0,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 06, 2019 10:06AM ET</span>",U.S. October wholesale inventories revised down,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. wholesale inventories rebounded less than initially estimated in October, with apparel stocks dropping by the most in three years, suggesting that inventory investment could be a drag on fourth-quarter economic growth.
The Commerce Department said on Friday that wholesale inventories edged up 0.1% in October instead of the previously reported 0.2% gain. Stocks at wholesalers dropped 0.7% in September. They gained 3.8% on a year-on-year basis in October.
The component of wholesale inventories that goes into the calculation of gross domestic product rose 0.2% in October.
The pace of inventory accumulation had slowed in the second quarter after stocks surged from the third quarter of 2018 through the first quarter of this year. The inventory overhang has led businesses to place fewer orders at factories, contributing to a downturn in manufacturing activity.
Inventory accumulation helped to lift economic growth to a 2.1% annualized rate in the third quarter, offsetting the drag to GDP from a wider trade deficit. The economy grew at a 2.0% pace in the second quarter.
Growth estimates for the fourth quarter are converging around a 1.8% rate.
In October, wholesale auto inventories fell 0.4% after decreasing 1.3% in the prior month. Apparel inventories tumbled 1.4%, the largest drop since September 2016, after nudging up 0.1% in September.
There were also decreases in furniture and professional equipment inventories. Petroleum inventories dropped 3.7%.
Sales at wholesalers fell 0.7% in October, the biggest decline since December 2018, after dipping 0.1% in September.
Motor vehicle sales rose 0.6% in October after decreasing 3.0% in the previous month. Apparel sales fell 2.4% after rebounding 3.6% in September.
At October's sales pace it would take wholesalers 1.37 months to clear shelves, the most since May 2016, up from 1.36 months in September."
1,By Investing.com,"<span>Dec 06, 2019 09:16AM ET</span>","Payrolls Jumped 266,000 Last Month, Crushing Expectations","Investing.com - The U.S. economy created many more jobs that expected in November, while the unemployment rate ticked lower and wage growth remained in check. That boosted stocks and send Treasury yields higher.
Nonfarm payrolls rose by 266,000, the Labor Department said Friday, handily topping expectations for a rise of 186,000, according to forecasts compiled by Investing.com.
That was the biggest rise in 10 months.
In addition, previous months were revised higher. September payrolls were revised up by 13,000 to 193,000 and October was revised higher by 28,000 to 156,000.
“Put all that together, and it says that payrolls growth over the past three months has averaged a healthy +205K” which smooths out auto strike-related volatility, University of Michigan economics professor Justin Wolfers tweeted.
The unemployment rate ticked down to 3.5% from 3.6%. Economist predicted it would remain steady.
“This does not feel like an economy that at great risk of recession; the Fed will likely be on hold for a while,” Carl Tannenbaum, chief economist for   Northern Trust   (NASDAQ:NTRS) tweeted.
Average hourly earnings rose 0.2%, lower than the 0.3% predicted, while year over year they are up 3.1%, indicating wage inflation remains in check.
“Wage growth continues to remain puzzlingly weak,” Wolfers said. “Over the past year, hourly earnings are up only 3.1%. That's the sort of number that's unlikely to worry the Fed much (even as it continues to be puzzled by such low wage and price growth at such a low inflation rate).”
Manufacturing activity contracted for a fourth straight month in November. The factory malaise has been blamed on the Trump administration's 17-month trade war with China, which has bruised business confidence and undercut capital expenditure.
S&P 500 futureswere up 0.65%, while the 10-Year Treasury yield rose 6 basis points to 1.855%.

2,By Bloomberg,"<span>Dec 06, 2019 09:06AM ET</span>",Canada Posts Largest Job Loss Since 2009 on Full-Time Drop,"(Bloomberg) -- Canada’s job market unexpectedly weakened for a second-straight month, registering the biggest drop in employment since 2009 and casting doubt on the resiliency of the domestic outlook.
The economy lost 71,200 jobs in November, Statistics Canada said Friday in Ottawa, following a decline of 1,800 in the prior month. That pares the total number of jobs added this year to around 285,100.
The report missed the median economist forecast for a gain of 10,000 jobs. The unemployment rate increased to 5.9% in the month, from 5.5% in October, the biggest one-month jump since 2009. The decrease in employment was broad-based among both the goods-producing and service-producing sectors.
“Canada’s jobs report is disappointing, showing job losses for the second month in a row,” said Julia Pollak, labor economist at ZipRecruiter, an online employment marketplace. “But observers should remember that the numbers are highly volatile and that this is still the strongest year for job growth in Canada in 17 years.”
The Canadian currency depreciated on the report, dropping 0.6% to C$1.3249 against its U.S. counterpart at 8:40 a.m. Toronto time.

3,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 06, 2019 07:56AM ET</span>","Brazilian inflation rebounds in November, but no barrier to rate cut","By Jamie McGeever
BRASILIA (Reuters) - Brazilian consumer price inflation bounced back to seven-month highs in November from ultra-low levels the month before, led by the rising cost of meat and regulated prices like electricity, official figures showed on Friday, .
Although the annual rate of inflation posted one of its biggest increases from the previous month seen in years, it remains well below the central bank's target and is unlikely to prevent another cut in interest rates next week.
The benchmark IPCA index of inflation rose 0.51% from the previous month, government statistics agency IBGE said, the highest month-on-month increase since April and above the median estimate in a Reuters poll of 0.46%.
The rise of 0.41 percentage points from October's 0.10% monthly inflation rate was the biggest in over a year.
The year-on-year rate of IPCA price inflation in November was 3.27%, up from 2.54% in October. That jump of 0.73 percentage points was the biggest since June last year, and the second biggest in 15 years, Refinitiv data show.
The median forecasts in a Reuters poll of economists was for an annual inflation rate of 3.23%.
""The rise in inflation was a bit more than had been expected ... (but) I don't see anything that will stop Copom from cutting interest rates next week,"" said William Jackson, economist at Capital Economics.
""But this, alongside a strengthening economy, certainly means that will be the last cut in the cycle,"" he said.
The central bank's official year-end inflation goals are 4.25% for 2019 and 4.00% for 2020. Most economists think they will be undershot.
In the first 11 months of the year, the annual rate of inflation was running at 3.12%, IBGE said.
The central bank is widely expected to cut its benchmark Selic interest rate next week by half a percentage point to a record low of 4.50%. That would be the fourth consecutive reduction of 50 basis points.
But some economists, like Jackson, think it might be the last, after figures this week showed the economy grew in the third quarter more rapidly than expected.

Annual inflation hit 2.7%, still towards the lower end of the bank's 2% to 4% range though creeping closer to its 3% target.
Unrest last month sent Chile's peso spiraling to an historic low against the dollar. The most violent, widespread protests to hit the country since its return to democracy in 1990 have left at least 26 dead. Statistics agency INE did not mention the protests in a statement accompanying the data release.
The central bank this week said a recently announced $5.5 billion fiscal stimulus plan and the depreciating peso could help push long-lagging inflation upwards in coming months. The bank expects inflation to hit 3.4% in 2019."

Industrial output dropped 1.7% on the month against expectations for a 0.1% rise, Statistics Office figures showed on Friday. Production of capital goods slumped by 4.4% on the month, the steepest decline in more than five years.
Europe's biggest economy is going through a soft patch as its export-oriented manufacturers struggle against a backdrop of trade friction, an ailing car industry and uncertainties over Britain's planned departure from the European Union.
""Now the trepidation starts again about GDP growth in the final quarter,"" said Jens-Oliver Niklasch, economist at Landesbank Baden-Wuerttemberg.
In its 10th successive year of growth, the economy has been relying on strong consumption as exports weaken, which resulted in a second-quarter GDP contraction of 0.2%.
The economy grew by just 0.1% in the third quarter, narrowly avoiding recession, which economists usually define as two consecutive quarters of negative growth.
""Trade conflicts, global uncertainty and disruption in the automotive industry have put the entire German industry in a headlock, from which it is hard to escape,"" said Carsten Brzeski, economist at ING.
Many economists have been urging the government to ditch its policy of incurring no new net debt, saying it should instead borrow to finance a stimulus package.
The government seems to be betting instead on an easing of trade frictions between the United States and both China and the EU to revive Germany's manufacturing sector.
""The economic weakness in industry remains"" the ministry said in a statement. ""However, the latest developments in new orders and business expectations indicate that a stabilising trend could emerge in the coming months.""
German business morale rose in November, the Ifo economic institute said late last month."
8,By Bloomberg,"<span>Dec 06, 2019 12:40AM ET</span>",Consumers in India Turn Most Pessimistic in More Than Five Years,"(Bloomberg) -- Consumer confidence in India dropped to its lowest since at least 2014, the year Prime Minister Narendra Modi came to power.
The current situation index fell to 85.7 in November from 89.4 in September, according to the Reserve Bank of India’s consumer confidence survey, where 100 is the dividing line between pessimism and optimism. The future expectations gauge -- that takes into account the one-year ahead perceptions -- fell to 114.5 from 118.0.
The drop coincides with a deepening slowdown in Asia’s third-largest economy and increased worries about employment. The yearlong crisis in the shadow-banking sector has tightened lending, affecting domestic consumption that makes up about 60% of the nation’s economy. All this contributed to growth cooling to a new six-year low in the quarter ended September.
The central bank’s survey was conducted in 13 big cities and 5,334 households. Consumers were surveyed about perceptions and expectations on the general economic situation, the jobs scenario, the overall price situation apart from income and spending.
Worryingly enough, respondents felt that prices have increased in the past year and are likely to rise in the year ahead, implying inflationary pressures are likely to stay sticky in the near term.
On Thursday, India’s central bank shrugged off lower growth worries to keep interest rates unchanged amid a spike in headline inflation. The six-member Monetary Policy Committee headed by Governor Shaktikanta Das decided to wait and see how the five rate cuts already delivered this year pan out before it does more."
9,By Bloomberg,"<span>Dec 05, 2019 11:36PM ET</span>",Singapore Keeps Building Until the Buyers Come,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- You’ll build and they’ll come? Well, don’t bet on it.
That’s what Singapore’s authorities seem to be telling property developers, who are flooding the market with new homes. 
The builders themselves are getting nervous about the glut. But everyone — the prospective homeowner, the seller and the government — is actually lucky. A minor bubble got pricked in time, with exorbitant duties now charged on most purchases to discourage speculation. These hit overseas buyers and foreign-born permanent residents, whom many Singaporeans feel were pricing them out of the market, especially hard.  
In July 2018, the city-state imposed additional buyers’ stamp duties and tighter loan-to-value norms to break up the frenzy of en-bloc sales, in which owners of apartments take cash from builders to vacate, permitting redevelopment. Just the previous year, $6.4 billion of such deals took place, the most since 2007.
As planners had feared, all those bulldozed older buildings are now making way for gleaming new condominiums. The catch is, there are few buyers. 
The number of units that developers have launched for sale, but remain unsold, reached almost 4,400 in the third quarter, a 3.5-fold increase from just before the government imposed harsh curbs on purchases. Speculation is frowned upon. Except for Singaporean citizens buying a first property, everyone now pays a stiff duty. Foreign-born permanent residents are levied as much as 15% for a second home. Overseas buyers who aren’t permanent residents are charged 20%.
The oversupply of unsold new homes is thus an engineered solution. The pipeline is helping keep a lid on prices, which had surged 9.1% from a year earlier before the cooling measures were imposed. Now, they’re rising just 2.1% annually. And even this moderate pace may be at risk. “The increase in the unsold inventory could place downward pressure on prices in the medium term, if unaccompanied by a corresponding rise in demand,” the central bank said in its recent financial stability review.  
The next general elections are due by 2021, but likely to be held sooner. In that case, why wouldn’t Singapore want the wealth effect of a stronger property market? One reason is that most Singaporeans live in public housing. The fate of Housing Development Board estates when their 99-year lease expires is a bigger issue for voters than private property riches.
Second, the government doesn’t want a repeat of the 2010-2013 experience when low global interest rates sent a tsunami of money into the Asian financial center’s private housing market.
Currently, overseas buyers’ participation is subdued at 5%-7% of transactions, compared with a peak rate of nearly 20% in 2011. A 5.9 percentage-point increase in foreigners’ purchases is associated with an acceleration of 1.2 percentage points in the quarter-on-quarter growth rate of Singapore residential property prices, research at the International Monetary Fund has shown. 
The current lull in foreigners’ participation may be temporary. Easy money conditions are back again globally, and property prices in protest-hit Hong Kong are overstretched.  That combination alone is sufficient to keep Singapore vigilant.
If the city hadn’t punctured the en-bloc mania in time, home prices would by now have started to run away. Affordability would have become an issue, especially at a time when, caught in the crossfire of the U.S.-China trade war, Singapore residents have seen their incomes rise much more slowly.
Builders have got the memo and cut back on land purchases. However, the government’s land sales program for the first half of next year doesn’t show much sign of pulling back on supply. If carried out in full, the plan announced this week will release another 6,490 housing units sometime in the future. But who is this additional stock for? With the local labor market hitting a soft patch, and amid rising clamor for a “Singaporean First” employment policy, tight controls on immigration are likely to remain in place through 2020, further depressing potential demand.
Maybe once the elections are out of the way, Singapore will allow more prospective buyers to show up on its shores. On that hope, developers will have to go on and keep building."

Monitored by the Bank of England, the index of demand for staff from the Recruitment and Employment Confederation (REC) and accountants KPMG fell to 51.4 in November, its lowest since September 2009, from 51.6 in October.
Last month, two out of nine BoE interest-rate setters unexpectedly voted to cut interest rates, citing signs that the labor market - the bright spot of Britain's economy since the Brexit vote - may now be starting to weaken.
Friday's REC report showed permanent job placements fell for an ninth month running, chiming with official data which has shown job creation waning.
""The uncertainty around the upcoming election and Brexit outcomes are playing havoc with the UK jobs market, as clearly employers and job-seekers are taking a wait-and-see approach before committing to growth or movement,"" James Stewart, vice chair at KPMG, said.
The survey showed starting salaries for permanent staff rose in November at the slowest rate since December 2016. For temporary staff, it was the weakest reading since November 2016.
In its latest forecasts for the economy, the BoE said pay growth in Britain was likely to cool off a little in the coming year, after recently hitting its highest in more than a decade."

The total national health expenditures last year grew 4.6% to $3.6 trillion, or $11,172 per person, boosted by faster growth in private health insurance and government-sponsored health insurance programs, the U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) said.
The federal government and households were the largest sponsors, each contributing 28% to the total spending in the year.
The cost of health as a share of the economy decreased 0.2 points to 17.7% in 2018.
Increased net costs drove up private health insurance spending by 5.8% to $1.2 trillion in 2018, faster than the 4.9% growth in the year before. 
Consumers also paid more out-of-pocket for retail prescription drugs, medical equipment and dental services last year, offseting a fall in hospital care expenses, CMS said.
Non-price factors such as the use and mix of drugs consumed drove up spending on retail prescription drugs, which grew 2.5% in 2018 to $335 billion, accounting for 9% of total healthcare spending. 
Last February, the CMS had projected U.S. healthcare spending to rise 5.3% in 2018, reflecting rising prices of medical goods and services and higher Medicaid costs.

As more U.S. citizens become eligible for Medicare, the federal health insurance program for people aged 65 and above and the disabled, health spending in the country will grow at an average rate of 5.5% every year from 2018 over the next decade, CMS said earlier this year.

13,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 05, 2019 01:26PM ET</span>",U.S. trade deficit shrinks sharply; labor market tight,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. trade deficit dropped to its lowest level in nearly 1-1/2 years in October, suggesting trade could contribute to economic growth in the fourth quarter, though a broad decline in imports hinted at a slowdown in domestic demand.
Still, consumer spending is likely to remain supported by a strong labor market. Other data on Thursday showed the number of Americans filing claims for unemployment benefits unexpectedly fell last week, hitting their lowest level in seven months.
The reports countered data this week showing manufacturing activity contracting for a fourth straight month in November, a slowdown in growth in the services sector as well as a drop in construction spending in October. The latest data suggested the economy was growing at a moderate pace rather than stall speed.
The Commerce Department said the trade deficit tumbled 7.6% to $47.2 billion, the smallest since May 2018, as both imports and exports of goods declined. It was the second straight monthly drop in the trade bill and the percent drop was the biggest since January.
The decreases in imports and exports suggested the White House's ""America First"" agenda, marked by a 17-month trade war with China, was reducing trade flows, which in the long run is detrimental to domestic and global growth.
""Shrinking the trade deficit by cutting imports even faster than you cut exports is obviously not a sustainable long-term path to drive growth for any economy,"" said Tim Quinlan, a senior economist at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) Securities in Charlotte, North Carolina. 
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the trade gap narrowing to $48.7 billion in October. 
The goods trade deficit with China fell 1.1% to $31.3 billion, with imports unchanged and exports increasing 3.4%.
The goods trade gap with the European Union jumped 20% to $16.4 billion, with imports surging to a record high.
While Washington and Beijing are working on a ""phase one"" trade deal, the United States has ratcheted up tensions with other trade partners including Brazil, Argentina and France.
President Donald Trump has defended the tariffs as necessary to protect domestic manufacturers from what he says is unfair foreign competition. Trump has accused trading partners, including China, the European Union, Brazil and Argentina of devaluing their currencies at the expense of U.S. manufacturers.
Ironically, the United States has a goods trade surplus with Brazil, which swelled in October to its highest level since March 2014. It is also running a goods trade surplus with Argentina. The goods trade surplus with South and Central America hit a record high in October.
The dollar was weaker against a basket of currencies, while U.S. Treasury yields rose. U.S. stocks were trading lower amid a lack of new developments in U.S.-China trade talks.
IMPORTS, EXPORTS FALL
Trade tensions have undermined business investment, which together with slowing growth overseas has led to a recession in manufacturing. 
In a second report on Thursday, the Commerce Department said factory orders increased 0.3% in October, but shipments were unchanged and unfilled orders barely rose, indicating the manufacturing downturn could persist for a while. 
There are, however, no signs the trade war is significantly impacting the labor market. In a third report, the Labor Department said initial claims for state unemployment benefits dropped 10,000 to a seasonally adjusted 203,000 for the week ended Nov. 30, the lowest level since mid-April.
While the claims data has no bearing on November's employment report, scheduled for release on Friday, it underscored labor market strength. 
According to a Reuters survey of economists, nonfarm payrolls probably increased by 180,000 jobs in November, boosted by the return of about 46,000 striking General Motors (N:GM) workers. The strike had helped to hold job growth down to 128,000 in October.
Employment gains have slowed this year, averaging 167,000 per month compared with an average monthly gain of 223,000 in 2018, because of ebbing demand and a shortage of workers. But the pace of hiring has been more than the roughly 100,000 jobs needed per month to keep up with growth in the working-age population.
When adjusted for inflation, the goods trade deficit decreased $3.9 billion to $79.1 billion in October, also the smallest gap since May 2018. 
The drop in the so-called real trade deficit is positive for the calculation of gross domestic product. It suggested trade could add to GDP growth in the fourth quarter after being a drag for two straight quarters. The Atlanta Federal Reserve raised its fourth-quarter GDP estimate to a 1.5% annualized rate from a 1.3% pace. The economy grew at a 2.1% pace in the third quarter. 
But the drivers of the decline in the trade gap in October point to softening economic fundamentals. In October, goods imports dropped 2.1% to $204.1 billion. Consumer goods imports fell $2.4 billion amid declines in cellphones and other household items, toys, games and sporting goods, as well as pharmaceutical preparations. This implies a slower pace of consumer spending after two straight quarters of brisk growth.
""The drop in imports is a double-edge sword,"" said Ryan Sweet, a senior economist at Moody's Analytics in West Chester, Pennsylvania. ""The good news is that it helped narrow the deficit, but it could also signal weakness in domestic demand.""
Motor vehicle and parts imports dropped $1.8 billion. Motor vehicle parts imports accounted for most of the drop, likely reflecting the GM strike, which undercut motor vehicle production. A reversal is likely.
Goods exports fell 0.6% to $136.1 billion in October. They were led by a $0.7 billion drop in shipments of consumer goods. Motor vehicle exports and parts exports also fell. There were, however, an increase in crude oil exports, pushing the petroleum surplus to a record high.

The services surplus widened to $20.8 billion in October from $20.6 billion in September.

14,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 05, 2019 10:16AM ET</span>",U.S. factory orders rebound in October; shipments unchanged,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - New orders for U.S.-made goods rebounded in October after two straight monthly declines, lifted by rising demand for machinery and transportation equipment, but gains were likely to be limited amid persistently weak business confidence.
Factory goods orders increased 0.3% also as bookings for computers and electronic products rose, the Commerce Department said on Thursday. Data for September was revised down to show orders dropping 0.8% instead of falling 0.6% was previously reported. October's gain in factory orders was in line with economists' expectations.
Factory orders decreased 0.4% compared to October 2018.
The government also said October orders for non-defense capital goods excluding aircraft, which are seen as a measure of business spending plans on equipment, increased 1.1% instead of surging 1.2% as reported last week.
Shipments of core capital goods, which are used to calculate business equipment spending in the gross domestic product report, rebounded 0.8% in October as previously reported.
With business confidence remaining depressed, the improvement in orders is probably unsustainable. A survey on Monday from the Institute for Supply Management showed its measure of national factory activity contracting for a fourth straight month in November as a gauge of new orders slumped back to around the lowest level since 2012.
Business sentiment has been hurt by a 17-month trade war between the United States and China, weighing on manufacturing, which accounts for 11% of the economy. While Washington and Beijing are working on a ""phase one"" trade deal, the United States has ratcheted up tensions with other trade partners including Brazil, Argentina and France.
Manufacturing has also been hampered by an inventory overhang and the grounding of Boeing's (N:BA) 737 MAX plane after two fatal crashes in Indonesia and Ethiopia.
Transportation equipment orders rebounded 0.7% in October after dropping 3.2% in the prior month. Orders for civilian aircraft and parts increased 10.7% after decreasing 19.0% in September.
Orders for computers and electronic products rose 0.6%. Machinery orders jumped 1.2% in October after dipping 0.1% in September. But orders for electrical equipment, appliances and components dropped 1.8% after rising 0.9% in September.
Shipments of manufactured goods were unchanged in October after falling 0.4% in the prior month. Unfilled orders at factories nudged up 0.1% after being unchanged in September. Inventories edged up 0.1 in October after rising 0.3% in September."

Bloomberg’s Consumer Comfort Index rose to 61.7 from 60.5 in the week ended Dec. 1, according to a report issued Thursday. Among the gauge’s three components, views of personal finances posted the biggest weekly advance since the end of August, recovering most of a drop that took root in mid-October. Sentiment about the state of the economy and whether it’s a good time to buy also climbed.
Key Insights
The improvement in comfort reflects steady hiring, wage gains and near-record stock prices that are allowing consumers to look beyond economic worries such as the trade war with China and a slowdown. The comfort index has risen three straight weeks and erased most of a steep 5.4-point drop over the preceding three weeks. Sentiment mirrors positive reports coming from the nation’s retailers. Brick-and-mortar store sales on Black Friday were up mid-single-digits, according to Fiserv’s First Data Insights, while shoppers blew out Cyber Monday by spending almost 20% more than last year.

TORONTO (Reuters) - Canada posted a slightly narrower trade deficit in October as both exports and imports climbed, Statistics Canada said, data that could support the Bank of Canada's greater confidence in the outlook for economic growth.
Canada posted a trade deficit of C$1.08 billion ($0.82 billion) in October, less than the C$1.37 billion deficit that analysts had forecast. The September deficit was revised upward to C$1.23 billion.
Exports rose by 0.8% to C$49.9 billion, while imports were up by 0.5%.
""Trade remains sturdy and unlikely to add or subtract meaningfully from Q4 growth,"" Robert Kavcic, a senior economist at BMO Capital Markets, said in a note. ""There’s little here to alter this week’s Bank of Canada tone, which has shown increasing disinterest in cutting rates.""
On Wednesday, Canada's central bank held its overnight interest rate at 1.75% as expected and cited early signs the global economy was stabilizing.
The impact of a strike at U.S. auto manufacturer General Motors Co (N:GM) was evident in the trade data, with both exports and imports of motor vehicles and parts falling.
Exports of consumer goods rose 5.5% in October, helped by higher exports of artwork destined for an art fair in New York. Statistics Canada said those items could be brought back and included as imports if they do not sell.
Energy product exports were up 3.4% as a result of higher prices, while imports of energy products jumped 8.9%.
Export volumes rose 0.7%, while import volumes were up 0.8%.
Canada's trade surplus with the United States increased to its widest since the financial crisis of 2008 at C$5.5 billion from C$4.9 billion in September.
Exports to China were down 19.3% at C$1.6 billion, the biggest decrease since 2012 and the lowest level in more than five years."
17,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 05, 2019 08:55AM ET</span>","U.S. trade deficit narrows to 1-1/2-year low on weak imports, exports","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. trade deficit dropped to its lowest level in nearly 1-1/2 years in October, suggesting trade could contribute to economic growth in the fourth quarter, though a fall in imports of consumer goods hinted at a slowdown in domestic demand.
The Commerce Department said on Thursday the trade deficit tumbled 7.6% to $47.2 billion, the smallest since May 2018, as both imports and exports of goods declined. It was the second straight monthly fall in the trade bill and the percent decline was the biggest since January. 
The decreases in imports and exports suggested the White House's ""America First"" agenda, marked by a 17-month trade war with China, was reducing trade flows.
Data for September was revised to show the trade gap shrinking to $51.1 billion instead of the previously reported $52.5 billion. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the trade gap narrowing to $48.7 billion in October. 
The goods trade deficit with China fell 1.1% to $31.3 billion, with imports unchanged and exports increasing 3.4%. The goods trade gap with the European Union jumped 20% to $16.4 billion.
While Washington and Beijing are working on a ""phase one"" trade deal, the United States has ratcheted up tensions with other trade partners including Brazil, Argentina and France.
President Donald Trump has defended the tariffs as necessary to protect domestic manufacturers from what he says is unfair foreign competition. Trump has accused trading partners, including China, the European Union, Brazil and Argentina of devaluing their currencies at the expense of U.S. manufacturers.
The U.S. has a trade surplus with Brazil, which swelled in October to its highest level since March 2014. The trade surplus with South and Central America hit a record high in October.
Trade tensions have undermined business investment, which together with slowing growth overseas have led to a recession in manufacturing. That is casting a shadow on the longest economic expansion in history, now in its 11th year. 
When adjusted for inflation, the goods trade deficit decreased $3.9 billion to $79.1 billion in October, also the smallest gap since May 2018. The drop in the so-called real trade deficit is positive for the calculation of gross domestic product. 
It suggested trade could add to GDP growth in the fourth quarter after being a drag for two straight quarters. But the drivers of the decline in the trade gap in October point to softening economic fundamentals. 
Growth estimates for the fourth quarter are between a 1.3% and 1.9% annualized rate. The economy grew at a 2.1% pace in the third quarter. 
In October, goods imports dropped 2.1% to $204.1 billion. Consumer goods imports fell $2.4 billion amid declines in cellphones and other household items, toys, games and sporting goods, as well as pharmaceutical preparations. This implies a slower pace of consumer spending after two straight quarters of brisk growth. 
Motor vehicle and part imports dropped $1.8 billion. Parts imports accounted for most of the drop, likely reflecting a 40-day strike at General Motors (N:GM), which undercut motor vehicle production.

Goods exports fell 0.6% to $136.1 billion in October. They were led by a $0.7 billion drop in shipments of consumer goods. Motor vehicle exports and parts exports fell $0.3 billion. But there were increases in oil exports, with the petroleum surplus the highest on record.

Initial claims for state unemployment benefits dropped 10,000 to a seasonally adjusted 203,000 for the week ended Nov. 30, the lowest level since mid-April, the Labor Department said on Thursday. Data for the prior week was unrevised.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast claims increasing to 215,000 in the latest week.
Claims data tend to be volatile around holidays like last week's Thanksgiving Day, which was later this year compared to 2018. This can throw off the model that the government uses to strip out seasonal fluctuations from the data.
The Labor Department said no states were estimated last week. The four-week moving average of initial claims, considered a better measure of labor market trends as it irons out week-to-week volatility, fell 2,000 to 217,750 last week.
The claims data has no bearing on November's employment report, which is scheduled for release on Friday. According to a Reuters survey of economists, nonfarm payrolls probably increased by 180,000 jobs in November, boosted by the return of about 46,000 striking General Motors (N:GM) workers. The 40-day strike had helped to hold job growth down to 128,000 in October.
Employment gains have slowed this year, averaging 167,000 per month compared with an average monthly gain of 223,000 in 2018, in part because of a 17-month trade war between the United States and China, ebbing demand and a shortage of workers.
But the pace of hiring has been more than the roughly 100,000 jobs needed per month to keep up with growth in the working-age population. The unemployment rate is forecast holding at 3.6% in November.
Thursday's claims report also showed the number of people receiving benefits after an initial week of aid rose 51,000 to 1.69 million for the week ended Nov. 23. The four-week moving average of the so-called continuing claims was unchanged at 1.68 million."
19,By Bloomberg,"<span>Dec 05, 2019 08:34AM ET</span>",U.S. Jobless Claims Unexpectedly Drop to Lowest in Seven Months,"(Bloomberg) -- Filings for U.S. unemployment benefits unexpectedly fell to the lowest level since April, signaling resilience in the labor market ahead of Friday’s jobs report.
Jobless claims fell by 10,000 to 203,000 in the week ended Nov. 30, according to Labor Department figures released Thursday that were below all estimates in Bloomberg's survey of economists. The four-week average, a less-volatile measure, decreased to 217,750.
Key Insights

The decline in claims to near a half-century low underscores the tightness in the labor market despite manufacturing weakness, soft global growth and slower business investment. That suggests consumer spending should continue to hold up and support the broader expansion.
The latest data come with important caveats, though. Last week included Thanksgiving, and the claims figures tend to be more volatile around the year-end holidays. In addition, the seasonal adjustment for Thanksgiving may have been even trickier than usual because the holiday came so late in the month, compared with about a week earlier in 2018.
The sign of strength precedes the Labor Department’s November jobs report, which is projected to show that hiring is holding up at a more moderate pace than last year while the jobless rate remained close to a half-century low. At the same time, a private report this week showed companies added 67,000 jobs in November, the fewest in six months.

ATHENS (Reuters) - Greece's economy continued to recover in the third quarter, driven by net exports, but its expansion slowed from the second quarter amid weaker consumer spending and investments.
Seasonally adjusted data released by statistics service ELSTAT on Thursday showed gross domestic product expanded 0.6% in the third quarter compared with an upwardly revised 1.3% growth rate in the second.
On an annual basis, economic growth decelerated to 2.3% in the third quarter from an upwardly revised 2.8% growth rate in the previous quarter.
""Despite the international slowdown, the export sector provided the main support to economic activity, topping initial estimates,"" said National Bank economist Nikos Magginas.
Data showed that exports of goods and services, up 4.5% compared with the second quarter, outpaced imports, which rose just 0.6%, producing a positive contribution to domestic economic output.
""Tourism continued to support economic growth, making up for a mild increase in consumer spending and fixed capital investments,"" Magginas said.
He said the economy's performance in the third quarter rendered expectations of growth higher 2.0% for the year ""more realistic.""
Greece's 180 billion-euro economy grew 1.9% last year, driven mainly by net exports. Private consumption also provided a boost.
Greece emerged from a decade of bailouts in August last year and is now relying on financial markets to cover borrowing needs. The government projects growth will pick up to 2.8% next year; the central bank foresees a smaller expansion of 2.4% to 2.5%."

Gross domestic product (GDP) in the 19 countries sharing the euro was up 0.2% in the July-September period, the same figure as the flash estimate released in October and unchanged from the second quarter.
Retail sales in the euro zone in October fell by 0.6%, double the amount expected in a Reuters poll, and were up a modest 1.4% year-on-year. The monthly decline was the steepest fall of 2019.
The data confirmed a somber outlook for the single currency bloc, which is facing threats and uncertainty over Brexit and rising global trade conflicts.
Britain had been set to exit the European Union at the end of October, a deadline since pushed back until the end of January.
In trade, the United States outlined the first phase of a deal to end its conflict war with China in October, but the two are still arguing about the details.
Year-on-year, euro zone expansion was 1.2%, also the same figure as in the second quarter of the year.
The bloc's largest and third largest economies, Germany and Italy, grew by just 0.1% during the quarter, while in France, the second largest economy, growth was 0.3%.
Household spending was the strongest overall contributor, boosting euro zone growth by 0.3% percentage points, followed by government spending and capital investment at 0.1 points.
However, the contributions of trade and of inventory changes were negative, in the case of trade for a second consecutive quarter.
In the October retail sales figures, non-food sales declined, particularly online and mail order sales, although these tend to pick up in November and December ahead of the Christmas period.
Eurostat also said that the growth of employment in the euro zone slowed in the third quarter to 0.1% from 0.2% in the second quarter. Year-on-year the figure was also softer at 0.9% from 1.2% previously."

BERLIN (Reuters) - German industrial orders fell unexpectedly in October as demand at home and from outside the euro zone weakened, suggesting a manufacturing downturn will continue to hold back growth in Europe's largest economy in the final quarter.
Contracts for German-made goods were down 0.4% from the previous month, the Statistics Office said on Thursday. That undershot a Reuters consensus forecast for a 0.3% rise.
""The German industry is still stuck in the vale of tears,"" VP Bank economist Thomas Gitzel said, adding that a growing number of companies were applying for state aid to keep well-trained staff but put them on short-time work.
The reading for September was revised up to an increase of 1.5% from a previously reported 1.3%.
The economy ministry said that industrial orders had stabilised in recent months, with business expectations also developing a bit more favourably.
""However, activity in the manufacturing industry is still weak. The manufacturing outlook for the final quarter therefore remains subdued,"" it said.
Industrial orders from domestic clients fell 3.2% while demand from customers outside the euro zone dropped 4.1%, the data showed. Orders from other euro zone countries jumped 11.1%, helped by bulk orders.
Without bulk orders, overall industrial orders fell 1.4% in October.
Demand was particularly weak for capital goods such as machines and equipment, whereas orders for consumer and intermediate goods edged up, the data showed.
The German economy skirted a recession in the third quarter as consumers, exports and state spending drove a 0.1% expansion from July through September, following a 0.2% contraction in the previous three months.
The country's export-dependent manufacturers are struggling with weaker foreign demand, tariff disputes sparked by U.S. President Donald Trump's 'America First' policy and business uncertainty linked to Britain's delayed departure from the European Union.
Gitzel also pointed to the struggling automobile industry, which he said had become an ""enormous burden"" for the economy as a whole.
German car companies are having trouble adjusting to stricter regulation following an emissions-cheating scandal and managing a broader shift away from combustion engines towards electric cars.
The automobile industry body VDA said on Wednesday it expected car sales to remain sluggish next year and companies to cut more job cuts as a result.
""Hopes of a stabilization of incoming orders have ... been dampened noticeably,"" Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) analyst Christoph Weil said.
Manufacturing is likely to slow the economy down in the coming months which means that the economy as a whole will probably only stagnate in the fourth quarter, he added."

Demand dropped 0.4% in October, defying estimates for a 0.4% gain. It was driven by weak demand for investment goods within Germany and outside the euro area. Bulk orders from within the currency bloc prevented a sharper decline.
The reading serves as a reminder that German factories have a long way to go to overcome a slump that’s already lasted more than a year. Industry output continued to contract in November, and business confidence remained muted.
“Manufacturing momentum continues to be depressed,” the Economy Ministry said in a statement. “The outlook for manufacturing in the fourth quarter is still subdued.”
Orders were down 5.5% from a year earlier in October, highlighting the damage global trade conflicts have inflicted on German industry.
A gauge for factories’ order stocks in November hinted at a continued contraction in the sector, according to a separate report from Germany’s Ifo institute. Carmakers, chemicals and metal-goods producers reported deteriorating conditions.
“The great order book deflation in German industry continues,” said Carsten Brzeski, chief economist at ING Germany. This “does not bode well for industrial production in coming months. The trade conflict, global uncertainty and sector-specific shocks are clearly weighing on German industry.”
The Bundesbank has said Germany’s economy will probably stagnate in the fourth quarter, and there’s little sign of a rebound any time soon. Growth is set to remain below 1% next year."

The RBI reiterated that it would maintain an accommodative stance as long as it is necessary to revive economic growth which slowed to 4.5% in the September quarter from 7% a year ago, to stand at its lowest in more than six years.
""The MPC recognizes that there is monetary policy space for future action. However, given the evolving growth-inflation dynamics, the MPC felt it appropriate to take a pause at this juncture,"" the committee said in a statement.

The total stimulus package amounts to around 26 trillion yen ($239 billion) spread over the coming years, with fiscal measures around half that figure, according to a draft of the package obtained by Bloomberg. The stimulus will boost real growth by about 1.4 percentage point, the draft said.
End of Line for BOJ Leaves Kuroda Talking Up Fiscal Firepower
The extra spending comes amid a rising awareness around the world that more government help is needed to keep economies growing in the face of a global slowdown that is exposing the limits of relying on central banks do the heavy lifting of economic management.
“In any country, the positive impact of extra monetary stimulus is limited, which is especially true in Japan and Europe where rates have turned negative. You have no effective choice but to execute fiscal measures to support growth,” said Harumi Taguchi, Tokyo-based principal economist at IHS Markit.
Abe described the stimulus as a three-pillared package designed to aid disaster relief, protect against downside economic risks and prepare the country for longer-term growth after the 2020 Tokyo Olympics. He said the stimulus would be funded by a supplementary budget for the current fiscal year ending in March, and special measures in the following year. The draft indicated that finding for the measures in the extra budget would be around 4.3 trillion yen.
While the package was slightly larger than expected, the single-digit size of fresh spending measures left markets largely unimpressed.
Bond Traders Shrug Off Japan’s $239 Billion Bid to Boost Economy
With the package, Abe looks intent on minimizing the risk of a recession that would tarnish the record of his Abenomics growth program, while shoring up his own political support after recent scandals. To that end, an array of measures with a large price tag that can be paid for with the bare minimum of extra borrowing would fit the bill for a country with the developed world’s largest debt load.
The package earmarks spending to improve the country’s resilience to extreme weather, to extend of a rebate system for cashless payments and to put a tablet or device on every school child’s desk up to the end of junior high school, according to the draft.
“The size of the package is pretty big considering the official government assessment of the economy is that it remains on a recovery trend. We’ve heard a lot about preventive interest rate cuts, but these are preventive fiscal measures,” said Yuichi Kodama, chief economist at Meiji Yasuda Life Insurance Co. in Tokyo.
The support for the economy through the extra spending gives the Bank of Japan welcome breathing space to keep its monetary easing policy on hold as fiscal policy takes the driving seat in propping up growth.
 Barclays  (LON:BARC) Changes BOJ Call, Expects No Easing Through FY2021
Ahead of the announcement of the plan, some economists had already switched their forecasts on the BOJ’s policy stance toward a holding pattern rather than additional action, taking into account the likelihood of the stimulus package and the central bank’s lack of extra ammunition.
The BOJ has already piled up assets worth more than the size of Japan’s entire economy in its bid to support growth and inflation. But the growing side effects of its easing program on the banking sector and a perceived lack of effectiveness of taking yet more action are keeping the bank on hold unless absolutely necessary.
While Japan’s economy has kept growing in the first three quarters of 2019 despite the slowdown in global trade exacerbated by the U.S.-China trade wary, it is forecast to shrink 2.7% in annualized terms this quarter, according to economists surveyed by Bloomberg. The sales tax hike and a destructive typhoon, combined with weak exports are the factors set to push the economy into reverse.
The package would aim to get Japan’s economy up and running again to avoid any further deterioration in global demand triggering a recession early next year.
What Bloomberg’s Economist Says
“Japan’s fiscal stimulus package appears to be a marginally larger than expected, going by the size of the planned extra budget and actual spending in the draft reported by Bloomberg News. This is clearly positive for growth -- likely helping avert a recession -- but it won’t be sufficient to prevent a significant slowdown in 2020.”

The seasonally adjusted IHS Markit UAE Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI), which covers manufacturing and services, fell to 50.3 from 51.1 in October.
Although the non-oil sector remained in growth territory -- a reading above 50 indicates expansion and below, contraction -- it was the UAE's weakest growth rate since August 2009.
The survey data showed the first month-on-month decline in new business at UAE non-oil companies in the series history, though the overall reduction was marginal.
""Anecdotal evidence commonly linked the decline to subdued market conditions and weaker customer demand,"" said David Owen, economist at IHS Markit and author of the report.
Employment levels fell marginally in November, after positive but weak growth last month, indicating the fastest reduction in workforce numbers in UAE non-oil businesses for nine months.
The UAE raised its expectations for economic growth in 2019 to 2.4% in September, driven by faster growth in the oil sector, after lowering them earlier this year.
""With cost pressures remaining subdued, firms continued to lower selling prices in November. The latest reduction was sharp and extended the current sequence to 14 months,"" said Owen.
""As has been the case recently, respondents highlighted that strong competition forced them to offer discounts. That said, the rate at which charges fell softened for the first time since July,"" he added.
Despite the slowing growth, companies were more optimistic for the year ahead, the survey showed, expecting output to rise over the coming 12 months."
27,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 04, 2019 10:01PM ET</span>","Australia retail sales stagnate, exports skid in bleak start to fourth-quarter","By Wayne Cole
SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australian retailers had it tough in October as skittish consumers chose to hoard any windfall from lower interest rates and tax rebates, likely heralding another quarter of disappointment for the economy.
Data out on Thursday also showed the country's trade surplus shrank by a third in October as resource exports came off the boil, a worrying turn for what has been a vital prop to growth.
Extending a spate of soft reports, retail sales were flat in October at A$27.6 billion ($18.73 billion) when analysts had looked for a 0.3% gain. Clothing, home wares and department stores all saw declines in the month.
The sector had already suffered its worst 12-month stretch since the 1991 recession as shoppers struggled with stagnant wages and sky-high debt.
The dire result was particularly telling as the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) had cut interest rates to a record low of 0.75% in early October, its third easing since June.
Neither were government giveaways providing much impetus with billions in tax rebates being saved rather than spent.
That is becoming an increasing headache for Prime Minster Scott Morrison given he won re-election in May on a pledge the economy would always be stronger under his guidance.
""The spending 'strike' of Q3 looks to have extended into early Q4 with still no evidence of a boost from tax refunds or rate cuts – the combined value of which will be adding around $16.6 billion to household disposable incomes over the year to June 2020,"" said Westpac senior economist Matthew Hassan.
Investors are wagering policy makers will have to do a whole lot more to revive spending and futures are fully priced for a rate cut to 0.5% by April , with a real chance of a move to 0.25% by late 2020.
NOT SO MERRY XMAS
Weakness in household consumption was the main reason gross domestic production (GDP) managed only a modest 0.4% gain in the third quarter, and this quarter was looking no better.
There was anecdotal evidence that retailers fared well in November's Black Friday and Cyber Monday sales, yet history suggests these merely pull spending forward from Christmas.
Adelaide Timbrell, an economist at ANZ, noted the sales surge that used to come in Christmas has been on the wane.
""The growth of online retail and, in particular, heavy discounting coming into the Christmas season may be behind the weakening effect, which has seen a particular downward trend in the last 10-12 years,"" she said.
""The rising intensity of competition for the Christmas Dollar, means stabilization isn't expected in the short term.""
While retailers were struggling, Australia's exporters have never had it so good thanks to high prices for key resources and strong Asian demand in the tourist and education sectors.
Yet even they hit a bump in October as a 5% drop in exports shrank the country's trade surplus by a third to A$4.5 billion.
Iron ore alone dropped A$1.2 billion as prices retreated from their highs after supply disruptions in Brazil caused a spike in the first half of the year.
Gold exports fell another A$666 million, though this is a volatile component as shipments vary widely month to month.
""The first look at Australia’s external performance for Q4 suggests the era of very large trade surpluses could be behind us,"" said CBA economist Belinda Allen.
""Commodity prices were lower in both October and November, and as a result there are downside risks to export values in coming months.""

28,By Bloomberg,"<span>Dec 04, 2019 09:50PM ET</span>","Australian Shoppers Flatline as Tax, Rate Cuts Fail to Fire","(Bloomberg) -- Australia’s struggling households are under the spotlight again as flat retail sales and imports underscored a consumer unwilling to part with their cash despite recent tax rebates and interest-rate cuts.
Retail sales were unchanged from a month earlier in October with department store and clothing sales slumping, the statistics bureau said in Sydney Thursday. Imports were also little changed while exports fell 5%, narrowing the trade surplus to A$4.5 billion ($3.1 billion).
The results follow GDP data that showed consumption barely budged in the three months through September, and as the central bank highlighted uncertainty over household spending when it kept rates unchanged Tuesday at a record low. Australians are hunkering down, opting to save tax cuts and use rate reductions to pay down mortgages faster to bolster their resilience.
What Bloomberg’s Economists Say
“There’s little sign yet that households are prepared to part with income boosts from rate cuts and tax offsets. Unexpectedly weak retail sales suggest the savings dynamic evident in the national accounts -- where households saved more than A$4 out of every A$5 of extra income in 3Q -- is yet to shift.
One bright glimmer in the details of the trade data is imports of motor vehicles. After a steady decline, as households responded to wealth effects by curbing purchases of new cars, motor vehicle imports appear to have bottomed.”
James McIntyre, economist
The Australian dollar declined after the readings, and was trading at 68.42 U.S. cents at 12:35 p.m. in Sydney. Traders are pricing a two-in-three chance the Reserve Bank will cut rates again when it meets in February.
Real wages Down Under have barely moved for half a decade, leading to altered household behavior that is beginning to entrench low inflation expectations. Meantime, eye-watering property prices in Sydney and Melbourne have forced buyers to load up on debt in order to secure a home.
The cut in the trade surplus reflected lower prices of iron ore and coal -- Australia’s key exports -- and a slump in non-monetary gold. That reduces the windfall cash in the economy and, in turn, the amount Australians can spend on services that account for the bulk of GDP. This connection is set out in the chart below.
Australia’s economy slowed last quarter, a report showed Wednesday, with trade and government spending proving the remaining pillars supporting the expansion; however, weaker exports put even that narrow base at risk.
There is a flicker of light though: GDP showed a jump in savings, suggesting Australians are holding onto their cash and do have the capacity to spend if they choose. November’s retail data due January 2020 will incorporate sales surrounding Black Friday and should signal whether shoppers are prepared to open their wallets."

SANTIAGO (Reuters) - Chile´s central bank said on Wednesday it would hold its benchmark interest rate steady at 1.75%, and would likely keep it there for the next several months, even as weeks of protests begin to hammer the country's economy.
The bank said recently announced fiscal stimulus measures and a depreciating peso, which hit a historic low last week, could help push long-lagging inflation in the South American nation to its target, prompting its decision.
""In line with reaching our inflation goal, and in a context of greater fiscal stimulus ... the board believes that the interest rate will maintain its current level during the coming months,"" the bank said in a statement.
The unanimous decision to hold rates, which upended market expectations, comes as Chile´s economy takes a sharp turn for the worse.
Economic activity in October marked the biggest year-on-year contraction in a decade, according to bank data released Monday, as riots over inequality overtook the country. Forecasts for quarterly growth and unemployment are equally dire.

Despite some optimistic signs in Wednesday's survey, that picture is likely to disappoint policymakers at the European Central Bank who in September relaunched a 2.6 trillion euro asset purchase program designed to stimulate growth and inflation.
IHS Markit's final euro zone composite Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI), seen as a good gauge of economic health, held steady last month at October's 50.6.
That beat a preliminary estimate of 50.3 but remains uncomfortably close to the 50 mark separating growth from contraction.
The headline figure ""still indicates a near-stagnant economy,"" said Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit. The data pointed to fourth quarter GDP growth of 0.1%, with manufacturing continuing to act as a major drag.
""Worryingly, the service sector is also on course for its weakest quarterly expansion for five years, hinting strongly that the slowdown continues to spread,"" he said.
A Reuters poll last month had predicted growth of 0.2% this quarter.
Offering glimmers of hope, an index measuring demand climbed to the breakeven mark having spent two months below it, firms increased the pace of hiring and optimism was at a four-month high. The new business index was 50.0 compared to October's 49.6.
""New orders have not shown any growth since August, underscoring the recent weakness of demand, with sharply declining orders for manufactured goods accompanied by substantially weaker gains of new business into the service sector,"" Williamson said.
Overall services industry activity stuttered. Its PMI dipped to 51.9 from 52.2, although edging above a 51.5 flash reading.
Still, reflecting some level of increased optimism, firms increased headcount at a faster rate. The employment index nudged up to 53.2 from 53.0."

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. services sector activity slowed in November as lingering concerns about trade tensions and worker shortages pushed production to its lowest level in a decade, which could heighten fears about the economy's health.
Other data on Wednesday showed private employers hired the fewest workers in six months in November. The reports came on the heels of data on Monday showing manufacturing activity contracted for the fourth straight month in November and a decline in construction spending in October.
The continued manufacturing slump and second straight monthly drop in construction outlays tempered growth expectations for the fourth quarter, which had been boosted by a rush of upbeat reports on the trade deficit, housing and business investment. Still, the economy appears to be growing at a moderate pace rather than stalling.
Growth is being constrained by the Trump administration's ""America First"" policy, which has seen the United States embroiled in a trade war with China, and tit-for-tat tariffs with other nations. The trade tensions, which have eroded business confidence, come as the stimulus from last year's $1.5 trillion tax cut package is fading.
The Institute for Supply Management (ISM) said its non-manufacturing activity index fell to a reading of 53.9 last month from 54.7 in October. A reading above 50 indicates expansion in the services sector, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the index dipping to a reading of 54.5 in November. The survey's production index tumbled 5.4 points to 51.6, the lowest level since November 2009, as tariffs on imports, including steel and aluminum raised costs for businesses. A measure of prices paid by services industries jumped 1.9 points to 58.5 last month.
""The decline in the index in November seems to reflect the tariffs that are impacting the prices of many products that services companies use to provide their services to other companies and consumers,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG in New York. ""China is not paying for all the tariffs apparently.""
President Donald Trump has repeatedly claimed that China was paying the tariffs in the 17-month trade war.
The dollar fell against a basket of currencies, while U.S. Treasury yields rose. Stocks on Wall Street were trading higher.
LABOR MARKET SLOWING
The ISM said services industry businesses ""hope for a resolution on tariffs and continue to be hampered by constraints in labor resources."" It said 12 industries, including retail trade, utilities and information, reported growth last month. Five industries, including agriculture, mining and construction reported a contraction.
But key details of the ISM survey were upbeat. New orders picked up last month, though order backlogs contracted.
A measure of services industry employment rose to 55.5 from 53.7 in October. This supports economists' expectations that the government's closely watched employment report on Friday would show a sharp rebound in job growth in November, despite the paltry job gains reported by private employers last month.
Private employers added only 67,000 jobs in November, the ADP (NASDAQ:ADP) National Employment report showed on Wednesday. It was the smallest monthly gain since May when just 46,000 jobs were created, the fewest since 2010, and continued a trend of decelerating job growth that has taken hold this year.
Data for October was revised down to show private payrolls increasing 121,000 from an originally reported 125,000 gain.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast private employment rising by 140,000 jobs in November.
The ADP figures come ahead of the Labor Department's more comprehensive nonfarm payrolls report due out on Friday, which includes both public- and private-sector employment.
According to a Reuters survey of economists, nonfarm payrolls probably increased by 180,000 jobs last month, boosted in part by the return of about 46,000 General Motors (N:GM) workers who had been excluded while on a 40-day strike. The strike held down job growth to 128,000 in October. The unemployment rate is forecast unchanged at 3.6% in November.
The ADP report, which is jointly developed with Moody's Analytics, has a poor record predicting the private payrolls component of the government's employment report. Economists said the ADP job count was not affected by the resumption of work by the GM workers. Still, last month's private payroll gains pointed to a cooling labor market.
""This report adds to signs that the labor market is still losing momentum, suggesting that incomes growth and thus real consumption growth will slow a little further in the near term,"" said Michael Pearce, a senior U.S. economist at Capital Economics in New York. ""But it would take a much sharper downturn in employment growth to raise recession fears.""
Job gains have averaged 167,000 per month this year, above the roughly 100,000 needed each month to keep up with growth in the working age population.
In the wake of Monday's dour ISM manufacturing survey and October construction spending, economists slashed their gross domestic product growth estimates for the fourth quarter to as low as a 1.3% annualized rate from as high as a 2.0% pace. The economy grew at a 2.1% pace in the third quarter.
The U.S.-China trade war has undercut business investment, contributing to the manufacturing downturn.
Washington and Beijing are working on a ""phase one"" trade deal. Trump, however, said on Tuesday a deal might have to wait until after the U.S. presidential election in November 2020. Trump on Monday restored tariffs on steel and aluminum imports from Brazil and Argentina for ""massive devaluation of their currencies.""
The United States also threatened duties of up to 100% on French goods, from champagne to handbags, because of a digital services tax that Washington says harms U.S. tech companies."

OTTAWA (Reuters) - The Bank of Canada held its overnight rate at 1.75% as expected on Wednesday and cited signs the global economy was stabilizing, helping send the Canadian dollar to a two-week high as prospects for a rate cut faded.
Although the central bank stressed that uncertainty caused by trade wars remained the main threat to its outlook, markets paid more attention to the upbeat parts of its commentary.
The bank - which has held rates steady since October 2018 - said future moves would depend on its assessment of the damage done by trade conflicts versus sources of resiliency in the economy, notably consumer spending and housing activity.
""There is nascent evidence that the global economy is stabilizing, with growth still expected to edge higher over the next couple of years,"" it said.
The Canadian dollar strengthened to a two-week high of C$1.3231 to the greenback, or 75.58 U.S. cents.
""If you read how they describe the domestic economy, it is very broadly positive,"" said Andrew Kelvin, chief Canada strategist at TD Securities.
The bank said investment spending showed unexpectedly strong growth in the third quarter, adding it would assess the extent to which this points to renewed momentum in investment.
Third-quarter consumer spending expanded moderately while housing investment was also strong, the bank said, adding it ""continues to monitor the evolution of financial vulnerabilities related to the household sector.""
Inflation remains at the bank's 2% target and is expected to track close to that figure for the next two years.
Sal Guatieri, senior economist with BMO Capital Markets, said the bank appeared to be taking comfort from the rebound in business investment and steady growth in consumer spending.
""Barring some disruption on the trade policy front, it looks like the Bank of Canada is content to remain on the sidelines for a lot longer,"" he said in a phone interview.
Several of the bank's counterparts, including the U.S. Federal Reserve, have recently eased rates.

But Derek Holt, vice president and head of capital markets economics at Scotiabank, said the statement marked a prematurely hawkish turn.

33,By Bloomberg,"<span>Dec 04, 2019 10:27AM ET</span>","U.S. Services Gauge Drops, Though Details Signal Stable Growth","(Bloomberg) -- A gauge of U.S. service industries fell more than forecast in November as business activity cooled, though gains in employment and new orders suggest the biggest part of the economy is holding up in the fourth quarter.
The Institute for Supply Management's non-manufacturing index fell to 53.9, according to data released Wednesday that missed the 54.5 median estimate in Bloomberg's survey of economists. The decrease was driven by the weakest reading of business activity since 2010.
Key Insights

The composition of the report showed that declines in components tracking business activity, which parallels the ISM’s measure of factory production, and supplier deliveries outweighed the gains in orders and employment. The split suggests demand still has some momentum heading into the end of the year even as overall activity moderates.
The measure of services employment climbed to 55.5, the highest level since July. Other measures of the labor market's performance in November were mixed ahead of Friday's government jobs report.
The ADP (NASDAQ:ADP) Research Institute on Wednesday reported services payrolls rose at slowest pace in six months, with overall private employment climbing a less-than-forecast 67,000. IHS Markit's gauge of services employment showed growth in November after contracting the previous two months, helping the overall measure improve to 51.6.
While ISM's services gauge has held for almost a decade above 50, the line between expansion and contraction, the group's manufacturing gauge has contracted for four straight months. The divergence underscores how the services sector, which makes up most of the economy, has remained a resilient force for the record-long expansion even as factories falter.
New orders for services grew at a faster pace for a second month, lifting the index to 57.1. That helped offset the business activity gauge falling 5.4 points to 51.6.


The report indicates trade tensions and weak global growth continue to weigh on American service providers. Exports rose above 50, but imports contracted for a third-straight month to the lowest level in more than seven years.
A measure of order backlogs contracted for a second month, holding at the lowest level since December 2016, and the gauge of supplier deliveries eased. The prices-paid index rose to 58.5 from 56.6.
ISM's November factory report on Monday showed the index unexpectedly declined to 48.1, near the expansion’s low point, amid weaker orders and subdued production.

35,By Bloomberg,"<span>Dec 04, 2019 10:25AM ET</span>","Bank of Canada Holds Steady, Citing ‘Intact’ Global Recovery","(Bloomberg) -- The Bank of Canada said there’s evidence the global economy is stabilizing, while the domestic economy remains resilient, in an interest rate decision Wednesday that gave little indication policy makers are in a rush to lower borrowing costs.
The Ottawa-based central bank held its policy rate at 1.75% for a ninth consecutive meeting, retaining language from its previous statement that it judges the current interest rate is “appropriate.” The prolonged pause has left Canada with the highest policy rate among advanced economies.
The decision showcases a central bank still comfortable with its wait-and-see stance. In the statement, the central bank said the October projection for a recovery in global growth “appears to be intact,” even as ongoing international trade disputes remain the biggest source of risk. It also continued to characterize domestic economic conditions as resilient.
“Future interest rate decisions will be guided by the Bank’s continuing assessment of the adverse impact of trade conflicts against the sources of resilience in the Canadian economy,” policy makers led by Governor Stephen Poloz said in the statement.
“There is nascent evidence that the global economy is stabilizing,” officials said, adding that they expect global growth to edge higher over the next couple of years.
The statement is in line with comments Poloz made in a Nov. 21 interview, in which he said “we think we’ve got monetary conditions about right, given the situation.”
All 27 economists surveyed by Bloomberg expected the Bank of Canada to hold rates steady on Wednesday, though many see the bank eventually cutting borrowing costs as early as the first quarter next year. Markets are also pricing in one rate cut over the next 12 months.
The Canadian dollar extended gains on the statement, up 0.4% to C$1.324 per U.S. dollar at 10:04 Toronto time. Yields on two-year Canadian government bonds also jumped, trading at 1.62 percent from 1.56 percent yesterday./
On global outlook, policy makers said financial markets are being supported by easing measures by other central banks, and “waning recession concerns.” And while trade uncertainty persists, the Bank of Canada noted commodity prices and the currency have been stable.
Investment Momentum
On the domestic front, the central bank said gross domestic product came in as expected in the third quarter, driven higher by consumption and housing, as well as unexpected strength in investment. Policy makers, who had expected a decline in capital spending in the second half, said they will assess the extent to which the pickup “points to renewed momentum” in investment.
The Bank of Canada reiterated that the recent record of core inflation around 2% is consistent with an economy operating near capacity. While inflation is expected to pick up in coming months, the acceleration should be temporary due to year over year movements in gasoline prices.
One thing constraining the central bank is debt. Credit growth and real estate activity are re-accelerating in the second half of this year, propelled in part by lower interest rates imported from abroad, and any additional stimulus by the Bank of Canada could fuel risks.
“The bank continues to monitor the evolution of financial vulnerabilities related to the household sector,” they said in the statement."

The IHS Markit/CIPS UK Services Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) fell in November to 49.3 from October's 50.0.
The reading was revised higher from a preliminary 48.6, but the index has still not exceeded the 50 threshold for growth since August - the longest such run since 2009.
""Service providers have attributed the recent soft patch to delayed decision-making on new projects until greater clarity emerges in relation to the domestic political landscape,"" IHS Markit economist Tim Moore said.
The survey added to a string of underwhelming business activity data in the run-up to the Dec. 12 vote. However, the state of the economy has only played a minor role in an election campaign dominated by Britain future relationship with the European Union and promises of increased spending on public services.
The figures suggested the world's fifth-biggest economy is contracting at a quarterly rate of 0.1%, financial data company IHS Markit said, a smaller decline than the 0.2% suggested by November's flash estimate.
The PMIs have overstated economic weakness recently, in part because of higher government spending ahead of Brexit that has not been captured in private-sector measures of demand.
""November's PMI surveys collectively suggest that the UK economy is staggering through the final quarter of 2019, with service sector output falling back into decline after a brief period of stabilization,"" Moore said.
New orders contracted at the fastest pace since July 2016, the month after Britons narrowly voted in favor of Brexit in a referendum, the PMI showed.

IHS Markit's final services Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) edged up to 51.7 from 51.6 in October, also beating a preliminary reading of 51.3.
The final composite PMI, which tracks the manufacturing and services sectors that together account for more than two-thirds of economic activity, rose to 49.4 from 48.9, staying below the 50 mark that separates growth from contraction.
Phil Smith, Principal Economist at IHS Markit, said the unusually weak services figures of the past three months suggested the overall economic growth picture was looking ""flat at best"".
The German economy - Europe's largest - grew by just 0.1% in the third quarter following a 0.2% contraction in the previous quarter. Solid household spending and a booming construction sector are expected to prop up growth in the current quarter.
Record-high employment, inflation-busting pay hikes and historically low borrowing costs have turned private consumption into a steady and reliable driver of growth in Germany, helping to cushion its export-dependent economy from trade problems.
Services firms relied on backlogs in November as inflows of new work fell for the third month in a row, the survey showed.
However, service providers continued to recruit additional staff and raised pay to retain experienced employees, Markit said, adding that many firms were able to offset higher operating costs by raising charges.
""Services price pressures continue to run relatively high, which the survey indicates is being largely underpinned by increasing wages, representing another boon for consumer spending,"" Smith said.
A survey last week showed that the mood among German shoppers rose unexpectedly heading into December, suggesting that household spending will support growth at the end of the year."

BENGALURU/SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Capital investment by Chinese firms has ground to its slowest pace in three years, as a weakening economy, tight credit and prolonged trade war with the United States dent sales growth and cash reserves, a Reuters analysis showed.
Companies are also spending more days to turn inventory into sales and eking out smaller profit gains, the analysis showed, in an economy growing at its weakest pace in nearly three decades, with many analysts expecting the slowdown to intensify.
The outlook became even more uncertain on Tuesday after U.S. President Donald Trump said a trade deal with China might have to wait until after the U.S. presidential election in November 2020.
""Things will get much worse before getting better,"" economists at Macquarie said in a client note on Monday. Even positive economic data from China recently is volatile and vulnerable to one-off factors such as warm weather, they said.
""After all, the so-called phase 1 deal is mainly about preventing things from getting worse, instead of making things significantly better,"" they said, referring to negotiations in a 16-month Sino-U.S. trade war punctuated by tit-for-tat import tariffs.

Chinese firms raised capital spending by 1.6% in the three months through September versus the same period a year prior, the weakest growth in three years, showed a Reuters analysis of about 2,900 firms with market capitalization above $100 million.

""The weak appetite to invest is a problem in terms of generating a strong recovery in the Chinese economy,"" said senior China economist Julian Evans-Pritchard at Capital Economics.
""Overall credit conditions are still quite tight and credit growth is actually slowing ... because, in particular, the non-bank forms of credit access have become much more restrictive in the shadow banking sector.""
Though the government has taken steps to encourage lending, bankers told Reuters they have little appetite to lend to small firms due to the trade war and uncertain economic outlook, as well as a years-long drive to cut risk in the financial system.
Cash reserves at surveyed firms grew 5.6% on year in the September quarter, the weakest since the first quarter of 2018. Moreover, the average number of days a company holds inventory before sale was 108 in the first nine months of the year, topping an annual average of 100 or less in the last four years.
Revenue grew 6.7%, the weakest in at least three years - the earliest period for which data from a comparable number of firms is available - while net profit rose 7.8% versus nearly 22% two years earlier.

BEIJING (Reuters) - Activity in China's services sector accelerated to a seven-month high in November, as new business, especially new export business, picked up, a private survey showed on Wednesday.
Beijing has been counting on the services sector, which accounts for more than half of China's economy, to partly offset sluggish domestic and global demand for manufactured products as a prolonged trade war with the United States drags on.
The Caixin/Markit services purchasing managers' index (PMI) rose to 53.5 last month, the quickest pace since April, from 51.1 in October. It has stayed above the 50-point margin that separates growth from contraction on a monthly basis since late 2005.
The stronger performance points to easing pressure on the services sector, which had been faltering in recent months amid the broader economic slowdown. The November reading for the official non-manufacturing PMI, published by the National Bureau of Statistics, also picked up from a multi-year low the month before.
The Caixin reading signals a recovery in activity across the services sector, according to Zhong Zhengsheng, director of macroeconomic analysis at CEBM Group.
The indicator for new export business rose to a four-month high, with overall new business picking up, too.
But the measure for business expectations, despite rising on the previous month, was ""still lower than the long-term average, reflecting depressed business confidence,"" said Zhong.
The gauge for employment edged down from the previous month but remained in expansionary territory.
Caixin's composite manufacturing and services PMI, also released on Wednesday, rose to 53.2 in November from 52.0 in the previous month, marking the highest reading since February 2018.
Its factory gauge, released on Monday, showed the fastest expansion in almost three years, though analysts were not convinced the worst is over yet for Chinese manufacturers.
""But business confidence remained subdued, reflecting the impact from uncertainties generated by the China-U.S. trade conflicts. That will restrain a recovery in economic growth,"" said Zhong.
Weighed down by slowing investment and the escalating trade war with the United States, China's economic growth has cooled to near 30-year lows. Analysts widely expect it will drop below 6% next year for the first time since 1990."

Increasingly violent demonstrations have disrupted the Chinese-ruled city for nearly six months, battering its retail and tourism sector and plunging its economy into recession for the first time in a decade.
The seasonally adjusted headline Hong Kong Purchasing Manager's Index (PMI) fell to 38.5 in November, down from 39.3 in October and signaling the steepest private sector downturn since the SARS epidemic in early 2003.
A survey reading above 50 indicates expansion, while a figure below 50 denotes contraction on a monthly basis.
""Escalating political unrest saw business activity shrinking at the steepest rate since the survey started in July 1998,"" said Bernard Aw, principal economist at IHS Markit.
""The average PMI reading for October and November combined showed the economy on track to see GDP fall by over 5% in the fourth quarter, unless December brings a dramatic recovery.""
Demand from mainland China shrank for a nineteenth straight month in November, although the pace of contraction eased from October.
Companies also continued to scale back their purchases of raw materials and other inputs, with 38% of survey respondents predicting weaker activity in the year ahead, citing political unrest and the protracted U.S.-China trade war.
Hong Kong's retail sales fell the most on record in October, sinking 24.3% from a year earlier, government data showed on Monday. Tourist arrivals plunged nearly 44%.
Protesters are angry by what they see as Beijing's tightening grip over the city's cherished freedoms promised under a ""one country, two systems"" formula when Britain returned it to Chinese rule in 1997.
China denies interfering and says it is committed to the “one country, two systems” formula put in place at that time and has blamed foreign forces for fomenting unrest.
The crisis has heightened tensions between Washington and Beijing, complicating the two sides' efforts to negotiate a trade deal.
Economists at ING said Hong Kong is sliding into a hard-landing recession.
""No one is expecting a sudden end to the violent situation. We're forecasting GDP growth at -7% for the fourth quarter, and full-year growth will be -2.25% in 2019, which is close in scale to 2009's recession of -2.5%,"" they said in a note on Monday.
The economy could shrink 5.8% in 2020, assuming trade war uncertainty and violent protests drag on through the year, ING said."

The final seasonally adjusted Jibun Bank Japan Services Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) edged up to 50.3 in November from 49.7 in October due to a modest improvement in new business and business expectations.
It was above the 50 mark that separates expansion from contraction, though it was still just off the 50.4 preliminary reading for last month.
The overall outcome was ""highly discouraging"" for the Japanese economy as the strength of recovery was limited, with activity growing only marginally, said Joe Hayes, economist at IHS Markit, which compiles the survey.
""Japan's service sector has been robust in 2019 so far, doing a good job at offsetting the strong drag from manufacturing,"" Hayes said.
""However, based on survey data so far in the fourth quarter, a contraction in economic output seems highly plausible as we head into year-end.""
The PMI data showed new export orders grew at the slowest pace in five months as firms said they saw a fall in demand from South Korea and Russia, among other destinations.
To keep Japan's fragile recovery intact, the government is preparing an economic stimulus package worth $120 billion, two sources with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters on Tuesday.
The world's third-biggest economy ground to a near standstill in the third quarter with growth at its weakest in a year as the U.S.-China trade war and soft global demand knocked exports.
The worry for policymakers is that after a sales tax hike, which kicked in on Oct. 1, private consumption could also be knocked hard and put a choke hold on the economy.
The composite PMI, which includes both manufacturing and services, shrank for the second straight month in November, though the pace of contraction was slower than in the previous month.
The index rose to 49.8 from October's final 49.1."

The IHS Markit/CIPS UK Construction Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) rose to 45.3 from 44.2 in October, a four-month high that was above all forecasts in a Reuters poll of economists that had pointed to a reading of 44.5.
Still, the index languished below the 50 threshold for growth for a seventh month running, with all three sub-sectors - housebuilding, commercial and civil engineering - in decline.
The PMI added to a string of underwhelming data ahead of Britain's Dec. 12 election, although the country's exit from the European Union, rather than the health of the economy, is the central issue in the campaign.
""UK construction output fell again in November as Brexit uncertainty and the forthcoming general election continued to send a chill breeze across the sector,"" said Tim Moore, Economics Associate Director at survey compiler IHS Markit.
Housebuilding has suffered the least from the downturn in 2019 but nonetheless, November marked its longest decline since early 2013, Moore added.
Prospects for a recovery looked muted as a contraction in new construction orders accelerated in November, the PMI showed.

Month-on-month, consumer inflation stood at 0.38% in November, compared with a poll forecast of 0.7%.

In October, it forecast an export decline of 1.5% this year.
For next year, exports, a key driver of Southeast Asia's second-largest economy, are still expected to rise 0-1%, Ghanyapad Tantipipatpong, chairwoman of the Thai National Shippers' Council, said in a statement.

48,By Bloomberg,"<span>Dec 02, 2019 11:03PM ET</span>",Australia Keeps Rates on Hold at Record-Low 0.75%,"(Bloomberg) -- Australia’s central bank kept interest rates unchanged as it waits for three cuts since June to flow through to areas of the economy beyond the property market.
Reserve Bank Governor Philip Lowe and his board kept the cash rate at 0.75% Tuesday, in line with expectations of economists and money markets. He will want to hold onto his remaining conventional ammunition -- estimated at two more cuts -- and monitor the impact of earlier easing and recent government tax rebates.
“Given these effects of lower interest rates and the long and variable lags in the transmission of monetary policy, the Board decided to hold the cash rate steady at this meeting while it continues to monitor developments, including in the labor market,” Lowe said in a statement accompanying the decision. “The Board is prepared to ease monetary policy further if needed.”
The RBA’s final meeting of the year sees policy makers no closer to reviving wages growth and sluggish inflation, trends that have bedeviled central banks worldwide. Australia’s economy has decelerated in the past 12 months as households reined in spending and sentiment remains weak despite the increased cash flow from interest rate and tax cuts.
However, the economy keeps ticking over on strong population growth and state government spending on infrastructure as they try to keep pace with swelling cities. Hiring has also remained resilient in the face of slowing growth, though unemployment of 5.3% isn’t low enough to spur the kind of wage gains the RBA wants.
The Australian dollar edged higher to 68.38 U.S. cents at 2:38 p.m. in Sydney, from about 68.20 cents before the decision.
The currency is also helping policy makers, declining about 16% since early last year and lifting the competitiveness of exporters. Parts of the economy have benefited from the U.S.-China dispute as Beijing’s stimulus to offset trade losses has lifted demand for iron ore, Australia’s biggest export.
The clearest impact of easing has been in east coast house prices, with annualized gains over the past three months in the Sydney and Melbourne markets tracking in the mid-20% range.
The economy expanded an annual 1.7% in the third quarter, analysts forecast ahead of data Wednesday -- still well short of the estimated trend pace of 2.75%.
Lowe faces difficult decisions ahead. He has little rate ammunition remaining and the government is resisting increasing fiscal spending as it tries to return the budget to surplus. As a result, he has laid out what an Australian version of quantitative easing would look like, but still doesn’t expect he’ll need to go down that road.
His bet is that the interest rate and tax cuts combined with rising house prices encourage consumers to loosen their purse strings. Consumption is about 55% of the economy and key to sustained growth. A lift in mining investment also holds out some prospect of faster expansion."

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia's central bank left interest rates at record lows on Tuesday as it waits for the three cuts already delivered to gain traction in a sluggish economy, though markets are wagering more easing will ultimately be needed.
The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) ended its last board meeting of the year by leaving the door open to another cut in its 0.75% cash rate.
""The Board is prepared to ease monetary policy further if needed to support sustainable growth in the economy,"" said RBA Governor Philip Lowe in a brief statement.
""The Board also agreed that due to both global and domestic factors, it was reasonable to expect that an extended period of low interest rates will be required in Australia.""
Markets are almost fully priced for a move to 0.5% by April , with a real chance of reaching 0.25% or even a drastic shift to quantitative easing via buying government bonds.
The decision comes a day before government data is expected to show the economy expanded by 0.5% in the September quarter, the third straight quarter of middling outcomes.
Annual growth is forecast to pick up to 1.7% from a decade low of 1.4%, which, while pedestrian by past performances, would still support the RBA's hopes for a gradual turnaround.
Lower borrowing costs have certainly worked to reignite home prices, which enjoyed their strongest month in 16 years in November, led by boom-like gains in Sydney and Melbourne.
Yet they have had far less luck in reviving consumers struggling with stagnant wage growth and sky-high debts. A weekly survey from ANZ showed confidence near four-year lows with the rate cuts themselves blamed for spooking consumers.
""Annual GDP growth may accelerate a touch, but this hardly points to an economy that is undergoing more than a gentle turn, one that is unlikely to be enough to stop unemployment moving higher,"" said ANZ head of Australian economics David Plank.
""Sentiment looks set to be challenged for a while yet.""
Some sectors of the economy were doing well, notably exports. Data out Tuesday showed the country's current account surplus swelled to a record A$7.9 billion ($5.36 billion) in the September quarter, only the second surplus since 1975.
It's an influx of cash that fattens company profits and boosts the government's tax take, but fails to percolate down to households.
The major resource companies are majority owned by foreigners, so much of the profits they earn flows offshore. Neither are miners splashing out on their staff, with annual wage growth in the sector stuck at a miserly 2%.
Government spending was helping, having added around 0.3 percentage points to growth in the third quarter.
Yet the conservative government of Prime Minister Scott Morrison has so far rebuffed calls for a major injection of fiscal stimulus, choosing instead to stay wedded to a political pledge to return the budget to surplus."

Ireland has remained the European Union's fastest growing economy during three years of Brexit talks but consumer confidence was hit earlier this year when the prospect of Britain leaving without an agreement rose.
The KBC Bank consumer sentiment index rose to 77.1 in November from 69.5 in October, helped by a fresh Brexit deal that Prime Minister Boris Johnson hopes to ratify after a Dec. 12 election. That was back to the level it stood at in August but still well below its reading of 96.5 a year ago.
""While official data published through the survey period point towards rising incomes and subdued inflation, we think the main driver of the change in November was a scaling back of Brexit worries,"" KBC Bank Ireland chief economist Austin Hughes said.
""This outcome appears consistent with the idea that Irish consumers were viewing their world through slightly less dark-colored Brexit glasses as the immediate threat of a 'crash out' Brexit disappeared and were replaced by expectations of an orderly transition period through the year ahead.""
Hughes said the improvement was most marked in the survey's forward-looking readings and while that reflected an easing in worries rather than ""a sense that all is wonderful"", it may translate into healthier spending during the Christmas period."

The British Retail Consortium said total retail spending tumbled by 4.4% compared with its figures for November 2018 which included the Black Friday period, unlike this year.
Adjusting for that discrepancy, and for differences in the proximity to Christmas of the BRC's November sales measurement period, the figures looked better for retailers.
Adjusted sales rose 0.9% year-on-year, the biggest increase since January, apart from April when the timing of Easter gave a calendar-related boost to sales.
Britain's consumers, buoyed by rising pay and modest inflation, have helped the economy to grow since the 2016 Brexit referendum, offsetting cuts to investment by many companies.
But there have been some signs recently that shoppers were turning more cautious, given the lack of clarity about Britain's departure from the European Union and an election on Dec. 12.
""Growth appears stronger in November than in previous months,"" BRC chief executive Helen Dickinson said.
Consumers were more willing to spend after the risk of a no-deal Brexit was pushed back from an Oct. 31 deadline until the end of January, she said.
""If the next government wishes to see retail spending remain healthy in 2020 it is essential they clarify our future relationship with the EU as soon as possible,"" Dickinson said.
In like-for-like terms, which strips out changes in retail space, sales were up 0.4% compared with November 2018, when adjusted for Black Friday and the proximity of Christmas.
A separate survey from payment card company Barclaycard painted a less upbeat picture about broader consumer spending.
It said spending rose by 0.9% in November, slowing from 1.5% growth in October, with no change in spending on essentials and a 1.3% rise in non-essentials.
Last week, the Confederation of British Industry said retailers had better-than-expected sales in November and were more upbeat about December."
52,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 02, 2019 02:19PM ET</span>","U.S. manufacturing contracts further, tempers economic growth hopes","By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. factory activity contracted for a fourth straight month in November as new orders slumped back to around their lowest level since 2012, while construction spending fell in October, tempering optimism over the economy that had been fanned by a recent run of upbeat reports.
The data on Monday led the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta to slash its gross domestic product estimate for the fourth quarter. The Atlanta Fed had only last Wednesday boosted its growth estimate by whopping 1.3% percentage points in the wake of encouraging news, including a sharp drop in the goods trade deficit in October and a strong rebound in a proxy of business spending on equipment.
The Institute for Supply Management (ISM) said its index of national factory activity dropped 0.2 point to a reading of 48.1 last month. A reading below 50 indicates contraction in the manufacturing sector, which accounts for 11% of the U.S. economy. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the index rising to 49.2 in November from 48.3 in the prior month.
Though the ISM said business sentiment had improved relative to October, likely as the United States and China inched towards a partial trade deal, November's reading marked the fourth straight month that the index remained below the 50 threshold.
The ISM index remains above the 42.9 level, which is associated with a recession in the broader economy. The ISM's forward-looking new orders sub-index tumbled 1.9 points to a reading of 47.2 last month, matching July's reading, which was the lowest since June 2012. A measure of export orders dropped 2.5 points to a reading of 47.9.
""There is nothing to point to in this report that signals a bottom in domestic manufacturing and the decline in new orders if anything suggests downside risk,"" said Andrew Hollenhorst, an economist at  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) in New York. 
The survey's factory employment index fell 1.1 points to a reading of 46.6 last month. This raises the risk that factory payrolls remained depressed in November after being weighed down by striking workers at General Motors (N:GM) in October.
November's drop in the ISM index is at odds with the so-called hard data, including the surge in October of orders for non-defense capital goods excluding aircraft, that had hinted at some stabilization in manufacturing activity. 
A separate survey by IHS Markit showed manufacturing and new orders expanding in November. Still, the sharp contraction in the ISM new orders measure last month poses a high hurdle for any manufacturing recovery. The downturn in manufacturing in the United States bucked trends in the euro zone and China, where factory activity appeared to stabilize in November.
While Washington and Beijing are working towards a partial trade deal, President Donald Trump on Monday said U.S. legislation backing protesters in Hong Kong did not make trade negotiations with China easier. Economists say a complete trade deal is needed to revive manufacturing.
Manufacturing, which is also struggling with a domestic inventory bloat, slowing profit growth and weak overseas demand, was dealt another blow on Monday. Trump restored tariffs on steel and aluminum imports from Brazil and Argentina, accusing them of devaluing their currencies at the expense of U.S. farmers.
POLICY UNCERTAINTY DRAGS
""We expect trade policy uncertainty to continue weighing on manufacturing activity into the new year. Slower external and domestic demand will also constrain manufacturing moving forward,"" said Oren Klachkin, lead economist at Oxford Economics in New York. 
Continued weakness in manufacturing could see Trump sharpening his attacks on the Federal Reserve, which in October cut interest rates for the third time this year and signaled a pause in the easing cycle that started in July when it reduced borrowing costs for the first time since 2008.
Trump wrote on Twitter on Monday ""Lower Rates & Loosen - Fed!"" 
The weak data pushed the dollar to a two-week low against a basket of currencies. The Treasury yield curve steepened, while stocks on Wall Street fell broadly.
The ISM said ""global trade remains the most significant cross-industry issue."" It said only five industries, including paper and computer and electronic products reported growth last month. Transportation equipment, machinery, and electrical equipment, appliances and components were among the 13 industries reporting a contraction.
Wood products manufacturers complained ""profits are elusive,"" noting that ""markets have downshifted further,"" and that ""the continued confusion surrounding China trade has kept export markets on edge."" Petroleum and coal products manufacturers said the ""slowdown in business has us revising our 2020-21 capital spend."" 
But manufacturing could get a lift from increased automobile production following the end of the GM strike. 
More support could come from Boeing (N:BA) which said recently it hopes to resume deliveries of its fast-selling 737 MAX before the end of the year. Deliveries of the aircraft were suspended after it was grounded in March following fatal crashes in Indonesia and Ethiopia.
But for now, clouds continue to gather over the economy. In a separate report on Monday, the Commerce Department said construction spending dropped 0.8% as investment in private projects tumbled to its lowest level in three years.

Following the dour reports, the Atlanta Fed cut its fourth-quarter GDP growth estimate to a 1.3% annualized rate from a 1.7% pace. The economy grew at a 2.1% rate in the second quarter.

PARIS (Reuters) - British investor Robert Drake has bought a luxury flat near the Elysee Palace in central Paris for two million euros, lured by ultra-low borrowing costs, attractive prices and a belief in the growing allure of continental Europe for financiers post-Brexit.
The two-bedroom flat is Drake's first overseas property investment. His purchase is a reflection of how the damage dealt to London's global standing by Britain's tumultuous decision to leave the European Union is contributing to sharp price rises in the French capital's luxury real estate market.
In the ornately corniced living room of his new apartment, Drake, who is managing director of Bury Street Capital, said Britain's relationship with Europe had ""fundamentally shifted"" since its vote to leave the EU in 2016.
""Whether Brexit happens or not I still think we are likely to see a transfer from the financial sector in the UK into the major European cities over the coming decades,"" Drake said. ""So from an investment perspective that’s a relevant point to me.""
Drake believes international bankers will increasingly seek top-end apartments in Paris, a city where strict planning rules will keep a firm lid on the supply of upmarket properties.
Paris property prices suffered under socialist president Francois Hollande, in power from 2012 to 2017. His 75% super-tax on earnings over 1 million euros reinforced France's reputation abroad for being hostile to wealth. High earners fled, often to London, creating a glut in supply.
The election of investor-friendly Emmanuel Macron in 2017 spurred a turnaround, driven initially by French buyers. As the Brexit negotiations got messier, foreign investors increasingly lost confidence in London and set their sights on Paris.
""Paris today is the number one winner from Brexit when it comes to real estate,"" said Thibault de Saint Vincent, chairman of leading international realtor Barnes International.
Knight Frank, one of Britain's biggest real estate agents with operations across Europe, expects Paris's prime market - the top 5% - to post further gains of 5-7% in 2020.
SAFE HAVEN?
At 19,000 euros per square meter, prime prices in Paris still compare favorably with other first-tier global cities – the equivalent in London and New York would be closer to 28,000 euros and 27,600 euros respectively.
Prime prices in Paris stand 21% above their low in the fourth quarter of 2015, Knight Frank said.
As well as British investors, Belgian, Scandinavian and Middle Eastern buyers are also turning to Paris.
""Whereas in the past overseas investors would have probably gone straight to London, suddenly they are pausing for thought for a variety of factors – Brexit and Paris being on the front foot – being the main two,"" said Roddy Aris, London-based associate partner at Knight Frank.
""They see Paris as the best bet over other safe-havens. It's portfolio diversification.""
House prices in London declined at their fastest pace in almost a decade earlier this year and will end the year in negative territory, hurt by the Brexit uncertainty and its impact on the city's attractiveness as a global finance center.
Last year, London lost its spot in Barnes International's top five most sought after cities, behind Hong Kong, New York, Los Angeles, Toronto and Paris.
De Saint Vincent of Barnes International said clients in the United States faced borrowing costs of 4-7%, compared with loans of below 1% fixed for up to 20 years in France.
""We've got a really lively market here,"" de Saint Vincent said. ""In New York, Miami, Los Angeles, it's moribund.""
Drake plans to buy more properties in the French capital - a move he acknowledged was not without risk, given the country's tradition of high taxes.
""France has never been terribly stable in terms of its fiscal backdrop,"" he said. ""So there is risk there."""

Global manufacturing is looking a little brighter heading into the end of the year, with a pickup in China and Germany validating calls that global growth is stabilizing.
The better factory numbers from China in November filtered across Asian economies including South Korea, Japan and Malaysia, all of which saw their Purchasing Managers’ Indexes nudge higher. In Europe, Germany’s reading came in stronger than initially estimated, rising for a second month.
The news lifted equities, with the Stoxx Europe 600 up 0.4% following earlier gains across Asia. Bonds fell, with German 10-year yields rising to the highest in three weeks.
The latest numbers continue a narrative seen across continents in recent weeks that the global economy has reached the bottom of the downturn and is stabilizing. Also fueling the optimism is hope that the U.S. and China -- despite mixed messages and ongoing political tensions -- are close to signing the first part of a trade deal.
“The market is positioned for a phase-one deal either by the end of this year or if not, then that the tariff hike for December will be delayed,” said Christoph Rieger, head of fixed rate strategy at Commerzbank. “The green-shoots spirit regarding the economy probably has room to extend.”
The next data point for investors is the U.S. ISM manufacturing report later on Monday. Also coming this week are readings from German industry plus U.S. monthly payrolls.
Much of the better mood in Asia was down to China’s improved performance. The Caixin index rose to 51.8 from 51.7, following news on the weekend that the official measure jumped to 50.2, the first reading above the key 50 level since April.
What Bloomberg’s Economists Say...
“Headwinds to the economy are unlikely to let up in the near term. Domestic sentiment remains sluggish, and it’s hard to see it improving significantly anytime soon, given deterioration in industrial enterprises’ profitability and slowing consumption.”
--David Qu. Read the full REACT
In Germany, the factory PMI rose to 44.1 from 42.1 -- good news but far from suggesting a strong rebound in growth is in sight. The economy still faces obstacles, particularly in its auto industry, and employment in manufacturing continues to fall. If that persists, it could shake the consumer and put a dent in spending, a key pillar of the economy.
Highlighting the ongoing danger, Daimler AG said Friday it will eliminate more than 10,000 positions. That lifts the tally of job cuts announced this year across Germany’s manufacturing sector to more than 100,000, according to Bloomberg calculations.
Mixed signals weren’t confined to Germany. While Japanese companies increased capital spending from the previous year, corporate profits fell for a second quarter and sales dropped, suggesting that investment could come under pressure in the months ahead. The country’s PMI also remains below 50, despite the latest increase.
In South Korea, often seen as a bellwether for global trade, export demand continued to slide in November, dropping more than 14% year-on-year, the sixth straight double-digit decline.
“Considerable challenges remain,” said Chang Shu, chief Asia economist for Bloomberg Economics. “Meaningful stabilization hinges on whether the U.S. and China can strike a phase-one deal.”"

The IMACEC economic activity index encompasses about 90 percent of the economy tallied in gross domestic product figures.
Protests in Chile began on Oct. 18 over a hike in metro fares but quickly spiraled into riots, arson and looting that have left 26 dead and upwards of $1.5 billion in losses for businesses.
Non-mining activity fell 4 percent, the bank said, marked by a sharp drop in education, transportation, business services and the hotel and restaurant sector. Much of Santiago, Chile's capital of 6 million, was shut near the end of October as riots and looting closed streets, central squares and many small businesses.
Mining activity in the world's top copper producer nonetheless grew 2.0 percent compared with the same month in 2018, as new production from Codelco's Chuquicamata mine ramped up, boosting total output despite the mounting protests.

Retail sales by value contracted by 24.3% in the month from a year earlier, the fourth month of double-digit declines. By volume, sales contracted by 26.2%, also a record, according to a government release.
Earlier Monday, Financial Secretary Paul Chan told lawmakers he expected the first budget deficit since the early 2000s for the fiscal year, and said that the ongoing turmoil has hurt economic growth by some 2 percentage points this year.
The retail data indicate that the annual “Golden Week” holiday in mainland China failed to translate into a tourist bump that could have alleviated the domestic economic pain. Overall, visitors to Hong Kong fell almost 44% in the month.
For retail businesses, that raises the stakes for coming months. Many proprietors will have to make hard choices: whether to continue the fight into next year or give up as leases come up for renewal and employee bonuses must be paid.
Iris Pang, an economist with ING Bank NV in Hong Kong, sees a 70% chance of a wave of store closures among retailers if spending continues to be weak. The situation is especially dire for catering companies, who typically enjoy brisk business at the holidays though face the prospect of cancellations during periods of unrest.
“Make or break is the correct description for most catering businesses in Hong Kong as some of them have continued in the business just because their rental agreement has yet to be due,” Pang said. “It is very likely that many catering businesses will close their business if their revenue doesn’t make a comeback during this holiday.”
Hong Kong’s large retailers face a similar predicament.
Cosmetics retailer Sa Sa International Holdings Ltd. may close about 30 stores in the coming year depending on how the market shakes out and “the results of discussions with the owners on rent reduction,” the company said in an emailed statement. Sa Sa shares have tumbled more than 40% this year.
Chow Tai Fook Jewellery Group Ltd. will look to cut costs by seeking bigger rent discounts, reducing advertising and reviewing store networks in Hong Kong and Macau, the company said in a webcast after reporting that first-half net income sank 21%. The company has leases at more than 40 stores in Hong Kong and Macau expiring in the next fiscal year.
Watch Out
Hong Kong has been one of the world’s largest centers for sales of luxury watches, but it has taken a hammering this year. Swiss watch exports to mainland China surpassed those to Hong Kong for the first time in October.
“If the situation persists, by the end of the year many watch companies will have to shut down business,” said Alain Lam, finance director with Oriental Watch Holdings Ltd. “At the end of the year, suppliers will ask for payment and employees will demand a one-month bonus -- this may cut off the cash flow of some companies.”
Oriental Watch Holdings has managed to negotiate 8% to 10% discounts in rent from some landlords and will attempt to arrange better deals as leases come up, Lam said. But there’s no guarantee the company will retain its significant presence in Hong Kong, as it has healthier operations elsewhere.
“If the numbers don’t work out, we will close stores,” he said. “We are shifting our strategic focus to mainland China, aggressively.”

LONDON (Reuters) - British manufacturers cut jobs last month at the fastest rate since 2012, a survey showed on Monday, as pressures from Brexit and a global trade slowdown caused the sector's longest decline since the financial crisis.
The IHS Markit/CIPS manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) sank to 48.9 in November from 49.6 in October, a slightly smaller decline than an initial flash estimate of 48.3.
But the PMI stuck below the 50 level that divides growth from contraction for a seventh consecutive month, the longest such run since 2009, as the country headed for an early election on Dec. 12 intended to end a parliamentary logjam over Brexit.
""November saw UK manufacturers squeezed between a rock and hard place, as the uncertainty created by a further delay to Brexit was accompanied by growing paralysis ahead of the forthcoming general election,"" IHS Markit economist Rob Dobson said.
Britain's economy has slowed since the referendum decision in June 2016 to leave the European Union, with manufacturing especially hard hit due to concerns about disruption to supply chains, on top of pressures from the U.S.-China trade war.
Britain faced the risk of leaving the EU without a transition deal on Oct. 31, prompting many manufacturers to build up emergency stocks of raw materials, before a last-minute delay until Jan. 31.
In November, factories reduced stocks at the fastest rate since June 2018, weighing on overall demand, the PMI showed.
The PMI's employment component sank to 46.8 from 47.1, representing the biggest loss of jobs since 2012, though less of a fall than in the flash estimate.
Although the unemployment rate is its lowest since 1975, official figures have shown that British employers in the third quarter cut jobs by the most for any quarter in the past four years. Monday's data suggest this risks continuing.
Manufacturing makes up around 10% of Britain's economy. In the third quarter output in the sector fell by 1.4% from a year earlier, while growth in the economy as a whole slowed to 1.0%, its weakest since 2010.
Earlier on Monday, the Confederation of British Industry forecast economic growth of 1.2% for 2020 and 1.8% in 2021, assuming Britain leaves the EU with a Brexit transition deal on Jan. 31 and then strikes a deal to preserve tariff-free trade.
Trade association Make UK cut its forecast for manufacturing growth to 0.1% for 2019 and 0.3% for 2020, down from a previous forecast of 0.6%."

IHS Markit's final manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) has been below the 50 mark separating growth from contraction since February, but at 46.9 it was above October's 45.9 and higher than a preliminary estimate of 46.6.
An index measuring output, which feeds into a composite PMI due on Wednesday that is seen as a good gauge of economic health, rose to 47.4 from 46.6.
""Although still signaling a steep rate of decline, the manufacturing PMI nonetheless brings some encouraging signals which will fuel speculation that the worst is over for euro area producers,"" said Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit.
New orders, employment, raw materials purchases and backlogs of work all declined at a shallower rate, while optimism staged its biggest one-month bounce in over six years. The future output index leapt to 55.3 from 51.9.
""Perhaps most promising is a marked upturn in business sentiment, particularly in Germany,"" Williamson said.
Germany, Europe's biggest economy, is going through a soft patch but is on track to grow 0.2% this quarter, the Ifo economic institute said last week. Its export-dependent manufacturing sector contracted at a slower pace for the second month in a row in November, the German factory PMI showed earlier."
63,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 02, 2019 04:21AM ET</span>",German manufacturing contraction eases in November,"BERLIN (Reuters) - Germany's export-dependent manufacturing sector contracted at a slower pace for the second month in a row in November, a survey showed on Monday, as companies sounded optimistic about their future business.
IHS Markit's Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) for manufacturing, which accounts for about a fifth of the economy, rose slightly for the second consecutive month to a five-month high reading of 44.1.
The figure was higher than a flash reading of 43.8 but remained below the 50.0 mark separating growth from contraction for the 11th month in a row.
""There are encouraging signs from the survey's more forward-looking indicators, with new orders falling at the slowest rate since January and output expectations back in positive territory - albeit only just,"" said Phil Smith, principle economist at IHS Markit.
""Though now less worried about the outlook, manufacturers remain in retrenchment mode as they report lower capacity utilization and look to save costs,"" he added.
""Manufacturing is on course to make a negative contribution to economic growth in the fourth quarter and, through ongoing factory job losses, remains an indirect drag on the rest of the economy.""
With sales abroad hit by a worsening trade climate, a global economic slowdown and an increasingly chaotic run-up to Brexit, the bulk of Germany's growth momentum is being generated domestically, leaving it exposed to any weakening of the jobs market."

ISTANBUL (Reuters) - Turkey's economy grew 0.9% year-on-year https://tmsnrt.rs/2P6vV18 in the third quarter, in line with expectations, breaking three consecutive quarters of contraction as it shook off the effects of recession following last year's currency crisis. 
Compared to the second quarter, gross domestic product (GDP) expanded by a seasonally and calendar-adjusted 0.4%, its third positive quarter-on-quarter reading in a row, the Turkish Statistical Institute data showed. 
A Reuters poll forecast the economy would expand 1% year-on-year in the third quarter. It also predicted that the economy will grow 0.5% in 2019 as a whole.
The major emerging market economy has a track record of 5% growth, but a near 30% slide in the lira's value last year pushed up inflation and interest rates, while domestic demand tumbled.
Graphic: Turkey gets back on growth track (https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/editorcharts/TURKEY-ECONOMY-GDP/0H001QXMZ9QX/eikon.png)
The third quarter growth was driven by the agricultural sector which expanded 3.8%, while industry grew 1.6% and services grew 0.6%. The construction sector shrank 7.8%.
The lira  was at 5.7435 against the dollar, weakening slightly from 5.74 beforehand.
As the economy has recovered, inflation tumbled to single digits in October due to base effects, and loan growth picked up thanks to central bank rate cuts. In the second quarter, the economy shrank a revised 1.6% year-on-year.
In late October, the central bank slashed its policy rate more than expected to 14%, continuing an aggressive bout of cuts from 24% since July to help revive the recession-hit economy.
The central bank governor subsequently said the bank had used a significant part of its leeway for loosening monetary policy. Last week, he said the bank will use required reserves to support real sector access to loans and loan growth.
Industrial production, a key signal of economic activity and widely regarded as an indication of growth, expanded 3.4% year-on-year in September.

The government's own sharply lowered forecast for the year envisages growth at 0.5% in 2019, and 5% in 2020.

65,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 02, 2019 02:21AM ET</span>",Japan's third-quarter capex jumps on higher retail sector investment,"By Daniel Leussink
TOKYO (Reuters) - Japanese firms boosted capital spending in the September quarter, as retailers and wholesalers raised investment ahead of a long-awaited sales tax hike in October and factories maintained their automation push.
Official data on Monday showed capital spending rose 7.1% in the third quarter from the same period a year earlier, extending gains in business spending for a 12th consecutive month and outpacing the previous quarter's 1.9% increase.
Business investment has been a rare bright spot for the world's third-largest economy, as companies move to automate their production, however, there are concerns momentum could slow significantly in the current quarter.
Analysts worry merchants' rush to invest in new electronic payment systems in the quarter to take advantage of government rebates for cashless transactions could fall off in the current quarter.
""That will lead to a pullback, which will put downward pressure on capital expenditure in October-December,"" said Hiroshi Miyazaki, senior economist at Mitsubishi UFJ  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) Securities.
There is also a risk the U.S.-China tariff dispute will more deeply affect manufacturing spending.
""There is a good possibility that business spending will be negative"" in the fourth quarter, and pull economic growth into negative territory, Miyazaki added.
Japan introduced a twice-delayed sales tax hike on Oct. 1, raising the levy to 10% from 8%, to fix the industrial world's heaviest public debt burden at more than twice the size of the economy.
To ease the pain on consumers, it rolled out measures such as premium shopping vouchers, different tax rates and discounts for cashless payments.
On a seasonally adjusted basis, capital expenditure slipped 0.8% from the previous quarter. Corporate profits and sales fell on year as firms felt the pain from a prolonged Sino-U.S. trade war and slowing growth of China's economy.
The data will be used to calculate revised third-quarter gross domestic product figures due on Dec. 9.
A preliminary reading out last month showed the world's third-largest economy ran to a near halt during July to September with growth at its weakest in a year as the China-U.S. trade conflict and soft global demand lowered exports.
A string of gloomy data since then has fueled speculation the government may put together a large-scale economic stimulus package with fiscal spending exceeding $92 billion to keep the economy's fragile recovery intact.
Retail sales tumbled at their fastest pace in more than 4-1/2 years in October, while factory output posted its biggest fall since early 2018, exposing widening cracks in an economy that faces weakening foreign and domestic demand.
Capital expenditure, however, has been upbeat as companies replace old equipment and ramp up automation investment to offset a labor market that remains close to its tightest in 45 years as the country's population ages.
""The bright news is that capital spending in the manufacturing industry was holding up in the July-September quarter,"" said Shigeto Nagai, head of Japan economics at Oxford Economics.
""In August, sentiment was not so good because of worries over an acceleration of U.S.-China trade tensions,"" he said. ""Markets were also in rough weather.""
Manufacturers' business spending jumped 6.4% from a year earlier, Monday's survey, conducted among firms with at least 10 million yen ($92,000) in capital, showed, rebounding after a 6.9% drop in the previous quarter.
Spending by non-manufacturers advanced 7.6%, outpacing the second quarter's 7% rise and helped by a 17.1% gain in investment by the wholesale and retail trade sector, its largest since the fourth quarter of 2011.
Corporate recurring profit dropped 5.3% during the July to September period from a year earlier, falling for the third time in four quarters. Retained profits rose by 4% to the highest on record, while firms cut back spending on wages including bonuses by 1.5% and slashed the number of workers by 1.8%.
Sales lost 2.6%, down for the first time in three years as businesses struggled with weakening demand, and slowing from the previous period's 0.4% gain.

BEIJING (Reuters) - China's factory activity showed surprising signs of improvement in November, with growth picking up to a near three-year high, a private sector survey showed on Monday, reinforcing upbeat government data released over the weekend.
But analysts remain concerned about deflationary risks in the sector, unconvinced that the worst is over yet for Chinese manufacturers. They say the sub-indexes of both surveys painted a picture of patchy recovery that will be difficult to sustain. 
""The improvement last month was driven by different factors across the two manufacturing indices, making it hard to pinpoint the reason for the apparent uptick industrial activity,"" Julian Evans-Pritchard, Senior China Economist, wrote in a note on Monday.
""We doubt this marks the start of a decisive rebound in activity,"" he said.
The Caixin/Markit manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) index rose to 51.8 in November from 51.7 in the previous month, marking the fastest expansion since December 2016, when it was 51.9. The 50-mark separates expansion from contraction on a monthly basis. Economists polled by Reuters had expected a dip to 51.4.
The survey and a similarly strong official PMI helped push Asian shares higher on Monday with China's bluechips (CSI300) rising as much as 0.68% before paring gains.
Total new orders and factory production remained at buoyant levels in November, although they both eased slightly from record highs in the previous month, when they grew the fastest in over six years and nearly three years, respectively.
Larry Hu, Chief China economist at Macquarie Group, cautioned that the improvement could be hit as many one-off tailwinds wear off, such as better sentiment on trade deal and warm weather. Business confidence slipped and companies were reluctant to replenish their inventories, worried about the uncertain outlook for demand and the prolonged China-U.S. trade war, the survey showed.
China's official factory activity gauge on Saturday also surprised, returning to growth for the first time in seven months as domestic demand picked up in response to stimulus measures. But gains were slight and export orders sluggish.
The official survey focuses more on heavy industry than Caixin's, which is believed to include firms that are more export oriented. The two surveys also cover different geographical areas.
The Caixin survey showed sub-index for new export orders came in at 51, marginally below that in October, when it was the highest since February 2018. 
Resilience in the sector led to a notable recovery in the labor market in the month, with companies adding workers for the first time in eight months.
However, profit margins remained under pressure, with input costs continuing to rise while output charges fell, suggesting some firms are still cutting their prices due to fierce competition for sales.
""While growth is likely to stabilize in November, the overall downtrend will continue in months ahead,"" Hu told Reuters.
MORE STIMULUS NEEDED? 
The Chinese government has been trying to spur domestic demand for well over a year, largely through higher infrastructure spending and tax cuts, but the measures have been slow to gain traction.
Economic growth cooled to a near 30-year low of 6.0% in the third quarter.
""I think the rebound in headline PMIs may indicate the possibility that China will still be able to achieve above 6% growth rate in 2019,"" Betty Wang, senior China economist at ANZ told Reuters. 
""But the price subindices in the manufacturing PMI survey still declined, which suggests the deflationary risk in the manufacturing sector remains.""
To help avert a sharper slowdown, China has brought forward 1 trillion yuan ($142.07 billion) of the 2020 local government special bond quota to this year. The bonds are used largely to fund public works.
While China has cut some of its key lending rates in the last few months to reduce corporate financing costs, the reductions have been quite modest. Analysts believe policymakers are reluctant to unleash more aggressive stimulus out of concern it could heighten financial risks and add to a mountain of debt.
TRADE UNCERTAINTIES
Washington and Beijing said in October they were working on a ""phase one"" trade agreement, but initial market hopes for a quick deal are fading after weeks of conflicting headlines. 
A deal could slide into next year as Beijing presses for more extensive tariff rollbacks, and the Trump administration counters with heightened demands of its own.
Highlighting the tension, China's Global Times newspaper said on Sunday that Beijing is demanding Washington removes existing tariffs, not just planned tariffs, as part of the deal, citing sources with direct knowledge of the trade talks.
Additional U.S. duties on Chinese exports are set to kick in on Dec. 15.
Months of protests in Chinese-ruled Hong Kong have also exacerbated tensions.

A trade deal has now stalled after the U.S. passed legislation backing protesters in Hong Kong, news website Axios reported on Sunday, citing a source close to Trump's negotiating team.

Consumer prices rose 0.2% in November from a year earlier, rising for the first time in four months, according to a statement from the country’s statistical office on Monday. Economists had forecast a 0.7% rise, following a 0% reading in October and a first-ever drop in September. The data follows a bigger-than-expected exports decline for November, which damped optimism that a prolonged slump in global demand may finally be bottoming out.
Key Insights
South Korea’s central bank held interest rates at 1.25% on Friday, and said the economy will probably grow 2% this year, the slowest pace since the global financial crisis. It forecast inflation at 0.4%, far below the bank’s 2% target.Below-zero inflation in September had raised concerns over deflation risks. South Korean officials have dismissed those concerns as excessive, blaming higher-than-usual food prices last year. The BOK expects inflation to rise to 1% in 2020.“Looks like next year will be another tough one for inflation,” said Yoon Yeo-sam, an analyst at Meritz Securities in Seoul . “The economy appears largely to be bottoming out, but the pace of rise just isn’t strong enough.”Recent data from South Korea has been mixed. Consumer confidence improved for a third month in November, rising above 100 for the the first time since April. Pulling in the other direction, industrial production fell more than expected in October from the previous month while exports extended its double-digit slide in November.“A technical rebound in CPI does not mean a meaningful turnaround in the underlying prices trend,” said Ma Tieying, an economist with DBS Bank before the release. Disinflationary forces still appear intact for the time being, given the decline in producer prices and negative output gap, she added.South Korea’s aging population and falling potential growth are two challenges that raise the risk of structural deflation in the long term.“Our base case is for a gradual uptick in CPI from here and that should take some pressure off the BOK in the interim,” said Howie Lee, an economist at Oversea-Chinese Banking Corp, before the release.What Bloomberg’s Economist Says

SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korean exports in November fell for the 12th month in a row and far more than expected, denting hopes for the global manufacturing sector stabilizing as a much-awaited China-U.S. trade deal is still in darkness.
Exports declined 14.3% in November from a year earlier, trade ministry data showed on Sunday, far below a median 10.2% fall tipped in a Reuters poll and missing even the worst forecast in the survey of an 11.1% loss.
It was also the second-worst drop in overseas sales in nearly four years as global semiconductor prices failed to turn around while China, the country's biggest export market, continued to cut down purchases from its smaller neighbor.
The surprisingly weak November data from a manufacturing powerhouse, which reports monthly trade data ahead of major exporting nations each month, underscores the global economy still far from a turning point.
""The optimism for the first-phase trade deal between the United States and China will take time before actually boosting exports, and today's poor data means the turnaround in exports is taking longer than expected,"" said Chun Kyu-yeon, economist at Hana Financial Investment.
Shipments to China fell 12.2% in November from a year earlier, while overseas sales of semiconductors, South Korea's top export item, tumbled by 30.8% in value as prices plunged this year from a super-rally last year.
Imports fell 13.0% on-year in November, also missing an 11.9% contraction tipped in the survey. That brought the November trade balance to a $3.37 billion surplus, versus a $5.34 billion surplus a month earlier.
Sunday's data left shipments for the first 11 months of this year 10.7% below a year earlier, putting the country on track for its worst annual exports performance since a 13.9% fall in 2009 during the height of a global financial crisis.
South Korea's economy, the fourth-largest in Asia and heavily dependent on exports, has been hit especially hard by cooling global trade and a prolonged tariff war between China and the United States.
On Friday, the central bank trimmed its 2019 economic growth forecast for the fourth time this year to the lowest in a decade, and also lowered next year's forecast.
The downgrades came even after the Bank of Korea cut rates twice this year, the most recent cut coming in October. Many analysts expect the central bank to ease policy further next year to support the stuttering economy."
70,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 29, 2019 10:47PM ET</span>",China's factory activity unexpectedly returns to growth in November,"By Yawen Chen and Se Young Lee
BEIJING (Reuters) - Factory activity in China unexpectedly returned to growth in November for the first time in seven months, as domestic demand picked up on Beijing's accelerated stimulus measures to steady growth.
But gains were slight, and export demand remained sluggish. More U.S. tariffs are looming within weeks and Beijing and Washington are still haggling over the first phase of a trade deal.
With China's economic growth cooling to near 30-year lows and industrial profits shrinking, speculation is mounting that Beijing needs to roll out stimulus more quickly and more aggressively, even if it risks adding to a pile of debt.
The Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) bounced back to 50.2 in November, its highest since March, China's National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) said on Saturday, above the 50-point mark that separates growth from contraction on a monthly basis.
The result compared with 49.3 in October. A Reuters poll showed analysts expected the November PMI to come in at 49.5.
The official factory gauge pointed to an improvement in China's vast manufacturing sector last month. Total new orders bounced back to expansionary territory with the sub-index rising to 51.3, the highest level seen since April.
That indicates domestic consumption firmed up after Beijing repeatedly urged local governments to kick stimulus up a gear to meet economic goals before year-end. Factory output also rose to 52.6 in November, marking the strongest pace since March.
""In the short term, we may have already passed the low point where the economy hit the bottom,"" Zhang Deli, a macro analyst with Lianxun Securities, wrote in a note.
Beijing has front-loaded 1 trillion yuan ($142 billion) of a 2020 local government special bonds quota to this year and has urged that they be issued and used as early as possible to boost infrastructure investment. Some analysts say that could be a sign that the government is worried about downward economic pressure.
Zhang attributed to the better-than-expected November PMI to a government push on infrastructure investment, less property market control, and a de-escalation in U.S.-China trade tension in October, when both sides said they had substantially reached a ""Phase 1"" agreement and the United States delayed a tariff increase scheduled to take place on October 15.
RISING UNCERTAINTIES
But recent developments underscore rising uncertainties in the trade conflict, which bodes ill for the outlook for external demand. New export orders fell for an 18th straight month in November, albeit at a slower pace, with the sub-index rising to 48.8 from 47.0 in October.
U.S. President Donald Trump said this week that the world's largest economies are close to reaching agreement on the first phase deal. But trade experts and people close to the White House said it could slide into the new year, given China is pressing for more extensive tariff rollbacks.
An additional 15% in U.S. tariffs are scheduled to take effect on about $156 billion of Chinese products on Dec. 15.
Trump has also highlighted Washington's support for protesters in Hong Kong, potentially a huge sore point for China.
The PMI survey also indicated factories continued to cut jobs in November despite slightly improved business confidence, while it signaled a further deterioration in profits for Chinese manufacturers, with output prices falling into a three-month low.
Beijing's drive to guide more bank lending towards small private firms appeared to be working. Their PMI index recorded the strongest gain in November, compared to medium-sized and large firms, but their performance was still the poorest of the three at 49.4.
Growth in China's services sector also quickened in November, while construction activity held up well, but growth in the latter slowed compared to the previous month, a separate statistics bureau survey showed.
The official non-manufacturing PMI picked up to 54.4, recovering from October's 52.8, the lowest point since February 2016.
A strong services sector has offered Beijing some cushioning effect as manufacturers face growing difficulties in securing demand both at home and abroad. However, the sector's resilience weakened late last year amid a broader economic slowdown.
Some analysts have also cast doubt over the prospects for robust growth in the construction sector.
""After all, we are still waiting for more definitive signs of a recovery in the credit cycle. Meanwhile, sentiment in the property market continues to cool down, which clouds the outlook of the sustainability of property investment growth,"" researchers from China International Capital Corporation (CICC) said in a note this week.
China's gross domestic product growth is expected to slow to a near three-decade low of 6.2% in 2019 and then hit 5.9% in 2020, according to a Reuters poll."

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India's annual economic growth slowed to 4.5% in the July-September quarter, its weakest pace since 2013, putting pressure on Prime Minister Narendra Modi to speed up reforms as five rate cuts by the central bank have failed to boost investments.
Economists said the drop in growth could prompt the Reserve Bank of India to cut its repo rate by 25 basis points to 4.90% at its meeting next week, although investors are skeptical about how effective monetary policy can be in boosting growth in the current scenario.
The gross domestic product data released on Friday showed consumer demand, private investment and exports all struggling.
The year-on-year growth figure was below the 4.7% forecast in a Reuters poll of economists and compared with 7% growth in the same quarter of 2018, and 5% in the previous quarter.
Modi's government, given a second term by voters in May, has taken several steps including cutting corporate tax in September and speeding up privatization of state-run firms to boost investments and bolster growth.
India needs to grow at around 8% a year to create enough jobs for the millions of young people joining the labor force each year, yet many economists see the current slowdown continuing for another year or two, underlining the case for urgent reforms.
""At this point in time, direct fiscal intervention and/or cut in personal income tax rates to put in more money in the hand of consumers appears to be the only short-term solution,"" said Kunal Kundu, India economist,  Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN), Bangalore.
However he said the government had limited room to maneuver as the fiscal deficit crossed the full-year target in the seven months to October.
If the RBI does cut rates, it would the sixth consecutive policy meeting that it has done so. The repo rate has fallen 135 basis points so far this year but banks, saddled with about $140 billion in stressed assets, have not cut their lending rates much.
The government is nudging the central bank to set up a fund to buy out stressed assets of the country's top 25 shadow lenders and revive the financial sector, a government source told reporters on Thursday.
Modi is pushing in parliament for labor reforms as well as measures to offer more incentives to attract foreign investors to set up factories in India.
Firms show little appetite to invest due to sluggish domestic and global demand.
'ECONOMIC EMERGENCY'
In a heated parliamentary debate on the economic slowdown affecting jobs, opposition parties said earlier this week that millions of people had lost their jobs and the country faced an ""economic emergency"".
Reacting to Friday's economic data, former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh said the sharp fall in economic growth was ""unacceptable"" given the country's aspiration to grow at 8-9% a year.
Economists said that with persistently tight domestic credit and weak corporate profits, India's recovery could be delayed and the pick-up would remain below potential.
The unemployment rate in October rose to 8.5%, its highest since August 2016, according to the Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy (CMIE) data released earlier this month, though the government estimates that urban unemployment declined.
Government and central bank officials are not sure whether the economic slump has bottomed out as growth slipped for sixth straight quarter.
Many indicators – automobile sales, rail freight, petroleum product consumption, domestic air traffic and imports - are signaling weak domestic consumption.
In the September quarter, private investment grew 5%, up from 3.1% in the previous quarter, while government spending rose 15.6% from 8.8%.
However, capital investment growth slipped to 1% from 4%, indicating that despite rate cuts firms are putting investment on hold, while agriculture grew modestly and manufacturing contracted by 1.0%.
India's infrastructure output contracted for the second consecutive month to 5.8% in October from a year earlier, the lowest since at least April 2012, separate data released on Friday showed.
""While it appears likely that the growth rate has bottomed out especially as the favorable base effect kicks in, extremely weak demand conditions engender a lurking fear of continued weakness in economic activity,"" said Kundu, the Societe Generale economist."
72,By Bloomberg,"<span>Nov 29, 2019 08:54AM ET</span>",Canada’s Economy Slows in Third Quarter Even as Demand Jumps,"(Bloomberg) -- Canada’s economy slowed sharply in the third quarter, as a drop in exports and draw down in business inventories masked a rebound in domestic demand.
Gross domestic product grew at an annualized pace of 1.3% in the three months ended September, in line with economist estimates, Statistics Canada reported Friday. That was down from a revised 3.5% pace in the previous quarter that was largely seen as unsustainable. The period also ended as expected, with a monthly expansion of 0.1% in September.
While the slowdown last quarter marks a return to sluggish growth for the Canadian economy, the details of the report should provide some optimism about underlying strength domestically, even in the face of a weak trade sector, aided by a relatively robust jobs market and a rebound in housing.
Residential investment increased at an annualized pace of 13.3% in the third quarter, the fastest since 2012. Growth in household consumption picked up to an annualized pace of 1.6% in the third quarter, from 0.5% the previous quarter.
Non-residential business investment also surprised -- given the global trade uncertainties -- with spending on non-residential structures and machinery up 9.5%. That fully recouped a drop in the second quarter.
The end result was a 3.2% increase in overall domestic demand, fully rebounding from a very weak second quarter when consumption slowed and investment contracted. These underlying details should give Bank of Canada policy makers pause about cutting rates to counter an expected slowdown. Swaps trading suggests investors are placing a two-thirds chance of a rate cut in the first half of next year. The Canadian dollar pared losses after the report, and was trading at C$1.33 per U.S. dollar at 8:39 a.m. in Toronto trading.
The “hearty” gains in final domestic demand will “for now reinforce the Bank of Canada’s view that they have rates low enough to offset the drag from weak external markets,” Avery Shenfeld, chief economist at Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, said in a note to investors. “Overall, a mixed bag, but perhaps a bit better than it looks in the headline given the strength in domestic demand.”
The Bank of Canada, whose next rate decision is Dec. 4, had forecast growth of 1.3% annualized for the third and fourth quarters this year, before the expansion picks up a bit in 2020.
Another bit of good news was upward historical revisions by Statistics Canada to gross domestic product that showed the economy was slightly larger than initially estimated last year. This suggests there was less slack in the economy than previously thought, one less reason for the Bank of Canada to cut.
The biggest drag on the economy in the third quarter was a draw down in inventories by business to meet demand, instead of raising production. That’s the second straight draw down in inventories, and may still reflect concerns about the outlook.
At the same time, fewer inventories will ease worries that stockpiles had grown too large, posing a risk to future growth.
Exports dropped at an annualized pace of 1.5% in the third quarter, falling for a third time in the past four quarters.
Households also seem to be repairing their balance sheets, with the country’s savings rate jumping to the highest since 2015 in the third quarter."
73,By Bloomberg,"<span>Nov 29, 2019 08:28AM ET</span>","India’s Economic Growth Sputters to 4.5%, Weakest Since 2013","(Bloomberg) -- India’s economy posted its weakest growth in more than six years last quarter, a blow to Prime Minister Narendra Modi as he exhausts all options to stem the fallout.
Gross domestic product rose 4.5% in the September quarter from a year ago, down from 5% in the previous quarter and compared with a median estimate of 4.5% in a Bloomberg survey of economists.
Core infrastructure industries’ output declined 5.8% in October, the biggest contraction since at least 2005, data released separately showed Friday.
The slowdown in Asia’s third-largest economy took a turn for the worst this year as consumers curbed spending, businesses held back on investments and export demand slumped. Having left much of the stimulus burden to the central bank early this year, Modi has recently taken bolder steps to reverse the decline, though the policy room for additional stimulus is narrowing.
“Domestic demand is displaying chronic weakness, with an apparent credit crunch afflicting wide swaths of the economy,” Taimur Baig, chief economist at DBS Group Holdings Ltd. in Singapore, said before the GDP data. “Production and sales are under pressure, and public spending is running out of room due to poor tax collection.”
In recent months, the government has slashed corporate taxes, set up a special real-estate fund, merged banks and announced the biggest privatization drive in more than a decade. The Reserve Bank of India has already cut interest rates by 135 basis points this year to the lowest since 2009, with economists predicting more easing to come next week.
The weak growth outlook and interest-rate cuts are weighing on the rupee, the worst performing currency in emerging Asia this quarter.
India was the world’s fastest-growing economy until last year, posting quarterly growth rates of as high of 9.4% in 2016. A crisis among shadow banks -- a key source of funding for small businesses and consumers -- weak rural spending and a global slowdown have since conspired to bring down growth steadily.
“The onus is on the government to do the heavy lifting,” Devendra Pant, chief economist of India Ratings and Research, a local unit of Fitch Ratings Ltd., said before the data were released. He expects the government will miss this year’s fiscal deficit target of 3.3% of GDP as it boosts spending while tax revenue falters."

The ECB has struggled for years to boost inflation, which has undershot its target of almost 2% despite unprecedented stimulus that included negative interest rates, 2.6 trillion euros worth of bond purchases and subsidized loans to banks.
Annual inflation jumped to 1% this month from 0.7% in October, outpacing expectations for 0.9%, as volatile food prices rose more than predicted, data from Eurostat showed on Friday.
More comforting for ECB policymakers, underlying inflation also rose faster than predicted as services inflation continued to accelerate since bottoming out in July, possibly due to a normalization in the price of package holidays in Germany.
Core inflation excluding food and energy prices picked up to 1.5% from 1.2% a month earlier, beating expectations for 1.3%. An even narrower gauge, which also excludes alcohol and tobacco prices, accelerated to 1.3% from 1.1%, ahead of forecasts for 1.2%.
The November rise is unlikely to signal a bigger shift in price trends, however, and the ECB expects inflation to accelerate only very slowly, undershooting its target for years to come.
Indeed, headline inflation is only expected to average 1% next year, then rise to 1.5% in 2021 as overall growth remains below what is considered the bloc's potential, keeping price pressures muted.
In another comforting sign for policymakers, unemployment fell to 7.5% of the workforce in October, the lowest rate since July 2008, as the number of people without jobs fell by 31,000 to 12.334 million.
Although employment growth has slowed amid the bloc's wobble, firms are maintaining their workforces, supporting expectations that the slowdown would not morph into a recession and a recovery would eventually materialize.
The ECB will next meet on Dec. 12 and its policy stance is not expected to change for months to come."

The growth rate in unsecured consumer lending increased to 6.1% in the 12 months to October from 5.9% in September, the first increase in the annual growth rate since June 2018, the figures from the Bank of England showed.
Consumers have slowed the pace of their spending since voters decided to leave the European Union more than three years ago but the loss of momentum has contrasted with cuts to investment by business, helping the overall economy.
There have been signs recently that households were turning more cautious as the prospect of a potentially chaotic Brexit grew, and after Prime Minister Boris Johnson called an early election for Dec. 12.
Earlier on Friday, a measure of consumer confidence remained at its lowest level in six years.
The BoE said consumer lending increased by 1.326 billion pounds in October, compared with a median forecast for a rise of 0.9 billion pounds in a Reuters poll of economists.
There were other signs of caution among households in the data.
The number of mortgages approved for house purchase dropped to 64,602 in October, the lowest number since March and at the bottom end of a range of forecasts in the Reuters poll.
An industry survey published earlier this week showed banks in Britain approved the fewest mortgages in October since March.
The BoE's data on Friday showed net mortgage lending rose by 4.321 billion pounds, the highest since July and above all forecasts in the Reuters poll.
The BoE also said net gilt holdings by foreign investors fell by 5.243 billion pounds in October, the biggest drop since February."
76,By Bloomberg,"<span>Nov 29, 2019 05:49AM ET</span>","Euro-Area Inflation Quickens, But Remains Far Below ECB’s Goal","(Bloomberg) -- Euro-area inflation accelerated in November, offering some comfort for the European Central Bank whose monetary stimulus has attracted increased scrutiny over potentially detrimental side effects.
The rate picked up to 1% from a three-year low of 0.7% in October, beating expectations for a 0.9% reading. More importantly, a measure stripping out volatile components quickened to 1.3%, the highest in seven months.
The headline rate is still well below the ECB’s goal of just under 2%. Recent shifts in inflation have been driven by energy, and the central bank has warned that underlying price pressures are “muted.”
The ECB has been struggling to lift inflation despite years of ultra-loose policy. The latest stimulus salvo included cutting interest rates further below zero and a fresh round of quantitative easing that’s set to continue until inflation is firmly tethered to its goal.
But the high degree of monetary support is attracting increasingly intense criticism. Sub-zero rates have riled German savers and raised the specter of pension cuts in the Netherlands. Banks across the euro area are also blaming the policy for their poor profitability.
In its latest Financial Stability Review, even the ECB warned of potential side effects, including threats to investment funds, insurers and in some real estate markets.
The ECB is likely to take stock of its experience when it starts a strategy review early next year under new president Christine Lagarde. Policy makers expect to tweak their inflation target -- fixing it at 2%, but will struggle to go much further than that, according to officials with knowledge of the matter.
Separately, the Eurostat said on Friday that euro-area unemployment dropped to 7.5% in October, the lowest since July 2008. Yet regional differences remain significant. While in Germany, only 3.1% of the working population remained without a job, the figure stood at 16.7% in Greece and 14.2% in Spain."

In a report that’s likely to damp any expectations of German fiscal stimulus, the number of people out of work slid by 16,000, compared with estimates for an increase of 6,000. The jobless rate held at 5%, near a record low. The drop in those out of work is good news for the economy after earlier figures Friday showed a sharp drop in retail sales.
Data this month has shown a rebound in factory orders and a small improvement in business confidence. That’s given credence to the insistence by German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s administration that there’s no immediate case to deviate from its balanced budget, a stance backed by Bundesbank President Jens Weidmann.
Still, after more than a decade of falling joblessness, the risk remains that Germany’s labor market could be at a turning point.
Manufacturers have announced more than 80,000 job cuts this year, led by automakers such as Volkswagen AG (DE:VOWG_p) struggling with a fundamental shift to electric vehicles, and machine-tool makers such as   Siemens   AG (DE:SIEGn) hit by cooling global trade.
The labor agency said demand for new labor has eased. The concern is that job losses will erode private spending, which has supported the economy in recent quarters and helped prevent it from falling into a recession this year.
The International Monetary Fund and European Central Bank have called on Germany to dip into its fiscal surplus to bolster public spending. That’s part of a broader call -- addressed by ECB President Christine Lagarde in her first major speech -- for a new European policy mix in which government investment is stepped up to ease the burden on monetary stimulus."

Xi Jinping’s government faces an increasingly difficult balancing act as it tries to support the world’s second-largest economy without encouraging moral hazard and reckless spending. While authorities have so far been reluctant to rescue troubled borrowers and ramp up stimulus, the costs of maintaining that stance are rising as defaults increase and China’s slowdown deepens.
Policy makers are attempting to do the “minimum necessary to keep the economy on the rails,” Andrew Tilton, chief Asia-Pacific economist at  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS)., said in a Bloomberg TV interview.
Among China’s most vexing challenges is the deteriorating health of smaller lenders and regional state-owned companies, whose financial linkages risk triggering a downward spiral without support from Beijing. A landmark debt recast proposed this week by Tewoo Group, a state-owned commodities trader, has raised concerns about more financial turbulence in its home city of Tianjin.
Similar concerns have popped up across the country in recent months, often centered around smaller banks. Confidence in these institutions has waned since May, when regulators seized control of a lender in Inner Mongolia and imposed losses on some creditors. Authorities have since intervened to quell at least two bank runs and orchestrated bailouts for two other lenders.
In its annual Financial Stability Report released this week, China’s central bank described 586 of the country’s almost 4,400 lenders as “high risk,” slightly more than last year. It also highlighted the dangers associated with rising consumer leverage, saying household debt as a percentage of disposable income jumped to 99.9% in 2018 from 93.4% a year earlier.
The PBOC and other regulators have long warned about the risks of excessive corporate debt, which climbed to a record 165% of gross domestic product in 2018, according to Bloomberg Economics.
For now, investors appear to be betting that policy makers can manage the country’s financial risks and keep the economy afloat.
The government’s sale of $6 billion in sovereign dollar debt this week was oversubscribed, while volatility in the Chinese stock market has dropped to the lowest level since early 2018, in part due to optimism over the prospects for a trade deal with the U.S. Yield spreads on the short-term debt of lower-rated Chinese banks relative to AAA peers have narrowed in recent months, a sign that smaller lenders are finding it easier to secure funding.
The central bank and other regulators have said they are forcing troubled banks to increase capital, cut bad loans, limit dividends and replace management. They have also floated a sweeping package of measures that would encourage mergers among smaller institutions and enlist local governments to support them.
On Thursday, China’s Financial Stability and Development Committee, chaired by Vice Premier Liu He, called for more ways to beef up capital strength at smaller banks and set up a long-term mechanism to prevent and resolve risks. Earlier this week, China’s top securities regulator said more efforts should be made in protecting shareholders, especially retail investors, while actively guarding against liquidity and credit risks in the capital markets.
In one sign that authorities may be growing more concerned about downside risks to the economy, China’s finance ministry said on Wednesday that it had ordered local governments to speed up the issuance of debt earmarked for infrastructure projects.
The move put a fresh spotlight on the policy dilemma facing China’s leaders: While such support measures may help bolster economic and financial stability in the short term, the risk is that they leads to even bigger debt problems down the line.
Authorities have been trying “to bring discipline into the market, but every time that happens, the consequences become frightening so they back away,” said Michael Pettis, a finance professor at Peking University. “The longer you take to solve it, the more distorted the market becomes and the more painful the resolution becomes.”

October prices dropped 1.3% in one of the world's least affordable property markets compared with a revised fall of 1.7% in September, government data showed on Friday.
""Looking at the social and market situation, the price index will continue to decline in November and December,"" said Thomas Lam, executive director of property consultancy Knight Frank.
He added that low interest rates would provide some support.
The property sector has been relatively resilient compared with the tourism and retail sectors which have been hit badly by six months of often violent anti-government protests and the U.S.-China trade dispute. Hong Kong's home prices are still up 4.6% so far this year.
Aiming to support first-time home buyers, the government last month relaxed rules, allowing them to borrow as much as 90% of a home costing up to HK$8 million ($1 million).
That relaxation of the mortgage cap for first-time buyers as well as a lending rate cut helped restore purchasing power in the housing market in November, Knight Frank said this week.
Knight Frank also expects a planned vacancy tax will prompt developers to dispose of unsold stock at attractive prices for the remainder of 2019.
Realtor Centaline has estimated that sales in the secondary housing market in November will hit their highest level in six months, climbing 40% more than October.
Commercial property prices have also been disappointing for sellers. Although an auction this week saw a record amount paid for a Hong Kong property site, it was at the lower end of estimates.
Sun Hung Kai Properties Limited (HK:0016) won the auction for a commercial site above the high speed railway station that links the city to the mainland with its HK$42.2 billion ($5.4 billion) bid.
Property surveyors had given a range of HK$38 billion to HK$79 billion."

SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea's central bank left interest rates steady on Friday even as it trimmed growth and inflation projections, underlining a cautious view on the economy in the face of global risks and cementing market bets for more policy easing next year.
The Bank of Korea's policy board held the base rate steady at 1.25% having cut it twice in recent months, matching a unanimous prediction in a Reuters poll, but one of the seven board members voted for reduction.
The most liquid 3-year treasury bond futures extended gains after Governor Lee Ju-yeol's news conference, while local stock prices and currency showed a muted reaction.
""The (local) economy will continue to show a trend similar to the current pace until the middle of next year and then will likely begin improving,"" Lee told a news conference.
The central bank downgraded this year's economic growth forecast to 2.0% from the previous 2.2% and next year's to 2.3% from 2.5%. Inflation projection was also revised down to 0.4% for this year from the previous 0.7%.
""The governor said the momentum would be far from strong even when the economy begins recovering and that the recovery would start only from the middle of the next year,"" said Cho Yong-gu, economist at Shinyoung Securities.
Cho said these cautious views underscored the high chances of a further rate cut in 2020, adding he was changing his forecast to a further cut in the rate next year from no change.
While predicting the rate would be left unchanged on Friday, 11 out of the 14 economists in the Reuters survey saw a cut in the rate next year to 1.0% or lower, which would be the lowest since it adopted the current policy system in 1999.
Heavily dependent on exports of computer chips, smartphones, cars and ships, Asia's fourth-largest economy is headed for the worst growth in a decade even after two rate cuts and a big increase in government budget spending.
The central bank cut the policy rate in July and October by 25 basis points each time, but the bank had been given little chance of making another cut so soon as two of the seven policy board members had voted to keep it unchanged in October.
Earlier this month, the country's most influential government think-tank called on the BOK to cut interest rates further while slashing its economic growth forecasts for this and next year to 2.0% and 2.3%, respectively.
Despite some signs of manufacturing activity beginning to stabilize and optimism that the U.S.-China trade war would soon end, analysts said South Korea's economy would still require further policy support to build a solid recovery.
""We think that BOK’s easing cycle has further to run,"" Alex Holmes, Asia economist at Capital Economics, said in a note.
""We expect the global economy to struggle for momentum over the coming quarters and that export demand will stay subdued."""

Japanese industrial production fell more than expected in October, signaling the possibility of a steeper contraction in economic growth ahead and boosting the case for a bigger government stimulus package.
The global slowdown, a sales tax hike and a super typhoon contributed to a 4.2% slide in factory output from a month earlier, matching the worst drop in the last five-and-a-half years and falling more than twice as much as economists forecast, data from the economy ministry showed Friday.
Japan Eyes Big Fiscal Stimulus With Little Concern Over Debt
The steep drop, following declines in retail sales and exports, comes as the government mulls stimulus measures to help the economy cope with the typhoon damage, weak external demand and the hit to consumers from the tax increase.
More fiscal stimulus would be good news for the Bank of Japan, which has appeared reluctant to ramp up its own massive stimulus program, as it strains at the limits of effectiveness.
Key Insights
Economists have been surprised at the extent to which October’s super storm has hurt economic indicators. But weak production forecasts for the rest of the quarter suggest a weaker underlying trend following October’s 2 percentage point tax increase in the sales tax.“We must be ready for a big contraction this quarter,” said Yoshiki Shinke, chief economist at Dai-Ichi Life Research Institute. “It won’t be a surprise if growth is worse than the market consensus.”Economists have forecast GDP will shrink 2.7% this quarter -- much less than the 7.3% contraction that followed a previous tax hike in 2014, thanks to tax breaks designed to support spending.“Factories cut back on production after the sales tax and the typhoon also had an impact,” said Takeshi Minami, chief economist at Norinchukin Research Institute. “This makes it easier to call for a large stimulus package.”What Bloomberg’s Economist Says...
“Our basic view is that Japan’s growth would slow as a result of weakening external demand pressuring exports. This is playing out, but the trajectory is a little weaker than anticipated. All this adds up to a greater need for fiscal support, given the Bank of Japan’s hands look mostly tied.”

84,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 28, 2019 08:50PM ET</span>",Japan's factory output posts largest fall in almost two years,"By Daniel Leussink
TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's industrial output slipped at the fastest pace since early last year in October, exposing widening cracks in the economy which faces a decline in domestic and foreign demand.
Factory output fell 4.2% in October from the previous month, trade ministry data showed on Friday, below the median market forecast for a 2.1% fall and swinging from a 1.7% rise the previous month.
That matched a similar decline in January last year.
Manufacturers surveyed by the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry expect output to decline 1.5% in November and rise 1.1% in December, the data showed.
Production was pushed down by a decrease in output of passenger cars and car engines, as well as general purpose and production machinery, the data showed.
The decline in autos production has raised concerns that the government's sales tax hike last month will have a more sustained impact on demand for cars and car parts.
""It is increasingly likely that there will be negative growth (in the fourth quarter),"" said Takeshi Minami, chief economist at Norinchukin Research Institute.
""Domestic demand is growing worse,"" he said, adding that there appears to be a strong hit from the sales tax, which was raised to 10% from 8%.
The weak reading follows other gloomy data released this week that may further fuel calls on the government to craft a large stimulus package to keep the country's economic recovery intact.
Official data on Thursday showed retail sales plunged at their fastest pace since early 2015 in October following the twice-postponed tax hike, boding ill for domestic demand.
The hit to consumption from the tax hike was also exacerbated by a powerful typhoon that swept across eastern and central Japan last month.
A government official said output was negatively impacted by temporary shutdowns of factories due to the typhoon and slowing production of big-ticket items following the tax hike.
A silver lining in the data came from a 0.9% increase on the previous month in electronic parts and devices, which also saw inventories rise 8.8%, suggesting firms may be preparing for an upturn in the IT cycle, although production in this sector tends to be volatile.
Minami at Norinchukin Research Institute said that it is too early to say whether a sustained pickup in electronic parts' production will spread to the broader economy even as Asia-bound exports of such parts increase.
However, factory activity and the broader economy are likely to remain under pressure as weak manufacturers' confidence, soft retail consumption and a delayed pickup in global growth hit demand.
Japan's decision to implement the sales tax hike is seen as a crucial to repairing the industrial world's largest public debt, which is more than twice the size of its $5 trillion economy. 
But under the Bank of Japan's current accommodative monetary policy, lawmakers could also step up calls for increased fiscal spending with financing costs extremely low.
Meanwhile, Japan's jobless rate and jobs-to-applicants ratio held steady in October, separate official data showed on Friday, suggesting the nation's tightest jobs market in decades is holding up. 
The seasonally adjusted unemployment rate was steady at 2.4%, matching economists' median forecast, figures from the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications showed.

The jobs-to-applicants ratio held steady at 1.57 in October from the previous month, health ministry data showed.

The survey looked in line with other indicators that have painted a subdued picture of the British economy, although a seasonally adjusted version of the GfK survey published by the European Commission on Thursday showed a small rise.
""In the face of Brexit and election uncertainty, consumers are clearly in a 'wait-and-see' mode,"" Joe Staton, client strategy director at GfK, said.

The Commission's monthly survey showed economic sentiment in the 19 countries sharing the euro rose to 101.3 points this month from 100.8 in October, beating Reuters consensus estimates of a rise to 101.0.
Sentiment in the services sector, which is responsible for some two thirds of euro zone gross domestic product, rose to 9.3 from 9.0 in October while the mood in industry improved to -9.2 this month from -9.5.
Sentiment among consumers rose to -7.2 from -7.6 and in retail trade to -0.2 from -0.9.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's retail sales tumbled at their fastest pace in more than 4-1/2 years in October as a sales tax hike prompted consumers to cut spending, raising a red flag over the strength of domestic demand.
The Japanese government increased the nationwide sales tax to 10% from 8% on Oct. 1, in a bid to fix the industrial world's heaviest public debt burden, which is more twice the size the country's gross domestic product.
However, some analysts have warned the tax hike, previously postponed twice, could leave the economy without a growth driver amid a slump in exports and production.
Retail sales fell 7.1% in October from a year earlier, pulled down by weak demand for big ticket items such as cars and household appliances as well as clothing, trade ministry data showed on Thursday. The data showed department store sales were hit particularly hard.
The drop marked the biggest since a 9.7% fall in March 2015 and was worse than a 4.4% decline predicted by economists in a Reuters poll.
It was also sharper than the declines reported after the last two times the sales tax was raised, suggesting other factors might be dragging on consumption.
""Retail sales fell more sharply in October than after previous sales tax hikes,"" said Tom Learmouth, Japan economist at Capital Economics.
""The fall in sales was slightly larger than the 13.7% m/m plunge which followed both the 1997 and 2014 sales tax hikes,"" he wrote in a note. Sales fell 4.3% in April 2014, the month of the previous tax hike.
Seasonally-adjusted retail sales dropped 14.4% month-on-month in October, the data showed.
The negative reading comes after separate data this month showed Japan's economy nearly stalled in the third quarter, while exports in October shrank at their fastest pace in three years.
The gloomy conditions have led to calls for the government to compile a big spending package to keep the country's fragile economic recovery on track.
(For an interactive graphic on Japan's retail sales, click: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/editorcharts/JAPAN-ECONOMY-RETAIL/0H001QXM89NP/index.html)
Some analysts have said retail sales in October have been particularly weak due to poor weather, after a huge typhoon tore through central and eastern Japan, exacerbating the negative effect from the sales tax hike.
The previous tax hike to 8% from 5% in 2014 hit the broader economy hard as households tightened their purse strings after front-loading purchases before the hike.
But policymakers have said that the tax hike last month has not triggered such a big swing in demand, given the smaller extent of the hike and various government measures to help offset the hit to spending."

CBI surveys have regularly painted a downbeat picture of Britain's economy as businesses face political uncertainty created by Brexit and, more recently, a national election on Dec. 12.
""The current economic climate is holding back UK services firms, which are reporting falling sentiment, declining volumes and weaker profitability. Neither is the outlook expected to improve,"" CBI chief economist Rain Newton-Smith said.
The professional and business services profitability gauge held at August's level of -25, the lowest since November 2011, while plans to invest in vehicles, plant and machinery were the weakest since 2010.
Overall optimism for consumer services firms fell again albeit at a slightly slower pace of -25 in November compared with -28 in August, while for business and professional services companies it picked up to -20 from -31.
Britain's services sector accounts for about 80% of the economy which grew by 1.0% year-on-year in the third quarter of 2019, the weakest since early 2010, official figures showed earlier this month.
The services sector grew 1.4%, but depended more on government spending than at any time since early 2013.

""The shortage of workers spanned most industries and skill levels, and some contacts noted that their inability to fill vacancies was constraining business growth,"" the Fed's Beige Book report said. ""Moderate wage growth continued across most Districts. Wage pressures intensified for low-skill positions.""
Inflation, meanwhile, continued at a modest pace, as companies' abilities to raise prices to cover higher costs, partly due to tariffs on Chinese imported goods, has been somewhat limited.
A few districts said, however, ""that companies affected by the tariffs were more inclined to pass on cost increases,"" the report showed.
The Beige Book is an anecdotal look at the economy, compiled by staff at the 12 Federal Reserve banks around the country. It is published eight times a year in advance of the next meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee, the Fed's rate-making body. The next FOMC meeting is scheduled for Dec. 10-11.
Most of the 12 Fed districts reported moderate of modest growth. The weakest districts appeared to be the Midwest, hit by weak performances in agriculture, and the Southwest, dominated by the energy sector and exposed to falling oil prices.

91,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 27, 2019 01:10PM ET</span>",U.S. economy picks up in third-quarter; data surprise on the upside,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. economic growth picked up slightly in the third quarter, rather than slowing as initially reported, and there are signs the downturn in business investment may be drawing to a close. 
The modest firming in growth reported on Wednesday by the government came alongside data showing the number of Americans filing claims for unemployment benefits dropped last week after standing at a five-month high for two straight weeks. Labor market strength should continue to support consumer spending, which appears to be slowing.
Collectively those reports and others are painting a more upbeat picture of an American economy, now in a record 11th year of expansion, that has had to overcome speed bumps from President Donald Trump's trade war with China and the ebbing tailwinds from last year's Republican tax cuts. Economists boosted their estimates for growth in the current quarter as well.
The upswing in the data would appear to validate the optimistic tone struck earlier this week by Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, who said ""at this point in the long expansion, I see the glass as much more than half full."" 
The U.S. central bank last month cut interest rates for the third time this year and signaled a pause in the easing cycle that started in July when it reduced borrowing costs for the first time since 2008.
""Fourth-quarter growth is looking better,"" said Michael Feroli, an economist at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) in New York.
Gross domestic product increased at a 2.1% annualized rate, the Commerce Department said in its second estimate of third-quarter GDP. That was up from the 1.9% pace it estimated last month. The economy grew at a 2.0% pace in the April-June period.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast third-quarter GDP growth would be unrevised at 1.9%. 
The upward revision to GDP reflected more inventory accumulation than initially thought. Inventories rose at a $79.8 billion pace instead of the $69.0 billion rate reported last month. The inventory build, which economists attributed to the waxing and waning trade tensions between the United States and China, contributed to growth instead of being a drag.
Even discounting the inventory lift, the economy was healthy last quarter. 
When measured from the income side, the economy grew at a 2.4% rate in the last quarter. Gross domestic income (GDI) increased at a rate of 0.9% in the second quarter. The income side of the growth ledger accelerated despite a drop in profits.
Second-quarter GDI growth was revised down by 0.9 percentage point, with growth in wages and sales during that period slashed by $46.7 billion to $62.1 billion. 
After-tax profits without inventory valuation and capital consumption adjustment, which corresponds to S&P 500 profits, decreased $11.3 billion, or at a rate of 0.6%, as they were held down by legal settlements with Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL). Profits increased at a 3.3% rate in the second quarter.
The average of GDP and GDI, also referred to as gross domestic output and considered a better measure of economic activity, increased at a 2.3% rate in the July-September period, quickening from a 1.4% growth pace in the second quarter.
The Atlanta Fed raised its fourth-quarter GDP growth estimate to a 1.7% rate from only a 0.4% pace. Despite the upbeat growth data, inflation remains muted, which could trouble some Fed officials. 
The Fed's preferred inflation measure, the core personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index excluding food and energy, increased 1.6% in the 12 months through October. The so-called core PCE price index rose 1.7% in September and has undershot its 2% target this year.
The dollar firmed against a basket of currencies, while U.S. Treasury prices fell. Stocks on Wall Street stocks rose, with the main indexes touching record highs.
GREEN SHOOTS
Though growth has been relatively strong, economists did not expect the economy to achieve the Trump administration's 3.0% this year. The economy grew 2.6% in the first half.
""There isn't a lot of oomph here to power the economy forward at anywhere near the Trump economics team's prediction of 3 percent,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist MUFG in New York. ""There are some green shoots, however, that bode well for the economy in the months ahead.""
The White House's 16-month trade war with China and the fading stimulus from last year's $1.5 trillion tax cut package are restraining the economy. But there was good news for business investment, which has borne the brunt of the trade war.
In a second report on Wednesday, from the Commerce Department said orders for non-defense capital goods excluding aircraft, a closely watched proxy for business spending plans, surged 1.2% last month, the largest gain since January, after falling 0.5% in September. 
These so-called core capital goods orders were boosted by increased demand for machinery, computers and electronic products, and fabricated metals. Shipments of core capital goods increased 0.8% last month. Core capital goods shipments are used to calculate equipment spending in the GDP measurement.
Business investment dropped at a 2.7% rate in the third quarter, rather than contracting at a 3.0% pace as previously reported. This was because the decline in spending on nonresidential structures such as mining exploration, shafts and wells, was not as steep as previously estimated. 
A third report from the Labor Department showed initial claims for state unemployment benefits declined 15,000 to a seasonally adjusted 213,000 for the week ended Nov. 23, raising concerns of some easing in the labor market.
With the labor market on solid footing, consumer spending remains supported. 
In a fourth report, the Commerce Department said consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, increased 0.3% last month as households spent more on electricity and gas, offsetting a drop in new motor vehicle purchases. Spending gained 0.2% in September.
When adjusted for inflation, consumer spending nudged up 0.1% in October after gaining 0.2% in September. That suggests some moderation in consumer spending after it grew at a 2.9% rate in the third quarter. 

""We are in store for a moderation in the pace of consumer spending, not a collapse,"" said Tim Quinlan, an economist at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) Securities in Charlotte, North Carolina.

The Commerce Department said on Wednesday consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, increased 0.3% last month as households spent more on electricity and gas, offseting a drop in new motor vehicle purchases.
Consumer spending rose by an unrevised 0.2% in September. Last month's increase in consumer spending was in line with economists' expectations.
The gain in consumer spending together with signs of stabilization in business investment supports economists' expectations that the economy will continue to grow around its potential, which they estimate at between 1.7% and 2.0%.
The economy grew at a 2.1% annualized pace in the third quarter. Though growth has slowed from a 3.1% rate in the first quarter, the risks of a recession in the near term have subsided as trade tensions between the United States and China have eased and the housing market has rebounded from last year's soft patch, driven by lower mortgage rates.
The Federal Reserve last month cut interest rates for the third time this year and signaled a pause in the easing cycle that started in July when it reduced borrowing costs for the first time since 2008.
With consumer spending rising moderately, inflation remained benign in October. Consumer prices as measured by the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index rose 0.2% last month, lifted by food, energy goods and services prices. The PCE price index was unchanged in August and September.
In the 12 months through October, the PCE price index increased 1.3%, matching September's gain.
Excluding the volatile food and energy components, the PCE price index edged up 0.1% last month after being unchanged in September. That lowered the annual increase in the so-called core PCE price index to 1.6% in October from 1.7% in September.
The core PCE index is the Fed's preferred inflation measure, and had undershot the U.S. central bank's 2% target this year.
When adjusted for inflation, consumer spending nudged up 0.1% in October after gaining 0.2% in September.
Personal incomes were unchanged in October, held back by declines in interest income and farm proprietors' income. Income rose 0.3% in the prior month when it was driven by an increase in farm proprietors' income related to payments to farmers caught in the U.S.-China trade war.
Wages increased 0.4% in October after climbing 0.1% in September. Wages were boosted by a $7.2 billion adjustment to account for General Motors (NYSE:GM) strike pay and payments associated with a new contract for members of the United Automobile Workers union.
With spending outpacing income growth, savings fell to $1.29 trillion from $1.34 trillion in September."

There are signs the economy slowed early in the fourth quarter amid a cooling in consumer spending and a deepening downturn in business investment.
The Trump administration's trade war with China has eroded business confidence, contributing to the second straight quarterly contraction in business investment. The fading stimulus from last year's $1.5 trillion tax cut package is also sapping momentum from the expansion, now in its 11th year.
Growth has slowed from the 3.1% rate notched in the first three months of the year. But the risks of a recession in the near term have subsided as the housing market has rebounded from last year's soft patch, driven by lower mortgage rates.

(Bloomberg) --
Bookings for commercial equipment excluding aircraft -- a proxy for business investment -- rose 1.2% following two straight declines, while shipments advanced 0.8%, according to the Commerce Department. Those were both the largest gains since January and compared with analyst projections for declines.
Other government data on Wednesday showed that gross domestic product expanded an annualized 2.1% in the third quarter, better than the initially reported 1.9% and the prior period's 2%, while weekly filings for unemployment benefits fell by the most since May.
While the GDP figure suggests the economy is a bit healthier than thought, the revision largely reflected more inventory accumulation, and economists project moderation in fourth-quarter growth. In addition, jobless claims tend to be volatile around the year-end holidays, partly because of difficulties adjusting for seasonal swings.
Consumers were the economy’s torch-bearer last quarter, with modest help from residential construction, while U.S. companies trimmed capital spending budgets in response to weaker global demand exacerbated by the U.S.-China trade war. A report later Wednesday morning is forecast to show inflation-adjusted household spending was little changed at the start of the fourth quarter and ahead of the all-important holiday-shopping season.
So far, consumers have benefited from a still-solid job market. The Labor Department said applications for unemployment benefits fell by 15,000 last week to a three-week low of 213,000, following a five-month high the prior week. The median estimate of economists was for a drop to 221,000.
Federal Reserve officials decided at each of their last three policy meetings to reduce the benchmark lending rate target as a way of insuring the economy against a broader slowdown that threatens to extend beyond the pullback in capital spending. Policy makers have indicated they will hold rates steady for some time unless there's a significant shift in the outlook.
Corporate Profits
The GDP report included the government’s first read on corporate earnings for the quarter. Pre-tax profits increased 0.2% from the prior three months and fell 0.8% from a year ago. That reflected a $6 billion reduction from legal settlements with Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL), according to the Commerce Department. Even excluding that effect, though, the pace of earnings increases was still relatively modest.
Inventory investment added 0.17 percentage point to the pace of GDP growth in the third quarter, according to the data, revised from an initially reported drag of 0.05 point.
Business fixed investment in equipment, structures and software decreased an annualized 2.7% in the third quarter, revised from an initially estimated decline of 3%. Nonresidential investment subtracted 0.36 percentage point from growth, the most since the final three months of 2015.
While the Commerce Department’s durable goods report showed a monthly increase in shipments of non-military capital goods excluding aircraft, used in the calculation of GDP, orders were down slightly on a year-over-year basis. The outlook for investment will probably depend on a resolution to U.S.-China trade tensions and whether export markets begin to recover.
The broader gauge of orders for all durable goods climbed 0.6% in October, compared with estimates for a 0.9% drop. Bookings excluding transportation equipment also increased 0.6%.
Consumer Spending
Personal consumption was the economy’s bright spot in the third quarter, climbing at an annualized 2.9% rate, unrevised from the initial estimate, which followed a 4.6% surge in the previous three months. Considering the uncertainty over business spending, the economy’s performance in the fourth quarter will likely again be determined by the pace of consumer outlays.
An uninspiring advance in October retail sales showed spending got off to a modest start in the fourth quarter. Purchases of merchandise account for about a third of all consumer spending, while services make up the rest.
In addition to the consumer spending figures, Wednesday will also see the release of October data on pending home sales, as well as the Fed's anecdotal Beige Book survey of business conditions across the central bank's 12 regions.

99,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 27, 2019 03:44AM ET</span>",China's industrial profits post steepest fall in eight months,"BEIJING (Reuters) - Profits at China's industrial firms shrank at their fastest pace in eight months in October, tracking sustained drops in producer prices and exports and underscoring slowing momentum in the world's second-largest economy.
Industrial profits fell 9.9% in October year-on-year to 427.56 billion yuan ($60.74 billion), data released by the National Bureau of Statistics showed on Wednesday, marking the biggest drop since January-February period and compared with a 5.3% decline in September.
China's industrial sector has been under pressure in recent months as slowing demand at home and the fallout from the Sino-U.S. trade dispute undercut earnings.
""The big drop in October profits suggests the real economy is still facing plenty of difficulties,"" said Nie Wen, economist at Shanghai-based Hwabao Trust, adding that the country's industrial firms now face a double whammy of falling prices and higher funding costs. 
""Profit growth is expected to stay negative for a period of time in the future, likely prompting authorities to unveil more growth-boosting measures in a gradual and restrained way.""
Profit declines for the manufacturing sector deepened in October, as margins contracted by 4.9% in the January-October period, compared with a 3.9% drop in the first nine months of the year. Meanwhile, mining sector profit growth also moderated. 
For January-October, industrial firms' profits fell 2.9% from a year earlier to 5.02 trillion yuan, compared with a 2.1% decline in January September. 
China's producer price index, seen as key indicator of corporate profitability, posted its sharpest fall in more than three years in October as prices for raw materials weakened. The country's official manufacturing PM also showed a contraction in activity for the sixth straight month in September with new export orders falling for their 17th straight month.
China's exports fell in annual terms for the third straight in October, albeit at a slower-than-expected rate. 
Despite recent signs of progress in trade negotiations, there is growing uncertainty about whether Beijing and Washington can reach an agreement that would put off another U.S. tariff hike on Chinese goods scheduled to take effect on Dec 15.
""We expect industrial profit growth to remain sluggish, given the deteriorating growth outlook and elevated uncertainty amid the U.S.-China trade conflict,"" said Nomura analysts in a note to clients after the data release.
With growth at near 30-year lows, China's central bank has recently lowered some of its key lending rates while its governor has pledged to step up credit support and lower funding costs to help those parts of the economy that have struggled with financing.
China's central bank warned on Monday of increasing downside risks for the economy as growth continues to falter despite various fiscal and monetary stimulus introduced this year.
A Reuters poll of analysts tipped China's growth to slip to a near 30-year low of 6.2% this year and then ease further to 5.9% in 2020, underlining the challenges faced by Beijing. 
Industrial firms' liabilities increased 4.9% from a year earlier to 66.74 trillion yuan at end-October, compared with a 5.4% increase at end-September.
Private sector profits rose 5.3% in January-October, slowing from 5.4% for January-September.

The data covers firms with more than 20 million yuan in annual revenue from their main operations.

Profits at Chinese industrial firms dropped 9.9% from a year ago, the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) reported. It was biggest fall since 2011 and the third consecutive month of fall in profit. 
Slowing demand at home and the fallout from the Sino-U.S. trade dispute undercut earnings were cited as the catalyst for the fall. While U.S. President Donald Trump and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping both expressed a desire to sign a “phase one” trade deal, reports have suggested that the signing of the deal might be delayed till next year. 
“Fall in profits was mainly attributable to an expanding decrease in producer prices for manufactured goods, slower production and sales growth,” said Zhu Hong, NBS senior statistician. 
Chinese stocks were mixed following the release of the data, while the Australian dollar fell.

101,By Bloomberg,"<span>Nov 26, 2019 10:04PM ET</span>","China’s Economy Slows for 7th Month, Early Indicators Show","(Bloomberg) -- The earliest-available indicators of China’s economic performance point to a continued slowdown in November.
Economic growth was already the slowest in almost three decades in the third quarter, and Bloomberg Economics’ gauge aggregating the earliest data from financial markets and businesses shows that continuing, with a worsening picture for trade, sales manager sentiment, and factory prices.
While tensions with the U.S. have eased since the two sides announced talks toward a so-called “phase one” deal last month, a leading indicator for trade flows in Asia, South Korean exports, still contracted almost 10% in the first 20 days of November. That’s an improvement from September’s worst result in a decade, but it indicates that high-technology trade across the region is still struggling as the Christmas shopping season approaches.
Profits at Chinese industrial firms fell the most on record in October, dropping 9.9% from a year ago, data from the National Bureau of Statistics showed Wednesday. The decline in prices at the factory gate is one of the factors undercutting those profits and is expected to continue in November, according to a Bloomberg tracker of producer prices.
The falling prices indicates domestic demand is weak. If those deflationary effects continue it will further hurt corporate profits at home and eventually drag down prices and profits overseas as well.
Sales managers at Chinese companies reported the worst conditions on record, with the headline index and sub-indexes for manufacturing and services all below the 50 level that separates growth from contraction. Business confidence was at a 14-month low, and all the gauges for manufacturing dropped from recent months, suggesting widespread problems, according to World Economics, which compiles the data.
What Bloomberg’s Economists Say..
“Given weak global demand and uncertainties over trade talk, China’s growth has to rely more on domestic demand. However, worryingly, China’s factory deflation continued and deepened for the fifth month.”
Qian Wan, Bloomberg Economics
Yet there is some optimism among the parts of the economy most exposed to the global economy. Export-focused firms were more upbeat in a  Standard Chartered  (LON:STAN) Plc survey of smaller businesses.
“Production activity accelerated as external demand rebounded” while the new orders sub-index for domestically focused smaller companies weakened, Hunter Chan and Ding Shuang from Standard Chartered wrote in the report. “The manufacturing sector outperformed, its performance index rising to a seven-month high, while that of the services sector dropped.”
Iron ore prices have risen recently on optimism for domestic demand next year, with prices of steel rebar, which is used in construction, surging to their highest since May.

102,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 26, 2019 01:09PM ET</span>",U.S. consumer confidence ebbing; housing market firming,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. consumer confidence fell for a fourth straight month in November amid worries about current business conditions and employment prospects, but remained at levels sufficient to support a steady pace of consumer spending.
Another report on Tuesday showed an unexpected drop in new home sales last month, but data for September was revised higher to show purchases hitting their highest level in over 12 years. The housing market, the most sensitive sector to interest rates, is catching up to the Federal Reserve's easy monetary policy stance, which has pushed down mortgage rates from last year's multi-year highs.
Though housing accounts for a fraction of gross domestic product, it has a bigger economic footprint. The rise in housing activity early in the fourth quarter together with a narrowing in the trade deficit suggest some support for the economy as it slows amid cooling consumer spending and persistent weakness in business investment and manufacturing.
The Trump administration's 16-month trade war with China has been largely blamed for the ebb in consumer confidence. The trade fight has also hammered business confidence, leading to a downturn in capital expenditure. 
Trade tensions between the two economic giants have eased in recent weeks, with President Donald Trump saying on Tuesday that Washington was in the ""final throes"" of a deal with Beijing. 
""The economy is growing, but it would take a politician to say it is in good, let alone great shape,"" said Joel Naroff, chief economist at Naroff Economic Advisors in Holland, Pennsylvania. 
The Conference Board said its consumer confidence index slipped to a reading of 125.5 this month from an upwardly revised 126.1 in October. The index was previously reported at 125.9 in September. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the index would climb to 127.0 in November. 
The survey's present situation measure, based on consumers' assessment of current business and labor market conditions, fell to 166.9 this month from 173.5 in October. But the expectations index drawn from consumers' short-term outlook for income, business and labor market conditions rose to a reading of 97.9 from 94.5 last month. 
Consumer confidence has retreated from a recent peak of 137.9 in October 2018. Still the index remains relatively high and is consistent with an economy growing at a moderate pace. Growth estimates for the fourth quarter are below a 2.0% annualized rate after a 1.9% pace in the third quarter.
The Conference Board survey's so-called labor market differential, derived from data on respondents' views on whether jobs are plentiful or hard to get, fell to 32.1 in November from 36.1 in October. That measure closely correlates to the unemployment rate in the Labor Department's employment report.
""This suggests on the margin some slowing in job gains going forward, but overall the labor market remains strong,"" said Kathy Bostjancic, chief U.S. financial economist at Oxford Economics in New York. 
The dollar was steady against a basket of currencies, while U.S. Treasury prices rose. Stocks on Wall Street were trading higher, with the three main indexes hitting all-time highs on rising hopes of a U.S.-China trade truce.
LOWER MORTGAGE RATES
In a separate report on Tuesday, the Commerce Department said new home sales dropped 0.7% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 733,000 units last month. 
September's sales pace was revised higher to 738,000 units, the highest since July 2007, from the previously reported 701,000 units. Economists had forecast new home sales, which account for about 11.3% of housing market sales, would increase 1.1% to a pace of 709,000 units in October. 
New home sales are drawn from permits and tend to be volatile on a month-to-month basis. Sales surged 31.6% from a year ago, concentrated in the $200,000-$400,000 price range. Homes priced below $200,000, the most sought after, accounted for only 9% of sales.
Reports last week showed housing starts surging and building permits vaulting to more than a 12-year high in October, and home resales advancing. The renewed strength in housing activity has been accompanied by a pickup in home prices. 
A third report on Tuesday showed the S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller 20-metro-area house price index increased 2.1% from a year ago in September after rising 2.0 % in August. Firming house price inflation was also corroborated by another report from the Federal Housing Finance Agency showing home prices advancing 5.1% in September from a year ago.
Residential investment rebounded in the third quarter after contracting for six straight quarters, the longest such stretch since the 2007-2009 recession.
""We think that real residential investment will increase again during the quarter, with the housing market continuing to benefit from the drop in mortgage rates relative to late last year,"" said Daniel Silver, an economist at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) in New York. 
But the housing market momentum could slow as mortgage rates have backed up in the last two months, partly driven by ebbing fears of a recession amid the thaw in U.S.-China trade relations.
The Fed last month cut rates for the third time this year and signaled a pause in the easing cycle that started in July when it reduced borrowing costs for the first time since 2008.
In another report, the Commerce Department said the goods trade deficit dropped 5.7% percent to $66.5 billion in October, driven by further declines in both exports and imports. 
The shrinking trade gap is positive for the calculation of GDP and suggests trade could support the economy in the fourth quarter. But the continued decline in both exports and imports is a worrying trend and suggests the White House's ""America First"" policy was reducing trade flows.

""Global trade volumes continue to plummet, suggesting global growth continues to weaken,"" said Chris Low, chief economist at FHN Financial in New York.

The S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller index of property values increased 2.1% from September 2018, higher than the median estimate of 2% in a Bloomberg survey of economists, data showed Tuesday. Prices rose 0.4% from the previous month. A separate report from the Federal Housing Finance Agency showed home prices advanced 0.6% in September from a month earlier, the most since January.
Key Insights
Home prices rose in September as lower mortgage rates and a solid labor market generated buyer interest in a market where supply remains lean. At the same time, price growth has slowed since early 2018, when year-over-year increases exceeded 6% and made homes less affordable.All 20 cities in the index, with the exception of San Francisco, showed annual gains, led by a 6% surge in Phoenix.Other data point to a healthier housing market. Sales of existing properties that make up the vast majority of transactions increased in October for the third time in four months. A report later this morning is projected to show a modest increase in new-home sales. Economists estimated a 0.3% gain in home prices from the prior month.Get More
Prices rose from the prior month in 17 cities, led by a 0.8% increase in Seattle and a 0.7% gain in Los Angeles. Home prices fell in San Francisco, Chicago and Boston.The FHFA’s data, derived from conforming mortgages, also showed that prices in the third quarter increased 1.11% from the previous three months, the smallest advance since the second quarter of 2014. Compared with the third quarter of last year, prices rose 4.9%, the smallest gain since the first quarter of 2015."
104,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 26, 2019 09:46AM ET</span>",U.S. goods trade deficit narrows sharply in October,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. goods trade deficit fell sharply in October as both exports and imports declined, pointing to a continued reduction in trade flows that has been blamed on the Trump administration' ""America First"" policy.
The Commerce Department said on Tuesday the goods trade gap dropped 5.7% percent to $66.5 billion last month.
Exports fell 0.7% after decreasing 1.3% in September. Exports were depressed by a drop in shipments of foods and feeds, likely soybeans. Automobile exports also declined and were probably weighed down by a 40-day strike at General Motors (N:GM), which undercut motor vehicle production.
There were also decreases in exports of capital and consumer goods. Exports of industrial supplies, however, rose.
Goods imports tumbled 2.4% in October after falling 2.1% in the prior month, amid decreases in imports of industrial supplies, motor vehicles and consumer goods. Imports of capital goods rebounded modestly.
The shrinking trade gap is positive for the calculation of gross domestic product and suggests trade could support the economy in the fourth quarter as growth slows amid cooling consumer spending and persistent weakness in business investment.
But the continued decline in both exports and imports is a worrying trend. The White House's protectionist trade policy has left the United States embroiled in a trade war with China, and engaged tit-for-tat tariffs with other countries. The government argues that the tariffs are necessary to protect manufacturers from what it says is unfair foreign competition.
Trade subtracted 0.08 percentage point from GDP growth in the third quarter. The economy grew at a 1.9% annualized rate in the July-September quarter after expanding at a 2.0% pace in the second quarter. Growth estimates for the fourth quarter are below a 2.0% rate.
The Commerce Department also reported on Tuesday that retail inventories increased 0.3% in October after gaining 0.2% in the prior month. Motor vehicle and parts inventories dipped 0.1% after edging up 0.1% in September. They were likely restrained by the GM strike.
Retail inventories, excluding motor vehicles and parts, the component that goes into the calculation of gross domestic product jumped 0.6% after rising 0.2% in September.
Wholesale inventories rebounded 0.2% last month after declining 0.7% in September.
Data this month showed a modest rebound in retail sales in October and continued decline in production at factories. The economy is losing speed mainly because of the 16-month U.S.-China trade war. The fading stimulus from last year's $1.5 trillion tax cut package is also constraining growth."

MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexico's economy entered a mild recession during the first half of 2019 and was flat in the third quarter, revised data from the national statistics agency showed on Monday, handing a setback to the plans of President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador.
The updated figures showed the economy contracted by 0.1% quarter-on-quarter in seasonally-adjusted terms during both the first and second quarters of 2019 after also shrinking by the same margin in the last three months of last year.
A recession is usually defined by economists as two consecutive quarters of contraction in gross domestic product.
In a preliminary estimate published at the end of October, the agency reported that the economy grew by 0.1% from the previous quarter during the July-September period. However, that figure was revised down to show the economy stagnated.
Alberto Ramos, a Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) economist, said in a note to clients the bank now expected no growth to be registered in Mexico in 2019 after GDP advanced by 2% last year.
Next year, the economy should bounce back somewhat, expanding by 1.1%, lifted by several factors including a recovery in oil and gas output, stronger construction activity, wage gains and a pick-up in public sector spending, he said.
Investor confidence in Mexico, Latin America's second largest economy, has been shaken by a number of policy moves made by Lopez Obrador, an exponent of economic nationalism.
In particular, his decision to cancel a partly built, $13 billion airport for Mexico City and his retreat from the prior government's opening of the oil and gas industry to private capital have raised doubts about his economic management.
The veteran leftist took office in December 2018 pledging to ramp up growth to 4% per year. Instead the economy has slowed, and he has sought to deflect criticism by saying poorer parts of Mexico have benefited more from his policies.
The statistics agency's data showed that during the first nine months of 2019, Mexican GDP was unchanged in adjusted terms compared with the same period last year.
A breakdown of those figures showed that secondary activities, which include manufacturing, slipped 1.7% from the previous year during the January-September period.
Tertiary activities, which capture services, rose by 0.6%, while primary activities, which cover farming, fishing and mining, rose by 2.2%, the agency said.

In unadjusted terms, the economy shrank 0.3% from a year earlier during the third quarter, the data showed.

BERLIN (Reuters) - German business morale rose in November and Europe's largest economy is on track to grow by 0.2% in the fourth quarter as its domestic strength more than offsets a manufacturing recession, the Ifo economic institute said on Monday. 
Munich-based Ifo said its business climate index rose to 95.0 in November from 94.7 in October. The November reading was in line with a Reuters consensus forecast.
Europe's biggest economy is going through a soft patch as its export-oriented manufacturers battle with trade friction, a struggling car industry and uncertainties over Britain's planned departure from the European Union.
""The German economy is showing resilience,"" Ifo President Clemens Fuest said, adding that mainly consumer-driven domestic economic strength pointed to a ""very good Christmas"". But he added that manufacturing ""is still stuck in recession"".
The institute's chief economist, Klaus Wohlrabe, said it was too early to speak of a turnaround in the economy, which contracted in the second quarter before growing slightly in the third.
""Companies tell us that industrial order backlogs are still not satisfactory,"" Wohlrabe told Reuters.
Highlighting the challenges facing German manufacturers, carmaker Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) last week cut its forecasts for operating profit and sales growth due to a downturn in demand for passenger cars.
""It is fair to say that the very best of the party is over,"" Chief Financial Officer Frank Witter said.
Thomas Gitzel, economist at VP Bank, said the Ifo survey showed ""growth will not go into freefall for the time being"" but that Ifo's warning the manufacturing sector is stuck in recession was cause for concern. 
""It should be noted that developments in the manufacturing sector precede those in the services sector,"" Gitzel said. ""The dangers for the German economy have by no means been averted.""
Detailed data released on Friday showed strong exports, state spending and consumers helped the German economy avoid a recession in the third quarter. The figures confirmed a preliminary reading of a 0.1% expansion on the quarter.
Conservative Chancellor Angela Merkel's right-left coalition government has rejected calls from industry groups and economists for a stimulus package to put the economy firmly back on a growth trajectory.
In its 10th successive year of growth, the economy has been relying on strong consumption as exports weaken, which resulted in a second-quarter GDP contraction of 0.2%.
Economists have been urging the government to ditch its policy of incurring no new net debt, saying it should instead borrow to finance a stimulus package.

The government seems to be betting instead on an easing of trade frictions between the United States and both China and the EU to revive Germany's manufacturing sector.

October arrivals came to 177,426 tonnes, up from the previous month's 161,836 tonnes.
Pork imports for the first ten months of the year stood at 1.5 million tonnes, up 49.4% from the corresponding period a year earlier, data from the General Administration of Customs shows.
The data is for muscle cuts and does not include offal and other non-muscle parts known as 'variety meats'.
Deadly African swine fever has reduced the world's top pig herd by 41%, according to official data, after spreading throughout China and leaving many farmers unwilling to replenish their farms.
The slump in the herd pushed retail pork prices by late October up 148% from a year earlier, to almost 59 yuan ($8.38) per kg, causing food inflation to spike.
China has been opening up its market to new sources of meat, approving dozens of new pork processing plants in Brazil, Argentina and Britain in recent months to help alleviate its protein shortage.
It received its first cargo of Italian pork this week, customs said on its website, while Argentina shipped its first boatload of chilled pork to China.
In the United States, top processor Smithfield has transformed a slaughterhouse to ship pig carcasses to China.
Imports of beef, usually more expensive than pork, are also benefiting from the meat shortage, with October arrivals at 150,829 tonnes, up 63.2% on a year ago..
For the first ten months, beef imports were 1.28 million tonnes, a jump of 54.5% from a year ago, customs said. Beef shipments are also growing, thanks to rising demand from China's expanding middle class.
Chicken meat imports have also jumped, with October shipments at 66,921 tonnes, up 64% on the year."

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India's urban unemployment rate between January and March this year was 9.3%, the lowest in at least four quarters, according to an unpublished government report reviewed by Reuters.
The numbers, recorded in the statistics ministry's quarterly jobs report, could provide some relief to Prime Minister Narendra Modi who has faced criticism for not being able to create enough jobs amid slowing economic growth.
The urban unemployment rate of the January-March quarter compared with 9.9% in the preceding quarter. Quarterly data prior to the April-June 2018 survey period is not available and the January-March quarter's rate is the lowest since then.
The report, which is likely to be published soon, did not assess rural unemployment.
The estimates were arrived as using the so-called ""current weekly status"" method which gives an average picture of unemployment in a short period of seven days preceding the survey period, the document said. A person is considered as unemployed in a week if he did not work even for 1 hour during that week.
Joblessness among the youth - those aged between 15-29 years and who account for roughly over a third of India's 1.3 billion people - was also marginally lower at 22.5% in the quarter ending March 2019, from 23.7% in the preceding quarter."
110,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 22, 2019 09:58AM ET</span>",U.S. factory and services activity quicken in November: Markit,"(Reuters) - U.S. manufacturing output accelerated in November to its fastest pace in seven months and services activity also picked up more than expected, a survey of purchasing managers showed on Friday in a sign of the continued resilience of the U.S. economy in the face of the U.S.-China trade war and other headwinds.
IHS Markit said its ""flash"" purchasing managers index for manufacturing rose to 52.2 in November from a final reading of 51.3 in October, while its preliminary services PMI increased to 51.6 this month from 50.6 last month.
Both indexes were at their highest since April and were modestly above the median forecasts among economists polled by Reuters. A reading above 50 signals expansion, while one below that mark indicates a contraction in activity.
Markit's flash composite index, a blend of the two, rose to 51.9 from 50.9 in October and reaching its highest level since July.
The U.S. economy has slowed this year from 2018's brisk pace that had been fueled by $1.5 trillion in stimulus from tax cuts and spending. In the third quarter, the economy expanded at a 1.9% annualized rate, and some recent data suggest the pace has slowed further in the fourth quarter as businesses hold back on investment due to uncertainty spawned by U.S. President Donald Trump's trade war with China and weak demand from abroad.
The U.S. Federal Reserve has cut interest rates three times since July in a bid to prevent the economy, now in a record 11th straight year of expansion, from slipping into recession. No more rate cuts are expected in the near term, however.
The recent weakness has been most pronounced on the manufacturing side of the economy, while the vast services sector, fueled by near-record low unemployment and healthy consumer spending, has proven more resilient."

LONDON (Reuters) - Euro zone business growth has almost ground to a halt this month as a downturn in the manufacturing industry appears to be increasingly affecting the bloc's dominant services industry, a survey showed on Friday.
Worryingly for policymakers at the European Central Bank, who have so far failed to stoke demand and inflation, forward-looking indicators suggest the bloc's economy is on shaky ground.
New ECB President Christine Lagarde reaffirmed on Friday that the central bank would do its part by continuing to support the economy and respond to future risks while monitoring the side effects of its easy money policy.
The ECB has resumed its bond-buying program and is purchasing 20 billion euros' worth a month, and in September it lowered its deposit rate deeper into negative territory while keeping the door open to future reductions.
But so far those measures have not borne fruit.
IHS Markit's flash November composite Purchasing Managers' Index, seen as a reliable guide to economic health, slipped to 50.3 from October's 50.6, moving to within a whisker of the 50 mark separating growth from contraction.
That was below all expectations in a Reuters poll and was only just shy of a more than six-year low reading in September.
November's PMI points to GDP growth of 0.1% this quarter, IHS Markit said, slower than the 0.2% last quarter and the 0.2% prediction in a Reuters poll last week.
""It seems that growth is slowing to a snail's pace in the fourth quarter. The winter months will, therefore, be a nail biter for euro zone growth,"" said Bert Colijn at ING.
Still, strong exports and state and consumer spending helped the German economy avoid a recession in the third quarter, other data showed, although Europe's biggest economy is going through a soft patch.
Business conditions there continued to deteriorate in November, although more slowly than recently, but its PMI showed the mood was still gloomy.
""There are signs that Germany's industrial recession may have passed the worst. But this merely suggests that the pace of contraction is slowing,"" said Andrew Kenningham at Capital Economics.
In France, business activity picked up slightly this month, as the euro zone's second-biggest economy battles to keep growing while international trade disputes cloud the outlook.
Core European government bond yields edged lower after the PMI data but global stocks inched up, lifted by China's renewed offer to work out a trade pact with Washington.
DOWNBEAT
Giving little hope for a big revival, new business fell for a third month in the currency union. The sub-index was 49.7, albeit just above October's 49.6.
A PMI for the bloc's dominant service industry dropped to a 10-month low of 51.5 from 52.2. That was also below all expectations in a Reuters poll.
Manufacturers produced slightly more positive news, but their PMI showed activity contracted for a 10th month. The factory PMI rose to 46.6 from 45.9, above the median forecast for 46.4.
An index measuring output, which feeds into the composite PMI, rose to 47.1 from 46.6. That contraction was despite factories cutting the prices of their goods for a fifth month.
Once more, with demand falling a chunk of that production was derived from completing backlogs of work and factories again reduced headcount and cut back on purchases of raw materials.
Also probably of concern for policymakers, services firms likewise filled old orders faster than new ones came in and curtailed hiring, suggesting there won't be a turnaround anytime soon.
That meant optimism dwindled to its lowest since mid-2013. The services business expectations index dropped to 57.0 from 57.4."
112,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 22, 2019 04:06AM ET</span>","Germany dodges recession in third quarter thanks to exports, spending","By Joseph Nasr and Rene Wagner
BERLIN (Reuters) - Strong exports, state spending and consumers helped the German economy avoid a recession in the third quarter, detailed data showed on Friday, confirming a preliminary reading of a 0.1% expansion on the quarter.
The Federal Statistics Office said exports grew 1% in the quarter and net trade contributed 0.5 percentage points to the overall economic expansion.
Europe's biggest economy is going through a soft patch as its export-oriented manufacturers cope with trade friction, a struggling car industry and uncertainties over Britain's planned departure from the European Union.
Conservative Chancellor Angela Merkel's right-left coalition government has rejected calls from industry groups and economists for a stimulus package to put the economy firmly back on a growth trajectory.
In its 10th successive year of growth, the economy has been relying on strong consumption as exports weaken, which resulted in a second quarter GDP contraction of 0.2%.
""Particularly the strength of private consumption remains an important anti-recession insurance for the economy,"" Carsten Brzeski of ING wrote in a note. ""Private consumption has been growing consecutively every quarter since the start of 2014.""
'ON A KNIFE-EDGE'
The data showed that private consumption grew 0.4% and state spending by 0.8%, which translated into each segment contributing 0.2 percentage points to growth.
Acting on the program agreed between Merkel's conservatives and their Social Democrat coalition partners, the government has increased allowances for families, students and pensioners. This comes in addition to tax cuts and more spending on infrastructure.
Economists have been urging the government to ditch its policy of incurring no new net debt, saying it should instead borrow to finance a stimulus package.
The government seems to be betting on an easing of trade frictions between the United States and both China and the EU to revive Germany's manufacturing sector.
The data on Friday showed that despite growth in exports, investment in fixed assets and equipment had contracted in the third quarter, a sign that companies still have a negative outlook.
""The fall in investment in equipment and the burden of inventory reductions show that companies have reacted strongly to the global uncertainties and the problems facing the automotive industry,"" said Andreas Scheuerle of DekaBank.
In addition to trade conflicts and a slowing global economy, German carmakers are also burdened by a costly shift to electric vehicles and stricter emissions rules.
There have been signs that the slowdown in manufacturing is spreading to the services sector. IHS Markit's PMI surveys on Friday showed that activity in the sector has fallen to a 38-month low in November.
""In the coming quarters, the economy will remain on a knife-edge between a recession and small growth,"" said Thomas Gitzel of VP Bank Group."
113,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 22, 2019 01:37AM ET</span>","GDP revisions put China on target to double economy, but data doubts remain","BEIJING (Reuters) - China on Friday revised up its nominal 2018 gross domestic product (GDP) by 2.1% to 91.93 trillion yuan ($13.08 trillion), keeping it on track to achieving its goal of doubling the size of its economy by 2020 from 2010. 
However, with the economy growing at its weakest pace in nearly three decades, the revisions could fuel scepticism about the credibility of Chinese data with some analysts suspecting authorities may be massaging the numbers to achieve Beijing's ambitious targets.
In a statement, the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) said the change in the size of 2018 GDP will not significantly influence the calculation for the 2019 growth rate. 
Yet some analysts suggest the nominal nudge may actually not be so nominal after all. 
Despite ""NBS stressing that the current round of revisions is the result of the census uncovering previously unrecorded activity, it's hard to ignore the fact that it will also help them meet official growth targets,"" said Julian Evans-Pritchard, Senior China Economist at Capital Economics, in a note. 
In previous revisions real growth has almost always been revised upwards, he said. 
Indeed, growth of about 6.2% is seen needed for the whole of this year and the next to meet the Communist Party's longstanding goal of doubling GDP and incomes in the decade to 2020. 
Such a rate of expansion would be a stiff ask given the 6.0% GDP growth logged in the third quarter - the slowest pace since 1992 - and with many analysts tipping the pace to slip below 6% in 2020.
A slowdown in demand at home and abroad has weakened the world's second-biggest economy, in part with business investment and factory activity hit by a trade war with the United States. 
China routinely revises its annual GDP data. Days before GDP data for 2018 was released in January, the statistics bureau cut its final 2017 growth figure to 6.8% from 6.9%.
China's fourth National Economic Census, released on Wednesday, included ""richer"" data points that showed more business entities and a bigger total asset base in 2018 than assumed under earlier GDP estimates, Li Xiaochao, deputy head of the statistics bureau, told Reuters earlier this week.
Revisions to historical GDP figures will also be made, Li told reporters.
The services sector contributed more to GDP in 2018 than the original data had indicated, the statistic bureau said. Nominal GDP includes changes in prices due to inflation, so it is usually higher than adjusted, or real GDP. 
MASSAGING NUMBERS TO HIT TARGETS?
Analysts say that without further information from the NBS, it's hard to calculate the impact of the latest adjustments on the 2018's real GDP or the GDP growth rate for that year. 
But a rough estimate of an adjusted real GDP growth in 2018 might be 8.9%, compared to an original reading of 6.6%, said Chaoping Zhu, Global Market Strategist at J.P. Morgan Asset Management, in a note. 
The government's target range for 2019 growth is 6%-6.5%. The economy expanded 6.4% in the first quarter, 6.2% in the second and 6.0% in the third - the weakest pace since 1992. 
If the 2018 figure is revised up, the government might be more tolerant of an economic slowdown next year and set a lower growth goal in 2020, said Zhu.
As the deadline for doubling the size of the economy draws nearer, it's become increasingly clear that the target was ""too ambitious,"" said Evans-Pritchard. 
""Our research suggests that political pressure to meet growth targets has encouraged the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) to massage the GDP deflator in recent years.""
The GDP deflator is the ratio of nominal to real GDP. 
In an email to Reuters, Louis Kuijs, head of Asia economics at Oxford Economics, said he would not discount the possibility of the NBS massaging the data. However, an upward revision by the NBS is neither surprising nor unreasonable, he said, noting that newly included sectors in statistical coverage tend to grow quickly.
""Also, outside of China, revisions of the size of economies are almost always upwards,"" he said. 

A paper published by the U.S.-based Brookings Institution earlier this year said China had overestimated nominal and real growth rates by about 2 percentage points between 2008 and 2016.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's factory output and retail sales are expected to have slumped in October, a Reuters poll showed, as slowing global demand and a sales tax hike introduced in the month hurt exports and private consumption.
The slew of data is likely to underscore the fragile state of Japan's economic recovery and keep policymakers under pressure to unveil more measures to prop up growth.
Industrial production is expected to fall 2.1% in October after a 1.7% gain in September, a poll of 18 economists showed, as sluggish exports and the hit to domestic demand from the sales tax hike took a toll on factory activity.
""Given the pent-up demand that occurred in September ahead of the tax hike, a downturn in October is inevitable,"" said Takeshi Minami, chief economist at Norinchukin Research Institute.
A huge typhoon that caused heavy rain and flooding during the month also likely disrupted factory output, analysts say.
Separate data is expected to show that retail sales fell 4.4% in October from a year earlier after growing at the fastest pace in 5-1/2 years in September, when consumers rushed to buy big-ticket items to beat the sales tax hike. [nL3N27F00S]
Prime Minister Shinzo Abe proceeded with a twice-delayed sales tax hike in October to 10% from 8% as part of efforts to rein in Japan's huge public debt.
Some investors fret the higher levy may put more pressure on an economy that saw growth ground to a near standstill in the third quarter as the U.S.-China trade war knocked exports.[nL4N27S22T]
Private consumption grew 0.4% in July-September, slowing from a 0.6% increase in the previous quarter, despite stronger demand from households which sought to beat the October tax hike.
Heightening fears of recession have prompted calls from ruling party lawmakers for an extra budget including $92 billion in spending to revive growth. [nL3N280528]
The government will release the retail sales data at 8:50 a.m. Japan time on Nov. 28 (2350 GMT, Nov 27), while the industrial production data is set to be released a day later at the same time.
Data next week also includes the Tokyo consumer price index (CPI) for November, which likely rose 0.6% from a year earlier, according to the Reuters poll.

115,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 21, 2019 08:22PM ET</span>",Japan's consumer inflation stagnant despite tax hike boost,"By Leika Kihara
TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's annual core consumer inflation ticked up only marginally in October despite the boost from a sales tax hike during the month, suggesting weak household sentiment is keeping companies from passing on the higher costs.
The data underscores the challenge the Bank of Japan faces in firing up inflation to its elusive 2% target, as soft global demand and the U.S.-China trade war cloud the outlook for the export-reliant economy.
The nationwide core consumer price index (CPI), which includes oil costs but excludes volatile fresh food prices, rose 0.4% in October from a year earlier, government data showed on Friday.
That matched a median market forecast and followed a 0.3% increase in September.
Excluding the impact of the sales tax hike rolled out in October and the introduction of free child-care, annual core consumer inflation was 0.2% in October, slowing from 0.3% in September.
Yasunari Ueno, chief market economist at Mizuho Securities, expects inflation to stagnate and force the BOJ to maintain its ultra-loose monetary policy for a prolonged period, given weak services prices.
""It's nearly impossible for consumer inflation to sustainably hit 2% in Japan,"" he said.
Prime Minister Shinzo Abe proceeded with a twice-delayed sales tax hike in October to 10% from 8% as part of efforts to rein in Japan's huge public debt.
The boost from the tax increase was offset partly by the introduction of free child-care, which is aimed at easing the pain on households from the higher levy.
While rising labor and raw material costs pushed up the price of dining out, electricity bills pushed down CPI for the first time in nearly three years due to falling fuel costs, the data showed.
However, analysts said the data also showed the tax hike has so far not had the sort of negative impact on consumption that a similar hike in 2014 did in welcome news for policymakers.
""The muted rise in inflation in October supports our view that the recent sales tax hike won't derail consumer spending,"" said Marcel Thieliant, senior Japan economist at Capital Economics.

The Jibun Bank Flash Japan Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) edged up to a seasonally adjusted 48.6 from a final 48.4 in the previous month.
The index remained below the 50.0 threshold that separates contraction from expansion for a seventh month. If the final reading due early next month confirms the contraction, it will mark the longest such run since a nine-month stretch from June 2012 to February 2013.
Friday's PMI survey showed key activity gauges such as factory output and total new orders shrank again, though at a slower pace than in the previous month, while the backlog of work slipped to a level not seen since late 2012.
""Slack in export demand, the protracted U.S.-China trade war and limited policy levers stack up against the chances of an improvement in Japan's economy,"" said Joe Hayes, economist at IHS Markit, which compiles the survey.
""Without any drive from the service sector, a quarterly contraction in Q4 seems highly likely.""
Data last week showed Japan's economy ground to a near standstill in the third quarter with growth at its weakest in a year as the U.S.-China trade war and soft global demand knocked exports.
The PMI follows recent calls by Japan's ruling coalition lawmakers for an extra budget that would include $92 billion in spending to support slowing growth and ensure a fragile economic recovery remains on track.
Activity in the service sector grew, though the pace of expansion was markedly slower than during the first nine months of the year, before a sales tax hike to 10% from 8% came into effect last month.
The Jibun Bank Flash Japan Services PMI index edged up to a seasonally adjusted 50.4 from October's 49.7, partly thanks to an improvement in business expectations, which hit its highest since early 2018.
However, ""with manufacturing malaise still strikingly apparent, PMI-implied growth rates in the service sector are insufficient to offset Japan's industrial woes,"" IHS Markit's Hayes said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The number of Americans filing applications for unemployment benefits was unexpectedly unchanged at a five-month high last week, suggesting some softening in the labor market.
While other data on Thursday showed a mild pick-up in factory activity in the mid-Atlantic region this month, manufacturers reported a sharp slowdown in new orders, shipments and unfilled orders. 
There were also declines in factory employment and hours measures. The persistent weakness in manufacturing is despite an easing in tensions in the 16-month trade war between the United States and China, which has depressed capital expenditure.
The reports added to last week's downbeat October retail sales and manufacturing output data in suggesting the economy lost speed in the fourth quarter. Slower growth was underscored by the third straight monthly decline in a gauge of future economic activity in October. But the risks of a recession in the near term are low as the housing market is rebounding from last year's soft patch, driven by lower mortgage rates.
The Federal Reserve last month cut interest rates for the third time this year and signaled a pause in the easing cycle that started in July when it reduced borrowing costs for the first time since 2008. 
""This is no time for complacency, but it's not time to panic either,"" said Tim Quinlan, a senior economist at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) Securities in Charlotte, North Carolina. 
Initial claims for state unemployment benefits were flat at a seasonally adjusted 227,000 for the week ended Nov. 16, the highest level since June 22, the Labor Department said. Data for the prior week was revised to show 2,000 more claims received than previously reported.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast claims decreasing to 219,000 in the latest week. The four-week moving average of initial claims, considered a better measure of labor market trends as it irons out week-to-week volatility, rose 3,500 to 221,000 last week, the highest since June 29.
The claims data covered the week that the government surveyed establishments for the nonfarm payrolls component of November's employment report. The four-week average of claims rose 5,250 between the October and November survey weeks. 
While that would suggest little change in job gains this month, employment growth will be boosted by the return to payrolls of about 46,000 workers at General Motors (N:GM). The 40-day strike at the automaker's plants in Michigan and Kentucky helped to hold back payrolls gains to 128,000 jobs in October.
""This recent weakening in the claims data points to some deterioration in the labor market,"" said Daniel Silver, an economist at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) in New York. ""We expect effects of the recent United Automobile Workers strike to boost the November employment count after depressing the October data.""
The dollar was steady against a basket of currencies, while U.S. Treasury prices fell. Stocks on Wall Street were trading lower as a row between Washington and Beijing over protests in Hong Kong cast doubts on the timing of a trade deal.
WORKER SHORTAGES
Job growth has slowed this year, averaging 167,000 per month compared with an average monthly gain of 223,000 in 2018, in part because of the U.S.-China trade spat, ebbing demand and a shortage of workers.
Minutes of the Fed's Oct. 29-30 policy meeting published on Wednesday showed that while officials at the U.S. central bank viewed labor market conditions as remaining strong, they also acknowledged the slowdown in the pace of job gains.
Policymakers attributed the moderation in hiring to worker shortages and also viewed it as ""indicative of some cooling in labor demand,"" in line with recent declines in job vacancies.
Troubles for manufacturing, which accounts for 11% of the economy, have persisted into the fourth quarter. In a separate report on Thursday, the Philadelphia Fed said its business conditions index rose to 10.4 in November from 5.6 in October.
But the survey's measures of new orders, employment and shipments declined, pointing to underlying weakness in manufacturing in the region that covers eastern Pennsylvania, southern New Jersey and Delaware.
The Philadelphia Fed survey's six-month business conditions index rose to 35.8 this month from 33.8 in October. But its six-month capital expenditures index tumbled to 19.4 from a reading of 36.4 in the prior month
A survey from the New York Fed last Friday showed a drop in its business conditions index this month and manufacturers remained pessimistic about conditions over the next six months. 
Manufacturing is also being undercut by an inventory overhang, especially in the automobile sector, design problems at Boeing (N:BA) and slowing global growth. 
The Fed minutes on Wednesday showed policymakers believed conditions for manufacturing ""were unlikely to improve materially over the near term,"" citing ""continuing concerns about global growth and trade uncertainty.""
In a third report, the National Association of Realtors said existing home sales rose 1.9% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.46 million units in October. But gains are likely to be limited. The median existing house price surged 6.2% from a year ago to 270,900 in October, the biggest rise since June 2017. In addition, the stock of houses on the market fell.
""This is likely to be as good as it gets for existing home sales,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG in New York.
""Baby boomers are sitting on their properties and not downsizing or moving as much as earlier generations and this is likely to put the kibosh on any further improvement in existing home sales for this cycle.""

A fourth report from the Conference Board showed its Leading Economic Index dipped 0.1% in October after declining 0.2% in both September and August.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. home sales increased more than expected in October and house prices rose at the fastest pace in more than two years amid lower mortgage rates and a shortage of properties for sale.
The National Association of Realtors said on Thursday that existing home sales rose 1.9% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.46 million units last month. September's sales pace was downwardly revised to 5.36 million units.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast existing home sales rising 1.4% to 5.47 million units.
The U.S. Federal Reserve has cut interest rates three times this year, which has bolstered the housing market by lowering mortgage rates.
Last week, Fed Chair Jerome Powell reiterated that he and his colleagues see a ""sustained expansion"" ahead as likely for the country's economy, with the full impact of recent interest rate cuts still to be felt and low unemployment boosting household spending.
The central bank's reduction in borrowing costs has caused the 30-year fixed mortgage rate to drop more than 130 basis points since last November's peak to an average of 3.66%, according to data from mortgage finance agency Freddie Mac.
Other factors continue to weigh on housing though, including a chronic lack of properties for sale, which has inflated prices and kept many buyers on the sidelines.
There were 1.77 million homes in the market last month, a decline of 4.3% compared to a year ago.
In a more positive sign, data on Tuesday showed U.S. homebuilding rebounded in October and permits for future home construction jumped to a more than 12-year high.
The median existing house price climbed 6.2% from a year ago to 270,900 in October, the strongest price appreciation since June 2017. It was the 92nd consecutive month of year-on-year price gains.
""The lack of inventory is pushing up prices way too fast,"" said NAR Chief Economist Lawrence Yun.
Existing home sales rose 4.6% from one year ago, the NAR said, the fourth consecutive month of year-on-year gains. Sales were mixed across the nation's four regions last month. They increased 4.4% in the South and 1.6% in the Midwest but retreated 1.4% in the Northeast. They fell 0.9% in the West.
At October's sales pace, it would take 3.9 months to clear the current inventory, down from 4.3 months a year ago. A supply of six to seven months is seen as a healthy balance between supply and demand."

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain ran a much bigger budget deficit last month than expected, showing how public borrowing is already on the rise even before politicians implement any of the costly spending pledges they have made in the run-up to a Dec. 12 election.
Borrowing in October alone rose by a quarter compared with a year earlier to 11.2 billion pounds ($14.5 billion), the Office for National Statistics said, the highest for any October since 2014 and above all economists' forecasts in a Reuters poll.
Borrowing in the first seven months of the financial year is now higher than for all of 2018/19 at 46.3 billion pounds, and is 10% higher than it was for April-October 2018.
After nearly a decade of austerity when the budget deficit fell from 10% of national income to under 2%, Britain's Conservative government began last year to loosen the purse-strings, spending more on health care and public-sector pay.
This process has gathered pace since Boris Johnson succeeded Theresa May as prime minister in July, as new finance minister Sajid Javid announced the biggest increase in public spending in 15 years ahead of the early election.
""Political developments serve as a reminder that the deterioration in the public finances that we have seen so far likely marks the tip of the iceberg,"" Investec economist Victoria Clarke said.
The opposition Labour Party, who trail the Conservatives in opinion polls, set out their manifesto on Thursday, promising an extra 83 billion pounds a year in public spending by 2023/24 - a 10% increase they said would be covered by higher taxes.
On top of this, they plan around 55 billion pounds a year in investment, which would be funded by higher debt issuance.
Labour also wants to renationalize the electricity network, rail operators, the  Royal Mail  (LON:RMG) and BT's broadband network.
Thursday's data showed a 6.2% year-on-year fall in revenue from corporation tax in October, the biggest annual drop for that month in four years.
Overall tax revenues are up by 2.4% so far this year, compared with a 3.1% rise in day-to-day government spending, driven by costs for staffing and other goods and services.
As in most other big economies, Britain's level of government debt is much higher than before the financial crisis.
Public sector net debt totaled 80.4% of GDP in October, excluding public-sector banks, or 72.2% once the effect of a temporary Bank of England lending scheme was stripped out too.
Britain's debt-to-GDP ratio was below 40% before the 2008/09 financial crisis."

Jobless claims were unchanged at 227,000 in the week ended Nov. 16, as the prior reading was revised higher by 2,000, according to Labor Department figures released Thursday. The reading was above all estimates in Bloomberg's survey of economists. The four-week average, a less-volatile measure, increased to 221,000, also the highest since June.
Key Insights

The figures have the potential to stoke additional concern that the economy is slowing in the fourth quarter following data on retail sales and factory output that spurred analysts to lower growth projections. One caveat: the increase came during the week containing Veterans Day, and seasonal adjustments tend to be trickier around holidays.
While initial claims remain near historically low levels, they're up slightly from a year earlier. The latest report is also likely to get more scrutiny than usual because the week included the 12th of the month, which makes it the reference period for the Labor Department's November jobs report due out in early December. 
Federal Reserve officials have signaled little concern recently about the state of employment, as Chairman Jerome Powell last week described the labor market as “strong” and “healthy.”
Only one state, Pennsylvania, had estimated claims last week. In the prior report, five states including California were based on estimates, along with Puerto Rico.

122,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 21, 2019 06:40AM ET</span>",Exclusive: German exports to United States jump despite trade tensions,"By Michael Nienaber
BERLIN (Reuters) - Strong German exports to the United States helped Europe's largest economy to avoid a recession in the third quarter, data showed on Thursday, as companies benefited from a weaker euro and trade diversion linked to the U.S.-China tariff dispute.
The detailed trade figures, compiled for Reuters from the Federal Statistics Office, underline that U.S. demand for German goods remains strong, undaunted by President Donald Trump's threats to increase import tariffs on European cars.
Germany's export-reliant economy avoided slipping into recession in the third quarter as consumers, state spending and construction drove a 0.1% quarterly expansion. Exports also fared better than in the previous three months.
Overall, exports grew 1.7% year-on-year in the third quarter after a 1.3% decline in the second. The U.S. and France remained Germany's two biggest customers, the data showed.
German exports to the U.S. grew 7.6% year-on-year in the third quarter after a 5.3% increase in the previous three months. Exports to France rose 3.1% year-on-year after stagnating in the second quarter.
""Europe is benefiting from still being the uninvolved third party in the American-Chinese trade conflict. This leads to trade diversion and helps European exporters,"" Jens Suedekum from the Heinrich-Heine-University in Duesseldorf told Reuters.
Unexpected help for German exporters also came from France, where the economy is doing well thanks to structural reforms and fiscal stimulus measures enacted by President Emmanuel Macron.
""This spilled over to German exporters,"" Suedekum said. ""Chancellor Angela Merkel should send a thank-you note to Paris.""
SIDE EFFECTS
Gabriel Felbermayr, president of the Kiel Institute for the World Economy, pointed out that the euro had depreciated by 14% against the U.S. dollar since the beginning of 2018. A weaker euro makes German exports less expensive.
""The strong dollar is one of the macroeconomic side effects of Trump's trade policy towards China. It leads to trade diversion,"" Felbermayr told Reuters. That means the U.S. is increasingly buying goods from the European Union and Germany as tariffs make competing imports from China more expensive.
The United States and China are locked in a trade war triggered by Trump. Both countries have levied punitive duties on hundreds of billions of dollars worth of each other's goods, roiling financial markets and threatening global growth.
But Felbermayr cautioned that the uncertainty created by Trump's 'America First' trade policy in the medium term will lead to stronger production of German companies in the United States, which will weaken exports.
""The relocation of jobs is already taking place but is not yet visible in the export figures,"" he said.
This cautious tone was echoed on Thursday by the finance ministry. It said in a monthly report that exports stabilized at the end of the third quarter, but a slowing world economy and persistent trade risks pointed to only moderate developments in the coming months.
The strong demand for German' goods from the United States and France helped to cushion Germany from an unusual slowdown in exports to China, which was a steady source of growth for German manufacturers for nearly three decades.
German exports to the world's second-largest economy edged up only 0.3% year-on-year in the third quarter. By comparison, exports to China grew 1.8% in the second quarter and 6.3% in the first.
That suggests Germany can no longer rely on Chinese demand to fuel its export machine and with it, well-paid manufacturing jobs and tax revenues at home.
""Rising protectionism, the U.S. trade conflicts with Europe and China and the still-unclear Brexit situation are unsettling companies worldwide so they are holding back investments,"" said Volker Treier from the DIHK Chambers of Industry and Commerce.
The subdued trade outlook means that exports are expected to shrink by 0.5% next year, Treier said. That would be the first decline in German exports since the global financial crisis over a decade ago."
123,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 20, 2019 06:06PM ET</span>","German exports stabilized, but trade risks remain: finance ministry","BERLIN (Reuters) - German exports stabilized at the end of the third quarter but a slowing world economy and persistent trade risks for Europe's largest economy point to only moderate developments in the coming months, the finance ministry said on Thursday.

On Oct. 30, the Fed cut its benchmark rate by 25 basis points to a range of 1.50% to 1.75% from 1.75% to 2.00%. It was the third rate cut of the year.
The minutes showed that the eight members of the Federal Open Market Committee who voted for the rate cut believed it was sufficient to support the economy, suggesting that further policy action at future meetings was unlikely. The Federal Open Market Committee is the Fed's rate-making body. Two FOMC members voted against the rate cut.
""With regard to monetary policy beyond this meeting, most participants judged that the stance of policy, after a 25-basis-point reduction at this meeting, would be well-calibrated to support the outlook of moderate growth, a strong labor market, and inflation near the Committee's symmetric 2 percent objective and likely would remain so as long as incoming information about the economy did not result in a material reassessment of the economic outlook,"" according to the FOMC minutes.
 
 
That echoed recent remarks from Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell. 
In his press conference following the rate-cut decision, the Fed chief signaled that monetary policy would likely remain on pause for the rest of the year unless there was a “material reassessment” of the central bank’s outlook on the economy. 
The slow pace of inflation was singled out as one the key headwinds that prompted the Fed members to back the October rate cut, and there has been few signs that price pressures will gather pace and overshoot the Fed's 2% target. 
""The information available for the October 29–30 meeting indicated that labor market conditions remained strong and that real gross domestic product (GDP) increased at a moderate rate in the third quarter,"" the minutes showed. ""Consumer price inflation, as measured by the 12-month percentage change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures (PCE), remained below 2 percent in August. Survey-based measures of longer-run inflation expectations were little changed.""
Investor expectations for the Fed to stay put on rates at its next meeting are all but priced in, according to Investing.com's Fed Rate Monitor Tool.
Earlier this week, Powell was summoned to the White House for a sit-down with President Donald Trump. The talks were ""good and cordial,"" Trump said in a tweet following the meeting.
The meeting came just a week after Trump lashed out at Powell, claiming more market-friendly Fed policies would have led stocks to rack up even more gains.
""If we had a Federal Reserve that worked with us, you could have added another 25% to each of those numbers I guarantee you that,” Trump said. “That doesn’t happen. But we all make mistakes, don’t we. Not too often, we do make them on occasion.”
The president also floated the idea of negative interest rates, but there appears little appetite among Fed members to support the idea amid worries that it risks introducing significant complexity or distortions to U.S. financial systems. 
""All participants judged that negative interest rates currently did not appear to be an attractive monetary policy tool in the United States,"" the minutes showed. But Fed members did not rule out the possibility that ""circumstances could arise in which it might be appropriate to reassess the potential role of negative interest rates as a policy tool,"" according to the minutes.

Japan’s exports suffered their largest drop in three years in October, as the U.S.-China trade war continued to hit global demand and extreme weather disrupted output at home.
Exports fell 9.2% from a year ago, dropping for an 11th month and extending the longest streak of monthly declines since 2016, Ministry of Finance data showed Wednesday. Economists had forecast a 7.5% slide. Exports to China and the U.S., Japan’s two biggest markets, logged double-digit falls. Drops in automobile and steel shipments were major factors, along with damage from last month’s super typhoon.
Key Insights
Despite rumblings that Washington and Beijing are nearer to a truce that could roll back tariffs, global manufacturers remain in a funk over the global economy and uncertainty surrounding the trade outlook.Takeshi Minami, economist at Norinchukin Research Institute, said the continued weakness in exports could be a factor that pushes the Japanese government to add to the size of a stimulus package announced earlier this month, partly to shield the economy from the global slowdown. “We may see politicians increasingly calling for a sizable economic package,” he said.Still, the latest data, partly distorted by bad weather, needn’t be a cause for pessimism, Norinchukin’s Minami said, adding that there were further signs that the worst was over for the global tech sector.Speaking after the data was released, a finance ministry official said that manufacturing disruption caused by Typhoon Hagibis may have contributed to October’s drop in auto trade.The export slump has made the economy more dependent on consumer demand at a particularly vulnerable time. A sales tax hike introduced last month is expected to weigh heavily on spending this quarter.South Korean boycotts of Japanese products likely contributed to the drop in Japan’s exports of autos and food to its neighbor, according to economist Yutaro Suzuki at Daiwa Institute of Research Holdings. Since summer, the two countries have been embroiled in their own trade spat stemming from a dispute over Japan’s colonial past. Exports to Korea fell 23% in October.What Bloomberg’s Economist Says
“The U.S.-China trade war continues to undermine supply-chain demand, and remains the biggest downside risk to Japan’s exports.”

LONDON (Reuters) - Annual home price rises in Britain won't keep pace with already-low inflation until 2021, a Reuters poll found, and will fall in the capital London this year as uncertainty around the country's departure from the European Union continues to deter buyers.
Britons voted in a June 2016 referendum to leave the EU but there is still no clarity about how, when or even if the two sides will finally part ways.
That uncertainty is likely to continue even if Britain leaves by Jan. 31 as is currently scheduled as there is another tight deadline - by the end of 2020 - for both parties to hammer out a new trade deal, though many doubt that target can be met.
Prices in London, for decades a magnet for foreign investors and speculators, will fall 1.5% this year and only hold steady in 2020, the Nov. 5-18 Reuters poll found.
But highlighting the ambiguity, forecasts for this year ranged from -3.0% to no change. For 2020, the range was even wider, from -2.0% to +5.0%.
""Until we have greater certainty regarding the political environment it isn't possible to forecast what might happen in London with the greatest accuracy,"" said Rod Lockhart at property finance hub LendInvest.
""We do not anticipate a material price rebound in London until at least 2022, although we may experience some recovery from 2021 - if and when the political 'dust' begins to settle.""
London-focused real estate agent  Foxtons  Group (L:FOXT) reported a fall in third quarter revenue late last month and said ongoing political uncertainty continued to weigh on volumes and prices in the London residential sales market.

Nationwide, home prices will rise 1.0% this year, 1.5% in 2020 and 2.3% in 2021, the poll of 27 property market specialists predicted. Inflation is forecast for those years at 1.9%, 1.9% and 2.0% respectively.
""Regardless of what happens with Brexit in the months ahead, a revival in the housing market is unlikely,"" said Hansen Lu at Capital Economics.
""Indeed, even if a Brexit deal is implemented soon, we expect to see only a small improvement in housing market transactions and house price growth over the next two years.""
Based on recent public opinion polls, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson looks set to win a Dec. 12 election and secure the backing in parliament he needs to get his new Withdrawal Agreement passed and take Britain out of the EU on Jan. 31.
Johnson's Conservative Party has extended its lead over the opposition Labour Party during the past week, an opinion poll by ICM for Reuters showed on Monday.
BREXIT DEAL BOUNCE
Economists in another Reuters poll last week overwhelmingly said Britain would eventually strike a free-trade deal with the EU. The second-most likely resolution was Britain remaining a member of the European Economic Area.
But third most likely in the poll of economists was the country leaving the EU without a deal and trading under World Trade Organization rules - something the housing market experts polled by Reuters said unanimously would have the most deflationary impact on home prices.
Economists said the least likely outcome was Brexit being canceled. Housing watchers - again, unanimously - said that outcome would be the most inflationary for house prices in the coming year.
Rising prices would not be welcomed by first-time buyers struggling to get on the property ladder since, despite very low borrowing costs, scraping together the minimum 10% deposit demanded by most lenders poses a huge challenge.
The average asking price nationally for a home was 302,808 pounds ($391,652) this month, property website Rightmove said, around ten times the average British salary. The average price was double that in London.
When asked to describe the level of London house prices on a scale of 1 to 10 from extremely cheap to extremely expensive, the median response was 8. Nationally they were rated 6.
""While house prices in London and the surrounding regions have been falling over recent months, prices are still significantly higher than elsewhere in the country, making buying a property in the capital unaffordable for many people,"" said Jamie Durham at PwC.
""But this affordability problem is not constrained to just the capital, and house prices are high relative to wages right across the country.""

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's exports tumbled at their quickest pace in three years in October, threatening to tip the trade-reliant economy into recession as weakening demand from United States and China darkened the outlook.
Ministry of Finance data out on Wednesday showed Japan's exports fell 9.2% year-on-year in October, a bigger decline than the 7.6% drop expected by economists in a Reuters poll.
The feeble results, driven by plummeting shipments of cars and aircraft engines to the United States and plastic materials to China, marked the longest run of declines in exports since a 14-month stretch from October 2015 to November 2016.
In volume terms, exports slumped 4.4% in the year to October, the third consecutive month of declines.
The data comes after a preliminary reading of gross domestic product last week showed Japan's economy saw the worst growth in a year in the third quarter due to soft demand.
Lawmakers have called on the government to boost spending by as much as 10 trillion yen ($92.08 billion) for the current fiscal year to support the economy, which many fear is facing additional pressure from a sales tax hike that took effect in October.
The government has said it plans to compile a stimulus package as soon as possible as a pre-emptive measure against heightening overseas risks.
By region, exports to China, Japan's biggest trading partner, slipped 10.3% year-on-year in October, down for the eighth month as shipments of plastics and car parts declined.
Exports to Asia, which account for more than half of Japan's overall exports, tumbled 11.2% in the year to October, down for the 12th month.
Japan's exports to the United States dropped 11.4% in the year to October, hurt by reduced shipments of 2,000 to 3,000 cc cars, aircraft engines and car parts.
Japan's lower house of parliament approved on Tuesday a limited trade deal Prime Minister Shinzo Abe agreed with the United States, clearing the way for tariff cuts next year on items including U.S. farm goods and Japanese machine tools.
The nation's overall imports sank 14.8% year-on-year, a smaller decline than the median estimate for a 16.0% decrease.
The trade balance came to a surplus of 17.3 billion yen, versus a 301.0 billion yen surplus seen by economists."
128,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 19, 2019 01:22PM ET</span>",U.S. services data suggests upward revision to third-quarter GDP,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. economic growth for the third quarter is likely to be revised higher after data on Tuesday showed stronger consumer spending than initially estimated, according to JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM).
It said the Commerce Department's quarterly services survey, or QSS, on Tuesday implied spending on legal services increased at a faster pace than the government had assumed in its advance estimate of gross domestic product published last month.
""Data from this survey signaled stronger consumption growth during the quarter than what was first reported by the BEA (Bureau of Economic Analysis),"" said JPMorgan economist Daniel Silver. ""We now look for third-quarter real consumption growth to be revised up to a 3.2% annualized rate.""
The government estimated last month that consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of the economy, increased at a 2.9% rate in the third quarter. Before the QSS data, economists were already expecting that GDP growth for the July-September quarter would be bumped up to a 2.0% pace from a 1.9% rate following solid gains in manufacturing inventories and construction spending in September.
Based on the QSS data, JPMorgan estimated another three-tenths of a percentage point would be added to the third-quarter GDP estimate. That means third-quarter GDP could be raised to a 2.3% rate when the government publishes its first revision next week. That would be a pick-up in GDP growth from the 2.0% pace logged in the second quarter. 
""The QSS data will impact many different categories of services consumption, and we think that an upward revision to the BEA data on legal services consumption could be particularly noticeable,"" said Silver. ""Away from consumption, the QSS data had only marginal effects on our tracking of third-quarter investment in intellectual property products.""

Consumer spending is supporting the economy as a 16-month trade war between the United States and China undermines business investment and manufacturing.

129,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 19, 2019 11:44AM ET</span>","Lower mortgage rates boost U.S. housing starts, building permits","By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. homebuilding rebounded in October and permits for future home construction jumped to a more than 12-year high, pointing to strength in the housing market amid lower mortgage rates.
The report from the Commerce Department on Tuesday also showed an increase in home completions and the stock of homes under construction, which could help to ease a supply squeeze that has plagued the housing market. 
Though housing accounts for a fraction of gross domestic product, it has a bigger economic footprint. The surge in housing activity at the start of the fourth quarter suggested some support for the economy, which is slowing amid cooling consumer spending and persistent weakness in business investment and manufacturing.
""It is cheaper than ever to finance the cost of a new home and home builders are sitting up and taking notice assuming that if they build it, buyers will come,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG in New York. ""There won't be a recession if residential housing construction has anything to say about it.""
Housing starts increased 3.8% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.314 million units last month, with single-family construction rising for a fifth straight month and activity in the volatile multi-family sector rebounding solidly.
Data for September was revised to show homebuilding falling to a pace of 1.266 million units, instead of decreasing to a rate of 1.256 million units as previously reported. 
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast housing starts increasing to a pace of 1.320 million units in October. Housing starts advanced 8.5% on a year-on-year basis in October. 
Building permits surged 5.0% to a rate of 1.461 million units in October, the highest level since May 2007. Permits were driven by the single-family housing segment, which increased 3.2% to the highest level since August 2007.
Building permits in the populous South region scaled their highest level in more than 12-1/2-years last month. 
The housing market, the most sensitive sector to interest rates, has perked up in recent months, catching up to the Federal Reserve's easy monetary policy stance, which has pushed down mortgage rates from last year's multi-year highs.
The sector, which accounts for about 3.1% of the economy, however, continues to be hobbled by land and labor shortages.
A survey on Monday showed confidence among homebuilders hovering near a more than 1-1/2-year high in November. Builders, however, complained about ""a lack of labor and regulatory constraints,"" adding that ""lot shortages remain a serious problem, particularly among custom builders.""
The dollar was steady against a basket of currencies, while U.S. Treasury prices rose. Stocks on Wall Street were mixed. The PHLX housing index (HGX) was trading lower.
BROAD STRENGTH 
Housing starts shot up to a more than 12-year high in August. But momentum could slow as mortgage rates have backed up in the last two months, partly driven by ebbing fears of a recession amid a de-escalation in trade tensions between the United States and China. 
The Fed last month cut rates for the third time this year and signaled a pause in the easing cycle that started in July when it reduced borrowing costs for the first time since 2008. 
New York Federal Reserve President John Williams (NYSE:WMB) said on Tuesday he believed that the U.S. central bank had ""monetary policy in the right place,"" and that ""the economy is right where we would like it to be.""
The 30-year fixed mortgage rate is currently at 3.75%, still below its peak of 4.94% in November 2018, according to data from mortgage finance agency Freddie Mac. 
Residential investment rebounded in the third quarter after contracting for six straight quarters, the longest such stretch since the 2007-2009 recession. 
The strong housing starts and building permit data prompted economists to lift their fourth-quarter GDP growth estimates by one-tenth of a percentage point to as high as a 1.5% annualized rate. The economy grew at a 1.9% pace in the third quarter.
Single-family homebuilding, which accounts for the largest share of the housing market, increased 2.0% to a rate of 936,000 units in October, the highest in nine months. Single-family housing starts rose in the West, Midwest and the South last month. They fell in the Northeast.
Starts for the volatile multi-family housing segment soared 8.6% to a rate of 378,000 units in October. Permits for the construction of multi-family homes increased 8.2% to a rate of 552,000 units last month.
Housing completions vaulted 10.3% to 1.256 million units last month. Realtors estimate that housing starts and completion rates need to be in a range of 1.5 million to 1.6 million units per month to close the inventory gap. 
The stock of housing under construction gained 0.1% to 1.161 million units, the most since January.

""While the housing industry isn't yet building enough to satisfy demand, especially considering years of under-building since the Great Recession, if these trends continue we may return to a better housing equilibrium in the next couple years,"" said Robert Frick, corporate economist at Navy Federal Credit Union in Vienna, Virginia.

Swiss watch export growth stagnated in October as anti-Beijing protests in Hong Kong led shipments to the market to plummet.
A 30% plunge put the city behind mainland China as a landing spot for the products for the first time since the Federation of the Swiss Watch Industry began keeping monthly records about 30 years ago. Hong Kong had already begun slipping behind the U.S. in recent months after ranking as the largest destination for Swiss timepieces for about a decade.
As the protests rage on, rich Chinese are increasingly buying timepieces in their home country. The stream of tourists into Hong Kong watch shops has dropped to about a tenth of its former level, according to Alain Lam, finance director at Oriental Watch Holdings Ltd., which sells brands such as Rolex and Piaget at stores in both Hong Kong and on the mainland.
“Even Hong Kong locals are afraid of coming out onto the street,” he said in an interview.
Weakening of the yuan has also reduced the price differential between the mainland and Hong Kong, where watches were once about 20% cheaper. Now the difference is about 10%, Lam said.
Globally, Swiss watch exports gained 1.5% in October. Growth in the first 10 months of the year was 2.7%, compared with the industry’s annual pace of 6.3% last year."

Thailand’s economy grew more slowly than expected in the third quarter and the government lowered its forecast for full-year growth as the country deals with the impact of the U.S.-China trade war and a strong currency.
Gross domestic product rose 2.4% from a year ago, the National Economic and Social Development Council said Monday, below the median estimate of 2.7% in a Bloomberg survey of economists. The council cut its 2019 GDP forecast to 2.6% -- from an earlier view of 2.7%-3.2% -- and said growth should accelerate to 2.7%-3.7% next year.
Thailand’s trade-reliant economy has been hit by slumping exports, a surging currency and mixed performance in the tourism sector. The central bank earlier this month cut its benchmark interest rate to a record low and announced measures to slow gains in the baht, which has been the strongest performer in emerging markets over the past year, rising about 9%.
The council’s secretary general, Thosaporn Sirisumphand, called for more stimulus to supplement a $10 billion package the government approved in August. The global slowdown, drought and volatility remain key challenges for the economy, he said.
“We need to use all tools that we have as there are still a lot of risks that we can’t control,” Thosaporn told reporters in Bangkok. “We can’t be complacent.”
Exports, Currency
While the economy appeared to bottom out in the second quarter -- when it grew 2.3%, its slowest pace in nearly five years -- the rebound has been more muted than expected, Thosaporn said.
“Baht strength hurt exports and private investment in the third quarter,” he said. “We think the baht strength may continue.”
The baht was at 30.245 per dollar as of 10:35 a.m. in Bangkok, little changed from before the data release.
“The worst is probably now over for the economy, but a strong rebound is unlikely,” Gareth Leather, an economist at Capital Economics, wrote in a research note. “Exports will continue to struggle if, as we expect, global growth slows further. A high level of household debt will also constrain private consumption growth.”
The NESDC said exports now are expected to shrink by 2% this year, compared to the 1.2% contraction it forecast in August. The economy should pick up in the final quarter of the year and accelerate into 2020, driven by government stimulus measures, gradual recovery in exports and an improvement in tourism, the council said.

133,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 15, 2019 02:38PM ET</span>",U.S. retail sales rise modestly; factory output tumbles,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. retail sales rebounded moderately in October although consumers did cut back on purchases of big-ticket household items like furniture and discretionary spending, which could temper expectations for a strong holiday shopping season.
Signs from the Commerce Department report on Friday that consumer spending was slowing faster than economists had expected, and news that production at factories tumbled again in October, revived concerns about a downshift in the economy, which had receded after a recent raft of fairly upbeat data. 
Economists slashed their economic growth estimates for the fourth quarter following Friday's reports. 
""The consumer is still spending, but not robustly enough to support other sectors, especially business investment,"" said Joel Naroff, chief economist at Naroff Economic Advisors in Holland, Pennsylvania.
Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell on Thursday told lawmakers that ""the U.S. economy is the star economy these days,"" compared to other advanced economies and ""there's no reason that can't continue."" The U.S. central bank signaled last month that it will probably not cut interest rates again in the near term.
Retail sales gained 0.3% last month. But the increase in sales, which reversed September's unrevised 0.3% drop, reflected higher motor vehicle and gasoline prices. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast retail sales climbing 0.2% in October after falling in September for first time in seven months.
Auto manufacturers reported a drop in unit sales in October. Compared to October last year, retail sales advanced 3.1%.
Excluding automobiles, gasoline, building materials and food services, retail sales increased 0.3% last month. Data for September was revised lower to show the so-called core retail sales slipping 0.1% instead of being unchanged as previously reported. Core retail sales correspond most closely with the consumer spending component of gross domestic product.
""We have long been anticipating a slowdown in consumer spending but it appears to have happened more significantly than we had expected,"" said Daniel Silver, an economist at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) in New York.
Based on the latest data, economists estimated that consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of the economy, could grow at around a 1.5% annualized rate in the fourth quarter. That would be a step-down from the 2.9% pace notched in the July-September period. 
U.S. financial markets were little moved by the data as investors watched news on trade negotiations between the United States and China. The dollar fell against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices slipped, while stocks on Wall Street were trading higher.
GROWTH ESTIMATES SLASHED
Consumer spending is being supported by the lowest unemployment rate in nearly 50 years. Strong consumption has helped to blunt the hit on the economy from the White House's 16-month trade war with China, which has led to a decline in capital expenditure and a recession in manufacturing. 
The manufacturing downturn deepened in October, with the Fed reporting on Friday that output at factories tumbled 0.6%, the most since May 2018, after dropping 0.5% in September. Output, was weighed down by an 11.1% plunge in motor vehicle production because of a 40-day strike at General Motors (N:GM).
Excluding auto production, manufacturing output slipped 0.1% last month. Even with trade tensions between Washington and Beijing easing, there is no sign that business confidence and manufacturing will rebound anytime soon.
In a third report on Friday, the New York Fed said its business conditions index for factories in New York state fell to a reading of 2.9 in November from 4.0 in October. Manufacturers remained pessimistic about business conditions over the next six months.
""With the global backdrop still weak and trade policy still up in the air, we expect the underlying trend in manufacturing activity to remain subdued over the next few months,"" said Sarah House, a senior economist at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) Securities in Charlotte, North Carolina.
Following the reports, the Atlanta Fed slashed its GDP growth estimate for the fourth quarter to a 0.3% rate from a 1.0% pace. The economy grew at a 1.9% rate in the third quarter.
The Fed last month cut rates for the third time this year and indicated a pause in the easing cycle that started in July when it reduced borrowing costs for the first time since 2008. 
Receipts at auto dealerships gained 0.5% in October after falling 1.3% in September. Sales at service stations surged 1.1%. Online and mail-order retail sales increased 0.9%. 
Walmart Inc (N:WMT) on Thursday reported better-than-expected earnings for the third quarter, driven by food sales. The world's largest retailer raised its annual outlook.
But the retrenchment in purchases of big-ticket household items and discretionary spending casts doubts on the holiday shopping season, which typically kicks off around Thanksgiving. 
Sales at electronics and appliance stores fell 0.4% last month and receipts at clothing stores declined 1.0%. Spending at furniture stores decreased 0.9%, the most since December 2018. 
Receipts at building material stores dropped 0.5%. Americans also cut back on spending at restaurants and bars, with sales falling 0.3%, the most in nearly a year. Spending at hobby, musical instrument and book stores dropped 0.8%.

""Consumers are easing off their spendthrift ways from the second quarter and are adopting more prudent attitudes,"" said Robert Frick, corporate economist at Navy Federal Credit Union in Vienna, Virginia. ""Should these trends continue we will be facing a not-so-merry holiday shopping season.""

134,By Bloomberg,"<span>Nov 15, 2019 10:27AM ET</span>",U.S. Retail Sales Rebound But Details Show Consumer Cooling,"(Bloomberg) -- U.S. retail sales rebounded by slightly more than estimated in October on gains from auto dealers and filling stations, though declines in categories including clothing and furniture stores tempered the advance.
The value of overall sales increased 0.3% from the prior month after a 0.3% drop in September, Commerce Department figures showed Friday. The median estimate in a Bloomberg survey called for a 0.2% advance.
Sales in the “control group” subset, which some analysts view as a more reliable gauge of underlying consumer demand, increased 0.3% as projected. The measure excludes food services, car dealers, building-materials stores and gasoline stations.
The reading signals consumers remain willing to spend, though at a slower pace than earlier this year, as the robust jobs market and solid wage gains offer reasons for Americans to remain upbeat. Consumers have driven the economy forward in recent quarters, and Friday’s data suggest the trend may continue in the final three months of the year.
“It’s not screaming softness on the consumer but the consumer is gradually fading,” said Stephen Gallagher, chief U.S. economist at  Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN) SA. “We’re more dependent on the consumer than ever in this expansion, and we’re getting some signs the consumer is slowing.”
Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell reiterated this week that the labor market is strong, following an October jobs report that showed payroll gains intact and the jobless rate still near a half-century low. Solid employment would continue to underpin consumer spending.
But the retail report also included some signs that may point to consumers running low on steam, with seven of 13 major categories dropping. Sales at furniture and home furnishing stores fell 0.9% while food service and drinking places decreased 0.3%, both posting the steepest declines of this year.
Control-group sales have increased an annualized 4% over the latest three months compared with a 6.3% rate in the same period through September.
A separate report Friday from the New York Fed showed manufacturing weakness persisted this month. The Empire State factory gauge, based on a survey of companies in New York, fell to 2.9, compared with forecasts for a gain, pointing to tepid growth in the sector.
Later Friday, the Fed is due to report national figures for industrial production in October.
Nonstore retailers, which include online shopping, were a bright spot. They posted a 0.9% gain from the prior month and were up 14.3% from a year earlier, the most of any major group.
Filling-station receipts increased 1.1%, the report showed. The retail figures aren’t adjusted for price changes, so sales could reflect changes in gasoline costs, sales, or both.
Spending at automobile dealers climbed 0.5% after decreasing 1.3% in the previous month. That contrasted with industry data from Wards Automotive Group that previously showed auto sales slumped to a six-month low in October.
Excluding automobiles and gasoline, retail sales edged up 0.1% -- below forecasts -- after a decline the previous month.
Retail sales estimates in Bloomberg’s survey of economists ranged from a 0.2% decline to a 0.7% gain from the prior month.
The sales data capture don’t capture all of household purchases and tend to be volatile because they’re not adjusted for changes in prices. Personal-spending figures will offer a fuller picture of U.S. consumption in data due at the end of the month.
A separate Labor Department report Friday showed the U.S. import price index fell 0.5% in October from the prior month and 3% from a year earlier, the most in three years. Excluding petroleum, the index decreased 0.1% from the prior month."
135,By Bloomberg,"<span>Nov 15, 2019 10:16AM ET</span>",U.S. Factory Output Drops by Most Since April on GM Strike,"(Bloomberg) -- U.S. manufacturing output slumped in October by the most in six months as an auto workers’ strike at General Motors (NYSE:GM) curtailed vehicle production and the trade war continued to weigh on other factories.
The 0.6% decline in output followed a 0.5% decrease the previous month, Federal Reserve data showed Friday. Excluding the 7.1% drop in motor vehicle output, which was the largest since January, factory production decreased a more modest 0.1% for a second month.
Total industrial production, which also includes output at mines and utilities, slumped 0.8% in October, the largest setback since May 2018.
Key Insights
The data are consistent with other reports showing cracks in the factory sector as producers grapple with sluggish global demand, slower business investment and the U.S.-China trade war. The Institute for Supply Management’s gauge contracted three straight months, while a separate index showed global manufacturing shrank in October for a sixth month.All major market groups, including consumer goods and business equipment, reported declines in output for at least a second month.Factory production may rebound next month as the striking United Auto Workers reached an agreement with GM late in October.

The Commerce Department said on Friday that the unchanged reading in business inventories followed a 0.1% dip in August. Inventories are a key component of gross domestic product.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast inventories edging up 0.1% in September.
Retail inventories rose 0.2% in September instead of increasing 0.3% as estimated in an advance report published last month. That followed a 0.2% drop in August.
Motor vehicle inventories gained 0.2% in September as previously reported. Retail inventories excluding autos, which go into the calculation of GDP, increased 0.2%, instead of climbing 0.3% as reported last month.
The pace of inventory accumulation has been slowing after stocks surged from the third quarter of 2018 through the first quarter of this year. The inventory overhang has led to businesses placing fewer orders at factories, contributing to a downturn in manufacturing activity.
The government reported last month that inventory investment subtracted a marginal 0.05 percentage point from GDP growth in the third quarter. The economy grew at a 1.9% annualized rate in the July-September quarter, driven by consumer spending.
Wholesale inventories dropped 0.4% in September, while stocks at manufacturers increased 0.3%.
Business sales fell 0.2% in September after edging up 0.1% in the prior month. At September's sales pace, it would take 1.40 months for businesses to clear shelves, unchanged from August.

The Federal Reserve said on Friday industrial production declined 0.8% last month after an upwardly revised 0.3% decline in September. It was the largest decline since May of 2018.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast industrial production falling 0.4% last month after a previously reported 0.4% percent drop in September.
Manufacturing output fell 0.6% last month, driven by an 11.1% drop in motor vehicle production. U.S. producers assembled cars and trucks in October at an annual rate of 9.14 million units, down 2.5 million since a recent peak in July.
The strike at General Motors (NYSE:GM) added to that decline, contributing to a 1.2% drop in durable goods output, the Fed reported.
But excluding motor vehicles and parts, U.S. manufacturing production still fell 0.5%, the Fed said, and durable goods still dropped 0.2%.
Production rose 0.1% for computers and related products, but output for communications equipment fell 0.4%.
The data point to the possible fallout of the U.S. trade war with China, with final production of business equipment falling 0.6% amid weak business investment.
The Trump administration raised tariffs on a range of Chinese imports in July, triggering retaliatory tariffs from Beijing on U.S. exports.
Mining production fell 0.7% in October. Utilities fell 2.6% percent.
With overall industrial production falling, capacity utilization, a measure of how fully firms are using their resources, fell last month to 76.7% from 77.5%. That was the lowest level since September 2017.
Officials at the Fed tend to look at capacity use measures for signals of whether resources may become scarce and cause inflation to rise."

The Labor Department said on Friday import prices dropped 0.5% last month. Data for September was revised lower to show import prices gaining 0.1% instead of climbing 0.2% as previously reported.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast import prices slipping 0.2% in October. In the 12 months through October, import prices fell 3.0%, the biggest decline since July 2016, after decreasing 2.1% in September.
That suggests inflation could remain moderate despite an increase in overall consumer and producer prices in October.
The Federal Reserve last month cut rates for the third time this year and signaled a pause in the easing cycle that started in July when the U.S. central bank reduced borrowing costs for the first time since 2008.
Import prices exclude tariffs. In October, prices for imported fuels and lubricants fell 2.9% after increasing 1.5% in the prior month. Petroleum prices tumbled 3.7% after rising 1.5% in September. Imported food prices declined 0.4% after falling 0.8% in September.

The Commerce Department said on Friday retail sales increased 0.3% last month, lifted by motor vehicle purchases and higher gasoline prices, reversing September's unrevised 0.3% drop, which was the first decline in seven months.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast retail sales gaining 0.2% in October. Compared to October last year, retail sales advanced 3.1%.
Excluding automobiles, gasoline, building materials and food services, retail sales increased 0.3% last month. Data for September was revised lower to show the so-called core retail sales slipping 0.1% instead of being unchanged as previously reported. Core retail sales correspond most closely with the consumer spending component of gross domestic product.
The rebound in core retail sales added to reports this week showing firming inflation in supporting the Federal Reserve's signal that it will probably not cut interest rates again in the near term. Other reports this month have shown solid job growth in October and an acceleration in services sector activity.
The data and easing trade tensions between Washington and Beijing have diminished financial market fears of a recession. Fed Chair Jerome Powell told lawmakers on Thursday that ""the U.S. economy is the star economy these days,"" compared to other advanced economies and ""there's no reason that can't continue.""
The U.S. central bank last month cut rates for the third time this year and signaled a pause in the easing cycle that started in July when it reduced borrowing costs for the first time since 2008.
Consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of the economy, increased at a 2.9% annualized rate in the third quarter. The economy's engine is being powered by the lowest unemployment rate in nearly 50 years and has helped to blunt the hit on the economy from the White House's 16-month trade war with China, which had led to a decline in capital expenditure and a recession in manufacturing.
Auto sales increased 0.5% in October after declining 1.3% in September. Receipts at service stations surged 1.1%, reflecting higher gasoline prices, after dipping 0.1% in the prior month. Online and mail-order retail sales increased 0.9% after gaining 0.2% in September.

140,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 15, 2019 07:49AM ET</span>",U.S. companies say consumer still strong even as broader outlook dims,"By Caroline Valetkevitch
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Walmart (NYSE:WMT) became the latest company to point to a strong U.S. consumer, adding to a raft of firms in recent weeks citing healthy demand at a time when spending is seen as an increasingly key support for the economy.
Several companies including banks and homebuilders have painted an upbeat picture of consumer health in conference calls this reporting season, even as many firms have offered more dour outlooks especially given the lingering U.S.-China trade war.
Reports of strong demand from companies are a welcome sign to some in the market amid weakening manufacturing activity and a slump in business investment.
Data showed U.S. economic growth slowed less than expected in the third quarter as resilient consumer spending offset a further contraction in business investment, and many strategists remain confident in consumers' ability to support the economy.
""I'm in that camp. We are now in this job market where the consumer has the advantage versus employers,"" said Lindsey Bell, chief investment strategist at Ally Invest in Charlotte, North Carolina.
Lower interest rates, which mean reduced borrowing costs, are giving people more money to spend, and that's likely to be the case for the first half of next year as well, she said.
On Thursday, Walmart Inc raised its annual outlook and its chief financial officer, Brett Biggs, told Reuters spending going into the crucial holiday season remained healthy.
Focus on spending at retailers will remain high next week, when a wide range of retailers report results, wrapping up the reporting period. They include  Target  Corp (NYSE:TGT),  Home Depot  Inc (NYSE:HD), Gap Inc (NYSE:GPS) and Macy's Inc. 
Homebuilder  Lennar  Corp (NYSE:LEN), MasterCard and Tapestry were among companies alluding to healthy consumer spending during the current reporting period.
In JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) Chase's Oct. 15 earnings call, Chief Financial Officer Jennifer Piepszak said uncertainty related to trade may be impacting some investing but the U.S. consumer is ""incredibly strong."" 
""Sentiment is strong for the consumer, credit is good,"" she said.
The number of companies mentioning a strong consumer in the third-quarter season is roughly in line with the number in the second-quarter reporting period.
To be sure though, business investment has been easing, and plenty of companies have given a more cautious view of the outlook. Among them, Cisco Systems Inc (NASDAQ:CSCO) late on Wednesday forecast revenue and profit below expectations and said increasing global economic uncertainties were weighing on client spending.
Also, analysts have been cutting earnings forecasts for the fourth quarter and 2020, while third-quarter earnings for S&P 500 are on track to fall slightly from a year ago, which would be the first quarterly profit decline for the group since 2016, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
Banking on the consumer is a risk at this point, said Richard Bernstein, chief executive of Richard Bernstein Advisors LLC in New York. 
""If we get a profits recession, you're going to see the employment situation start to change,"" said Bernstein, who spoke at the Reuters Global Investment Outlook 2020 Summit in New York last week.
Investors will seek further clues from reports on spending trends ahead of the holiday shopping period, when many retailers get a big part of their annual sales.

A report Friday on U.S. retail sales for October could be among them.

The economy shrank by 3.2% in July-September from the previous quarter on a seasonally adjusted basis, revised government data showed, in line with a preliminary reading. 
Gross domestic product (GDP) contracted for the second consecutive quarter, meeting the technical definition of a recession.
With no end to the protests in sight, analysts warn the financial and trading center potentially faces a longer and deeper slump than during the global financial crisis in 2008/2009 and the SARS epidemic in 2003.
From a year earlier, the economy contracted 2.9%, also in line with the preliminary reading. The readings were the weakest since the global crisis.
""Domestic demand worsened significantly in the third quarter, as the local social incidents took a heavy toll on consumption-related activities and subdued economic prospects weighed on consumption and investment sentiment,"" the government said in a statement. 
It revised down its forecast for full-year growth to a contraction of 1.3% versus an earlier estimate of 0-1% growth. That would mark the first annual decline since 2009. 
""Ending violence and restoring calm are pivotal to the recovery of the economy. The government will continue to closely monitor the situation and introduce measures as necessary to support enterprises and safeguard,"" the government said. 
More than five months of political protests have plunged the city into its worst crisis since it reverted from British to Chinese rule in 1997.
Tourists are cancelling bookings, retailers are reeling from a sharp drop in sales and the stock market is faltering, adding to pressure the city is feeling from China's economic slowdown and the prolonged Sino-U.S. trade dispute.
August retail sales were the worst on record - down 23% from a year earlier - while September's plunged 18.3%.
Parts of the city were paralyzed for a fifth day on Friday. Transportation disruptions have become common and some shopping malls and other businesses are shuttering early as the unrest escalates.
BUSINESS GATEWAY TO CHINA
Hong Kong is one of the world's most important financial hubs with total banking, fund and wealth management assets worth more than $6 trillion.
Many businesses with ambitions to expand in China still consider it as a gateway into the mainland, while Chinese firms use it to access international capital, as well as a testing ground and springboard for their global ambitions. 
Business activity in the private sector fell to its weakest in 21 years in October, according to IHS Markit, while demand from mainland China declined at the sharpest pace in the survey's history - which started in July 1998.
The government has rolled out stimulus measures since August, but since it is forced to keep a high level of reserves to back the Hong Kong dollar peg to the U.S. dollar, the packages have been relatively small.

Analysts also doubt the effectiveness of handouts, since the uncertainty prevents businesses and consumers from spending and investing, and store closures will lead to job losses.

BANGKOK (Reuters) - Thailand's economic growth likely slowed in July-September from the previous quarter, a Reuters poll showed on Friday, as exports and manufacturing remained weak amid global trade tensions while domestic demand was sluggish.
The economy grew a seasonally-adjusted 0.1% in the third quarter versus the second quarter, according to the poll's median estimate of 12 economists. That would be the weakest pace since a contraction in 2018's third quarter.
Gross domestic product (GDP) expanded 0.6% in the June quarter.
Annual growth was forecast at 2.6% in the September quarter, slightly better than the 2.3% pace in the June quarter, which was the weakest in nearly five years. Fourteen analysts gave annual growth forecasts.
""We do not expect a recovery in Q3 GDP growth, as the manufacturing sector was under heavy pressure from a deepening export downturn,"" said Nomura economist Charnon Boonnuch in Singapore.
There is a ""risk of a technical recession in the fourth quarter"" due to a delayed government budget, said Charnon, who predicts third-quarter annual growth of 2.3% and a quarter-on-quarter contraction.
Deputy Prime Minister Somkid Jatusripitak said on Friday third-quarter GDP ""may not be good"", and additional stimulus measures will be considered to shore up growth.
The poll's forecast for full-year 2019 growth was 2.8%, slowing from last year's 4.1%, the best rate in six years.
Southeast Asia's second-largest economy is heavily reliant on exports, which have been hit by the U.S.-Sino trade war, while the strength of the baht , Asia's top performing currency this year, has added to the pressure.
In the third quarter, exports were flat from a year earlier and manufacturing slumped 4.2%, while private consumption growth slowed to 1.4% and private investment contracted 3.4%, central bank data showed.
However, annual public expenditure rose 11.9% in the third quarter and foreign tourist numbers increased 7.2%, helped by last year's low comparative levels.
In a bid to boost flagging domestic activity, the government in August introduced a big stimulus package.
Last week, the Bank of Thailand (BOT) cut its policy interest rate for the second time in three months, taking it to a record low of 1.25%.
Deputy BOT Governor Mathee Supapongse told Reuters on Wednesday there was still scope to support the economy if needed.
The National Economic and Social Development Council, which compiles GDP data, has forecast full-year 2019 economic growth of 2.7-3.2%, with exports down 1.2%. It may downgrade those forecasts again on Monday."

  Daimler   AG (DE:DAIGn) said this week it will shed 10% of management positions at its Mercedes unit, lifting the tally of job cuts announced this year across Germany’s manufacturing sector to more than 80,000, according to Bloomberg calculations.
Companies from  Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) AG  (DE:VOWG) to   Siemens   AG (DE:SIEGn) are letting go workers as Germany’s powerful automotive industry is struggling with a shift toward electrification and self-driving cars, and makers of machinery and robots are hit by slower exports and trade disputes.
While the country’s unemployment rate, at 5%, remains close to its historic low, the number of freelancers is rising and short-term work has been creeping up since last year. Automotive companies in particular have also started to shed thousands of jobs. Daimler alone pledged to cut a total of at least 1.4 billion euros ($1.5 billion) in personnel expenses -- potentially putting many more jobs at risk.
The full effect of the cuts may not be felt immediately. German labor laws and powerful unions make it difficult to fire workers, and many large companies have agreements banning forced dismissals, meaning job-cut programs have voluntary elements and sometimes run for years.
Still, the deteriorating prospects for employment could turn into a headache for the German government, which has been considering following countries from China to the U.K. in beefing up investments to stimulate its economy.
Here is a rundown of the main job cuts announced since the beginning of the year by German industrial companies. The tally includes foreign corporations that have announced cuts affecting staff in Europe’s biggest economy. It excludes the financial industry, cuts that remain unconfirmed, and programs where companies have not yet specified how many jobs will go."

Gross domestic product rose 4.4% in the three months through September from a year ago, according to figures from the central bank. That matched the median expectation in a Bloomberg survey of economists.
The slower third-quarter print comes after Malaysia’s economy bucked the regional trend in the previous three months by expanding 4.9% -- its fastest pace in more than a year -- even as its neighbors’ growth slowed. Analysts are calling for Malaysia’s central bank to begin easing borrowing costs next year after a surprise cut last week to banks’ reserve ratio requirement hinted at the need to bolster growth.
“The weak growth figure in every sector means BNM will need to cut rates to support growth,” said Trinh Nguyen, senior economist at Natixis Asia Ltd. in Hong Kong, predicting the benchmark rate will be 50 basis points lower by the end of 2020. Inflation “is low and growth is decelerating, so the hurdles to a rate cut are low.”
Economy ‘Resilient’
Signs of strain have begun to show in Malaysia’s economy as exports slid in September by the most since 2016 and industrial production growth eased in the three months through September. The global downturn has put pressure on Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad’s government, which widened its 2020 budget deficit target to support growth, delaying its goal of fiscal consolidation.
In slides accompanying the data release, Bank Negara Malaysia said the economy will remain “resilient” this year and next and that monetary policy “remains accommodative and supportive of economic activity.” The central bank is maintaining its full-year forecast of 4.3%-4.8% GDP growth for 2019, governor Nor Shamsiah Mohd Yunus told reporters.
“We think the economy is likely to lose more steam in the quarters ahead,” Alex Holmes, an economist with Capital Economics, wrote in a research note. “Looser monetary policy is likely to be offset by headwinds from elsewhere. Tighter fiscal policy is a key headwind as the government aims to bring down the budget deficit.”
Khoon Goh, head of Asia research at Australia & New Zealand Banking Group Ltd. in Singapore, said Friday’s data was neutral for the ringgit. The currency held its gains after the release, up 0.2% to 4.1483 per dollar.
The reserve-ratio cut earlier this month, coupled with signs that activity may be starting to recover, “suggest that there is no urgency” for the central bank to cut its benchmark rate, he said.
Infrastructure Projects
Data on Friday showed annual growth in GDP components slowed almost across the board compared to the second quarter. Domestic demand and a resumption of big-ticket transport projects will help support the economy going forward, while risks include the trade war and commodity-price volatility, the central bank said.
Despite the overall decline in exports as global growth slows, U.S.-China trade tensions have allowed Malaysia to ship an additional $1.4 billion of goods to the world’s two largest economies from January through August, the central bank said.
Asked if the reserve-ratio cut was a prelude to further adjustments to the benchmark rate, Shamsiah said the central bank is “not on a preset” course and will monitor incoming data. The central bank has cut rates once this year by 25 basis points, less than the easing carried out by many of its Southeast Asian peers.

Despite the overall decline in exports as global growth slows, U.S.-China trade tensions have allowed Malaysia to ship an additional $1.4 billion of goods to the world’s two largest economies from January through August, the central bank said.
Asked if last week’s RRR cut was a prelude to further adjustments to Malaysia’s benchmark rate, Shamsiah said the central bank is “not on a preset” course and will monitor incoming data. The central bank has cut rates once this year by 25 basis points, less than the easing carried out by many of its Southeast Asian peers."

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. producer prices increased by the most in six months in October, lifted by gains in the costs of goods and services, further bolstering the Federal Reserve's stance that it will probably not cut interest rates again in the near term.
The report from the Labor Department on Thursday showed healthcare costs accelerated last month, with the cost of outpatient care at hospitals posting its largest rise since 2009. The jump in healthcare prices mirrored gains reported in October's consumer price index report on Wednesday. Still, underlying producer inflation remained muted last month.
Stabilizing inflation follows in the wake of fairly upbeat data on the economy, including better-than-expected job growth in October and a pickup in services sector activity, which have eased financial market fears of a recession.
There have also been hopeful signs in the 16-year trade war between the United States and China, which has pressured business investment and manufacturing. 
The U.S. central bank last month cut rates for the third time this year and signaled a pause in the easing cycle that started in July when it reduced borrowing costs for the first time since 2008. Fed Chair Jerome Powell again reiterated that position in testimony before lawmakers on Thursday.
""Inflation needs to accelerate noticeably for the Fed to consider raising interest rates, and that doesn't appear to be in the cards,"" said Ryan Sweet, a senior economist at Moody's Analytics in West Chester, Pennsylvania. 
The producer price index for final demand rose 0.4% last month, the biggest increase since April, after falling 0.3% in September. In the 12 months through October, the PPI climbed 1.1%, the smallest increase since October 2016, after advancing 1.4% in the 12 months through September. 
Annual producer inflation retreated as last year's hefty gain dropped out of the calculation. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the PPI would rise 0.3% in October and climb 0.9% on a year-on-year basis.
Excluding the volatile food, energy and trade services components, producer prices edged up 0.1% after being unchanged in September. The so-called core PPI increased 1.5% in the 12 months through October after gaining 1.7% in the 12 months through September. Annual core PPI also slowed last month as last October's increase dropped out of the calculation. 
The government reported on Wednesday that consumer prices rose solidly in October amid large gains in healthcare costs and prices of used cars and trucks.
The Fed, which has a 2% annual inflation target, tracks the core personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index for monetary policy. The core PCE price index rose 1.7% on a year-on-year basis in September and has undershot its target this year. October PCE price data will be published later this month.
The dollar (DXY) was little changed against a basket of currencies, while U.S. Treasury prices rose. Stocks on Wall Street were mixed.
SOLID LABOR MARKET
While another report from the Labor Department on Thursday showed the number of Americans filing claims for unemployment benefits rose to a five-month high last week, that likely does not signal a shift in labor market conditions as claims for several states were estimated because of Monday's holiday. 
Initial claims for state unemployment benefits increased 14,000 to a seasonally adjusted 225,000 for the week ended Nov. 9, the highest reading since June 22. Some of the states, including California, Pennsylvania and Virginia, did not have enough time to process the claims data because of Monday's Veterans Day holiday, leading to them making estimates.
The four-week moving average of initial claims, considered a better measure of labor market trends as it irons out week-to-week volatility, rose only 1,750 to 217,000 last week.
""This cannot be viewed as anything but noise,"" said John Ryding, chief economist at RDQ Economics in New York. ""We would not view claims as sending a troubling growth signal until the four-week average approaches 250,000.""
Labor market strength, marked by the lowest unemployment rate in nearly 50 years, is supporting consumer spending and helping to offset some of the hit on the economy from the U.S.-China trade war.
In October, wholesale energy prices rebounded 2.8% after dropping 2.5% in September. They were boosted by a 7.3% surge in gasoline prices, which followed a 7.2% decline in September.
Gasoline accounted for nearly half of the 0.7% increase in goods prices last month. Goods prices fell 0.4% in September. 
Wholesale food prices jumped 1.3% in October after rising 0.3% in September. There was still no sign that the trade tariffs were boosting producer inflation, with core goods prices unchanged last month after slipping 0.1% in September.
The cost of services increased 0.3% last month, reversing September's 0.2% decrease. Services were lifted by a 0.8% surge in trade services, which measure changes in margins received by wholesalers and retailers. 
There were also increases in the cost of healthcare services, which accelerated 0.8% after gaining 0.3% in the prior month. The cost of hospital outpatient care jumped 0.7%, the most since July 2009. Inpatient care prices rose 0.6%, the biggest increase since October 2018. Those healthcare costs feed into the core PCE price index. 

But portfolio management fees, which also go into the calculation of the core PCE price index fell 0.9% after being unchanged in September. That led economists to expect that the core PCE price index gained 0.2% in October following a flat reading in September. The annual increase in the Core PCE price index is seen steady at 1.7% in October.

LONDON (Reuters) - British consumers, whose spending has helped the economy through the Brexit crisis, cut back on their shopping in October, according to official data that adds to signs the economy is losing momentum.
An unexpected fall in sales in October pushed retail growth over the last three months to its weakest since April 2018, the Office for National Statistics said on Thursday.
The downbeat news follows official figures earlier this week that showed the economy as a whole grew at its weakest annual rate since 2010 in the third quarter of this year, while the number of people in work dropped sharply.
A strong job market and solid consumer spending have helped keep Britain's economy afloat since the Brexit referendum in June 2016, as businesses have cut investment and manufacturers have suffered more recently from the U.S.-China trade conflict.
""These latest ONS figures are symptomatic of the challenges facing the retail sector after a year fraught with uncertainty,"" said Lynda Petherick, head of retail at management consultants Accenture (NYSE:ACN).
Prime Minister Boris Johnson has called an early election for Dec. 12 in an attempt to get a large enough majority to pass Brexit legislation before a new deadline of Jan. 31, something he hopes will restore business confidence.
However, many economists fear that even if he gets his way, the risk of serious disruption to Britain's trade ties with the European Union will soon be back on the agenda, due to his aim of moving to new trading arrangements by the end of 2020.
The Bank of England warned last week it may need to cut interest rates if global trade conflicts and Brexit uncertainty do not end, and two of its policymakers have already voted to loosen policy.
Thursday's data showed retail sales volumes unexpectedly fell by 0.1%, and annual sales growth held at 3.1%, bucking average forecasts for a pick-up to 3.7%.
In the three months to October sales rose just 0.2% compared with the previous three months, an 18-month low.
Measures that exclude spending on motor fuel - which some economists think give a truer picture of underlying consumer demand - were weaker still, and fell below all forecasts in Reuters' poll of economists.
The only retailers to do well in October were department stores, which the ONS said benefited from sales promotions and an earlier introduction of Christmas lines.
Supermarket group Sainsbury's (L:SBRY) said last week that it expected to trade well in the run-up to Christmas but feared a consumer hangover in early 2020 if Brexit was unresolved.
Baby products retailer Mothercare (L:MTC) is set to close its British stores with the loss of at least 2,500 jobs under the weight of the pressures plaguing the retail sector, including online competition."

BERLIN (Reuters) - The German economy narrowly avoided an expected slip into recession in the third quarter as consumers, state spending and construction drove a 0.1% quarterly expansion in Europe's largest economy.
On an annual basis, German gross domestic product expanded 0.5% from July through September after a 0.3% expansion in the previous three months, seasonally adjusted figures from the Federal Statistics Office showed on Thursday.
""The German economy got away with a black eye: the technical recession could be avoided,"" Deka bank analyst Andreas Scheuerle said. But he added that it is still too early to give the all-clear.
The economy is ""suffering from enormous global political uncertainty"" and its flagship industry, the automobile sector, is not running smoothly anymore, Scheuerle said.
Manufacturers, whose exports have been a bedrock of German economic strength for decades, are struggling with weaker foreign demand, tariff disputes sparked by U.S. President Donald Trump's trade policies and business uncertainty linked to Britain's decision to leave the European Union.
The automobile sector, a key driver of overall growth, is also having trouble adjusting to stricter regulation following an emission cheating scandal and managing a broader shift away from combustion engines toward electric cars.
""We do not have a technical recession, but the growth numbers are still too weak,"" Economy Minister Peter Altmaier told ARD public television.
FISCAL STIMULUS
Finance Minister Olaf Scholz has suggested abolishing the Soli income tax surcharge for most employees from 2021, which could boost household spending by providing overall stimulus worth about 10 billion euros a year.
Speaking to the Bundestag lower house of parliament, Scholz defended his decision that high-income people should continue to pay the 5.5% surcharge. Despite criticism from Chancellor Angela Merkel's conservative bloc, lawmakers passed the plan with the support of majority of the ruling coalition.
The BDI industry association called on Berlin to abolish the surcharge for all employees and bring the move forward to 2020 - a move which would cost the government another 10 billion euros.
""The federal government must do more to increase public investment and improve conditions for private investment,"" BDI Managing Director Joachim Lang said.
France, where growth this year is expected to overtake that of Germany thanks to its more domestically driven economy, has already implemented a package to counter the ""yellow vest"" protests of the last year.
The French package worth 10 billion euros is made up mainly of tax breaks for low-income workers and pensioners this year, followed by a 5 billion euro cut in income tax next year.
The European Commission expects the French economy to grow 1.3% this year while in Germany it expects a 0.4% expansion.
Eurostat said on Thursday that the combined economy of the 19 countries sharing the euro grew 0.2% in the third quarter from the second, giving a 1.2% year-on-year expansion.
SLOWDOWN IN CHINA
Germany's Statistics Office said private households increased their spending from July through September while state spending and construction also supported overall growth.
Exports edged up on the quarter while imports remained broadly flat, the office said, suggesting that net trade could have been a positive impulse on the economy as well.
Alexander Krueger from Bankhaus Lampe said that he expected more meager growth rates in the coming quarters as the trade outlook remained clouded. ""The economic slowdown in China, the global trade dispute and the Brexit chaos are all pointing to a weaker economic momentum,"" Krueger said.
The Statistics Office revised the quarterly GDP rate for the second quarter to a 0.2% quarter-on-quarter contraction from a previously reported 0.1% decline.
But it revised up the growth figures for the first quarter to a 0.5% quarterly expansion from a 0.4% increase reported earlier.
Analysts polled by Reuters for the third quarter had expected a 0.1% contraction quarter-on-quarter and a 0.5% expansion year-on-year in seasonally adjusted terms."

Germany narrowly dodged its first recession in six years, putting a damper on speculation that the government will add fiscal stimulus any time soon.
The surprise expansion doesn’t change the fact that the economy is going through a torrid period that’s turned it from the euro area’s traditional growth engine into a source of weakness. A pile up of trade tensions, weaker global demand and turmoil in the automobile sector has led to the worst manufacturing slump in a decade and put question marks over the country’s role as an economic powerhouse.
The 0.1% increase in gross domestic product was led by consumer and government spending. Construction and exports also rose, while investment in machinery and equipment fell. The contraction in the second quarter -- which had sparked months of recession speculation -- was revised to 0.2% from 0.1%.
The euro rose after the report and traded little changed at $1.1001 at 8:18 a.m. Frankfurt time.
“I would put mild positive as a descriptor on the German GDP report,” said Jim McDonald, chief investment strategist at  Northern Trust  (NASDAQ:NTRS) Bank. “German is the point of the spear when it comes to manufacturing and especially exposure to China,” but “but consumer spending across all of Europe has been holding up better.”
There have been some signs recently that the economy may be through the worst of its downturn. Business sentiment appears to have stabilized, and investor confidence about the outlook is improving. But it’s far from an all-clear, with most key indicators still at multi-year lows and the economy expected to post sub 1% growth in 2019 and 2020.
The global economy also remains under pressure. Separate data Thursday showed Chinese growth spluttering, with factory output slowing, investment growth at a record low and consumption coming off the boil. In Japan, expansion cooled sharply in the third quarter.
The pain has been felt across the major names in German corporate royalty, with firms from Siemens to BASF repeatedly warning that trade fights are hitting sentiment and investment.
Upheaval in the car industry from emissions and the switch to electric engines have compounded the slump, and there’s little end in sight. Parts maker  Continental AG  (DE:CONG) said two days ago it sees no material improvement in global car production in the next five years.
What Bloomberg’s Economists Say
“The question remains how much of the weakness in manufacturing will spread to services. Our base case is that some of the damage will be transmitted, keeping growth slow, but that a downturn will be avoided.”
--Jamie Rush. Read the GERMANY REACT
Economic concerns weighed on bond yields, and German 10-year borrowing costs have been below zero for six months. It also meant Germany faced a growing chorus of calls to unleash fiscal stimulus. Among those voices was the European Central Bank, which loosened monetary policy in September to help the euro area and upped its push for public spending.
The German government’s response was that it would act if there was a crisis, and that wasn’t the case now. Finance Minister Olaf Scholz has said the country is in a “stable economic situation,” and he’s likely to feel vindicated by Thursday’s figures.
Economy Minister Peter Altmaier, speaking on ARD television shortly after the data were published, said characterized growth as “still too weak.”
“That means the upward trend has started but it’s proceeding very slowly,” he said.
Much hinges on developments in the U.S.-China trade battles that have dominated the global economic landscape. The danger of U.S. levies on European automobiles isn’t fully off the table, suggesting manufacturing momentum will remain subdued.
Consumers have also become wary. Households’ assessment of the growth outlook is at a seven-year low, financial expectations are deteriorating rapidly and fears of unemployment are rising.
“In a trade war, tariffs are only part of the problem,” Bloomberg economists David Powell and Dan Hanson wrote. “Uncertainty -- damping consumers’ appetite to buy and businesses’ incentives to invest -- can create a bigger drag on growth.”

BEIJING (Reuters) - China's factory output growth slowed significantly more than expected in October, as weakness in global and domestic demand and the drawn-out Sino-U.S. trade war weighed on broad segments of the world's second-largest economy.
Industrial production rose 4.7% year-on-year in October, data from the National Bureau of Statistics released on Thursday showed, below the median forecast of 5.4% growth in a Reuters poll and slower than September's 5.8%.
Indicators showed other sectors also slowed significantly and missed forecasts with retail sales growth back near a 16-year trough and fixed asset investment growth the weakest on record.
The disappointing numbers show China off to a rough start in the final three months of 2019 and will bolster calls for Beijing to roll out fresh support after third quarter growth slowed to its weakest in almost three decades, with factory production bruised by the trade war with Washington.
Asian stocks fell after the soft data, which reinforced concerns the trade war was hurting one of the world's major drivers of economic growth.
""These data support our view that growth headwinds remain strong and the economy has yet to hit bottom,"" said Nomura in a note, adding that GDP growth is expected to slow to 5.8% in the fourth quarter from 6.0% in the third quarter.
Broad activity in China's factory sector remained weak in October with producer prices falling at their fastest pace in more than three years and manufacturing activity mired in contraction for a six straight month, recent indicators showed.
Thursday's data showed the value of delivered industrial exports fell 3.8% on-year in October, marking the third straight month of declines.
China's steel output fell to a seven-month low in October while the cement production contracted for the first time in over a year, compared with a year earlier.
The tariff war between China and the United States has hit global demand, disrupted supply chains and upended financial markets.
Other major trading powers have also felt the blow from the dispute with Japan's economy grinding to a near standstill in the third quarter, posting its weakest growth in a year.
While some signs of recent progress in trade negotiations between the superpowers have cheered financial market, officials from both sides have so far avoided any firm commitments to end their dispute.
That uncertainty has weighed persistently on manufacturers and their order books in recent months and raised doubts about the prospects of any breakthrough.
""Even if a minor deal is agreed upon in the coming months, this would merely allow the focus to shift to the more intractable issues that we think will eventually lead the trade talks to break down,"" Capital Economics China Economist Martin Lynge Rasmussen said.
RECORD-LOW INVESTMENT
Fixed asset investment, a key driver of economic growth, rose just 5.2% from January-October, against expected growth of 5.4% and the weakest pace since Reuters record began in 1996.
Infrastructure investment rose 4.2% in the first 10 months, slowing from a 4.5% gain in January-September.
In a bid to stop this trend, China's State Council on Wednesday pledged to lower the minimum capital ratio requirement for some infrastructure investment projects.
At the same time, local governments are facing increasing fiscal strains as tax cuts and the broader slowdown reduce revenues, hampering the big infrastructure projects Beijing needs to revive growth.
Meanwhile, China's property investment and sales growth both eased to three-months low in October, suggesting a critical pillar of the economy is softening.
Retail sales rose 7.2% year-on-year in October, missing expected growth of 7.9% and matching the more than 16-year low hit in April.
Consumers have been hit with higher food prices over the past few months, as pork and other meat prices soared. For October, they bought fewer garments, jewelry, automobiles from a year earlier.
SUPPORT ON THE WAY
To prop up growth, China's central bank this month cut the interest rate on its one-year medium-term lending facility loans, a key policy rate, for the first time since early 2016.
Analysts said the cut, while modest, may be a sign the central bank is becoming more proactive and looking to ease worries that higher inflation will prevent it from delivering fresh stimulus.
""Economic performance still faces a fairly large number of risks and challenges and these cannot be underestimated. In the next stage, we will...continue to fully implement counter-cyclical adjustment policies,"" statistics bureau spokeswoman Liu Aihua told reporters in a briefing.
Earlier this week, Premier Li Keqiang flagged the need for the more effective use of economic support tools, such as ""counter-cyclical adjustments"" and local government special bonds.
In a front-page editorial on Thursday, the state-owned Securities Times said authorities should tolerate longer-term increases in China's debt-to-gross domestic product ratio to allow for changing economic conditions."
157,By Bloomberg,"<span>Nov 13, 2019 11:32PM ET</span>",Australian Unemployment Unexpectedly Climbs; Currency Drops,"(Bloomberg) -- Australia’s unemployment rate increased and the economy shed jobs for the first time in 17 months, a surprise result adding to evidence that central bank interest-rate cuts are failing to gain much traction.
The jobless rate advanced to 5.3% in October from 5.2%, data from the statistics bureau showed Thursday; economists had expected it to hold at 5.2%. Highlighting the labor market slack, the under-utilization rate, which combines unemployment and under-employment, rose 0.3 point to 13.8%.
The currency declined and money markets boosted bets on a rate cut in February as the jobless rate exceeded 5.2%, where the Reserve Bank had predicted it to remain through next year. Almost out of conventional policy ammunition to galvanize the economy, RBA Governor Philip Lowe may need to lean heavily on a depreciating currency to bolster exporters and lift inflation.
“Australia’s latest labor force figures make another rate cut a certainty,” said Callam Pickering, an economist at global jobs website Indeed Inc., who previously worked at the central bank. “To kick-start the economy we will need greater stimulus. Much more needs to be done, whether it be through further rate cuts, unconventional monetary policy or, in an ideal world, fiscal stimulus.”
Unorthodox Policies
To date, the government has resisted Lowe’s calls for fiscal support, fueling speculation the central bank will have to turn to unorthodox policies next year. The governor is due to speak on the subject later this month.
The data showed New South Wales, the most populous state, led unemployment higher, with its rate rising to 4.8% in October from 4.5% a month earlier. Victoria, the next biggest, edged up to 4.8% versus 4.7%. The northern state of Queensland led job losses, shedding 14,000 positions, with NSW losing 10,300.
The RBA has cut rates three times since June seeking to boost hiring and investment, but so far the easing has shown little impact apart from the housing market. The decision to resume cutting aimed in part to prevent the Aussie dollar from rebounding in response to renewed easing by the Federal Reserve.
The U.S. central bank has now signaled it’s on hold after cutting 75 basis points -- the same as the RBA -- and Lowe left rates unchanged last week.
The Aussie dollar slipped to 68.08 U.S. cents at 12:08 p.m. in Sydney, from around 68.38 before the data.
Resilient Market
The central bank forecasts unemployment to hold around 5.2% through the end of 2020 and for wage growth to remain at 2.3% through 2021. This suggests an acceptance that its strategy of trying to push the jobless rate down to 4.5% -- estimated full employment -- to spark wage growth and return inflation to the 2%-3% target is unlikely to achieve its goals for a while yet.
Still, Australia’s labor market has remained remarkably resilient over the past 12 months. Hiring has held up even as the economy decelerated sharply, expanding at an annual 1.4% rate in the most recent reading, about half its estimated speed limit.
Even then, the strong employment failed to translate into a lower jobless rate, as new positions were filled by new entrants to the labor market.
The RBA is betting that a combination of rate cuts and government tax rebates will eventually encourage consumers to spend and keep the economy ticking. Rising house prices and the associated wealth effect are expected to help that cause."

159,By Bloomberg,"<span>Nov 13, 2019 11:31PM ET</span>",Japan’s Economy Decelerates Sharply Amid Trade Tensions,"(Bloomberg) -- Japan’s economy slowed sharply in the third quarter as overall exports continued to fall amid trade tensions and a shopping splurge before a sales tax increase ran down stockpiles of goods.
The deceleration comes as Prime Minister Shinzo Abe mulls the size of an economic stimulus package aimed at shielding Japan’s economy from the global slowdown and the impact of the tax hike. Abe may also need to consider the implications of Tokyo’s trade spat with Seoul, as a steep decline in Korean tourist numbers dragged on the economy.
Gross domestic product grew at an annualized pace of 0.2% in the three months through September from the previous quarter, the Cabinet Office said Thursday, stuttering from revised growth of 1.8% in the April-June period. Economists had forecast a 0.9% expansion.
Stronger business investment combined with robust consumer spending before last month’s tax hike helped prop up growth, though rush demand was weaker than expected. The softer jump in consumer spending before the tax increase suggests an expected contraction in the economy in the current quarter will be smaller than feared.
“Given today’s data, I think fiscal spending of 3 trillion yen ($28 billion) would be sufficient for an economic package to keep the economy going,” said Takashi Shiono, economist at  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) Group AG. If the package turns out to be 4 trillion yen or more, that would likely prompt economists to revise up their forecasts for the economy, he added.
Abe ordered the stimulus measures last week as Japan’s economy shows sign of losing momentum, hit by soft global demand amid the U.S.-China trade war, the tensions with Korea and natural disasters such as Typhoon Hagibis. Those factors put growth in a vulnerable spot, given concerns over a cooling of consumer spending after the tax hike.
Japan’s Abe Calls for Extra Spending for Disaster Relief, Growth
While an influential member of Abe’s ruling party has said government spending of more than 6 trillion yen ($55 billion) is needed, the size and timing of the measures have yet to be announced.
Fiscal measures will likely reduce the need for the Bank of Japan to add stimulus, barring a major deterioration of economic data or a slide in markets, though speculation rumbles on that the BOJ will lower its negative rate by January. The smaller jump in quarterly spending will also reassure the central bank, which has flagged the impact of the tax hike as a concern.
The gain in private consumption was less than a quarter the size of the bump that came before the last sales tax hike in 2014. That suggests Japan’s economy will suffer less damage from the tax hike than five years ago, when a boom in consumption was followed by a bust that triggered a 7.3% economic contraction in the following quarter.
Temporary Pain
Falling service exports was the dark spot on trade, outweighing a slight improvement in shipments of goods overseas. That reflected a sharp drop in spending by Korean tourists as they chose other destinations or stayed home amid the dispute with Japan, a point highlighted by economy minister Yasutoshi Nishimura. The spat between the two neighboring economies has its roots in a dispute over Japan’s colonial past.
Still, economists said they didn’t expect the dispute with Korea to further depress growth in coming quarters given that exports of key items for Korea’s tech sector haven’t fallen in the way feared. That likely leaves tourist sentiment as a passing factor for Japan’s economy.
“I think the slump in the number of Korean tourists is already bottoming out. This time, the figures showed the worst extent of the impact, but I don’t think things will get deteriorate from here,” said Atsushi Takeda, chief economist at Itochu Research Institute Inc.
What Bloomberg’s Economists Say
“The undershoot in 3Q GDP growth suggests the slump in 4Q due to the higher sales tax is likely to be less severe than expected. The slowdown was driven mainly by a drag from net exports as imports picked up on front-loaded demand.”-- Yuki Masujima, senior economist

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australian employment suffered its sharpest fall in three years last month, data showed on Thursday, underlining the need for urgent stimulus to revive economic activity and wages.
The local dollar fell a third of a cent to $0.6806 as the market narrowed the odds on a rate cut from the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) in December, though it was still considered an outside chance.
The disappointing report will also pile political pressure on the conservative government of Prime Minister Scott Morrison to launch a fiscal rescue package for the economy.
Morrison has so far resisted all calls for action, in part by citing continued strength of the labor market.
That position will be harder to defend given net new jobs fell 19,000 in October, the largest drop since late 2016. The unemployment rate also nudged up to 5.3%, reversing a promising dip in September.
Analysts polled by Reuters had forecast a gain of 15,000 jobs and an unemployment rate of 5.3%
""Slower employment growth also presents an additional challenge for the RBA's outlook for a recovery in consumer spending,"" said NAB economist Kaixin Owyong.
""Ideally the government would step in to deliver additional fiscal stimulus, but if this fails to eventuate he RBA could adopt unconventional policy and cut the cash rate to 0.25%.""
The central bank has already cut rates three times to an historic low of 0.75%, but so far the only impact has been a revival in home price inflation.
Financial markets imply around a 24% probability of a quarter-point easing at the RBA's next meeting on Dec. 3, rising to 62% for February.
Just last week the RBA threw in the towel on getting wages going, forecasting miserly annual growth of 2.3% right out to 2021. Indeed, data out on Wednesday showed wage growth actually went backward to 2.2% in the September quarter.
EVERYONE WANTS TO PARTICIPATE
Up until now, Australia's problem was not a dearth of hiring. Some 251,800 net new positions were created in the year to October, with the majority full time.
Annual jobs growth ran at a solid 2.0%, comfortably above the latest U.S. performance of 1.4%.
The trouble, ironically, is that the labor market has proved too flexible in providing the workers needed to fill those jobs. All the growth in employment was met by an increased supply of labor, thus keeping the jobless rate up.
Participation in the workforce is up near record peaks at 66.0% and, adding in those who want to work more hours, the underutilization rate was a high 13.8%.
This phenomenon is partly a direct result of government policy. Extending child care and disability payments have lifted the share of females in the workforce to all-time peaks.
The conservative government of Prime Minister Scott Morrison has also kept the doors wide open to skilled migration, with net arrivals running at almost 300,000 in the year to September, the highest in more than five years.
It has also imposed caps on pay rises for the public sector which has kept growth well under 3% for every year since 2013."

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's economy grew at the slowest pace in a year in the third quarter as the U.S.-China trade war and soft global demand knocked exports, keeping policymakers under pressure to ramp up fiscal and monetary stimulus to bolster a fragile recovery.
Growth in private consumption also cooled from the previous quarter, casting doubt on the Bank of Japan's view that robust domestic demand will offset the impact from intensifying global risks.
The world's third-largest economy grew an annualized 0.2% in the third quarter, slowing sharply from a revised 1.8% expansion in April-June, preliminary gross domestic product (GDP) data released by the government showed on Thursday.
It fell well short of a median market forecast for a 0.8% gain and marked the weakest growth since a 2.0% contraction in July-September last year.
""Domestic demand had made up for some of the weakness in external demand, but we can't count on this to continue,"" said Taro Saito, executive research fellow at NLI Research Institute.
""A contraction in October-December GDP is a done deal. The economy may rebound early next year, but will lack momentum.""
The feeble data may heighten calls from lawmakers for the government to boost fiscal spending to support the economy, which many fear will take a hit from a sales tax hike that took effect in October.
Private consumption grew 0.4% in July-September, slowing from a 0.6% increase in the previous quarter, despite stronger demand from households which sought to beat the October tax hike.
Capital spending, a rare bright spot in the economy, rose 0.9% in the third quarter, accelerating from the previous three months. That helped domestic demand add 0.2 percentage point to growth.
But external demand knocked 0.2 percentage point off GDP growth, as exports were hit by the protracted China-U.S. trade war that has upended world supply chains and hurt the global economy.
TRADE WAR STRAINS
Markets have been on edge in the past month as the United States and China seek to complete an initial trade deal to de-escalate their bitter tariff row. 
U.S. President Donald Trump on Tuesday dangled the prospect of completing the initial deal with China ""soon,"" but has so far offered no new details on the negotiations.
The dispute has already hit big exporters hard. Japanese electronic giant Panasonic Corp (T:6752) last month reported a 12% drop in its second-quarter operating profit due to slumping sales of electric components to factory owners.
Economy Minister Yasutoshi Nishimura said while Japan's economy is likely to continue recovering moderately, the government will be vigilant to the impact from global risks and the sales tax hike.
""The fundamentals underpinning consumption remains firm. But consumer sentiment is weak, so we need to keep an eye out on developments,"" he told reporters after the GDP's release.
The data comes as the government plans to compile a package of measures for disaster relief and to protect the economy from heightening global risks.
The BOJ kept monetary policy steady last month but signaled its readiness to maintain or even cut already low interest rates to underpin a fragile recovery.
Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's administration proceeded with a twice-delayed sales tax hike to 10% from 8% in October as part of efforts to fix Japan's tattered finances.

Government officials say the hit to growth from the tax hike will be smaller than the previous increase to 8% from 5% in 2014, because of measures the administration has already taken to ease the impact on households.

Those figures reflected the second full budget year under U.S. President Donald Trump, a Republican, and a time when the country had an expanding tax base with moderate economic growth and an unemployment rate near a 50-year low.
When adjusted for calendar effects, the deficit for October remained at $134 billion compared with an adjusted deficit of $113 billion in October 2018."

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. consumer prices jumped by the most in seven months in October, which together with abating fears of a recession, support the Federal Reserve's signal for no further interest rate cuts in the near term.
The report from the Labor Department on Wednesday showed healthcare costs surging by the most in more than three years and recreation posting its biggest gain since early 1996. But a moderation in rents suggested inflation would remain contained.
The U.S. central bank last month cut rates for the third time this year and signaled a pause in the easing cycle that started in July when it reduced borrowing costs for the first time since 2008. That stance was reiterated by Fed Chair Jerome Powell in prepared testimony to lawmakers on Wednesday.
""There is little reason for the Fed to cut rates again anytime soon,"" said Joel Naroff, chief economist at Naroff Economic Advisors in Holland, Pennsylvania. ""Inflation is not trending downward, the economy is just where so many of us thought it always was ... that is, modest to moderate growth.""
The consumer price index increased 0.4% last month as households also paid more for energy products, food and other goods. That was the largest gain in the CPI since March and followed an unchanged reading in September.
In the 12 months through October, the CPI increased 1.8% after climbing 1.7% in September.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the CPI advancing 0.3% in October and gaining 1.7% on a year-on-year basis.
Excluding the volatile food and energy components, the CPI rose 0.2% after edging up 0.1% in September. The increase in the so-called core CPI was limited by the retreat in rents, which blunted somewhat the surge in healthcare costs and prices of used cars and trucks and recreation.
In the 12 months through October, the core CPI increased 2.3% after rising 2.4% in September.
The Fed tracks the core personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index for its 2.0% inflation target.

Though upbeat on the economy, Powell continued to describe inflation as ""muted.""
The dollar briefly rose against a basket of currencies before ceding gains to trade flat. U.S. Treasury prices rose, while stocks on Wall Street were mixed.
RENTS RETREAT
Firming inflation comes on the heels of fairly upbeat data, including better-than-expected job growth in October and an acceleration in services sector activity.
There has also been a de-escalation of trade tensions between the United States and China. President Donald Trump on Tuesday said Washington was close to signing a ""phase one"" trade deal with Beijing, but provided no new details on negotiations.
Last month's jump in healthcare costs suggest an uptick in the core PCE price index last month. October producer price data due to be published on Thursday will shed more light on the core PCE price index, which will be released later this month.
In October, energy prices vaulted 2.7% after falling 1.4% in the prior month. Energy prices, which were also driven by more expensive electricity, accounted for more than half of the increase in the CPI last month.
Gasoline prices rebounded 3.7% after declining 2.4% in September. Food prices climbed 0.2%, rising for a second straight month. Food consumed at home gained 0.3%.
Owners' equivalent rent of primary residence, which is what a homeowner would pay to rent or receive from renting a home, climbed 0.2% in October after rising 0.3% in September. Other shelter categories also softened last month.
The cost of hotel and motel accommodation dropped 3.8%. As a result, the rent index edged up 0.1% last month, the smallest gain since April 2011. But with rental vacancy rates remaining low, rents are likely to trend higher.
Healthcare costs surged 1.0% last month, the most since August 2016, after climbing 0.2% in September. Healthcare costs were boosted by strong increases in the costs of hospital services and prescription medication. Healthcare costs increased 4.3% on a year-on-year basis in October.
""Fed officials should go to the doctor if they think there is no inflation in the economy,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG in New York.Used motor vehicles and trucks prices increased 1.3% after decreasing 1.6% in September. The cost of recreation surged 0.7%, the largest increase since February 1996. Consumers also paid more for personal care products.
There was no sign that a recent increase in tariffs on a range of imported Chinese consumer goods were impacting consumer prices. Apparel prices fell 1.8% after dropping 0.4% in the prior month. Prices for household furnishings declined 0.2%.
Prices for new motor vehicles declined for a fourth straight month. There were also decreases in the costs of household furnishings and airline fares.
Last month's rise in overall inflation ate into households' purchasing power, which could contribute to slowing consumer spending.
""While we expect the trend in inflation to firm, dimmer prospects for U.S. growth amid the ongoing trade war will likely prevent inflation from breaking meaningfully above the Fed’s target in the near-term,"" said Sarah House, a senior economist at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) Securities in Charlotte, North Carolina."

Russian economic growth accelerated to 1.7% in the third quarter, the fastest pace this year, after the central bank slashed borrowing costs in four consecutive rate cuts.
The latest growth number, a preliminary reading, is a sharp acceleration from 0.9% in the second quarter and matched the median estimate in a Bloomberg survey.
“Industrial production, mining and extraction, and wholesale trade, especially in natural gas, supported growth in the third quarter,” Pavel Malkov, the head of the agency, said at a press briefing in Moscow.
Monetary easing has helped to support consumer demand that was battered by half a decade of shrinking incomes. But economists say further economic growth will be limited without fiscal stimulus. A multi-year infrastructure spending project has so far been slow to get off the ground, but could be a bigger contributor to the economy next year.
“Growth is rebounding, but beneath the headline data demand remains weak,” said Scott Johnson, an economist at Bloomberg Economics. “The economy needs stimulus to keep the recovery going, and fortunately there’s more on the way.”
The Economy Ministry said in a report published Wednesday that budget stimulus may only give a temporary boost to growth.

The core consumer price index, which excludes volatile food and energy costs, rose 2.3% from a year earlier, a Labor Department report showed Wednesday. That missed economist estimates, while the broader CPI climbed 0.4% and 1.8% annually, with both readings topping forecasts. The core measure was up 0.2% on the month, matching projections.
The subdued annual core reading, driven by a deceleration in rents, follows a third-straight Fed rate cut last month and signals that policy makers face a longer wait to see whether easing since July is spurring faster price gains. Low unemployment and tariffs on Chinese goods may support inflation, though Chinese and American negotiators are moving toward a deal to roll back levies.
President Donald Trump on Sept. 1 added tariffs on $112 billion of Chinese goods, on top of other levies already in effect. He said Tuesday that a deal is close, but the U.S. will “substantially” increase tariffs on China if the first step of a broader agreement isn’t reached.
Rents, Lodging
The measure for rent of primary residence rose 0.1% from a month earlier, the smallest gain since April 2011, Labor figures showed. The broader measure of shelter costs, which make up about a third of total CPI, also climbed 0.1% as prices for hotels and motels, which can be volatile, dropped by a record 4.4%.
Elsewhere, apparel prices fell 1.8% on the month, the most since March. New vehicle prices fell for a fourth month, while used-car prices rose 1.3% after a 1.6% decline in the prior month.
The Labor Department’s CPI tends to run higher than the Commerce Department’s personal consumption expenditures price index, which the Fed officially targets. The core PCE index that policy makers watch for a better read on underlying price trends has shown signs of firming in recent months, though September’s annual gain of 1.7% was below the 2% objective.
Fed Chairman Jerome Powell signaled at his press conference last month that the central bank is taking a pause on interest-rate cuts. Gauges of investors' and consumers' inflation expectations remain near historical lows.
Energy prices climbed 2.7% from the prior month, the most since April. Food costs rose 0.2%, the most since May, while expenses for medical care climbed 1% for the steepest increase in three years.
A separate Labor Department report Wednesday showed average hourly earnings, adjusted for price changes, fell 0.2% in October from a year earlier after no change in September. Higher inflation tends to erode wage gains.

WELLINGTON (Reuters) - New Zealand's central bank surprised investors by holding interest rates at an all-time low of 1% on Wednesday saying it saw no urgency to ease policy further, sending the kiwi dollar sharply higher.
Increases in wage growth and non-tradable inflation together with a weaker local dollar helped by a surprise 50 basis point cut in August, aided the Reserve Bank of New Zealand's (RBNZ)decision.
A majority of economists polled by Reuters had tipped an easing in the final policy meeting for the year.
Wednesday's call not to cut startled doves, sending the kiwi more than 1% higher to $0.6422. If gains are sustained, this would be biggest one-day percentage rise since late January.
Yields on two-year New Zealand bonds (NZ2YT=RR) jumped to a more than two year high.
Even so, the kiwi is down about 4.7% since the start of this year.
""We expect interest rates to remain low for a long time and it's a global phenomenon,"" RBNZ Chief Economist Yuong Ha told reporters. ""We'll keep watching the data and that will drive our decisions from here and we'll do what's required for that.
The RBNZ left the door ajar for further policy easing saying it was ""prepared to act"" if required. The central bank's own projections imply a 50/50 chance of a cut next year.
However, business sentiment remains subdued despite the policy easing. Economists expect at least one more cut to 0.75% as growth in the $200 billion economy is yet to pick up.
MARKET REACTION
Traders have complained about being wrong-footed by mixed messages from RBNZ Governor Adrian Orr in the past, but the central banker maintains he wants to reach a wider audience than just currency traders, analysts and bloggers.
Orr said the fact that analysts were again surprised by the RBNZ decision on Wednesday reflected deeper market uncertainties about the economy, and was not an attempt to catch investors off-guard.
""Market pricing and expectations have been moving around considerably... based on data coming in,"" said Orr.
He added that the RBNZ was seeking to be as transparent as possible.
""Today's decision shows that the RBNZ is not afraid to stare down financial markets,"" said Dominick Stephens, chief economist at Westpac, which changed its call twice in the days leading up to the decision. ""The RBNZ is certainly open to a February cut, depending on what happens to the data.""
Stephens said there were two key factors that could swing the decision.
""First, we expect the housing market will be much stronger than the RBNZ expects. However, the global financial and economic situation could worsen again before February,"" he noted.
Capital Economics said the bank was too optimistic about the prospects for growth in New Zealand.
""The Reserve Bank of New Zealand sounded cautious when it left rates on hold today but we believe that a deterioration in the economy will force the bank to 0.5% by early next year,"" Capital Economics analyst Ben Udy said in a note.
The RBNZ's dual mandate includes targeting employment, which has put the spotlight on labor figures. Data released last week showed unemployment ticked up from a decade low but was still below the bank's forecast in August.
Wednesday's rates hold echoed Australia's central bank, which kept policy unchanged at its meeting last week, having already delivered three rate cuts this year to a record low of 0.75%."

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australian wage growth dimmed last quarter while consumers remained gloomy in November, clouding the outlook for household consumption and suggesting more policy stimulus is needed to brighten the country's sluggish economy.
The wage price index rose 0.5% in the three months that ended September, in line with expectations but down from an already mediocre 0.6% in the June quarter, Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) data showed on Wednesday.
Annual wage growth, at 2.2%, slowed from 2.3% last quarter, when economists had expected it to hold steady.
Separately, a survey of Australian consumers showed sentiment remained below average despite three interest rate cuts since June, with pessimists outnumbering optimists.
The weak wage growth and consumer sentiment have weighed on consumption, which has become a ""key uncertainty"" for domestic outlook, forcing the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) to slash its benchmark rate to a record low of 0.75%.
""Wage growth remains one of the key challenges for the Australian economy,"" said Callam Pickering, economist at global job site Indeed. ""It is the key for household spending, inflation and monetary policy.""
RBA Governor Philip Lowe has repeatedly said wage growth of ""3 point something"" was needed to spark any inflation pressure.
Still, Wednesday's figures will be no surprise to the RBA, which only last week said forecast a subdued 2.3% pace through the end of 2021.
The data may, however, embarrass Australia's conservative government, which had predicted wage growth of 2.75% for the financial year ending June 2020 and 3.25% the following year.
The RBA has shown willingness to reduce rates further if needed. Senior officials have also publicly discussed the possibility of unconventional monetary policies in Australia such as quantitative easing or bond purchases.
Financial markets imply the cash rate at 0.5% by early next year, when many economists expect policymakers to launch QE.
HOUSING BOOM
Consumer sentiment, though dour, picked up in November from the previous month, led largely by a wider recovery in home prices across the country, Citi economist Josh Williamson noted.
Sentiment among mortgagees increased 4.9% while that of homeowners jumped 8.0%. The index measuring time to buy a dwelling improved by 2.1%.
The boost from housing was expected to stay with a research by ANZ Banking Group (AX:ANZ) and CoreLogic on Wednesday showing boom times in Australian home prices were set to return in the first half of next year.
Last month, home prices posted their biggest monthly increase since mid-2015, clocking a fourth straight month of gains. The annualized pace of price increase in Sydney has shot to 24%.
""If this trend continues, we could see property prices reach new highs early next year,"" said CoreLogic's head of research Tim Lawless.
However, economists reckon a housing boom is not enough to keep the RBA on the sidelines with wage growth remaining weak, unemployment seen edging up and measures of business confidence remaining sluggish.
""Ideally we need to see significant fiscal stimulus soon,"" said AMP Capital chief economist Shane Oliver. ""However, in the absence of fiscal stimulus soon, the pressure remains on the RBA where we expect to see more rate cuts, quantitative easing and more dovish forward guidance on rates."""

(Reuters) - The executive in charge of the No. 1 seaport for U.S. trade with China on Tuesday said importers were not stockpiling goods ahead of President Donald Trump's plan to slap 15% tariffs on cellphones, laptops, toys and other Chinese-made goods next month. 
Last year, U.S. importers rushed products from China to the Port of Los Angeles and other gateways to avoid such import duties - sending cargo volumes surging to record levels.
But volumes have softened as importers - who are grappling with excess goods and unexpected tariff-related costs - appear unwilling to take a similar bet ahead of the planned imposition of 15% tariffs on about $156 billion of Chinese products on Dec. 15. 
""Our outlook for the fourth quarter is extremely soft,"" said Gene Seroka, executive director of the Port of Los Angeles.
""We are not seeing any kind of advance like we saw last year in the third and fourth quarters because those inventory levels are not being worked down fast enough,"" Seroka said. 
Trump offered no resolution to the 16-month U.S.-China trade standoff in a highly anticipated speech on Tuesday. 
Importers are hoping for a deal that will suspend the Dec. 15 levies, said Jonathan Gold, vice president of supply chain and customs policy at the National Retail Federation.
""Last year a lot of folks spent a lot of time and money advancing (imports) before the Jan. 1 deadline that ended up getting postponed six months ... They got hit with extra costs,"" Gold said.
Trade with China accounted for roughly half of the nearly $300 billion in cargo handled by the Port of Los Angeles last year.
The Trump administration slapped the first tariffs on industrial components and technology goods from China in July 2018. China retailated with devastating duties on soybeans and other U.S. farm exports, and the U.S. escalated the battle by targeting a broader swath of Chinese goods. 
The trade standoff is taking a toll on the U.S. manufacturing, industrial and transportation sectors, raising concerns about the U.S. consumer economy ahead of the retail holiday season and next year's U.S. presidential election. 
October imports and exports at the Port of Los Angeles each dropped 19% as the U.S.-China trade war roiled global supply chains. 

Seroka forecast a 10% decline in combined imports and exports for November and said, ""December looks soft.""

172,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 12, 2019 05:58AM ET</span>",UK jobs fall by most in over four years as election nears,"By William Schomberg and David Milliken
LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's employers cut more jobs from July to September than in any quarter for four years, according to official data, which highlighted how the labour market is slowing as an election nears although the fall was smaller than economists forecast.
Strong jobs growth has been a silver lining of the Brexit crisis for British workers as companies hired staff rather than make longer-term commitments to investment.
The unemployment rate fell back to 3.8%, its lowest level since early 1975, the Office for National Statistics said.
But falls in the number of people in work, vacancies and the pace of wage growth added to signs of slowdown which prompted two Bank of England officials to vote for an interest rate cut last week. 
""Granted, the employment data can be volatile, and the recent drop is being driven by part-time employment. But the drop ... could be an early sign of a sharp softening in labour demand, and a broader turning point in the labour market,"" HSBC economist Chris Hare said.
However Samuel Tombs, an economist at consultancy Pantheon Macroeconomics, said the softening appeared gradual enough for the Bank of England to steer clear of any rate cut for now.
Sterling rose slightly after the figures were published.
The ONS said the number of people in employment fell by 58,000 to 32.753 million, less severe than the median forecast of a fall of 94,000 in a Reuters poll of economists.
But it represented the biggest decline since the three months to May 2015.
Total and basic pay both rose by 3.6%, weaker than all forecasts, although still comfortably above inflation.
Britain's economy grew by a decade-low 1.0% in the 12 months to September, hit by U.S-China trade tensions and the approach of a now postponed Brexit deadline on Oct. 31.
Prime Minister Boris Johnson, seeking to break the Brexit impasse, has called an election for Dec. 12. 
But many employers say the uncertainty is likely to continue even if Johnson wins the election as he must hammer out a new European Union trade deal before a deadline at the end of 2020.
Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn says he will renegotiate the Brexit divorce deal and call a new referendum.
The Brexit uncertainty has aggravated Britain's weak productivity record. 
Output per hour was flat in annual terms in the third quarter, an improvement from a 0.5% fall in the April-June period, the ONS said.
That measure of productivity has not grown since the second quarter of 2018, the longest such run in a decade.

Vacancies showed their biggest annual fall since the end of 2009 to 800,000.

ZEW said its monthly survey showed economic sentiment among investors jumped to -2.1 from -22.8 in October. Economists polled by Reuters had expected an improvement to -13.0.
A separate gauge measuring investor assessments of the economy's current conditions edged up to -24.7 from -25.3 in the previous month. Analysts had predicted a reading of -22.0.
""There is growing hope that the international economic policy environment will improve in the near future, which explains the sharp rise in the ZEW Indicator of Economic Sentiment in November,"" ZEW President Achim Wambach said.
U.S. punitive tariffs on car imports from the European Union have become less likely, and an agreement in the trade conflict between the United States and China is appearing more likely, Wambach said.
""In the meantime, the chances for an agreement between Great Britain and the EU and thus for a regulated withdrawal of Great Britain have noticeably increased,"" he said.
The German economy shrank by 0.1% in the second quarter, when household spending and state consumption were not enough to offset sluggish exports. Data due on Thursday is expected to show another contraction in the third quarter. That would mean that the German economy entered a technical recession.
U.S. President Donald Trump is scheduled on Tuesday to discuss his trade policy during a lunch time address at the Economic Club of New York.
The speech will be closely watched by investors searching for any encouraging news about his administration's long-running trade war with China and his repeated threats to increase import tariffs on European cars and vehicle parts.

ZEW’s index of expectations for the next six months increased to minus 2.1, compared with minus 22.8 last month. Economists had forecast a jump to minus 13. Measures of current conditions in Germany and of expectations for the euro zone also improved.
Economists predict Europe’s largest economy sank into a technical recession last quarter, with manufacturing in particular remaining stubbornly weak. While the U.S. and China might be closer to a partial trade accord and the Trump administration may punt a decision on whether to slap tariffs on European cars, the outlook still looks murky and British and European Union negotiators still haven’t found a way to avoid a no-deal Brexit.
“There is growing hope that the international economic policy environment will improve in the near future,” ZEW President Achim Wambach said in a statement.
Chancellor Angela Merkel’s economic advisers lowered their growth forecasts for this year and next, warning that the protracted industry slump threatens to draw down the broader economy.
The European Central Bank eased monetary policy in September to support the euro zone, but at the same time urged the governments of wealthier countries to step up fiscal spending to revive growth. President Christine Lagarde has echoed that sentiment since taking office.
Those calls have gone largely unanswered in Germany so far. Finance Minister Olaf Scholz has said the government is ready to act in moments of crisis but for now the country is in a “stable economic situation.” Merkel said the problem isn’t a shortage of money for investment, and there are sufficient projects in the pipeline."

BEIJING (Reuters) - New bank loans in China fell more than expected to the lowest in 22 months in October, but the drop was likely due to seasonal factors and policymakers are still expected to ramp up support for the cooling economy in coming months.
Chinese regulators have been trying to boost bank lending and lower financing costs for over a year, especially for smaller and private companies which generate a sizeable share of the country's economic growth and jobs.
But domestic demand remains sluggish as investment and consumption weakens, while escalating U.S.-China trade tensions weigh on exports, suggesting more policy stimulus is needed.
""We think the central bank will need to loosen policy more aggressively in the coming months in order to drive a turnaround in credit growth and prevent economic activity from slowing too abruptly,"" Julian Evans-Pritchard at Capital Economics said in a note.
Chinese banks extended 661.3 billion yuan ($94.55 billion) in new yuan loans in October - the weakest since December 2017, data from the central bank showed on Monday, down sharply from September and falling short of analyst expectations. 
Analysts polled by Reuters had predicted new yuan loans would fall to 800 billion yuan in October, down from 1.69 trillion yuan in September.
Household loans, mostly mortgages, fell to 421 billion yuan in October from 755 billion yuan in September, while corporate loans dipped to 126.2 billion yuan from 1.01 trillion yuan. 
""The data reflects weaker demand for credit from companies as their confidence has been affected by the trade war,"" said Nie Wen, a Shanghai-based economist at Hwabao Trust.
Broad M2 money supply in October grew 8.4% from a year earlier, central bank data showed on Monday, matching estimates of a forecast in the Reuters poll. It rose 8.4% in September.
Outstanding yuan loans grew 12.4% from a year earlier. Analysts had expected 12.5% growth, in line with September's 12.5%. 
ROOM FOR EASING SEEN LIMITED
Growth of outstanding total social financing (TSF), a broad measure of credit and liquidity in the economy, slowed to 10.7% in October from a year earlier and from 10.8% in September.
TSF includes off-balance sheet forms of financing that exist outside the conventional bank lending system, such as initial public offerings, loans from trust companies and bond sales.
In October, new TSF tumbled to 618.9 billion yuan - the lowest since July 2016 - from 2.27 trillion yuan in September. Analysts polled by Reuters had expected 1 trillion yuan.
The central bank is expected to maintain its policy easing to support growth, but room for further action could be limited by worries about debt and housing risks, as surging food costs push up consumer inflation, analysts said.
""The room for easing could be limited by factors including inflation, which could have some negative impact on the economy,"" Nie said. 
Data on Saturday showed China's producer prices fell the most in more than three years in October, while consumer inflation soared to the highest in nearly 8 years.
To support growth, the central bank has cut bank reserves seven times since early 2018 to spur lending - alongside modest lending rate cuts, while local governments have stepped up debt issuance to accelerate infrastructure spending.
Last month, the central bank cut the interest rate on its medium-term lending facility (MLF) for the first time since early 2016.
China's finance minister has said that local governments were on track to complete bond issuance within the 2.15 trillion yuan annual quota by the end of September.
The statistics bureau said last month that China would front-load some 2020 special local government bond issuance to this year.

China's economic growth slowed a near 30-year low of 6.0% in the third quarter. Growth is expected to cool to 6.2% in the whole of 2019 and then hit 5.9% in 2020, according to a Reuters poll.

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's economy grew at its slowest annual pace in nearly a decade during the three months to September as the global slowdown and Brexit worries hit manufacturing and business investment, official figures showed on Monday.
While the economy dodged outright recession, the rebound in quarterly growth was smaller than expected.
Output fell in August and September - when Britain looked at risk of leaving the European Union without a transition deal.
A month before an early election, finance minister Sajid Javid hailed what he called ""solid"" growth figures, a view challenged by the opposition Labour Party. 
""The fact that the government will be celebrating 0.1% growth in the last six months is a sign of how low their hopes and expectations for our economy are,"" Labour's top finance official John McDonnell said.
Economists said ongoing political uncertainty and a weak global backdrop could prompt the Bank of England to cut interest rates next year, even if Prime Minister Boris Johnson passes his Brexit deal before a new Jan. 31 deadline.
""Narrowly avoiding a recession is nothing to celebrate,"" said Tej Parikh, economist at the Institute of Directors. ""The UK economy has been in stop-start mode all year, with growth punctuated by the various Brexit deadlines."" 
Annual gross domestic product growth fell to 1.0% in the third quarter from 1.3% in the April-June period, the Office for National Statistics said, its lowest since early 2010.
This was weaker than the euro zone, which grew by 1.1%.
The quarterly growth rate recovered to 0.3% after contracting 0.2% in the three months to June when businesses wrestled with an overhang of raw materials stockpiled before the original Brexit deadline in March.
But it was a weaker rebound than the 0.4% growth predicted by the BoE and private sector economists.
BOE RATE CUT?
Britain's economy has lost momentum since the 2016 Brexit referendum, before which it typically grew more than 2% a year.
Last week the BoE nudged up its growth forecast for 2019 to 1.4% from 1.3%. This would be the same growth rate as last year and the weakest since the financial crisis. For 2020, the BoE expects a slowdown to 1.3%.
Two BoE policymakers voted to cut rates last week and others could follow if growth remains weak and uncertainty persists about the longer-term trade ties between Britain and the EU.
""The BoE forecasts an investment rebound if a Brexit deal removes no-deal risk but we think this is optimistic,"" said Nancy Curtin, chief investment officer at Close Brothers.
Business investment held steady in the third quarter but dropped by 0.6% on the year, the ONS said.
Manufacturing output fell more than expected, down 0.4% on the quarter and 1.8% on the year.

Household spending, which has been more resilient than business investment, due to low unemployment and rising wages, rose by 0.4% on the quarter. Government spending grew by 0.3%.

Britain dodged a recession ahead of the now-postponed Oct. 31 Brexit deadline, providing an election boost for Prime Minister Boris Johnson.
The economy grew 0.3% between July and September, avoiding a second straight quarter of contraction, the Office for National Statistics said on Monday. Still, the figures were weaker than expected and showed the economy had little momentum as it entered the fourth quarter.
Johnson is seeking a Conservative majority in a general election on Dec. 12 to push his Brexit deal through Parliament.
If he wins, Britain could be out of the European Union by the new deadline of Jan. 31. If he loses, Brexit could be delayed further, extending the uncertainty hanging over the economy, or the U.K. could see its most socialist government since the 1970s.
The rebound from the second quarter masked a fragile underlying picture, with GDP contracting in both August and September against a backdrop of Brexit uncertainty and slowing global growth.
It means the economy was losing strength as it entered a climatic year-end, explaining why two Bank of England official broke ranks to push for an interest-rate cut last week. The BOE expected an expansion of 0.4% in the quarter, in line with private-sector analysts.
Fragile Outlook
Economists expect growth to slow to 0.2% in the fourth quarter, with 2019 as a whole expanding just 1.2% -- the slowest pace since the financial crisis a decade ago. The outlook for 2020 depends on both the election and progress in Brexit.
A breakdown of the latest data revealed a familiar pattern, with solid consumer and government spending offsetting weak business investment. Services and construction expanded, while manufacturing flat-lined, with only a rebound in car production preventing the sector from declining.
There was little evidence of Brexit hoarding, with inventories actually falling over the quarter. That knocked 0.4 percentage point off growth. By contrast, they added 1.4 points in the first quarter ahead of the initial March 29 deadline to leave the EU. An unwinding of those stockpiles contributed to downturn in the following three months.
The quarterly GDP increase was due entirely to a strong July, with output falling 0.2% in August and 0.1% in September. Overall GDP rose just 1% in the third quarter from a year earlier, the least since 2010.
Exports jumped in the quarter, leading to a sharp narrowing of the trade deficit. Net trade added 1.2 points to growth. However, the data have been volatile recently because of effect of stockpiling and flows of non-monetary gold.

BEIJING/SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Fewer new energy vehicles (NEV) could be sold in China this year than in 2018, an official at the country's biggest auto industry association said on Monday, as customers hold back on purchases following a government decision to cut subsidies. 
Chen Shihua, assistant secretary general at China Association of Automobile Manufacturers (CAAM), made the comment on Monday after the association reported that sales of NEVs fell 45.6% in October from year-ago levels, following a 33% decline in September.
""There is a gap between sales to date and where they were last year, so according to the development trend, we may see negative growth for new energy vehicles this year,"" he said. 
China has been a keen supporter of NEVs and has implemented sales quota requirements for automakers. But it cut subsidies for NEVs this year as part of an overall plan to reduce subsidies, making the vehicles costlier. 
Prior to the subsidy cut, the market for NEVs - which include plug-in hybrids, battery-only electric vehicles and those powered by hydrogen fuel cells - had been a bright spot, having jumped 62% last year.
While NEVs sales rose last year, the world's largest auto market suffered its first contraction since the 1990s last year.

The trend has remained discouraging with auto sales falling for a 16th consecutive month in October, declining 4% from the same month a year earlier, and followed declines of 5.2% in September and 6.9% in August, CAAM said. September and October, known as ""Golden September, Silver October"" by China's auto insiders, are regarded as the high season for sales, with customers traditionally returning to make purchases after the summer. The decline in sales during the high season has dealt a blow to industry executives' hopes for a turnaround in the second half of this year. As recently as three years ago, automakers had enjoyed double-digit annual growth in China. But the prolonged sales decline has made domestic car makers from Geely (HK:0175) to Great Wall (SS:601633) lower their expectations for sales and profit.

179,By Bloomberg,"<span>Nov 10, 2019 11:57PM ET</span>",India’s Economy Needs More Than Prayers,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Over the weekend, India’s Supreme Court pronounced on a title dispute in Ayodhya, a small town in India’s northern state of Uttar Pradesh. Like many other property cases in India, this one had been working its way through the judicial system for decades. But it may be the most consequential such dispute in Indian history.
Millions of Hindus believe Ayodhya was the capital of Ram, an avatar of Vishnu and hero of the epic Ramayana, and the dispute was over rights to the site where Hindus say a 16th century mosque was built over Ram’s birthplace. Reversing a lower court’s order that the area be divided between the two sides, judges awarded it entirely to the Hindu applicants, while saying Muslims must be compensated with land elsewhere.
The dispute is inextricably entwined with national politics and the status of Indian secularism. It exploded into the national consciousness in the 1980s and early 1990s, when both the then-ruling Indian National Congress party and today’s ruling Bharatiya Janata Party laid claim to Ram’s heritage. Congress Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi had the locks on the mosque broken open and began an election campaign from the town.
Meanwhile, BJP leaders launched a nationwide “rath yatra” -- a pilgrimage in a bus decked out to look like a chariot -- intending to gather support for replacing the mosque with a Hindu temple. (One of the local organizers of the rath yatra was a young man named Narendra Modi.) Finally, amid the escalating tensions, a mob of Hindu activists physically demolished the medieval mosque in 1992 as the state police -- controlled by the local BJP administration -- stood by or ran away. That defiant act of violence marked the beginning of the long rise of the BJP to absolute power in India.
Today, after the Supreme Court awarded the BJP-run central government the right to set up a trust to administer the process of Hindu worship at this long-disputed site, it is worth noting how effectively and efficiently Modi’s party has moved forward on the core aspects of its ideological agenda. For decades, the Hindu nationalist wing of Indian politics has mobilized around certain key issues: the banning of cow slaughter, the building of a temple at Ayodhya, combating the perceived demographic threat to Hindus from migration or conversion, and denying autonomy to India’s Muslim-majority state of Jammu and Kashmir.
On each of these, in just the few months since Modi was reelected as prime minister with an enhanced majority earlier this year, there has been significant progress. A temple will be built at Ayodhya; Kashmir has had its special status revoked; a project to disenfranchise all “foreigners” in the border state of Assam has been concluded and may be extended to the rest of India. A national law effectively banning religious conversion may not be far off, while violence from self-styled “cow protectors” has also been widely publicized.
The speed and energy with which the BJP’s social agenda has been implemented stands in sharp contrast to the dilatory and timid approach the government has taken to structural economic reform. When Modi was first elected in 2014, many hoped that he would instead focus on the economy over social issues, as the BJP had done during its previous stint in power in New Delhi (remember the slogan, “build toilets before temples?”).
But the Modi government has clearly prioritized foreign affairs and domestic social change. While some major reforms have been introduced, including a new bankruptcy code and a nationwide goods-and-services tax, other long-pending measures that would improve Indian competitiveness have been postponed or avoided. Loss-making or unproductive state-owned companies have not been shut down or sold, for fear of the political fallout. This reluctance to reform has persisted in spite of a dramatic and self-inflicted economic slowdown, reflected last week in Moody’s decision to downgrade the outlook for India to negative.
The question is what Modi chooses to do after this victory. With so much progress to tout on the Hindu nationalist agenda, will he now feel he has the political space for bold economic reform? This is what many of those who continue to be optimistic about his tenure argue. And Modi himself continues to frame the government’s social program carefully, as part of the natural and impartial settling of long-pending issues rather than as the beginning of a new radical agenda.
But such hopes have been continually raised since 2014 and mostly been disappointed. The only rational conclusion is that Modi and his party feel that remaking Indian society is more important than remaking the economy. Perhaps they have been elected more on the basis of the social issues the BJP has espoused since its founding decades ago than on nebulous hopes of economic progress. Or perhaps they’re just true believers themselves. "

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's machinery orders fell for a third straight month in September, raising doubts that business spending will be strong enough to offset external pressures, which have clouded the outlook for the export-reliant economy.
Capital spending has been a bright spot for the world's third-largest economy, driven by refurbishing of aged infrastructure, urban development, automation and investments to cope with a labour crunch in the rapidly ageing population.
Policymakers are counting on solid capital expenditure and domestic demand to prop up growth amid the U.S.-China trade war, a broader global slowdown and the impact from last month's sales tax hike.
Core machinery orders fell 2.9% in September from the previous month, down for a third straight month and dashing expectations for a 0.9% increase in a Reuters poll, Cabinet Office data showed on Monday.
""The continued fall in machinery orders suggests that the recent strength in capital goods shipments won't last,"" said Marcel Thieliant, senior Japan economist at Capital Economics. ""Firms have scaled back their investment spending plans as capacity shortages have diminished.""
The core machinery orders data, which exclude those from shipbuilders and power utilities, is a highly volatile series but regarded as a key indicator of capital spending.
By sector, manufacturers' orders dropped 5.2%, dragged down by non-ferrous metals and transport machinery, while the service sector grew 2.6%, led by information and communications.
Manufacturers surveyed by the Cabinet Office forecast that core orders will rise 3.5% in October-December, after a 3.5% decrease in the previous quarter.
Data on Thursday is likely to show Japan's economic growth slowed to an annualised 0.8% in July-September from 1.3% in the second quarter, a Reuters poll found last week.
The capital spending component of GDP likely rose 0.9% quarter-on-quarter in July-September after a 0.2% gain in April-June.
The Cabinet Office cut its assessment, saying a pick-up is seen stalling in machinery orders. 
Prime Minister Shin Abe on Friday ordered his cabinet to compile a package of stimulus measures to cope with external risks and large natural disasters, and prepare against a potential economic slump after the 2020 Tokyo Olympics.
Recent data, including retail sales and household spending, suggested consumers went on a last-minute shopping spree in September to beat the sales tax hike to 10% from 8%, raising some worries about a subsequent pullback in demand.

Policymakers have argued that the economy would likely avoid a repeat of the previous tax hike from 5% in April 2014 that caused a big downward swing in the economy.

Low unemployment and solid wage growth have helped cushion the economy while businesses have cut investment due to the U.S.-China trade war and Brexit uncertainty.

Canada’s labor market slipped after two straight months of strength, with both employment and the jobless rate little changed, indicating the nation’s recent pace of job growth may be cooling.
The country lost 1,800 jobs in October, Statistics Canada said Friday in Ottawa, versus economist expectations for a 15,000 uptick in employment. October marks the first month of job losses since July and comes after Canada added almost 135,000 jobs in the prior two months. Full-time positions fell by 16,100, while part-time increased 14,300. The unemployment rate held steady at 5.5%, matching the median forecast, and wage gains accelerated.
The Canadian dollar dropped on the report, falling 0.4% to C$1.3224 per U.S. dollar at 8:46 a.m. in Toronto trading. Yields on Canadian two-year bonds were down three basis points to 1.60%.

The Commerce Department said on Friday wholesale inventories fell 0.4% in September, instead of the previously reported 0.3% decline, after having risen 0.1% in August. Inventories were up 4.8% on a year-on-year basis in September.
The decline in September was the largest since October 2017.
The component of wholesale inventories that goes into the calculation of gross domestic product fell 0.3% in September.
The pace of inventory accumulation has been slowing after stocks increased strongly from the third quarter of 2018 through the first quarter of this year. The inventory overhang has led businesses to place fewer orders at factories, contributing to a downturn in the manufacturing sector, which also has been hurt by uncertainty over the ongoing U.S-China trade negotiations.
But inventories shaved economic growth only slightly in the third quarter, when the economy grew 1.9%, after chopping 0.91 percentage point from growth in the second quarter, when GDP increased by 2.0%.
In September, wholesale auto inventories fell 1.2% after declining 0.3% in the prior month. There were also declines in furniture, metals, hardware and nondurable goods.
Stocks of lumber, professional equipment and machinery posted increases.
Sales at wholesalers were unchanged in September after falling 0.1% in August. Motor vehicle sales slumped 3.1% in September after edging up 0.1% in the previous month.

OTTAWA (Reuters) - The Canadian job market stagnated unexpectedly in October, losing 1,800 net positions, while the unemployment rate remained at 5.5%, Statistics Canada said on Friday, as employment declined in the manufacturing and construction sectors.
Analysts in a Reuters poll had forecast a gain of 15,900 jobs in October and an unemployment rate of 5.5%. Wages for permanent employees rose by 4.4%, Statscan said.
Canada lost 16,100 full-time positions last month, but gained 14,300 part-time jobs. The number of self-employed workers in October fell by 27,800.
The Canadian dollar weakened to a three-week low of $1.3232 to the U.S. dollar, or 75.57 cents U.S., after the jobs data was released.
""It definitely runs against the grain of very strong job gains we've seen through most of the past year,"" said Doug Porter, chief economist at BMO Capital Markets, noting there was likely a ""small, temporary boost"" because of hiring tied to last month's national election.
""We have to be cautious about reading too much into any one report, but it shows that the economy is not simply on a one-way trip north here,"" Porter said.
Canada's central bank, which has not moved since October 2018 even as its counterparts - including the U.S. Federal Reserve - have eased, held firm as expected last week, but left the door open to a possible future cut to help the economy weather the damaging effects of global trade conflicts.
The Bank of Canada said it would monitor ""the extent to which the global slowdown spreads beyond manufacturing and investment"" going forward while watching domestic data.
""I don't think one number will move the needle a whole lot at the Bank of Canada, but at the margin it's a little bit more of a cautious signal,"" Derek Holt, vice president of capital markets economics at Scotiabank, said of the jobs report.
Statscan said the services sector gained 39,000 jobs in October, with increases reported in public administration, as well as finance, real estate, insurance and rental leasing industries, while the goods-producing sectors saw a decline of 40,900 jobs on losses in manufacturing and construction.
The country's manufacturing sector lost 23,100 jobs in October, mostly located in Ontario, while the construction sector lost 21,300 positions across five provinces, Statscan said.
In a separate release, Statistics Canada said the value of Canadian building permits dropped by a larger-than-expected 6.5% in September to C$8.3 billion ($6.28 billion) because of declines in the residential sector.

185,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 08, 2019 03:28AM ET</span>",Biggest rise in German exports in nearly two years gives some relief from recession fears,"By Michelle Martin
BERLIN (Reuters) - German exports posted their biggest rise in almost two years in September, data showed on Friday, providing some relief amid widespread concerns that Europe's largest economy will dip into recession in the third quarter.
The Federal Statistics Office said seasonally adjusted exports increased by 1.5% on the month. That was their biggest increase since November 2017 and compared with economist expectations for a rise of 0.4%.
""While there is no doubt that industry is in recession, the entire German economy could have avoided another contraction - and hence a technical recession - at the very last minute,"" said ING economist Carsten Brzeski.
The economy shrank by 0.1% in the second quarter, and recent data have suggested manufacturing fared badly in the third, which could put Germany in a technical recession - usually defined as two straight quarters of contraction.
""Today's trade data suggest that there has been hardly any negative drag from net trade on third-quarter gross domestic product,"" he said, adding private consumption looked like it had increased slightly and construction was flat or positive.
Germany's export-reliant manufacturers have been suffering from a slowing world economy and business uncertainty linked to a trade war between the United States and China, and Britain's planned, if delayed, exit from the European Union.
Data published this week has painted a mixed picture of the industrial sector, with output falling more than forecast in September while orders rose more than expected. A survey showed Germany's manufacturers remained stuck in recession in October as new orders fell.
Speaking about Friday's data, Landesbank Baden-Wuerttemberg economist Jens-Oliver Niklasch said: ""This looks like a revival in foreign trade but looking at the whole year, September is more of an outlier"".
He said foreign trade had been rather weak throughout 2019 and added that the risks in overseas trade had declined but not disappeared. A 0.4 decline in exports to non-euro zone European Union countries between January and September compared with the same period last year could be due to Brexit, he said.
The DIHK Chambers of Commerce expects exports to grow by 0.3% this year as a whole before declining by 0.5% next year, which would be their first fall since the global financial crisis.
A panel of economists advising the government on Wednesday said Germany's long-term upswing had come to an end and said that the export-oriented German economy was particularly at risk from a possible escalation of the trade conflicts. But they did not expect a ""broad and deep recession"".
Friday's data showed imports climbed by 1.3% in September. The trade surplus widened to 19.2 billion euros from an upwardly revised 18.7 billion euros in the prior month.
Economists polled by Reuters had expected imports to be unchanged and saw the trade surplus at 18.1 billion euros."

BEIJING (Reuters) - China's exports and imports contracted less than expected in October, providing some relief for the economy as Beijing tries to reach a partial trade deal with Washington.
But even if a U.S.-China trade deal is signed soon, economists say it is unlikely to help boost exports and manufacturing for some time yet and could still mean more stimulus is needed from Beijing to avert a sharper downturn.
China's October exports fell for the third straight month, down 0.9% from a year earlier, customs data showed on Friday, less than a 3.9% fall forecast in a Reuters poll and September's 3.2% contraction.
""Even if the ""phase one"" U.S.-China trade deal crosses the finish line, it is unlikely to alleviate the main headwinds facing exporters and outbound shipments look set to remain weak in the coming months,"" said Martin Rasmussen, China economist at Capital Economics.
He attributed the rise in exports to a pick-up in U.S. demand after both countries outlined an interim deal and Washington suspended a threatened tariff hike set for Oct. 15.
There were other bright spots in the data. Exports to the United States in October fell 16.2%, less than a 21.9% drop the previous month, according to Reuters calculation based on customs data.
Betty Wang, senior China economist at ANZ, said anecdotal evidence also showed exports may have been boosted as Chinese firms rushed out hi-tech shipments after the U.S. government put some of the country's tech firms on a trade blacklist.
If a partial deal is reached this month, it is widely expected to include a U.S. pledge to scrap tariffs scheduled for Dec. 15 on about $156 billion worth of Chinese imports, including cell phones, laptop computers and toys. 
So far, U.S. President Donald Trump has only cancelled a scheduled Oct. 15 tariff increase on $250 billion goods.
China's imports shrank for the sixth consecutive month, though the 6.4% drop was smaller than an expected 8.9% and September's 8.5% decline.
That left China with a trade surplus of $42.81 billion in October, versus September's $39.65 billion surplus. Analysts had forecast a $40.83 billion surplus.
Despite the more modest drop in imports, domestic demand appeared to remain weak, with imports of iron ore and copper falling.
The trade data lines up with recent readings on shrinking factory activity and bleak producer prices. The slowdown points to lingering weakness in domestic demand and the limited impact of policy stimulus so far.
TARIFF ROLLBACK?
Beijing and Washington have been locked in a trade feud for 16 months, but hopes have risen that an initial deal may be signed soon.
In a new sign of progress that lifted market sentiment, Beijing and Washington agreed to roll back tariffs on each other's goods as part of the first phase of a trade deal, officials from both sides said on Thursday.
The Chinese commerce ministry, without laying out a timetable, said the two countries had agreed to cancel the tariffs in phases.
In what could be another gesture to boost optimism, China's state news agency Xinhua reported late on Thursday that the Chinese customs and Ministry of Agriculture are considering removing restrictions on U.S. poultry imports.
China's trade surplus with the United States was at $26.42 billion in October, up from $25.88 billion in September, according to Reuters calculation based on customs data.
Economists and analysts warn that the path toward a full deal is still highly uncertain and expect that a partial trade deal may only relieve some pressure on the world's second-largest economy.
""We remain cautious on this. It is unlikely that the bulk of existing tariffs will be removed soon and other types of restrictions are also coming, implying decoupling and tension,"" said Louis Kuijs, head of Asia economics at Oxford Economics.
Kuijs and others noted an improvement in import volumes, which could continue to gradually recover especially as local government step up infrastructure spending.
China's third-quarter economic growth cooled to its weakest pace in almost three decades hurt by soft global demand, slowing consumption at home and heightened trade risks.
To boost credit, the People's Bank of China cut the interest rate on its one-year medium-term lending facility (MLF) loans on Tuesday for the first time since early 2016.
Analysts said the cut, while modest, may be a sign the central bank is turning more proactive, following a slew of downbeat economic data suggesting more stimulus is needed soon."

189,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 07, 2019 08:59PM ET</span>",Japan's Sept. household spending rises at fastest pace on record,"By Kaori Kaneko and Tetsushi Kajimoto
TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's household spending rose at the fastest pace on record in September as consumers rushed to buy goods before a sales tax hike, though the test for the economy will be whether the higher levy will squeeze domestic demand in coming months.
Household spending jumped 9.5% in September from a year earlier, the fastest pace of increase since comparable data became available from 2001 and stronger than the median forecast for a 7.8% gain, government data showed on Friday.
It was a tenth straight month of gains, the longest such streak since 2001.
Spending had risen 7.2% in March 2014, a month ahead of the previous sales tax increase but the higher levy subsequently led to a slowdown in consumer spending and sharp economic slump. 
From the previous month, it grew 5.5% in September, which compared with the median estimate for a 3.8% increase. 
""We expect consumer spending will turn severe in Oct-Dec after pre-tax hike gains and the economy is also expected to contract,"" said Yoshiki Shinke, chief economist at Dai-ichi Life Research Institute.
Shinke believes consumer spending and the economy will recover in the first quarter next year after an expected pullback in the current quarter, but said concerns about the outlook remain.
""Consumer sentiment has stayed weak despite the government steps to mitigate the pain from the tax hike. Although deterioration in exports seems to be easing, we need to be cautious about their outlook, so there are risks to the economy.""
Japan rolled out a twice-delayed increase in the sales tax to 10% from 8% on Oct.1, a move that is seen as critical for fixing the country's tattered finances but that could tip the economy into recession by dampening consumer sentiment.
The government has taken steps to ease the burden on consumers by offering vouchers and tax breaks, mindful of the lessons of the 2014 tax hike. 
This time around the tame recovery in wages is raising concerns about the outlook for private spending and the economy as solid domestic consumption has so far partially offset weak global demand.
While separate data showed real wages adjusted for inflation rose for the first time in nine months in September, the sales tax hike and global slowdown are clouding the outlook. 
A Reuters poll on Wednesday showed the rush to beat the sales tax hike likely helped underpin solid domestic demand and helped the economy grow for a fourth straight quarter in July-September. 
But analysts expect the economy could shrink in the fourth quarter due to the higher tax.
The Bank of Japan kept policy steady last week but tweaked its forward guidance to say it would maintain ultra-low rates or even cut them for as long as needed to gauge overseas risks.

A monthly index of jobs vacancies from the Recruitment and Employment Confederation and accountants KPMG fell to 51.7 from 52.6 in September, its lowest level since January 2012.
On Thursday, two of the BoE's nine interest-rate setters unexpectedly voted to cut interest rates, citing signs that the labour market - the bright spot of Britain's economy since the Brexit vote - may now be on the turn.
Friday's REC report - which is monitored by the BoE - showed permanent job placements fell for an eighth month running and at a faster rate than in September, chiming with official data which showed job creation waning ahead of the aborted October Brexit deadline.
James Stewart, vice chair at KPMG, said uncertainty around Brexit and a national election scheduled for Dec. 12 had dampened companies' hiring plans.
""It's not just businesses that are being cautious, however, and over October we've seen job-seekers become increasingly nervous about making a career change,"" said James Stewart, vice chair at KPMG.
The survey showed starting salaries for permanent staff rose at a solid pace in October, albeit more slowly than in September.
In a new set of forecasts for the economy published on Thursday, the BoE said it thought pay growth in Britain - which recently hit a more than 10-year high - was likely to cool off a little in the coming year."

The data could support the view of the government and the central bank that a tight labor market should push up wages, stoking a virtuous cycle of household income gains and pick-up in private consumption, which will in turn accelerate inflation.
More than six years of massive monetary stimulus by the Bank of Japan has failed to accelerate inflation to its elusive 2% target, as tepid wage growth and tame consumer spending have kept a lid on prices despite the tightest job market in decades.
Labour ministry data out on Friday showed real wages, a key gauge of households' purchasing power, rose 0.6% in the year to September, up for the first time since the end of last year, as nominal wage growth outpaced consumer prices.
Nominal total cash earnings rose 0.8% in the year to September, up for the first time in three months, it showed.
A solid growth in pay for full-time workers amid a labor crunch and a 14.2% gain in special pay, including one-off bonuses, more than offset an increase in low-wage part-timers.
""Our assessment remains unchanged that wages are rising gradually. We cannot be complacent but must watch a trend over time,"" a labor ministry official told Reuters.
Regular pay - or base salary, which makes up most of the total cash earnings and determines a wage trend - rose 0.5% year-on-year in September, the data showed.
Overtime pay, a barometer of strength in corporate activity, stood flat in September from a year earlier, likely reflecting the government's ""work-style reform"" drive on corporate Japan to curb notorious long working-hours.
Revelations this year that labor ministry officials used faulty polling methods, which forced revisions, cast doubt on the accuracy of the ministry's wage data from 2004 to 2017.

The flaw has made it harder to gauge the actual wage trend.

Initial claims for state unemployment benefits decreased 8,000 to a seasonally adjusted 211,000 for the week ended Nov. 2, the Labor Department said on Thursday. Data for the prior week was revised to show 1,000 more applications received than previously reported.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast claims would fall to 215,000 in the latest week. The Labor Department said claims for one state, Kentucky, were estimated last week.
The four-week moving average of initial claims, considered a better measure of labor market trends as it irons out week-to-week volatility, increased 250 to 215,250 last week.
The level of claims suggests solid labor market conditions. Employment grew faster than expected in October, with firms adding 128,000 jobs, even though a strike by workers at General Motors (N:GM) idled 46,000 employees at the automaker's plants in Michigan and Kentucky.
The Federal Reserve cut interest rates last week for the third time this year to support continued economic growth. Officials also signaled a pause in the easing cycle, which started in July when the central bank reduced borrowing costs for the first time since 2008. Fed Chair Jerome Powell acknowledged some moderation in the pace of job growth this year, but said ""the job market remains strong.""
Thursday's claims report also showed the number of people receiving benefits after an initial week of benefits dipped 3,000 to 1.69 million for the week ended Oct. 26. The four-week moving average of the so-called continuing claims was unchanged at 1.69 million."
194,By Bloomberg,"<span>Nov 07, 2019 07:15AM ET</span>",Two BOE Members Unexpectedly Vote for Rate Cut as Outlook Sours,"(Bloomberg) -- The Bank of England is growing increasingly concerned about Brexit uncertainty and the global slowdown, pushing two policy makers to unexpectedly vote for an interest rate cut.
Michael Saunders and Jonathan Haskel wanted to lower the benchmark by a quarter point -- the first votes for looser policy since 2016 -- citing threats to the outlook and signs of a turn in the labor market. While the majority, including Governor Mark Carney, voted to keep the rate at 0.75%, they signaled that a further deterioration could see more policy makers support easing.
“If global growth fails to stabilize, or if Brexit uncertainty remains entrenched, monetary policy may need to reinforce the expected recovery,” officials said in the summary of the meeting, published Thursday.
The pound declined after the announcement, and was 0.2% lower at $1.2827 as of 12:05 p.m. London time.
The comments show the BOE is shifting closer to other central banks, such as the Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank, which have already cut interest rates this year. Still, signs of easing in the China-U.S. trade tensions on Thursday could be good news for the global economy and mean less chance of a worse scenario emerging.
While Saunders had been mentioned as a possible dissenter this month, Haskel’s vote for a cut is a surprise.
The BOE also said that if the risks don’t materialize, their previous guidance that limited and gradual hikes may be needed still stands.
In their re-branded Monetary Policy Report, officials cut their forecasts for growth and inflation. The projections highlight the impact of the global slowdown, with external factors accounting for most of the downgrade.
New Assumptions
The new forecasts are now also underpinned by a new assumption for Brexit, after U.K. prime minister Boris Johnson secured a new deal with the EU. The outlook is predicated on an “orderly transition to a deep free trade agreement” similar to the Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement in place between the bloc and Canada.
While a large amount of uncertainty remains, a major effect of the new assumptions is that the BOE is girding for greater impact within its forecast period. It previous based its forecasts on a less precise adjustment taking place over “many years.”
Based on market pricing for one rate cut over the next three years, the BOE now sees 2020 growth at 1.2% -- which would be the worst since 2009 -- from 1.3% previously, and the following year at 1.8%, down from 2.3%. The level of GDP will be 1% lower at the end of the forecast period than expected in August.
Officials now see far weaker inflation in the near-term thanks to a drop in energy prices, and it will remain below target until late 2021.
The U.K. is headed for a general election in December, and the country’s deadline to leave the EU has been postponed until Jan. 31. While Brexit is dominating the economic outlook, there’s also no escaping the slowdown in global growth.
The BOE devoted a whole section to trade protectionism and the global outlook. The trade dispute between the U.S and China has caused a fundamental shift in policy after a 50-year trend towards liberalization, boosted uncertainty and weighed on growth, the BOE said."

FAO,"ROME (Reuters) - World food prices rose for the first time in five months in October, boosted by jumps in quotations for sugar and cereals, the United Nations food agency said on Thursday.
The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) food price index, which measures monthly changes for a basket of cereals, oilseeds, dairy products, meat and sugar, averaged 172.7 points in October, up 1.7% on the previous month and 6.0% year-on-year.
FAO also predicted that cereal production would be 2.704 billion tonnes in 2019, slightly lower than its last forecast.
The FAO sugar price index jumped 5.8% from September levels, largely because of expectations of lower supplies in the year ahead following forecasts of large reductions in sugar output in India and Thailand.
The cereal price index rose 4.2%, with wheat and maize export prices climbing on the back of reduced crop prospects in several major producing countries and ""robust trade activity"". By contrast, rice prices fell, hit by subdued demand and expectations of an abundant basmati harvest.
The vegetable oil price index increased 0.5% to reach its highest level in more than a year, while the meat price index rose 0.9%, driven by higher import demand especially from China.
By contrast, the dairy price index dropped 0.7% in October, as lower quotations for cheese offset increases in those for skimmed and whole milk powders, FAO said.
FAO lowered its forecast for global cereal production in 2019 by some 2 million tonnes, pegging world cereal output at 2.704 billion tonnes, but still up 1.8% from 2018 levels.
The U.N. agency said worldwide coarse grain production in 2019 was seen at 1.425 billion tonnes, down 1.3 million on the previous forecast.
Wheat output was seen at 765 million tonnes, down nearly 1 million tonnes on the last outlook, but still on course to set a new record and up 4.5% on 2018 levels.
The forecast for global rice production was put at 513.4 million tonnes, little changed on the previous forecast and slightly below 2018 levels."

BERLIN (Reuters) - German industrial output fell more than expected in September, data showed on Thursday, pointing to ongoing weakness in the sector and indicating that Europe's largest economy most probably slipped into recession in the third quarter. 
Industrial output dropped by 0.6% on the month, figures released by the Economy Ministry showed. A Reuters poll had pointed to a fall of 0.4%.
""It's not a nice number. The decline in industrial production in September makes a technical recession almost official now,"" said Thomas Gitzel, economist at VP Bank.
The economy shrank by 0.1% in the second quarter, and recent data have suggested manufacturing fared badly in the third, which could put Germany in recession - usually defined as two straight quarters of contraction.
Data from the Statistics Office showed industrial production decreased by 1.1% between July and September, marking the fifth consecutive quarter of contraction.
While construction was stable in the third quarter, weakness was otherwise broad-based, with production declines registered at factories making chemicals, metal products, electrical equipment, machinery and motor vehicles or parts, data from the Economy Ministry showed.
The ministry said the weak patch in German industry was not yet over but business sentiment and an uptick in orders had brightened the outlook for the fourth quarter.
Germany's export-reliant manufacturers have been suffering from a slowing world economy and business uncertainty linked to a trade war between the United States and China, and Britain's planned, if delayed, exit from the European Union.
The data came a day after figures showing industrial orders rose more than expected in September had provided some hope for the sector.
Any optimism about German industry's prospects was premature, ING economist Carsten Brzeski said, adding that structural factors such as low capacity utilisation meant the sector was unlikely to rebound much before the first quarter of 2020 even if Brexit uncertainty and trade conflicts calmed.
Thursday's data showed factories churned out fewer capital, intermediate and consumer goods in September. 
Jens-Oliver Niklasch, economist at Landesbank Baden-Wuerttemberg, said significant declines in the production of intermediate and capital goods suggested the recession in the industrial sector would not be overcome anytime soon.
""The September number for industry makes us almost certain that gross domestic product declined slightly in the third quarter too,"" he said.
A survey on Monday showed that Germany's manufacturers remained stuck in recession in October as new orders fell for the 13th straight month and factories cut jobs at the fastest pace in almost 10 years.

However, German business sentiment held steady in October, and the economy should grow moderately in the final quarter, the Munich-based Ifo economic institute said late last month.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - American workers were unexpectedly less productive during the third quarter, with growth in their output failing to keep up with hours worked.
The Labor Department said on Wednesday nonfarm productivity, which measures hourly output per worker, fell at a 0.3% annualized rate between July and September, the biggest decline in almost four years. The last drop that was sharper was in the fourth quarter of 2015.
The decline might set back the prospects of a pick-up expected by some economists in the trend growth rate for productivity following 2017 tax law changes partially aimed at fostering investment.
Analysts had expected productivity growth of 0.9% during the quarter.
Part of the surprise owes to a modest upward revision in the Labor Department's estimate for productivity growth during the second quarter, to 2.5% growth from a previous estimate of 2.3%.
With the revisions, labor productivity was 1.4% higher in the third quarter than in the same period of 2018. That is a tenth of a point higher than the 1.3% average annual growth rate of 2007-2018, but well below the 2.1% long-run average between 1947 and 2018.
Labor productivity also declined in the factory sector for the second straight quarter, falling at a 0.1% annual rate in the third quarter.
Unit labor costs, the price of labor per single unit of output, rose at a 3.6% rate in the third quarter.
Hours worked rose at a 2.4% rate, while output was up 2.1%."

BERLIN (Reuters) - German industrial orders rose more than expected in September, according to data released on Wednesday, offering a glimmer of hope for the country's struggling manufacturers.
The export-reliant manufacturers have been suffering from a slowing world economy and business uncertainty linked to a trade war between the United States and China plus Britain's planned, if delayed, exit from the European Union.
Contracts for German goods rose 1.3% from the previous month, helped by increases in both domestic and foreign demand, the Federal Statistics said. A Reuters poll forecast a rise of 0.1%.
""At last, a positive surprise from German industry,"" said Jens-Oliver Niklasch, senior economist at Landesbank Baden-Wuerttemberg. ""It looks at the moment like a bottoming out. The downturn is not continuing, although new impulses for growth are thin on the ground.""
The economy ministry said the numbers were a good starting point for the final quarter of the year and pointed out that business expectations had also brightened. 
Germany's economy shrank 0.1% in the second quarter and recent data have suggested continued weakness in manufacturing in the third quarter, which could put Germany in recession, generally defined as two straight quarters of contraction.
Concern about the outlook for Germany, the engine of the euro zone economy, has in turn discouraged the rest of 19-country currency union. 
The data showed a 1.6% rise in domestic orders and 1.1% increase in foreign contracts, although those from the euro zone were 1.8% lower.
Orders for capitals goods rose most, up 3.1%. Those for consumer goods increased 0.8%. Demand for intermediate goods, however, fell 1.5%. 
The orders data offered a rare bright spot. Leading economic institutes have slashed growth forecasts for this year and next. The government has so far stuck to its balanced budget policy, resisting pressure to spend more to boost flagging demand.
A survey on Monday showed that Germany's manufacturers remained stuck in recession in October as new orders fell for the 13th straight month and factories cut jobs at the fastest pace in almost 10 years.

""The numbers today offer a small glimmer of hope that things will improve a bit in the coming months,"" said Thomas Gitzel, chief economist at VP Bank Group. ""But German economic growth will for now remain a sluggish affair.""

Wednesday's downbeat survey of private sector businesses comes soon after the European Central Bank reignited its 2.6 trillion euro bond-buying program to try and stimulate inflation and growth.
IHS Markit's final euro zone composite Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI), seen as a good gauge of economic health, rose to 50.6 from September's more than six-year low of 50.1 and above a preliminary estimate of 50.2.
However, the index remained near the 50 mark separating growth from contraction.
""The euro area remained close to stagnation in October, with falling order books suggesting that risks are currently tilted towards contraction in the fourth quarter,"" said Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit.
An index measuring new business was 49.6, above September's 48.7 but the second consecutive month it has been below 50. Some of the meager activity was generated by firms eating into previously-placed work -- as they have done for almost all of this year.
Williamson said the headline PMI was currently consistent with quarterly GDP rising 0.1%. A Reuters poll last month had pegged growth this quarter at 0.2%.
Activity in the bloc's dominant services industry also accelerated but remained lacklustre. Its PMI nudged up to 52.2 from 51.6 in September.
Demonstrating the gloomy mood among purchasing managers, the services business expectations index fell to 57.4 from 58.6. It has been lower only once in five years, in August."

Data compiler IHS Markit said its Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) for services rose to 52.9 points in October from 51.1 in September, in line with a previous estimate.
The improvement lifted the index further away from the key 50-point threshold, which demarcates an expansion from a contraction in business.
IHS Markit's overall October composite PMI reading, which includes the services and manufacturing sectors, rose to 52.6 from 50.8 in September, also in line with an earlier estimate.
Data earlier this week showed an expansion in French manufacturing in October.
""Manufacturers posted their fastest rise in production since June, but the service sector remained the key driver of growth, registering a solid expansion,"" said IHS Markit economist Eliot Kerr.

203,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 06, 2019 02:51AM ET</span>","China's October exports, imports to contract at sharper pace: Reuters poll","BEIJING (Reuters) - China's exports and imports probably fell at a slightly faster rate in October, pointing to a worsening outlook for the country's manufacturers as Beijing remains embroiled in a trade standoff with Washington, a Reuters poll showed.
The forecasts come despite optimism that a first-phase trade deal could be signed this month between China and the United States to resolve a 16-month long trade war that has raised the risk of a global recession and roiled financial markets.
The ""phase one"" deal is widely expected to include a U.S. pledge to scrap tariffs scheduled for Dec. 15 on about $156 billion worth of Chinese imports, including cell phones, laptop computers and toys.
China's October exports are expected to have contracted for a third month, falling 3.9% from a year earlier, according to the median estimate of 26 economists in the poll, worsening from a 3.2% drop in September.
The existing tariffs, including the latest additional levies by the United States on Chinese imports from Sept. 1, have hit the county's outbound shipments, along with stubbornly weak global demand.
That is also evidenced by worsening export orders in an official factory survey.
Though the possibility of a thaw in tense trade relations between the world's top two economies is rising, economists warn the path towards a full deal is still highly uncertain and expect that a partial trade deal may only relieve some of the pressure on the world's second-largest economy.
So far, U.S. President Donald Trump has only canceled a scheduled Oct. 15 tariff increase on $250 billion goods. And U.S. officials said they are still considering the fate of the Dec. 15 tariffs on Chinese-made goods.
""The September and scheduled December tariff hikes will likely weigh on exports and growth in the coming two quarters. Higher tariffs and trade war uncertainties may continue to hurt corporate earnings and manufacturing sector investment,"" analysts with UBS wrote in a note.
Imports, meanwhile, are also likely to remain in contraction, shrinking 8.9% from a year earlier, the sharpest drop since July 2016, versus an 8.5% decline in September, the poll showed.
The forecasts point to a rocky outlook ahead for the trade-reliant economy in the last quarter of the year, despite more than a year of growth boosting measures.
China's third-quarter economic growth slowed more than expected to its weakest pace in almost three decades, with gross domestic product rising just 6.0% on year, weighed down by cooling domestic demand, sluggish investment and weak exports.
China on Tuesday kicked off a giant import fair in Shanghai, trying to showcase its free trade credentials, temper criticism of its policies and deepen its global economic influence.
But critics say the week-long Chinese buying spree once a year does little to address structural concerns, including weak intellectual property protection, entry barriers and the lack of a level playing field for foreign businesses in China.
In a reassurance to investors worries that higher inflation could prevent the central government from delivering fresh stimulus measures, China's central bank cut the interest rate on its one-year medium-term lending facility (MLF) loans on Tuesday for the first time since early 2016.
Analysts said the cut, while modest, may be a sign the central bank is turning more proactive, following a slew of downbeat economic data suggest more stimulus is needed soon.
""With economic activity likely to come under further pressure in the months ahead, we think more easing will be needed to prevent growth from slowing too sharply. We expect another 70 (basis points) of reductions in the MLF rate by the middle of next year,"" analysts at Capital Economics said."
204,By Bloomberg,"<span>Nov 06, 2019 02:42AM ET</span>",German Manufacturing Shows Signs of Life ,"(Bloomberg) -- The German economy saw a glimmer of hope at the end of the third quarter, with factory orders increasing for the first time in three months.
Demand rose 1.3% in September, far exceeding estimates of a 0.1% gain. The jump was driven by solid pickup in investment and consumer goods, with demand from outside the euro area providing a particular boost.
Yet orders were still down 5.4% from the previous year, suggesting momentum will continue to be weak. Germany probably went into a technical recession during the last quarter, and the labor market started to deteriorate.
The data follow a report showing euro-zone manufacturing near its weakest in seven years, with job losses accelerating and order books declining. Even as the global economy shows signs of putting the worst of its recent slowdown behind it, Germany has continued to struggle.
Policy makers at the European Central Bank have called on European governments to step in with fiscal support, arguing that monetary stimulus alone can’t deliver the necessary boost. A call for additional spending also featured in President Mario Draghi’s farewell speech last week, and his successor Christine Lagarde is likely to continue his efforts.
Yet governments have been reluctant, with German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s administration indicating that the situation has to deteriorate before significant aid will be unlocked. Finance Minister Olaf Scholz has said the economic situation doesn’t require a rushed fiscal response.
The government’s council of economic advisers is set to slash its growth forecasts for this year and next when it presents Merkel with its annual report later on Wednesday."

The Confederation of British Industry's gauge of optimism for small and medium-sized manufacturers fell to -32 in the three months to the end of October, down from -28 in the three months to July.
Companies reported weak new orders - especially from clients in Britain - and little enthusiasm to raise investment spending.
""Firms are caught between the perfect storm of perennial Brexit uncertainty at home, and sluggish growth in the global economy,"" Alpesh Paleja, the CBI's lead economist, said.
""As well as hitting output, orders and hiring, these issues are depressing investment plans across the board.""
Whichever political party wins Britain's Dec. 12 national election ensure the country leaves the European Union with a transition deal and then push ahead with negotiations for a new, long-term trade relationship with the bloc, he said.
Britain's economy shrank in the second quarter of 2019 but is widely expected to have shown some growth in the July-September period, thus avoiding a recession.
As well as Brexit, British manufacturers are facing up to a slowdown in the global economy caused by trade tensions between the United States and China.

The European Union statistics agency Eurostat said prices at factory gates in the 19 countries sharing the euro rose by 0.1% in September on the month, in line with the Reuters consensus, and after a 0.5% fall in August.
On the year, prices dropped by 1.2%, also in line with market expectations.
Industrial producer prices signal inflationary pressure early in the pipeline because unless their change is absorbed by intermediaries and retailers, it is transmitted to the final consumer, impacting consumer inflation.
The European Central Bank wants to keep consumer inflation below, but close to 2 percent over the medium term, but has struggled to accelerate price growth for years despite programs of government bond buying on the market.
A preliminary estimate for October, released last week, shows the euro zone's headline inflation is slowing to 0.7% on the year from 0.8% in September.
The ECB decided in September to re-launch bond purchases as inflation remained to slow.
The monthly increase of producer prices was mostly due to a 0.5% rise in energy costs at factories. Excluding energy, industry prices were flat."

Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the trade gap would fall slightly to $52.5 billion in September.
The United States imported fewer cars but sold fewer overseas in September. It also imported fewer cellphones, toys and games, but sold less food, feed and beverages abroad.
The August trade deficit was revised to a slightly wider $55.04 billion. While the petroleum surplus of $252 million was the first since 1978, it reflected both a drop in exports of U.S. oil and a larger decline in imports of foreign oil, a possible outgrowth of the recent weakness in manufacturing.
The goods trade gap with China narrowed by $100 million to $31.6 billion, with exports to the country falling $800 million in September and imports from China falling $1.0 billion.
The United States and China have been embroiled in a 16-month trade war, but the two parties have edged towards an initial agreement. Washington last month announced tariffs on aircraft, other industrial products and agricultural products from the European Union as part of a World Trade Organization penalty award in a long-running aircraft subsidy case.
Trade experts expect the EU will impose tariffs on U.S. goods next year over subsidies for Boeing (N:BA).
In September, overall U.S. exports fell 0.9% to $206 billion, including a $1 billion drop in exports of soybeans, one of the political bargaining chips China has used to pressure the U.S. side in trade discussions. Exports of autos fell $1 billion.
Exports of capital goods ticked up by $800 million, including a $700 million rise in exports of civilian aircraft.
There was an overall decline in goods imports, including a $800 million drop in cell phones and a $600 million decline in toys, games and sporting equipment. Imports of capital goods fell $1.1 billion, including a $600 million drop in imports of semiconductors.
Imports of automobiles fell $1.1 billion.

GENEVA (Reuters) - A trade war between the world's top two economies cut U.S. imports of Chinese goods by more than a quarter, or $35 billion, in the first half of this year and drove up prices for American consumers, a U.N. study showed on Tuesday.
Beijing and Washington have been locked in a trade feud for the past 16 months although there are hopes that an initial deal offering some relief may be signed this month.
If that fails, nearly all Chinese goods imports into the United States - worth more than $500 billion - could be affected.
U.S. imports from China subject to tariffs fell to $95 billion between January and June from $130 billion during the same period of 2018, the study released by the U.N. Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) showed.
""Overall, the results indicate that the United States tariffs on China are economically hurting both countries,"" the report said. ""United States losses are largely related to the higher prices for consumers, while China's losses are related to significant export losses.""
Over time, Chinese companies began absorbing some of the extra costs of the tariffs through an 8% dip in export prices in the second quarter of 2019, but that still left 17% ""on the shoulders of U.S. consumers"", said the report's author Alessandro Nicita, an economist at UNCTAD.
The sector hit hardest by the U.S. tariffs are U.S. imports of Chinese office machinery and communication equipment, which fell by $15 billion. Over time, the scale of Chinese export losses increased alongside mounting tariffs, the study said.
Other countries stepped up to fill most of the gap left by China, the study found. It named Taiwan as the largest beneficiary of ""trade diversion"", with $4.2 billion in additional exports to the United States in the first half of 2019. They were mostly office and communication equipment.
Mexico increased exports to the United States by $3.5 billion, mostly agriculture and transport equipment and electrical machinery. The European Union boosted deliveries by $2.7 billion, mostly via additional machinery exports, it found.
""The longer the trade war goes on, the more likely these losses and gains will be permanent,"" Nicita said. Not all of Chinese trade losses were picked up by other economies and billions of dollars in trade were lost entirely.
The paper did not analyse the effect of Chinese tariffs on U.S. imports into China because detailed data was not yet available.
It also does not capture the most recent phase of the trade war -- including 10% tariffs on about $125 billion worth of additional Chinese goods imported into the United States that took effect on Sept. 1 -- beyond noting that it is likely to add to existing trade losses."

Factory goods orders declined 0.6% after dipping by an unrevised 0.1% in August, the Commerce Department said on Monday. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast factory orders would drop 0.5% in September.
Factory orders fell 0.3% compared to September 2018. Shipments of manufactured goods declined 0.2% in September after decreasing 0.3% in the prior month.
Pointing to underlying weakness in the sector, which accounts for about 11% of the economy, unfilled orders at factories were unchanged after edging up 0.1% in August. Inventories rose 0.3% in September after dipping 0.1% in August.
Manufacturing has been hobbled by a 16-month trade war between the United States and China, which has also caused a drop in business investment. U.S. and Chinese negotiators have been racing to finalize a text of a 'phase one' agreement between the world's two largest economies.
A critical date is Dec. 15, when new U.S. tariffs on Chinese imports such as laptops, toys and electronics are set to kick in.
Transportation equipment orders dropped 2.8% in September after increasing 0.2% in August. Orders for civilian aircraft and parts dropped 11.8% after declining 17.2% in the prior month.
Orders for computers and electronic products fell 1.2% but orders for electrical equipment, appliances and components rose 0.7%. Machinery orders edged up 0.2% in September after decreasing 0.3% in August.
The Commerce Department also said September orders for non-defense capital goods excluding aircraft, which are seen as a measure of business spending plans on equipment, dropped 0.6% instead of the 0.5% drop reported last month.
Shipments of core capital goods, which are used to calculate business equipment spending in the gross domestic product report, declined 0.7% in September, the same as previously reported. Business investment declined at its steepest pace in more than 3-1/2 years in the third quarter."

OTTAWA (Reuters) - Canada's trade deficit in September narrowed to C$978 million ($745 million) as imports fell faster than exports, ending the third quarter on a weak note, Statistics Canada data indicated on Tuesday.
Analysts polled by Reuters had forecast a shortfall of C$700 million for September. Statscan revised the August deficit up to C$1.24 billion from an initial C$0.96 billion.
Lower shipments of energy products helped cut the value of exports by 2.3% in the third quarter after they jumped 4.8% in the second quarter.
""(This) isn't something we are terribly surprised by. We are still seeing year-to-date growth of close to 2% which is reasonably good in a very challenging trade environment globally,"" said Ross Prusakowski, principal economist at Export Development Canada.
Last week, the Bank of Canada said the Canadian economy was not immune to global trade conflicts, including tensions between the United States and China.
Canadian exports declined 1.3% in September, with seven of the 11 categories falling. 
Shipments of metal and non-metallic mineral products posted the largest drop, falling 7.3%, mostly on lower gold shipments. Crude oil exports fell 2.1% because of lower volumes, after rising on higher prices in August.
Statscan noted the decline coincided with decreased production at some Canadian North Atlantic oil platforms, as well as at certain refineries in the American Midwest.
Exports of canola plunged by 49.8% to their lowest level in six years after China blocked some shipments. Ottawa and Beijing are locked in a trade and diplomatic dispute.
Meanwhile, imports fell 1.7%. Statistics Canada said imports of transportation equipment and parts sank 27.7%, largely because of slower trade from Belgium.
Imports of metal and non-metallic minerals were also down, slumping 20.5% on the month because of lower shipments of gold and copper ores.
The data helped push the Canadian dollar up to a near one-week high against its U.S. counterpart.
""While this looks like a soft report, the declines in two-way trade were anticipated and not any worse than we had feared,"" said Andrew Grantham of CIBC Economics.
Canada sent 76% of all its goods exports to the United States in September. Exports to the United States dipped by 0.6% while imports slipped by 0.4%.

As a result, Canada's bilateral trade surplus shrank to C$4.76 billion in September from C$4.85 billion in August.

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's economy got off to a weak start to the final quarter of 2019, according to surveys which showed the giant services sector stagnated last month, with concerns about Brexit depressing new orders, while consumers stayed cautious.
Britain had been due to leave the European Union on Oct. 31 which prompted limited stockpiling by businesses and households.
But Brexit has now been delayed until Jan. 31, with an election on Dec. 12 raising further uncertainty.
The IHS Markit services Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) edged up to 50.0 -- which represents zero growth -- from 49.5 in September, which was one of the lowest readings since Britain was last in recession in 2009.
The all-sector PMI, covering manufacturing and construction as well as services, remained below 50 for a third month in a row, the first time this has happened since 2009.
""The underlying business trend remains one of stagnation at best,"" IHS Markit economist Chris Williamson said.
October's PMI readings on their own were consistent with a 0.1% quarterly fall in overall economic output, Markit said.
Britain's economy has lost momentum this year, hurt by a global downturn due to the U.S.-China trade war as well as increased Brexit uncertainty. 
In the euro zone, the manufacturing PMI contracted even more sharply than in Britain, reflecting the bloc's greater reliance on exports to China.
British consumer spending has been more resilient than business investment, but surveys on Tuesday showed a slowdown here too.
The British Retail Consortium said high street spending rose 0.6% in October, the most since April. But on a rolling basis sales have grown by an average of just 0.1% over the past 12 months, the lowest on record.
Barclaycard data showed spending growth slowed to 1.5% from 1.6% last month, and the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders reported a 7% annual fall in new car sales.
A brighter note came from a survey by HSBC which, in contrast to most others, showed businesses were cheerier about export prospects than a year ago.
BREXIT DELAYED
Businesses have struggled to plan around deadlines for leaving the EU that have changed three times this year, leading to volatility in official figures that has not always been tracked by the PMI.
Official data showed the economy shrank by 0.2% in the three months to June as businesses dealt with an overhang of raw materials bought before the original March 29 Brexit deadline.
Most economists expect a limited rebound in the third quarter, meaning Britain would dodge a recession.
But the overall picture is muted, with  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) -- one of the gloomier forecasters -- predicting growth of just 0.2% in the third quarter and stagnation in the fourth.
The Bank of England is due to update its growth forecasts on Thursday but economists polled by Reuters do not expect any change in interest rates ahead of December's election.
The opposition Labour Party plans to renegotiate Brexit and put the revised deal to a referendum. It also promises a significantly more interventionist approach to the economy.

For now, businesses surveyed by IHS Markit say Brexit worries are reducing orders, which fell in October by their most in six months for services businesses. On the all-sector measure, orders fell at the third-fastest rate since 2009.

BEIJING (Reuters) - China's services sector activity expanded at its slowest pace in eight months in October as new orders slowed and business confidence hit a 15-month low, a private survey showed on Tuesday.
Beijing has been counting on the services sector, which accounts for more than half of China's economy, to partly offset sluggish domestic and global demand for manufactured products as a prolonged trade war with the United States drags on.
The Caixin/Markit services purchasing managers' index (PMI)slipped to 51.1 last month, matching February's low and edging down from September's 51.3. It has stayed above the 50-pointmargin that separates growth from contraction on a monthly basis since late 2005.
The fall indicates widespread pressure on the services sector, after the October reading for the official non-manufacturing PMI, published by the National Bureau of Statistics, fell to the lowest level since February 2016.
Expectations regarding the one-year outlook for business activity fell to the lowest since July 2018, the Caixin PMI showed, indicating depressed business confidence amid subdued market conditions, according to Zhong Zhengsheng, director of macro economic analysis at CEBM Group.
New orders grew at the slowest pace since February. Labor materials and fuel costs continued to rise at a faster clip than prices charged, indicating more pressure on profit margins.
While employment edged up at a weaker pace in October, the gauge for outstanding business rose further into expansionary territory, with businesses citing insufficient staffing as a reason. This implies ""a mismatch between labor supply and demand,"" said Zhong.
One bright spot was that the volume of new work from abroad received increased for the fourth straight month in October, and at a faster pace than the month before.
Caixin's composite manufacturing and services PMI, also released on Tuesday, rose slightly to 52 in October from 51.9 inSeptember, boosted by manufacturing activity unexpectedly rising to the highest level in more than two years.
""China's economy continued to recover in general in October, thanks chiefly to the performance of the manufacturing sector. Domestic and foreign demand both improved. However, business confidence remained weak, constraining the release of production capacity. Structural unemployment and rising raw material costs remained issues,"" said Zhong."
214,By Bloomberg,"<span>Nov 05, 2019 12:48AM ET</span>","Australia Holds Key Rate, Wagers Property Will Lift Spirits","(Bloomberg) -- Australia kept interest rates unchanged Tuesday, betting that a rebound in property prices will increase household wealth and confidence and see consumers more willing to part with their cash.
Reserve Bank chief Philip Lowe and his board left the cash rate at 0.75% in Sydney as they monitor the ongoing impact of three reductions since June. The decision was predicted by money markets and economists and comes as policy makers struggle to accelerate economic growth and rekindle inflation.
“Given global developments and the evidence of the spare capacity in the Australian economy, it is reasonable to expect that an extended period of low interest rates will be required,” Governor Lowe said in a statement announcing the decision. The board “is prepared to ease monetary policy further if needed to support sustainable growth in the economy.”
Australia gained much-needed breathing space in its easing cycle when the Federal Reserve signaled last week it was pausing rate cuts. That is likely to cool upward pressure on an Aussie dollar that Lowe has struggled to contain in order to keep his nation’s exporters competitive and hiring.
While the RBA’s three-quarters of a percentage point of rate cuts -- the same as the Fed -- and Australian government tax rebates have failed to lift flagging consumer spirits, monetary policy easing has been a boon for housing.
Prices in Melbourne surged 2.3% in October, the biggest monthly gain in almost 10 years, and have jumped 6% since bottoming in May. Sydney isn’t far behind, advancing 1.7% last month and rebounding 5.3% since May.
Yet that wealth effect hasn’t translated into improved sentiment: consumer confidence has fallen in four of the five months since the RBA resumed easing; retail sales, meanwhile, are miserable and rose just 0.2% in September from a year earlier and actually fell 0.1% in volume terms in the third quarter.
Lowe said today the central scenario is for the economy to expand around 2.25% this year -- a quarter-point less than forecast three months ago -- and then “gradually to pick up” to around 3% in 2021, in line with its August assessment. No figure was provided for 2020. The RBA will release its updated quarterly forecasts Friday.
“The low level of interest rates, recent tax cuts, ongoing spending on infrastructure, the upswing in housing prices in some markets and a brighter outlook for the resources sector should all support growth,” the governor said. He reiterated the outlook for consumption remains the main domestic uncertainty.
In a new addition, Lowe added that, “other sources of uncertainty include the effects of the drought and the evolution of the housing construction cycle.”
As has been the case for some time, Australia’s economy is being supported by one of the fastest growing populations in the developed world. But that’s proving a problem for the jobs market, where a surge in hiring has been mainly met by new entrants to the labor force, keeping unemployment above 5%. Lowe is trying to push down the jobless rate in order to spur wage growth and revive inflation.
The RBA targets consumer-price growth of 2-3% over time and the government announced today it was sticking with that framework.
Offshore, key trading partner China continues to slow and instability from Brexit to Hong Kong is weighing on global growth. The bright spot is increasing signs of a preliminary U.S.-China trade deal.
The currency is holding below 70 U.S. cents, and policy makers will want to keep the pressure on the Aussie to aid growth, particularly as the government is disinclined to add stimulus to the economy. The Aussie was little changed after the decision, trading at 69.03 U.S. cents at 3:21 p.m. in Sydney.

215,By Bloomberg,"<span>Nov 04, 2019 10:55PM ET</span>",Hong Kong Slows Further With Business Outlook Worst Since 2008,"(Bloomberg) -- Hong Kong’s business outlook continued to drop in October, indicating that there will be no immediate pickup from the recession in the city which is facing a global trade slowdown and domestic political unrest and violence.
The purchasing manager’s index for the whole economy dropped to 39.3. the worst result since the depths of the financial crisis in November 2008, according to IHS Markit, which surveyed about 400 private sector companies. Output fell to 32.3, the lowest reading since the series began and well below the 50 level that separates expansion from contraction.
Hong Kong’s economy contracted sharply in the third quarter, amid months of violent protests in the streets and ongoing headwinds from the U.S.-China trade war. Tourism has plummeted across the board, especially arrivals from mainland China, which accounts for almost 80% of all visitors to the city.
“The ongoing political unrest and impact of trade tensions saw business activity fall at the sharpest pace since the survey started over 21 years ago. Anecdotal evidence revealed that the retail and tourism sectors remained particularly affected,” Bernard Aw, principal economist at IHS, said in the release. “As new orders continued to fall sharply, led by a record decline in demand from mainland China, firms were becoming increasingly pessimistic about the outlook.”
The city will probably have to cut it’s full-year growth target from the current level of 0-1%, Financial Secretary Paul Chan said on his official blog over the weekend, after data showing the economy entered a technical recession. Retail sales dropped for an eighth month in September, as tourists stayed away amid the violent protests.
“In a sign of growing pessimism, firms cut back further on their purchasing activity and input inventories in October, reducing both at a rate not seen since the survey started in July 1998,” IHS said in the report."
216,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 04, 2019 09:18PM ET</span>",Hong Kong business activity contracts at fastest pace in 21 years,"HONG KONG (Reuters) - Business activity in Hong Kong's private sector fell to its weakest in 21 years in October, weighed down by anti-government protests and softening global demand, according to an IHS Markit survey published on Tuesday.
More than five months of often violent street protests have battered the city's retail and tourism sector, with preliminary government data showing the economy slid into recession for the first time in a decade in the third quarter.
Demand from mainland China declined at the sharpest pace in the survey's history - which started in July 1998 - while companies also cut back on purchasing and input inventories at the fastest clip since the series began, IHS Markit said. 
""Hong Kong's private sector remained mired in one of its worst downturns for the past two decades during October, with the latest PMI survey signaling a deepening economic malaise,"" said Bernard Aw, principal economist at IHS Markit. 
""As new orders continued to fall sharply, led by a record decline in demand from mainland China, firms were becoming increasingly pessimistic about the outlook."" 
Its seasonally adjusted headline Hong Kong Purchasing Manager's Index (PMI) fell to 39.3 in October, down from 41.5 in September and signaling the worst deterioration since November 2008, during the global financial crisis. 
A survey reading above 50 indicates expansion, while a figure below 50 denotes contraction. 
Almost all growth engines in the Asian financial hub stalled over the summer as stores, shopping malls and restaurants shut to avoid clashes between riot police and protesters, while the Sino-U.S. trade war intensified. Hong Kong is one of the world's most popular tourism destinations and a bustling container port.
Protesters are angry by what they see as Beijing's tightening grip over the city's cherished freedoms promised under a ""one country, two systems"" formula when Britain returned it to Chinese rule in 1997. 
The protests escalated in mid-June and show no sign of abating as demonstrators keep up their calls for universal suffrage and an independent inquiry into what they see as excessive police action, among other demands. 
Police, who have at times fired rubber bullets and tear gas at petrol bomb-throwing protesters, say they have shown restraint in the face of escalating violence.

The British Retail Consortium (BRC) said overall retail spending rose 0.6% year-on-year in October, marking the strongest growth since April when spending was boosted by the timing of Easter. 
Still, the BRC said the longer-term outlook remained bleak, with the 12-month rolling average of sales growth falling to a new low of 0.1%.
""With Brexit still unresolved and a December election creating new uncertainties, retailers will be looking nervously at the months ahead,"" BRC chief executive Helen Dickinson said. 
Consumers have propped up Britain's economy since the 2016 Brexit referendum, helping to offset reduced company investment.
But economists say recent signs of a weakening in spending by households raise the risk of a recession as the country prepares to leave the European Union.
Struggling baby products retailer Mothercare (L:MTC) said on Monday it intended to appoint administrators for its British division - giving it temporary protection from creditors - as it battled competition from supermarkets and online retailers.
The BRC showed that in like-for-like terms, which strips out changes in retail space, sales were up 0.1% compared with October 2018.
A separate survey from payment card company Barclaycard showed consumer spending rose 1.5% in October in annual terms, slowing from growth of 1.6% in September.
""Ongoing economic uncertainty combined with a bleak start to autumn led many Brits to stay in rather than spend out last month, choosing takeaways and evenings at home over socializing at bars or restaurants,"" Esme Harwood, a director at Barclaycard, said.

Just 17% of consumers surveyed by Barclaycard said they had stocked up ahead of the Oct. 31 Brexit deadline, with tinned food and toilet paper the top purchases of the minority who were concerned about possible disruption from a no-deal Brexit.

The AIB IHS Markit Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) for services slipped to 50.6 in October from 53.1 in September, holding just above the 50 mark that separates growth from contraction.
Ireland's economy has largely weathered the disruption caused by Britain's 2016 vote to leave the European Union, but the protracted uncertainty over Brexit has begun to take its toll.
New orders also expanded at the weakest rate in more than seven years, with the related subindex slipping to 50.9 in October from 52.2 the month before.
""The slowdown evident in manufacturing this year would now appear to have spread to the services sector,"" said Oliver Mangan, chief economist at AIB.

While Ireland's economy has remained the fastest growing in the EU throughout three tortuous years of Brexit negotiations, consumer confidence took a hit in recent months as the prospects of a no-deal British exit rose.
The most recent survey ran from Oct. 10 to 18, a period that began with a meeting between the leaders of Ireland and Britain that paved the way for a deal that failed to progress through the British parliament before an election was called.
The KBC Bank consumer sentiment index sank to 69.5 last month from 75.3 in September, the lowest level in over six years. The index stood at 93.5 a year ago.
""There is little doubt that the ongoing decline in consumer confidence  is largely as a result of continuing nervousness around Brexit,"" KBC Bank Ireland chief economist Austin Hughes said.
""Whereas risks are large and one-sided from a consumer confidence perspective, this has to be weighed against the current reality of healthy gains in employment and improving incomes. So, spending hasn't stopped but it is notably slower than it might otherwise be.""
Hughes added that the October reading may also hint at a measure of disappointment with Ireland's budget for 2020 when the government eschewed the tax cuts and spending increases of recent years to set aside funds for firms most exposed to Brexit."

Factory goods orders declined 0.6% after dipping by an unrevised 0.1% in August, the Commerce Department said on Monday. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast factory orders would drop 0.5% in September.
Factory orders fell 0.3% compared to September 2018. Shipments of manufactured goods declined 0.2% in September after decreasing 0.3% in the prior month.
Pointing to underlying weakness in the sector, which accounts for about 11% of the economy, unfilled orders at factories were unchanged after edging up 0.1% in August. Inventories rose 0.3% in September after dipping 0.1% in August.
Manufacturing has been hobbled by a 16-month trade war between the United States and China, which has also caused a drop in business investment. U.S. and Chinese negotiators have been racing to finalize a text of a 'phase one' agreement between the world's two largest economies.
A critical date is Dec. 15, when new U.S. tariffs on Chinese imports such as laptops, toys and electronics are set to kick in.
Transportation equipment orders dropped 2.8% in September after increasing 0.2% in August. Orders for civilian aircraft and parts dropped 11.8% after declining 17.2% in the prior month.
Orders for computers and electronic products fell 1.2% but orders for electrical equipment, appliances and components rose 0.7%. Machinery orders edged up 0.2% in September after decreasing 0.3% in August.
The Commerce Department also said September orders for non-defense capital goods excluding aircraft, which are seen as a measure of business spending plans on equipment, dropped 0.6% instead of the 0.5% drop reported last month.
Shipments of core capital goods, which are used to calculate business equipment spending in the gross domestic product report, declined 0.7% in September, the same as previously reported. Business investment declined at its steepest pace in more than 3-1/2 years in the third quarter."

LONDON (Reuters) - British construction activity shrank for the sixth month in a row in October, and at one of the fastest rates since the 2009 financial crisis, as Brexit worries and a general economic slowdown held back growth.
The IHS Markit/CIPS construction PMI rose to 44.2 in October from 43.3 in September, roughly in line with economists' forecasts in a Reuters poll, but this was still the third-lowest reading since 2009 and pointed to a fall in output.
""UK construction companies experienced a downturn in business performance during October as political uncertainty and subdued economic conditions again combined to hold back sales,"" IHS Markit economist Tim Moore said.
Construction companies reported the seventh successive fall in new work, ordered less raw materials and did not replace staff who quit.
Official data showed construction output rose by 2.4% in the 12 months to August, the most recent figures available, but last month smaller housebuilders reported the weakest demand since 2013.
Britain had been due to leave the European Union on Oct. 31, but Brexit was delayed for the third time this year after Prime Minister Boris Johnson failed to get an exit deal through parliament in time.
House building dropped off in October at the fastest rate since June 2016, the same month as the referendum that set Brexit in motion, while civil engineering projects declined at the fastest rate since October 2009.
Only a partial leveling in the rate of decline in commercial work stopped the index as a whole hitting fresh lows.
""There are clear signs that construction firms are positioning for an extended soft patch for project starts, as highlighted by a further decline in purchasing volumes and another month of cuts to workforce numbers,"" Moore said."

IHS Markit's final manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) was 45.9, barely above September's seven-year low reading of 45.7 and its ninth month below the 50 mark separating growth from contraction.
An index measuring output, which feeds into a composite PMI due on Wednesday that is seen as a good barometer of economic health, rose to 46.6 from September's near seven-year low of 46.1.
""Euro zone manufacturing remained stuck in its steepest decline for seven years in October, meaning the goods producing sector is on course to act as a severe drag on GDP again in the fourth quarter,"" said Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit.
""Geopolitical concerns, ranging from Brexit to U.S. trade policy, continue to create uncertainty, further dampening demand both at home and in export markets.""
An index measuring new orders rose to 45.3 from 43.4 but spent its 13th straight month below the breakeven mark.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australian retail sales surprisingly fell last quarter while growth in September was weaker-than-expected, underlining the need for even more stimulus to jumpstart the slowing economy.
Retail sales inched up 0.2% in September after a respectable 0.4% gain in August, figures from the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) showed on Monday. Analysts polled by Reuters had expected an increase of 0.5%.
Quarterly data showed sales slipped 0.1% in inflation-adjusted terms in the three months to September following an already sedate June quarter. Analysts were looking for a 0.2% rise. 
Retail volumes have now recorded falls in three of the past four quarters to be down 0.2% from a year ago. The last time annual volumes were this weak was in the early 1990s recession.  
In another worrying sign for the economy, separate data on Monday showed Australian job advertisements in newspapers and on the internet fell 1% in October to the lowest level in more than 2-1/2 years. 
The gloomy figures knocked the Australian dollar  off a near three-month peak to $0.6904. 
""The fall in real retail sales in the third quarter underlines that the RBA still has more work to do,"" said Marcel Thieliant, Singapore-based senior economist at Capital Economists.
The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) last month chopped its benchmark rate for a third time this year to a record low 0.75% in a bid to revive employment growth, consumer spending and inflation. 
GDP growth would continue to fall short of potential next year and the RBA ""will have to cut interest rates by more than most anticipate"", he added.
Australia's annual gross domestic product (GDP) growth has weakened to the slowest in a decade and indicators so far suggest the lacklustre momentum could continue for a while. Third-quarter GDP data is due next month. 
Investors are looking ahead to the RBA's monthly policy meeting due at 0330 GMT on Tuesday, where it is likely to stay on the sidelines as it awaits the impact of its stimulus so far.
Financial futures <0#YIB:> are pricing in a 60% chance of a cut to 0.5% early next year, with some economists speculating the need for unconventional policy measures or quantitative easing (QE) such as bond purchases or discounted lending to banks.
""We expect the RBA to embark on some form of QE. This could come as early as February 2020,"" Citi economist Josh Williamson wrote to clients last week.

""With bank pass-through of conventional policy to lending rates becoming constrained, our forecast for the next cash rate move in February 2020 implies that this date is the first opportunity for the RBA to announce a QE programme.""

Monday's figures from Australia and New Zealand Banking Group (AX:ANZ) showed total job advertisements slipped a seasonally adjusted 1% in October, following a 0.3% rise in September.
Job ads averaged 155,972 daily on websites one day a week in October, 11.4% lower than in October last year. Annual growth has been in negative territory since the start of this year.
ANZ's senior economist Catherine Birch said jobs ads were now at their lowest level since January 2017, if a holiday-affected result in May was excluded.
""The ANZ Job Ads series has been pointing to a material slowdown in employment growth for some time; yet employment growth has been remarkably resilient,"" Birch said in a statement.
""We don’t expect it can hold up for much longer though.
In particular, employment in the construction industry should continue to fall as residential building activity contracts through to mid-2020.""
The ANZ vacancies series is closely watched by the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) given it counts actual job ads, while Australian Bureau of Statistics data is based on more tenuous intentions by firms to hire.

""Slower economic growth (is) a symptom of the malaise that has set in, driven primarily by Brexit uncertainty and political instability,"" Michael Izza, chief executive of the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales (ICAEW), said.
The trade conflict between the United States and China was also a factor, ICAEW said.
The telephone survey of 1,000 accountants was conducted from July 22 to Oct. 18, mostly covering the period after Boris Johnson took over from Theresa May as prime minister and sought to negotiate a new exit deal from the European Union.
Johnson failed to take Britain out of the EU by Oct. 31 because of a deadlock in parliament. He has called an election for Dec. 12, ahead of a new Brexit deadline of Jan. 31.
Other business surveys have been similarly sombre. The Confederation of British Industry last month said manufacturers were the most gloomy about their export prospects in a decade.
Separately, forecasters at the EY ITEM Club consultancy cut their prediction for British economic growth next year to 1.0% from 1.5% - even as they assumed that Johnson will get his Brexit deal through parliament before the Jan. 31 deadline.
""The outlook for business investment growth is pretty bleak, with a weaker global economic environment adding to corporate concerns over the UK outlook,"" EY economist Mark Gregory said.
""A Brexit deal is only the first step in reducing uncertainty and may be offset by concerns over future growth with a divergent EU-UK relationship,"" he added."

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. job growth slowed less than expected in October as the drag from a strike at General Motors (N:GM) was offset by gains elsewhere and hiring in the prior two months was stronger than previously estimated, offering some assurance that consumers would continue to support the slowing economy.
While the Labor Department's closely watched monthly employment report on Friday showed the unemployment rate picking up from near a 50-year low of 3.5% last month, that was because of an influx into the labor force in a sign of confidence in jobs markets.
The report came on the heels of data this week showing a further slowdown in economic growth in the third quarter as a trade tensions-induced slump in business investment deepened.
Manufacturing's struggles appear to have persisted early in the fourth quarter, with a survey on Friday showing a measure of factory activity remaining in contraction territory for the third straight month in October.
The Federal Reserve cut interest rates on Wednesday for the third time this year, but signaled a pause in the easing cycle that started in July when it reduced borrowing costs for the first time since 2008.
""The current economic expansion looks set to continue at least through the first part of next year despite the trade war drag,"" said Gus Faucher, chief economist at PNC Financial (NYSE:PNC) in Pittsburgh. ""Today's solid jobs report means that the Fed, after cutting its policy rate three times since the summer, is likely to keep rates steady in the near term.""
Nonfarm payrolls increased by 128,000 jobs last month, with manufacturing shedding 36,000 positions - the most since October 2009, the government's survey of establishments showed. Striking workers who do not receive a paycheck during the payrolls survey period are treated as unemployed. The strike by about 46,000 workers at GM plants in Michigan and Kentucky ended last Friday.
Job growth last month was also held back by the departure of 20,000 temporary workers hired by the government for the 2020 Census. Excluding the strike and these temporary hires, economists estimate payrolls increased by about 190,000.
The economy created 95,000 more jobs in August and September than previously estimated. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast payrolls rising by only 89,000 jobs in October.
The dollar was little against a basket of currencies on the employment report, while U.S. Treasury prices fell. U.S. stocks were trading higher.
Job growth is slowing this year, averaging 167,000 per month compared with an average monthly gain of 223,000 in 2018, in part because of the nearly 16-month trade war between the United States and China, which has undermined business investment.
The U.S.-China trade war continues to cast a pall over the longest economic expansion, now in its 11th year.
The Institute for Supply Management (ISM) said its index of national factory activity rose to a reading of 48.3 last month from 47.8 in September, which was the lowest level since June 2009 when the recession was ending. A reading below 50 indicates contraction and October marked the third straight month that the index broke below the 50 threshold.
The index had declined for six straight months. Though the ISM's forward-looking new orders sub-index increased last month, in remained in contraction territory. The survey's factory employment index rose to 47.7 in October from 46.3 in September.
LABOR MARKET OPTIMISM
There are fears the business investment malaise could spill over to the labor market, which is underpinning consumer spending. Fed Chair Jerome Powell said he did not see this risk as the labor market remains healthy.
Solid consumer spending blunted some of the drag on the economy from weak business investment to limit the slowdown in growth to a 1.9% annualized rate in the third quarter. The economy grew at a 2.0% pace in the April-June quarter.
With the labor market steadily pushing up wages, consumers are likely to continue carrying the economy. Average hourly earnings increased six cents, or 0.2% last month after being unchanged in September. That kept the annual increase in wages to 3.0% in October. Wage growth peaked at 3.4% in February.
The one-tenth of a percentage point rise in the unemployment rate to 3.6% last month also reflected 325,000 people streaming into the labor force. The smaller household survey from which the unemployment rate is derived also showed a moderation in employment after adding 1.57 million jobs in the five months prior to October.
A broader measure of unemployment, which includes people who want to work but have given up searching and those working part-time because they cannot find full-time employment, rose to 7.0% last month from 6.9% in September, which was the lowest level since December 2000.
The labor force participation rate, or the proportion of working-age Americans who have a job or are looking for one, increased to 63.3% last month from 63.2% in September.
October's plunge in manufacturing employment reflected a strike-driven 41,600 tumble in payrolls in the auto sector. Manufacturing payrolls fell by 5,000 in September. Manufacturing is struggling under the weight of trade tariffs, which the White House has argued are intended to boost the sector.
Construction employment rose by 10,000 jobs in October. Hiring in the sector has slowed from a peak of 56,000 jobs in January. There were increases in professional and business services, healthcare, leisure and hospitality, financial activities, retail and wholesale trade employment last month.
Government employment fell by 3,000 jobs in October as 20,000 temporary workers hired for the 2020 Census completed their work."
230,By Bloomberg,"<span>Nov 01, 2019 10:43AM ET</span>",U.S. Factory Gauge Signals Contraction for Third-Straight Month,"(Bloomberg) -- A gauge of U.S. manufacturing trailed estimates for October and signaled the sector contracted for a third-straight month, with the weakest production level since the last recession.
The Institute for Supply Management index rose to 48.3 from a 10-year low of 47.8 the prior month, compared with the median projection for 48.9. The report Friday showed three of five components -- new orders, employment and inventories -- rose from September but stayed below 50, the line separating expansion and contraction. The production component sank to a 46.2 in a fourth-straight drop, though that may reflect the impact of the six-week walkout of General Motors (NYSE:GM) workers during the month.
The reading highlights the challenges for a manufacturing sector confronting headwinds ranging from the ongoing trade tensions with China to slowing global growth and the strong dollar. That's forced some producers to cut back on hiring and delay investment, though unemployment near a half-century low and a stable expansion show that the shaky sector isn't derailing the world's largest economy.
ISM's employment gauge rebounded from a three-year low to 47.7, suggesting companies continue to cut staff but at a slower rate. Friday's Labor Department jobs report showed factory employment posted a second-straight drop in October, driven by the GM strike, as U.S. payrolls climbed.
While manufacturing only makes up 11% of gross domestic product, the concern is that the deterioration in the sector could spread. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said Wednesday that consumers haven't shown signs of being affected by manufacturing weakness.
There have been indications of resilience for American producers that had been in recession earlier this year. The Fed's industrial production gauge rose at a 1.2% annual rate in the third quarter after declines of about 2% in the first and second quarters.
The crosscurrents for factories were visible in ISM trade data, with the measure for imports declining to a 10-year low of 45.3.
Meanwhile, the export orders index, a proxy for overseas demand, rebounded from a 10-year low with the biggest gain since 2011. That brought it to 50.4, back to a level signaling expansion for the first time since June and making it the only sub-gauge that's above that dividing line for October.
The new orders gauge rose to 49.1, and measures of both customer and business inventories also increased. The index of supplier deliveries slumped to the lowest level since February 2016.
The ISM’s index of prices paid sank further below 50, suggesting inflationary pressures remain muted. Order backlogs declined."
231,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 01, 2019 10:21AM ET</span>",U.S. construction spending beats expectations on homebuilding,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. construction spending increased more than expected in September as investment in homebuilding rose its highest level in nine months.
The Commerce Department said on Friday construction spending rebounded 0.5%. Data for August was revised down to show construction outlays falling 0.3% instead of ticking up 0.1% as previously reported.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast construction spending gaining 0.2% in September. Construction spending dropped 2.0% on a year-on-year basis in September.
Spending on private residential projects increased 0.6% to $511.4 billion, the highest level since December 2018, after advancing 0.8% in August. Investment in residential construction rebounded in the third quarter after contracting for six straight quarters, thanks to declining mortgage rates.
Mortgage rates have declined as the Federal Reserve has cut interest rates three times this year, to keep the longest economic expansion in history on track. The expansion, now in its 11th year, is under threat from a trade war between the United States and China, and slowing growth.
Spending on private nonresidential structures, which includes manufacturing and power plants, dropped 0.3% in September. Investment in private nonresidential structures tumbled 1.5% in August.
Outlays on private nonresidential structures have been weighed down by a manufacturing downturn due to trade tensions and cheaper energy products. Investment in nonresidential construction fell at its steepest pace in nearly four years in the third quarter. That contributed to business investment contracting for a second straight quarter.
Spending on private construction projects rose 0.2% in September after falling 0.3% in August.
Investment in public construction projects jumped 1.5% after declining 0.4% in August. Spending on state and local government construction projects raced ahead 1.6%.
That followed a 0.2% drop in August. Outlays on federal government construction projects dropped 1.1% in September, decreasing for a third straight month."

Investing.com - The latest jobs report gave the stock market everything it wanted, with strong payroll growth and tamer inflation.
The U.S. economy created more jobs than Wall Street expected in October, the Labor Department reported Friday, in an unusual month affected by the strike by workers at General Motors.
Stocks rose at the open of trading, with the S&P 500 rising 0.6%.
Nonfarm payrolls rose by 128,000, compared with expectations for a rise of 89,000 according to forecasts compiled by Investing.com. September's hiring was revised up to 180,000 from an initially-reported 136,000.
The unemployment rate ticked up to 3.6%, in line with forecasts.
“Put it all together, and this latest jobs report says the labor market is chugging along,” economist Justin Wolfers tweeted.
The GM (NYSE:GM) strike cut nonfarm payrolls by 42,000, so the gain would be 170,000 without the work stoppage. Workers on strike are not counted as employed in the survey.
Average hourly earnings rose 0.2%, versus expectations for a rise of 0.3%, while average weekly hours came in at 34.4, matching estimates.
“Over the past three months, (the jobs report has) averaged an extra +176,000 jobs per month,” Wolfers said. “That's more than enough to keep pushing the unemployment rate down even further.”

233,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 01, 2019 09:41AM ET</span>",Canadian factory activity expands at fastest pace in eight months,"TORONTO (Reuters) - Canadian manufacturing activity expanded in October for the second consecutive month as new orders climbed, which could temper concern at the Bank of Canada about the potential for global trade conflicts to derail the domestic economy.
The IHS Markit Canada Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' index (PMI), a measure of manufacturing business conditions, rose to a seasonally adjusted 51.2 in October, its highest level since February, from 51.0 in September. A reading above 50 shows expansion in the sector.
""October's survey data indicates a change of fortunes for the Canadian manufacturing sector, with output growth hitting an eight-month high in response to improving order books,"" said Tim Moore, economics associate director at IHS Markit.
The new orders index rose to the highest level since February, at 51.8 from 50.7 in September. The measure of output also notched an eight-month high, rising to 51.1 from 50.2, but was softer than the long-run average for the survey.
""Rising domestic demand has underpinned the gradual recovery in new work since the summer, but export sales remain relatively sluggish against a backdrop of weaker global trade conditions,"" Moore said.
The index for new export orders slipped into contraction, at 49.0 from 50.4 in September, with manufacturers pointing to intense competitive pressures.
On Wednesday, the Bank of Canada said the country's economy will ""be increasingly tested"" by trade uncertainty as it left its benchmark interest rate on hold at 1.75%.
The employment measure continued to show expansion but fell to 51.2 from 52.1."
234,By Bloomberg,"<span>Nov 01, 2019 07:38AM ET</span>",Hong Kong Retail Sales Continue Decline in September Amid Unrest,"(Bloomberg) -- The record weakness facing Hong Kong’s hard-hit retailers continued, albeit at a slower pace, in September as violent protests helped push the city into a recession, data released Friday showed.
Retail sales by value fell 18.3% in the month, compared with a decline of a revised 22.9% in August. Retail sales by volume declined 20.4%.
Hong Kong’s economy contracted sharply in the third quarter, amid months of violent protests in the streets and ongoing trade headwinds from the U.S.-China trade war. Tourism has plummeted across the board, especially arrivals from mainland China, which accounts for almost 80% of all visitors to the city. Financial Secretary Paul Chan has repeatedly called on property owners to cut their retail tenants a break as the slump continues.
Police scuffled with protesters and Halloween party-goers in the busy entertainment and shopping area of Lan Kwai Fong Thursday. Riot police closed the holiday hotspot at around 8:30 p.m., leading to tense confrontations with costumed party-goers who were shut out.
As an example of the retail impact of the anti-China and anti-government demonstrations, operating profits among prominent local jewelers including Chow Tai Fook Jewellery Group Ltd. and Luk Fook Holdings International Ltd. may have plunged as much as 45% for the fiscal first half ended September from a year ago, said Catherine Lim, a senior analyst with Bloomberg Intelligence, in an Oct. 16 report. The jewelry chains are set to report earnings at the end of November.
“Gains from mainland Chinese tourism, which drove operating profit at these jewelers’ Hong Kong outlets more than 40% higher in the fiscal year ended March, could diminish into 2020 as a result,” Lim said.
Third-quarter gross domestic product retreated 3.2% from the previous three months, after a 0.4% contraction in the second quarter. That’s the worst slump since 2009, in the aftermath of the global financial crisis. The government said the economy is very likely to contract in 2019 from the previous year."
235,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 01, 2019 05:46AM ET</span>",UK manufacturing decline slows after new Brexit stockpiling rush: PMI,"By Andy Bruce
LONDON (Reuters) - A renewed rush to stockpile ahead of another aborted Brexit deadline limited losses for British manufacturers last month, though not by enough to prevent a sixth month of contraction, a survey showed on Friday.
The IHS Markit/CIPS UK Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) rose to 49.6 from 48.3 in September, its highest level since April and topping all forecasts in a Reuters poll of economists that had pointed to a reading of 48.1.
However, the index still remained below the 50 dividing line between growth and contraction.
October's PMI was flattered by manufacturers building stocks ahead of the Oct. 31 date for Brexit that was superseded this week by a Jan. 31 deadline, survey compiler IHS Markit said.
Britain will also hold an early national election on Dec. 12 as Prime Minister Boris Johnson tries to break the Brexit deadlock.
Uncertainty around Britain's exit from the European Union, originally scheduled for March 29, had previously prompted factories to load up on parts at the fastest rate in the 27-year history of the PMI surveys in early 2019.
That spurred a brief increase in manufacturing output which gave way to a sharp downturn in mid-2019, exacerbated by a slowing global economy.
The latest official figures show that factory output fell by 1.7% in the year to August, and the Confederation of British Industry said last week that manufacturers reported the bleakest outlook since 2009.
October's PMI data showed that new business continued to decline, despite the fastest growth in export orders since December 2018 as EU customers stocked up on parts from British suppliers - a sign that domestic demand was especially weak.
""The underlying picture looks even darker than even these disappointing headline numbers suggest,"" IHS Markit director Rob Dobson said.
""Output and new orders fell despite short-term boosts from stock-building activity in advance of the October 31 Brexit deadline, which included a rise in exports as clients in the EU sought to mitigate supply risk.""
Compared with its long-term average, the elevated level of the stocks of purchases index added 0.8 points to the headline PMI.
IHS Markit said Brexit uncertainty had hurt the investment goods industry hardest as customers postpone or cancel capital spending.
""With a further Brexit extension confirmed and the prospect of a December general election, it looks as if the specter of uncertainty will cast its shadow over manufacturing for the remainder of 2019,"" Dobson said."

HONG KONG (Reuters) - Hong Kong's retail sales plunged in September as the anti-government protests that have gripped the Chinese-ruled city for nearly five months scared off tourists and battered spending.
Since June, protesters have taken to the streets of the Asian financial hub in sometimes violent demonstrations in response to perceived Chinese meddling with the city's promised freedoms.
Already hampered by the Sino-U.S. trade war and a slowing Chinese economy, the protests have further damaged the city's economy, hitting retail and tourism particularly hard.
Retail sales in September fell 18.3% from a year earlier, government data showed on Friday.
The slide compared with a revised 22.9% drop in August and a 21.5% fall in September 1998, according to Refinitiv data, as clashes spread across shopping districts and took a heavy toll on malls.
Tourist numbers fell about 50% in the first half of October, Chief Executive Carrie Lam said on Wednesday.
""The continuing unrest has crippled our retail trade, as well as catering, transport and numerous other businesses associated with the tourism industry,"" Lam said.
Retailers from prime shopping malls to family-run businesses have been forced by the protests to close on multiple occasions.
Retail sales fell for an eighth consecutive month to HK$29.9 billion ($3.81 billion) in September. They were down 20.4% in volume, compared with a revised 25.2% drop in August.
For the third quarter as a whole, retail sales volume fell by 19.5% year-on-year, almost on par with the record decline in the third quarter of 1998, the government said.
""As protests involving violence continue to deter tourists and reduce local consumption, and the subdued economic outlook also dampens consumer sentiment, the performance of retail sales is likely to stay weak in the near term,"" a government spokesman said.
For first nine months, total retail sales fell 7.3% in value and 8.3% in volume.
Figures on Thursday showed that Hong Kong slid into recession in the third quarter, for the first time since the global financial crisis. Lam has warned that full-year growth is likely to contract.
Analysts say a weak Chinese yuan has also translated into lower spending. Luxury goods have been hit particularly hard, with brands from Prada to Cartier counting the cost to their businesses.
Hong Kong is one of the world's top five luxury destinations and has long been a magnet for brands attracted by the flow of visitors from mainland China. Visitors from across the border typically make up around 80% of the city's overall tourists. Their numbers decline 35% in September. (https:// In September, sales of jeweler, watches, clocks and valuable gifts dropped 40.8%, compared with a revised 47.1% drop in August.
Several retailers have been forced to shut operations, including Chinese fashion retailer EPO, which said last week it had closed all 14 stores in Hong Kong because of the social and economic conditions."
237,By Bloomberg,"<span>Nov 01, 2019 12:42AM ET</span>","South Korea’s Exports, Prices Keep Showing Trade-War Pain","(Bloomberg) -- South Korea’s exports plunged the most in almost four years while consumer prices failed to rise for a third straight month, highlighting continued pain in this Asian bellwether for global trade.
China’s slowing economy and its trade war with the U.S. have hit South Korean exports ranging from memory chips to petrochemicals, putting the economy on course for the slowest expansion in a decade. Inflation at zero shows demand remains sluggish despite fiscal stimulus and monetary easing.
Both exports and imports fell about 15% in October from a year earlier, pushed down by a slide in shipments to the world’s two biggest economies. Consumer prices recovered from a 0.4% drop in September, but stalled price movements remains far below the central bank’s 2% inflation target.
A recent uptick in semiconductor prices and a decline in inventories had offered glimmers of hope that the tech cycle might be bottoming out, which would spur South Korea’s exports recovery. Friday’s data offered a setback to that optimism, with semiconductors shipment plunging 32% from a year earlier.
“It’s not a pretty picture, but we’ve seen a bad one for quite some time now.” said Moon Hong-cheol, a strategist at DB Financial Investment in Seoul. “There’s still anticipation that chips will rebound and if they do, we could start seeing exports falling by a single-digit number.”
South Korea is home to Samsung Electronics (KS:005930) Co., a key link in the global supply chain. The economy ships everything from smartphones to memory chips, two major sources of income that have been among the hardest hit in the trade war between the U.S. and China.
Weak Vitality
The steep cut in overall imports reflects private consumption still slumping in South Korea and dovetails with flagging inflation numbers, Moon said. Finance Minister Hong Nam-ki said last month that “vitality” in the private sector was the weakest since the global financial crisis.
South Korea’s economic growth slowed in the third quarter and the Bank of Korea has supported the economy with two interest-rate cuts this year to 1.25%, matching a record low.
“The BOK will feel less pressure to cut rates with inflation coming out better than surveyed,” An Young-jin, an economist at SK Securities, said, still expecting the bank to lower its key interest rate early next year. Economists surveyed by Bloomberg had expected a 0.3% slide in prices.
A full-fledged recovery for South Korea’s economy will depend not only on tech demand, but also on whether President Donald Trump follows through with his willingness to strike a deal with China.
“Expectation is high for a deal between the U.S. and China and if the improvement in relations continues, South Korean exports should rebound in the first quarter next year,” said Mun Byung-ki, a researcher at the Korea International Trade Association. Moon added that the steep fall in October exports was partly statistical, given a 23% jump in shipments a year earlier, the most in 2018.
Recovery Expected
Exports to China dropped 17% in October while those to the U.S. fell 8.4%, according to data from South Korea’s trade ministry. Shipments of petrochemicals fell 23%, but overseas sales of computer and vessels performed well with positive growth.
The pace of exports decline will gradually narrow from November, the trade ministry said. An expected recovery in chip prices and a potential “phase 1” trade deal between the U.S. and China were among reasons cited by the ministry as leading to an exports expansion in the first quarter of 2020.

238,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 01, 2019 12:06AM ET</span>","Asia's factory pain deepens on trade war, global slowdown","By Leika Kihara
TOKYO (Reuters) - Asia's export powerhouses saw factory activity shrink further in October, as cooling global demand and trade tensions keep policymakers busy ramping up support for their fragile economies to help dodge recession.
A private sector purchasing managers' index (PMI) showed a surprising pick-up in China's factory activity on Friday, but this was in contrast to an official factory gauge the day before which pointed to a further deterioration.
Manufacturing activity in North Asia contracted with Japan's sinking to a more than three-year low in October on shrinking new orders and output; activity in South Korea and Taiwan also shrank as companies bore the brunt of slumping demand across the globe.
The Caixin survey showed China's factory activity expanded at the fastest pace in well over two years in October as new export orders rose and plants ramped up production. But the official survey suggested a weak start to the fourth quarter for big state firms.
Overall, the soft batch of leading indicators highlights the broadening pain the bitter Sino-U.S. trade war is inflicting on business sentiment, which forced the International Monetary Fund to slash its economic growth forecast for Asia.
""The slump in exports remains the true Achilles' heel...with headwinds coming from all directions,"" said Joe Hayes, economist at IHS Markit, on South Korea's PMI.
""As well as U.S.-Sino trade frictions, tensions with Japan and a stagnating European economy have significantly dented order book volumes at South Korean manufacturers,"" he said.
POLICY LOOSENING
Increased uncertainty from the trade war and Britain's divorce from the European Union have prodded central banks to top up monetary support to fend off external headwinds.
The U.S. Federal Reserve slashed interest rates on Wednesday for the third time this year. South Korea's central bank also cut rates in October and kept the door open for further easing to support a flagging economy.
The Bank of Japan kept policy steady on Thursday but gave the strongest signal to date that it may cut rates in the near future, shrugging off concerns it has run out of tools to spur growth after years of heavy money printing.
""It's true the two countries appear to be making some progress towards a solution, and that markets are taking this positively,"" BOJ Governor Haruhiko Kuroda told a news conference on Thursday. ""But I wouldn't say risks have deteriorated.""
Fresh concerns over whether Washington and Beijing can iron out their difference resurfaced on Friday after Bloomberg reported that Chinese officials have doubts about reaching a comprehensive long-term solution to the trade war.
The nearly 16-months long trade war is placing increasing strain on the global economy and may see policymakers resort to a more aggressive mix of fiscal and monetary measures in the coming months.
Factory activity contracted in Malaysia and Indonesia, which saw PMIs hitting a four-year low. Activity was flat in Vietnam.
Japan's exports contracted for a 10th straight month in September, casting doubt on whether the world's third-largest economy can sustain an expansion as households take a hit from a sales tax hike that went into effect in October.
South Korea, the world's sixth-largest exporter, also saw economic growth slow more than expected in the third quarter due to a slump in domestic spending and global trade headwinds."

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's September jobless rate climbed from near 30-year lows and job availability slipped, government data showed on Friday, suggesting the nation's tightest jobs market in decades may be reaching its peak.
Japan's ageing and declining population has led to a tight labour market. But wage increases remain weak and companies are wary of passing on more of their profits to employees due to uncertainty over the economic outlook.
That has thwarted policymakers' hopes of creating an expansionary impulse in the sluggish economy, where higher pay drives up consumer spending and ultimately inflation.
The seasonally adjusted unemployment rate rose to 2.4%, compared with economists' median forecast of 2.3%, figures from the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications showed.
The unemployment rate stood at 2.2% in July and August, the lowest since 1992.
The jobs-to-applicants ratio fell to 1.57 in September, and compared with the median forecast of 1.59, data from the health ministry showed.
The ratio had stayed at an over 40-year high of 1.63 from late last year through to early this year.
""The employment environment remains favourable as domestic demand is solid and there is also a labour shortage,"" said Yusuke Shimoda, senior economist at Japan Research Institute.
""But there are worries about corporate profits due to the U.S.-China trade frictions. So the pace of improvement in the jobs market may be slowing down.""
The jobless data also showed that the number of those looking for a job rose by 90,000 in September to 420,000 from August.
""There are more people who want to work,"" said a government official.
The Bank of Japan kept monetary policy steady on Thursday as expected but gave the strongest signal to date that it may cut interest rates in the near future, underscoring its concern that overseas risks could derail a fragile economic recovery.
BOJ Governor Haruhiko Kuroda also said wages are not rising much despite a tightening labour market.
Slowing global demand and the escalating U.S.-China trade war have hurt the export-reliant economy, while a sales tax increase in October has fuelled concerns of a drop in domestic consumption in coming months."
240,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 31, 2019 09:56PM ET</span>",China Oct. factory activity expands at fastest pace in over two years: Caixin PMI,"By Gabriel Crossley
BEIJING (Reuters) - China's factory activity unexpectedly expanded at the fastest pace in well over two years in October as new export orders rose and plants ramped up production, a private business survey showed on Friday.
The Caixin/Markit Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) for October rose to 51.7 from 51.4 in September, marking the third straight month of expansion. Economists polled by Reuters had expected a dip in growth to 51.0.
The 50-mark separates expansion from contraction on a monthly basis. The pace of improvement in September was the quickest seen since February 2017, when it was also 51.7.
""Both domestic and foreign demand improved substantially,"" said Zhengsheng Zhong, director of macroeconomic analysis at CEBM Group.
New export orders for Chinese manufacturers bounced back into expansionary territory for the first time in five months even as a long trade war between the United States and China wears on.
This was likely due to the United States choosing to temporarily exempt more than 400 types of Chinese products from additional tariffs in September, Zhong said.
Washington and Beijing are working on a first-phase trade accord that could be finalised soon, although a new obstacle emerged this week when the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in Chile - where the two countries' leaders were supposed to meet - was canceled because of violent protests.
The Caixin survey showed that total new orders increased at the fastest clip in over six years, while growth in production picked up to the highest since the end of 2016.
The better-than-expected results stand in contrast with an official survey published on Thursday, which showed China's factory activity shrank for the sixth straight month in October.
The official survey focuses more on heavy industry than Caixin's, and the two surveys also cover different geographical areas.
The government has been trying to spur domestic demand for over a year, largely through higher infrastructure spending, but the measures have been slow to gain traction.
The ruling Communist Party's People's Daily said on Thursday that stabilizing growth should be made more of a priority. The commentary called for expanding investment in infrastructure where it is needed.
""If the improvement in demand, including that generated by infrastructure projects and exports, is able to continue, the manufacturing sector can gradually build a foundation for stability,"" said Zhong.
Despite the pick-up in manufacturing activity in October, the survey showed that the labor market remained subdued, with an employment sub-index dropping from the previous month and contracting at the fastest rate since September last year.
""As China's demographic dividend is fading, there has been pressure on growth of the labor force,"" said Zhong.
Input costs for manufacturing remained in expansionary territory while output charges fell for the fourth straight month and at a faster pace, suggesting that fierce competition for sales is still pressuring profit margins.
While a gauge of business optimism rose sharply to the highest since April, it remained in fairly subdued territory compared with historical data. Worsening delivery delays also signal manufacturers' low levels of confidence, Zhong said."
241,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 31, 2019 09:18PM ET</span>","South Korea October exports fall most in almost four years on chips, China demand","By Choonsik Yoo and Joori Roh
SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korean exports in October fell for an 11th consecutive month and by the most in nearly four years on-year as shipments to China kept slowing and computer chip prices plunged, data showed on Friday.
The country's exports dropped 14.7% in October from a year earlier, trade ministry data showed, setting the worst fall since January 2016 and missing a median 13.8% fall tipped in a Reuters survey and an 11.7% decline in September.
Economists said the poor data confirmed that it would take some time for any recovery to take hold, with the global economy still slowing and the U.S.-China trade row still unresolved.
""It appears exports were weak in both volume and value terms, and we can't talk about recovery until one or both of the two measures secures a firm growth momentum,"" Lim Hye-youn, economist at KTB Investment & Securities.
Investors, however, shrugged off the export figures, given the focus on global issues.
The Seoul stock market's KOSPI (KS11) edged up 0.1%, the won was fell 0.6% against the dollar, while liquid three-year treasury bond futures added 0.08 points after the first 45 minutes of trade.
The reading also bodes ill for South Korea's economic growth for the final quarter and for the whole year, as growth for all of this year now looks set to miss the psychologically important 2% mark without a significant rebound in exports.
South Korea, the first major exporting economy to release monthly foreign trade data, has been struggling especially hard from the prolonged U.S.-China trade war on top of already cooling global demand.
Sales abroad of semiconductors, the country's major export item, tumbled 32.1% in October over a year earlier, while total shipments to China dropped 16.9%, both dealing a decisive blow to the country's overall shipments abroad.
Though signs of a thaw in the U.S-China trade tensions provide some cause for optimism, economists say uncertainties remain high and exports have yet to show firm evidences of bottoming out.
Imports in October slid 14.6% from a year earlier, more than a predicted 13.2% drop in the Reuters survey. That brought the October trade balance to a $5.39 billion surplus, versus a $5.98 billion surplus in September.
The trade figures came out shortly after separate data showed South Korea's annual consumer price inflation stood at zero percent in October, pulling out of its first deflation on record in September.
On Oct. 16, the Bank of Korea cut the policy interest rate for the second time in three months. The 25 basis points cut to 1.25%, matching a record low, was done to support the faltering economy, and the central bank left the door open to further easing.
South Korea's economic growth slowed more than expected in the third quarter, central bank data showed last week, and the outlook was clouded by a domestic spending slump and intensifying global trade frictions."
242,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 31, 2019 09:11PM ET</span>",Irish manufacturing conditions improve for first time since May: PMI,"DUBLIN (Reuters) - Irish manufacturing business conditions improved in October for the first time since May as output and new orders returned to growth, a survey showed on Friday.
The AIB IHS Markit manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) climbed to 50.7 in October from 48.7 in September.
The rise above the 50-point mark separating expansions from contractions came as panelists said they had increased their production in line with a pick-up in customer demand.
Ireland's economy has by and large weathered the uncertainty created by close trading partner Britain's 2016 vote to leave the EU. But a lack of clarity around the terms of Britain's departure weighed heavily on manufacturing activity over the summer months.
The subindex measuring output stood at 50.6, up from 47.7 in September, ending a run of three straight months of decline to move to expansion at the fastest pace since April.
""Encouragingly, most of the sub-components of the survey saw an improvement after a string of weak readings over the third quarter,"" AIB Chief Economist Oliver Mangan said
Mangan welcomed the improvement but cautioned that the manufacturing PMI remains weak, with very modest growth as the slowdown in the global economy and Brexit uncertainty act as headwinds."
243,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 31, 2019 08:47PM ET</span>","Japan October factory activity sinks to three-year low, orders fall - PMI","TOKYO (Reuters) - Japanese factory activity sank to more than a three-year low in October, with the sixth-straight month of contraction largely led by shrinking new orders and output in a fresh warning sign for the world's third-largest economy.
The Jibun Bank Final Japan Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) dropped to 48.4 on a seasonally adjusted basis, hitting the lowest level since June 2016.
The figure was down a notch from last week's preliminary October reading of 48.5, and compared to a final 48.9 in the previous month.
The index has stayed below the 50.0 threshold that separates contraction for six months, matching a similar stretch from March to August in 2016.
""Worrying signs for Japanese manufacturers appeared at the start of the fourth quarter,"" said Joe Hayes, economist at IHS Markit, which compiles the survey.
""With weak regional growth across Asia and signs of fragility within the domestic economy, it is difficult to see any respite coming in the near-term.""
The deterioration in business conditions was driven by a steeper drop in demand, partly due to front-loading of purchases ahead of a sales tax hike coming to an end.
Japan raised its national sales tax to 10% in October, the first increase since a hike to 8% from 5% in April 2014.
The PMI data showed total new orders shrank at their fastest pace since May 2016, while factory output and new export orders were also in contraction. Total new orders and output stayed in contraction for the 10th straight month.
The dim survey results and other weak data recently highlight why policy makers and investors remain worried about the growing economic impact of heightened trade tensions and weaker growth around the world.
They came a day after the Bank of Japan kept monetary policy steady as expected but offered a stronger signal it may cut interest rates in the future, underscoring its concern that overseas risks could derail the country's fragile economic recovery.
IHS Markit said panellists attributed lower output volumes to the impact of a powerful typhoon, as well as spillover effects from U.S.-China trade frictions.
Data this week showed Japan's industrial output rebounded in September while retail sales jumped the most in over 5 years, but exports continued to contract and a sales tax hike last month has raised concerns the economy could tip into recession."
244,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 31, 2019 05:06PM ET</span>",U.S. consumer spending slowing; inflation benign,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. consumer spending increased marginally in September while wages were unchanged, which could cast doubts on consumers' ability to continue driving the economy amid a deepening slump in business investment.
The report from the Commerce Department on Thursday also showed inflation was muted last month.
The data came a day after the Federal Reserve cut interest rates for the third time this year, but signaled a pause in the easing cycle that started in July when it reduced borrowing costs for the first time since 2008. Fed Chair Jerome Powell said he expected the economy to continue on a moderate growth path, driven by ""solid household spending and supportive financial conditions.""
Signs of a slowdown in consumer spending and persistently low inflation could force the U.S. central bank to consider a rate cut early next year, some economists said.
""With wage growth no longer accelerating, and employment growth cooling, growth in consumer spending is expected to moderate as we enter 2020,"" said Gregory Daco, chief U.S. economist at Oxford Economics in New York. ""We believe the Fed will be prompted to reassess and provide one additional rate cut in March 2020.""
Consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, rose 0.2% last month as households boosted purchases of automobiles and spent more on healthcare. Data for August was revised up to show consumer spending increasing 0.2% instead of gaining 0.1% as previously reported.
Last month's rise spending was in line with economists' expectations. Consumer spending has slowed since jumping 0.5% in July. The data was included in the gross domestic product report for the third quarter, which was published on Wednesday.
The government reported that growth in consumer spending slowed to a still-healthy 2.9% annualized rate last quarter after surging at a 4.6% pace in the second quarter, the fastest since the fourth quarter of 2017.
That softened some of the blow on the economy from the second straight quarterly contraction in business investment.
The economy grew at a 1.9% rate in the third quarter after expanding at a 2.0% pace in the April-June period.
Last month's cooling in consumer spending was accompanied by a retreat in inflation. Consumer prices as measured by the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index, excluding the volatile food and energy components, were unchanged after gaining 0.1% in August.
That lowered the annual increase in the so-called core PCE price index to 1.7% in September from 1.8% in August. The core PCE index is the Fed's preferred inflation measure. It has undershot the U.S. central bank's 2% target this year.

WAGE GROWTH STALLING
The tame inflation environment was also underscored by a separate report from the Labor Department showing labor costs increased 0.7% in the third quarter after rising 0.6% in the second quarter. That raised the year-on-year rate of gain in the labor costs to 2.8% from 2.7% in the second quarter.
""The data reinforce the views of the Fed that the labor market will not generate significant inflationary pressures any time soon,"" said Dante DeAntonio, an economist at Moody's Analytics in West Chester, Pennsylvania.
The dollar (DXY) fell against a basket of currencies, while U.S. Treasury prices rose. Stocks on Wall Street were trading lower amid uncertainty around a potential trade deal between United States and China.
Bloomberg reported on Friday that Chinese officials had doubts about whether it was possible to reach a comprehensive long-term trade deal with the United States and President Donald Trump. The 15-month U.S.-China trade war is a major factor in the downturn in business investment.
There are fears the slump in business investment could spill over to the labor market, whose strength has been the key driver of consumer spending. So far, the labor market remains resilient. A report on Thursday from the Labor Department showed initial claims for state unemployment benefits increased 5,000 to a seasonally adjusted 218,000 for the week ended Oct. 26.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast claims would rise to 215,000 in the latest week.
While companies are holding on to their workers, they have slowed their pace of hiring, leading to a moderation in job growth. Employment gains likely slowed further in October because of a 40-day strike by workers at General Motors (N:GM).
Government data last Friday showed 46,000 GM employees were idle at the automaker's plants in Michigan and Kentucky during the October nonfarm payrolls count.
Striking workers who do not receive a paycheck during the payrolls survey period are treated as unemployed. The strike by members of the United Auto Workers union, which ended last Friday, had ripple effects on the auto industry.
Economists estimated the work stoppage cut between 75,000 and 80,000 jobs from October payrolls. As a result, the employment report on Friday will likely show only 89,000 jobs were added in October, down from 136,000 in September, according to a Reuters survey of economists.
With hiring slowing, wage growth is also stalling, which could significantly curb future consumer spending. The Commerce Department data showed personal income rose 0.3% in September, driven by government subsidies to farmers caught in the U.S.-China trade war. Income jumped 0.5% in the prior month.
Wages were unchanged after surging 0.6% in August. The government said it had adjusted wages and salaries down at an annualized rate of $1.9 billion in September to account for the GM strike. Economists said even without the strike, wage gains would still have been soft.
""The stalling here raises some doubts about the narrative that workers still have the upper hand in wage negotiations,"" said Tim Quinlan, a senior economist at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) Securities in Charlotte, North Carolina.
Savings rose to $1.38 trillion last month from $1.35 trillion in August.

245,By Bloomberg,"<span>Oct 31, 2019 09:16AM ET</span>","U.S. Consumer Spending, Jobless Claims Signal Caution on Economy","(Bloomberg) -- U.S. consumer spending trailed forecasts in September while weekly applications for unemployment benefits rose more than projected, offering a note of caution on the economy as Federal Reserve policy makers signal a pause from interest-rate cuts.
Consumer outlays for goods and services, which account for about 70% of gross domestic product, increased 0.2% from the prior month after a 0.2% August advance that was larger than previously estimated, Commerce Department data showed Thursday. The report also showed income gains matched projections, while the Fed’s preferred inflation gauge matched the slowest pace since 2016.
The figures suggest cooling momentum in Americans’ spending, which is key to sustaining the record-long expansion -- and crucial for President Donald Trump’s re-election prospects -- amid slowing payroll gains, trade tensions and weakness abroad. The data flesh out details on the economy after Wednesday’s GDP report showed consumption grew more than forecast in the third quarter as business investment saw a steeper decline.
Fed Chairman Jerome Powell highlighted a strong job market, rising incomes and solid consumer confidence in his press conference Wednesday after the central bank cut interest rates for a third straight meeting and suggested it would pause. “The consumer is really driving growth” and hasn’t shown signs of being dragged down by weakness in manufacturing, exports or business investment, he said.
Powell also cited low levels for initial unemployment claims as another positive sign, and they remain relatively low even with the latest increase. The Labor Department’s latest report Thursday showed that such filings rose 5,000 to 218,000 in the week ended Oct. 26, compared with projections for 215,000. The four-week average, a less-volatile measure, declined to 214,750.
Elsewhere in Thursday’s releases, the personal consumption expenditures price gauge, which the Fed officially targets for 2% inflation, was little changed from the prior month and up 1.3% from a year earlier.
Core Inflation
The core PCE price index, which excludes food and energy, was also little changed from the prior month, slightly below projections, and up 1.7% from a year earlier. It increased at a 1.6% annualized rate over the past three months compared with 2.5% in the three months through August. Policy makers view the core gauge as a better indicator of underlying price trends.
After adjusting for the increase in inflation, spending rose 0.2% from the prior month. The gain in September was driven by new motor vehicle purchases and health-care outlays, according to the report.
Consumer spending relies on wage gains. The Commerce Department’s report showed wages and salaries were little changed in September from the prior month. The strike by General Motors Co. workers that began in September reduced wages and salaries by $1.9 billion during the month, according to the report.
The personal saving rate rose to 8.3% in September, the highest since March. Adjusted for inflation, disposable income rose 0.3% following a 0.5% gain.
The report also said special payments to farmers -- begun after the trade war with China hit the agriculture sector -- gave a “substantial” boost to farm proprietors’ income in August and September.
Other data Thursday showed the Labor Department’s employment cost index, a broad gauge monitored by the Fed, rose 0.7% from the prior quarter, matching projections. The gauge increased 2.8% from a year earlier, as wages and salaries for private workers increased 3% for a third straight period. A tight labor market pushes companies to increase wages and benefits which could ultimately spur broader inflationary pressures.
Compensation gains were broad-based across sectors, with stronger increases in construction, finance and sales. The government’s quarterly ECI reading covers employer-paid taxes such as Social Security and Medicare along with other benefits.
The update follows Wednesday’s release of third-quarter GDP, which showed growth held up at a 1.9% annualized rate on unexpectedly strong consumer spending. The October jobs report Friday will give more detail on whether the labor market will keep propping up spending.

The Employment Cost Index, the broadest measure of labor costs, increased 0.7% after rising 0.6% in the second quarter. That raised the year-on-year rate of gain in the ECI to 2.8%. Labor costs advanced 2.7% on a year-on-year basis in the second quarter.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the ECI would advance 0.7% in the July-September period.
The ECI is widely viewed by policymakers and economists as one of the better measures of labor market slack. It is also considered a better predictor of core inflation.
Labor costs peaked in the final quarter of 2018 as a tightening labor market pushed up wage growth. The pace of increases has since moderated somewhat in tandem with wages.
In the third quarter, wages and salaries, which account for 70% of employment costs, increased 0.9% after rising 0.7% in the prior period. Wages and salaries were up 2.9% in the 12 months through September, matching June's gain.
Private-sector wages and salaries rose 0.9% in the third quarter after increasing 0.6% in the second quarter. They were up 3.0% in the 12 months through September after rising by the same margin in the year through June.
State and local government wages and salaries jumped 1.0% after gaining 0.5% in the second quarter.

The four-week moving average of initial claims, considered a better measure of labor market trends as it irons out week-to-week volatility, slipped 500 to 214,750 last week.
The claims data has no bearing on October's employment report, which is scheduled to be published on Friday, as it falls outside the survey period.
While the low levels of claims suggest solid labor market conditions, job growth is expected to have slowed sharply in October because of a 40-day strike by workers at General Motors (N:GM).

HONG KONG (Reuters) - Hong Kong slid into recession for the first time in a decade in the third quarter, weighed down by increasingly violent anti-government protests and the protracted U.S.-China trade war.
Five months of protests have battered the Chinese-ruled city's retail and tourism sector, and there is no sign of the demonstrations abating. Police tightened security on Thursday ahead of more potential clashes.
The city's economy shrank 3.2% in July-September from the preceding period, contracting for a second straight quarter and meeting the technical definition of a recession, according to preliminary government data on Thursday.
From a year earlier, gross domestic product (GDP) contracted 2.9%. The readings were the weakest for the Asian financial hub since the global financial crisis in 2008/2009.
The government also revised down second-quarter GDP data to show growth of 0.4% year-on-year, from a preliminary estimate of 0.6% and a later reading of 0.5%. Quarter-on-quarter was revised down to -0.5%, versus a preliminary forecast of -0.3% and a later reading of -0.4%.
""Domestic demand worsened significantly,"" the government said in a statement.
""As the weakening economic conditions dampened consumer sentiment and large-scale demonstrations cause severe disruptions to the retail, catering and other consumer-related sectors, private consumption expenditure recorded its first year-on-year decline in more than 10 years.""
The government said that with no sign of protests abating, private consumption and investment sentiment would continue to be affected.
Some Hong Kong businesses have asked employees to take unpaid leave as tourists steer clear of sometimes violent running battles between protesters and police in key shopping areas and malls.
Capital Economics said in a research note that while GDP would probably continue to contract in the fourth quarter, the pace of contraction should ease barring a further escalation in the demonstrations.
""Any recovery will be constrained by weak business investment, however, as the city’s political crisis has done lasting damage to its reputation as a stable and autonomous financial hub,"" it said in a note to clients.
The protests and escalating violence have plunged the former British colony into its biggest political crisis in decades and unnerved many in the business and financial communities.
Protesters are angry at what they see as Beijing’s increasing interference in the Chinese-ruled city. China denies meddling and has accused foreign governments, including the United States and Britain, of stirring up trouble.
The city's leader Carrie Lam warned on Tuesday that full-year growth could contract.
Almost all growth engines in the Asian financial hub stalled over the summer as shops shut to avoid clashes between riot police and protesters, while the Sino-U.S. trade war intensified. Hong Kong is one of the world's most popular tourism destinations and a bustling container port.
Retail sales fell the most on record year-on-year in August, while tourist arrivals dropped the most since Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) struck Hong Kong in 2003.
Last week, the government announced relief measures of HK$2 billion ($255 million) to support the economy, particularly in its transport, tourism and retail industries, and more is expected. It has also urged landlords to cut rents for struggling businesses.
But there is no guarantee Beijing will come to Hong Kong's rescue as it has done during previous downturns, at times relaxing mainland visitor restrictions to boost tourism.
""There is no liquidity bail-out for Hong Kong, ever. This is it. It's not coming back,"" said Andy Xie, a Shanghai-based independent economist formerly at  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS)."
250,By Investing.com,"<span>Oct 31, 2019 06:17AM ET</span>",NewsBreak- Euro Zone Q3 GDP Rises 0.2%,"Investing.com - The euro zone economy grew at a slightly faster than expected rate in the third quarter, but remained weak overall, according to preliminary data released on Thursday.
Eurostat said GDP rose a seasonally adjusted 0.2% from July through September, matching growth of 0.2% in the prior quarter. 
Economists polled by Investing.com forecast a rise of 0.1% in the third quarter. 
Year-on-year, GDP growth in the single currency bloc rose 1.1% in the third quarter, compared to the 1.2% expansion seen in the previous quarter, in line with forecasts.
Separate reports showed that the consumer price index for the bloc fell to 0.7%, while the unemployment rate ticked up to 7.5%, slightly higher than the consensus for a reading of 7.4%. 
The euro zone economy has weakened over the last year due to trade tensions with the U.S. and uncertainty over when the U.K. will leave the bloc, while Germany has remained on the brink of a recession. Recent business activity has pointed to the euro zone economy entering near stagnation. 
Outgoing president of the European Central Bank Mario Draghi warned at his final policy meeting last week that the EU would face “protracted weakness” going into 2020. 
“The main risk from all viewpoints, but especially also from a financial stability viewpoint, is a downturn in the economy … whether it is global or it is eurozone,” he said. 
In September the ECB unveilled fresh stimulus measures in a bid to prevent the faltering euro zone economy from grinding to a halt. It cut its deposit rate – the interest paid to commercial lenders when they deposit funds with the central bank, deeper into negative territory and relaunched bond purchases worth 20 billion euro per month.
The euro remained higher against the broadly weaker dollar following the data, with EUR/USD up 0.2% to 1.1168. "

BEIJING (Reuters) - Factory activity in China shrank for the sixth straight month in October and by more than expected, while service sector growth eased as firms grapple with the weakest economic growth in nearly 30 years.
The world's second-largest economy is facing heightened risks from slowing global demand and the Sino-U.S. trade war, adding pressure on policymakers to roll out more stimulus to avoid a sharper slowdown and bigger job losses. 
The Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) fell to 49.3 in October, China's National Bureau of Statistics said on Thursday, versus 49.8 in September. The 50-point mark separates growth from contraction on a monthly basis. 
Economists polled by Reuters had expected the reading would be unchanged from September.
Weighed down by cooling domestic demand, sluggish investment and a protracted trade war with the United States, China's economic growth slowed to a near 30-year low of 6.0% in the third quarter, raising expectations that Beijing will need to roll out more support measures soon.
New export orders fell for the 17th month in a row in October, with the sub-index down to 47.0 from 48.2 in the previous month. 
Total new orders, which includes those for export and domestic use, fell back to contractionary territory and erased September's fleeting growth, suggesting continued weakness in demand at home.
Demand contraction would put a dent on prices and further chip away the already-thin margin for manufacturers. In September, China's producer prices posted the steepest decline in more than three years, while industrial profits shrank for the second month.
Factories continued to shed jobs in October on weakening demand and rising business uncertainties. The sub-index for employment was at 47.3 in October compared with 47.0 the previous month. 
China's manufacturing sector will remain under pressure in the coming months as the nearly 16-months long Sino-U.S. trade war remains unresolved although Washington and Beijing are working on a first-phase trade accord that could be finalised soon.
But even if a ""phase one"" trade deal were signed it would be unlikely to have a significant positive impact on industrial activity, said Raymond Yeung, ANZ's chief Greater China economist in Hong Kong. Slumping price indexes in both the manufacturing and services PMIs point to increasing deflationary risk amid a pointed slowdown in economic momentum, he said.
Activity at larger firms slipped back into contractionary territory after a slight recovery in September. Gauges of activity at small- and medium-sized firms continued to be even lower.
""The official PMIs fell by more than expected this month, reinforcing our view that the improvement at the end of Q3 didn't mark the start of a sustained recovery,"" said Julian Evans-Pritchard, senior China economist at Capital Economics.
He said in a research note the construction index picked up, suggesting that building activity remained a bright spot, but adding this was overshadowed by a large drop in the index for service sector activity. 
Growth in China's services sector activity slowed in October, flagging a further weakening in domestic demand. 
The official services PMI fell to 52.8 from 53.7 in September, the lowest it has been since February 2016 but still above the 50-mark that separates contraction from expansion, according to a separate NBS survey.
Beijing has been counting on robust services firms to partly offset sluggish domestic and global demand for its manufactured products. 
The services sector, which makes up more than 50% of the economy, has been propped up by Chinese consumers' rising wages and robust spending power in recent years. However, the services sector cooled late last year amid a broader economic downturn.
""We expect the official manufacturing PMI to remain sluggish in coming months, the growth slowdown could gather pace, and markets could become more volatile in coming months,"" said analysts from Nomura in a note, adding that Beijing will likely ramp up stimulus measures in the coming quarters.
GROWTH FEARS
The ruling Communist Party's People's Daily said stabilising growth should be made more of a priority. The commentary published on Thursday called for expanding investment in infrastructure where it is needed.
A Reuters poll showed China's gross domestic product growth is expected to slow to 6.2% in 2019 and then hit 5.9% in 2020.
""Current economic conditions are very similar to 2009,"" said ANZ's Yeung, but he thinks Beijing will not launch a major stimulus as it did then. 
While there is room for lower rates, Yeung said Beijing is more likely to rely on industrial policy and fiscal support measures to keep the slowdown gradual and ensure a so-called ""soft landing"" for the economy.
China's southern province of Guangdong plans to use some of its 2020 bond issuance quota to issue debt as early as November, three sources with knowledge of the situation told Reuters.

Local government bond issuance typically begins in March but the statistics bureau has said the country would front-load some 2020 special local government bond issuance to this year.

""The fall percentage was in line with expectation,"" said Thomas Lam, executive director of Knight Frank. ""I expect the index may still correct downward in the next two or three months.""

However, the Chinese-ruled city's sky-high property prices have stayed relatively resilient compared with the tourism and retail sectors amid the latest crisis.

The HKMA on Thursday lowered its base rate to 2.00% from 2.25%, hours after the Fed’s quarter-point cut, according to the institution’s page on Bloomberg. As the Hong Kong dollar is linked to the greenback, the territory essentially imports U.S. monetary policy.
The move is unlikely to have much bearing on the local cost of borrowing as lenders don’t necessarily pass on the rate to the public. Data due for release later Thursday is expected to confirm that the city’s economy entered a technical recession in the third quarter, with retail and tourism sectors battered by almost five months of anti-government protests.
“It is hard to say whether the Hong Kong interbank rates may follow the U.S. rate,” HKMA Chief Executive Eddie Yue said Thursday at a briefing. “However, the U.S. rate cut does reflect the downward pressure on the global economy, to which Hong Kong is not immune.”

256,By Bloomberg,"<span>Oct 30, 2019 11:39PM ET</span>",China’s Factory Outlook Dims Again as Trade Uncertainty Lingers,"(Bloomberg) -- A gauge of the outlook for China’s manufacturing sector dropped to the lowest level since February, underlining the uncertainty faced by businesses struggling with weak domestic demand and the trade war with the U.S.
The manufacturing purchasing managers’ index fell to 49.3, according to data released by the National Bureau of Statistics on Thursday. That’s worse than the 49.8 forecast in a Bloomberg survey of economists. The non-manufacturing gauge was 52.8, lower than forecast but above the 50 level that divides expansion from contraction.
After a bruising third quarter, the chances for stabilization in China’s manufacturing sector hang on the success of months of government stimulus efforts and a confidence boost from a partial trade deal with the U.S. slated for November. While the timing of that meeting is now in question following Chile’s cancellation of a regional leaders’ summit, both sides appear committed to easing tensions.
“The China-U.S. trade war remains the main factor dragging on industrial production, while the long holiday break in the month also contributed to the decline,” Yao Shaohua, an economist at ABCI Securities Co. Ltd in Hong Kong. “Monetary policy doesn’t have much room for easing and fiscal policy has been doing a lot. Whether production can improve in the future still depends on how the trade talks go.”
See the breakdown of the data here
A sub-index gauging new export orders started falling again, dropping further into contraction at 47.0, while the sub-gauge for output was at the lowest since February. A gauge of imports also fell, underlining the weakness in domestic demand.
What Bloomberg’s Economists Say..
“China’s manufacturing sector continues to struggle, with the PMI slipping deeper into contraction in October. But the silver lining is that the drop in the headline PMI did not go beyond a seasonal dip, suggesting there has been no dramatic loss of growth momentum.”

The worse-than-expected outcome raises pressure on policy makers as the Communist Party concludes a key political gathering this week. Officials have tried to stick with limited stimulus for fear of reigniting debt growth, an approach that’s being tested as the economy looks set for sub-6% expansion next year.
Policy makers have pinned hopes on investment in infrastructure as a way to put a floor under the economy. The construction index in October’s PMI data picked up to 60.4, back to “high-level expansion territory”, according to the NBS statement.
As Chinese companies seek signs of stabilization, evidence of that may be emerging elsewhere in the region. South Korea’s semiconductor inventories fell the most in more than two years in September, signaling a potential end to a prolonged slump in tech demand that has weighed on global growth. Japanese industrial output rebounded more than expected.
Chinese output in the third quarter expanded 6% from a year ago, the slowest pace since the early 1990s, with the slowdown in investment growth a concern. A set of early indicators for activity collated by Bloomberg showed that trend continuing in October.
Both the manufacturing and non manufacturing PMIs are “so disappointing,” and growth stabilization seems to be a priority if the authorities want to secure 6% economic growth in the fourth quarter, Raymond Yeung, chief Greater China economist with Australia & New Zealand Banking Group Ltd. in Hong Kong. “A rate cut can be a quick measure to manage some sentiment especially if people are worried about the cancellation of APEC in Chile affecting the signing of Phase One deal.”

257,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 30, 2019 09:11PM ET</span>","Japan September factory output rebounds, but risks cloud outlook","By Tetsushi Kajimoto
TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's industrial output rebounded in September to log its fastest gain in four months, offering some relief to manufacturers amid a slowdown in global demand and rising pressure on the country's exports from the U.S.-China trade war.
Heightening downside risks for Japan's economy, including the effects of a hike in sales tax on consumption, will keep the central bank under pressure to ease again to sustain growth and meet its 2% inflation target.
The Bank of Japan is likely to stand pat at its two-day rate review that ends on Thursday as stable markets, a truce in U.S.-China trade talks and robust domestic demand give it room to save its limited ammunition.
Factory output rose 1.4% in September from the previous month, trade ministry data showed on Thursday, handily beating median market forecast for 0.4% growth and swinging from a 1.2% decline the previous month.
On the quarter, factory output fell 0.6% in July-September, swinging from a 0.6% gain in the previous three-month period.
Manufacturers surveyed by the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry expect output to rise 0.6% in October and decline 1.2% in November, the data showed.
""Looking ahead, the outlook is poor,"" said Marcel Thieliant, senior Japan economist at Capital Economics.
""With consumer spending set to slump after the tax hike, domestic demand won't come to the rescue. The upshot is that we expect the economy to stagnate in the first half of next year.""
On Wednesday, data showed a big jump in retail sales in September ahead of this month's tax hike, as consumers went on a spending spree on big-ticket items such as cars and household durables to beat the Oct. 1 tax hike.
Analysts, however, say weak manufacturers' confidence, a prolonged Sino-U.S. trade war, China's slowdown and tame consumption after the tax hike will keep a lid on factory activity and the broader economy.
Japan has implemented a twice-delayed sales tax hike to 10% from 8% this month, in a move seen as crucial for fixing the industrial world's heaviest public debt at more than twice the size of its economy.
But it could tip the economy into recession, some analysts say.
The BOJ will likely keep its minus 0.1% interest rates and maintain the 10-year Japanese government bond yield target at around 0% at this week's review, a Reuters poll of economists have forecast."

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's longest-running measure of consumer sentiment slipped back to its joint-lowest level since 2013 this month, as Brexit uncertainty weighed again on households' assessment of the economic outlook.
British consumers have generally remained upbeat since 2016's referendum to leave the EU - partly offsetting weaker business investment - but in recent weeks morale appears to have softened, boding poorly for spending in the run-up to Christmas.
The GfK consumer sentiment dropped to -14 in October from -12 in September, a slightly bigger fall than economists had forecast in a Reuters poll. The index was last this low in August, and has not been lower since July 2013.
""The ongoing machinations in Westminster appear to be impacting how we view our personal financial situation for the coming year with a notable fall ... in this measure in October,"" GfK strategy director Joe Staton said.
The survey took place between Oct. 1 and Oct. 14, before Prime Minister Boris Johnson secured a new Brexit deal, which he has since abandoned trying to pass through parliament in favor of holding an early election on Dec. 12.
Britain had been due to leave the EU on Oct. 31, but Johnson was forced by parliament to ask for a delay after failing to pass his transition deal in time and the Brexit deadline has moved back to Jan. 31.
The GfK survey showed falls across all five measures it use to calculate sentiment, with the steepest decline coming in consumers' assessment of how their personal finances were likely to evolve over the next 12 months.
British households declared themselves insolvent at the highest rate in eight years during the 12 months to the end of September, according to official data on Wednesday.
Separately, there were also signs that Brexit uncertainty has weighed on Britain's commercial property market. Some 62% of surveyors believe the market had entered a downturn in the three months to September, the most since the survey began in 2015 and up from 53% in the last quarter, according to the poll from the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors.
Retail was the hardest-hit real estate sector, RICS economist Tarrant Parsons said.
""It remains to be seen what impact the latest Brexit developments have on confidence across the sector, but with the picture unlikely to become clear until into the New Year it may well mean hesitation continues over the near term,"" he added."

Brazil cut its benchmark interest rate by half a percentage point and indicated another cut of the same magnitude is in the pipeline as inflation expectations fall further below target and the currency bounces back.
The bank’s board, led by its President Roberto Campos Neto, on Wednesday lowered the Selic rate to 5%, as expected by all 48 economists in a Bloomberg survey. It was the third straight reduction of 50 basis points, which came hours after the U.S. Federal Reserve also cut rates.
The central bank’s monetary policy committee “deems that the consolidation of the benign scenario for prospective inflation should permit an additional adjustment of the same magnitude,” policy makers wrote in their post-meeting statement.
Policy makers are boosting stimulus at a time when Latin America’s largest economy is weathering a period of weak growth and subdued price pressures. Annual inflation dove below the 2.75% floor of the official target range earlier this month, and investors have also lowered estimates for cost of living increases next year. Meanwhile, an improved global outlook and stronger real further facilitate monetary easing.
“It was a combination of factors,” Carlos Kawall, chief economist at Banco Safra and a top Selic forecaster in Bloomberg surveys, said before the rate decision. “Lower inflation opened space for continuing key rate cuts. The dollar went up, but then came back down again, and that corroborates the idea that the global outlook is largely favorable.”
Since the central bank’s previous policy meeting in September, Brazil’s real has gained roughly 3.2%, the third best performance among 24 emerging market currencies tracked by Bloomberg. It has been boosted by advances in U.S.-China trade talks and also by growing optimism over the domestic economy.
Last week, Brazil’s Senate gave the final go-ahead to a pension reform that will save government coffers some 800 billion reais ($200 billion) in a decade. Economy Minister Paulo Guedes is expected to introduce a new set of proposals to boost employment and help tame public servant costs.

260,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 30, 2019 04:55PM ET</span>","U.S. Fed cuts interest rates, signals it is on hold","By Howard Schneider and Lindsay Dunsmuir
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Federal Reserve on Wednesday cut interest rates for the third time this year to help sustain U.S. growth despite a slowdown in other parts of the world, but signaled there would be no further reductions unless the economy takes a turn for the worse.
""We believe that monetary policy is in a good place,"" Fed Chair Jerome Powell said in a news conference after the U.S. central bank announced its decision to cut its key overnight lending rate by a quarter of a percentage point to a target range of between 1.50% and 1.75%.
""We took this step to help keep the economy strong in the face of global developments and to provide some insurance against ongoing risks,"" he said. ""We see the current stance of monetary policy as likely to remain appropriate as long as incoming information about the economy remains broadly consistent with our outlook.""
Powell's comments clash with President Donald Trump's demands that the Fed cut rates even deeper to boost economic growth that ebbed to a 1.9% annual rate in the third quarter, well below the 3% level Trump pledged would flow from a round of tax cuts and other actions nearly two years ago.
But the Fed's new stance also vouched for both the seeming durability of a U.S. economic expansion that is now the longest on record.
In his news conference, Powell ticked off an extensive list of reasons why he feels the economy is doing well, and likely to continue to do so under the current stance of monetary policy - from robust consumer spending, strengthening home sales, and asset prices he considered healthy but not to a level of excess.
The S&P 500 index (SPX) closed at another record high on Wednesday.
As well, Powell said, some of the risks that had most unnerved Fed officials, and convinced them lower rates were needed if only as ""insurance,"" have seemed to abate in recent weeks.
The U.S.-China trade war was ""a step closer"" to resolution, Powell said, and it looked less likely that Britain would crash out of the European Union.
The outlook for the U.S. economy continues to be for ""moderate"" growth, a strong labor market and inflation rising back to the Fed's 2% annual goal, he said, and only ""a material reassessment"" of that outlook could drive the central bank to cut rates further from here.
DISSENTS
In the statement accompanying its decision to cut rates, the Fed dropped a previous reference that it ""will act as appropriate"" to sustain the economic expansion - language that was considered a sign for future rate cuts.
Instead, the central bank said it will ""monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook as it assesses the appropriate path"" of its target interest rate, a less decisive phrase.
Kansas City Fed President Esther George and Boston Fed President Eric Rosengren dissented from the decision. They have opposed all three Fed rate cuts this year as unnecessary.
St. Louis Fed President James Bullard, who had dissented in September because he supported a bigger rate cut then, voted with the majority on Wednesday, an indication that views within the Fed may be coalescing around standing pat for now.
The rate cut was widely anticipated by financial markets, but expectations for additional cuts after October have diminished significantly in recent weeks. Contracts tied to the Federal Funds rate indicate an expectation of perhaps one rate cut next year.
While yields on longer-dated bonds showed little reaction, those on shorter-dated maturities that are more closely influenced by Fed policy expectations initially moved higher. The yield on the 2-year note (US2YT=RR) rose to the highest since Oct. 1 at about 1.67% before settling back to earlier levels as Powell spoke.
""It's pretty much what was expected,"" said Jim Powers, director of investment research at Delegate Advisors.
""The more important outcome is they removed the phrase 'act as appropriate.' It looks like the market is taking that to mean that there will be a pause in the declining rate path they were on beforehand. That's what was expected, and that's generally a good thing,"" Powers said.
UNUSUAL JUNCTURE
The central bank and U.S. economy are at an unusual juncture.
Unemployment is near a 50-year low, inflation is moderate, and data earlier on Wednesday showed economic growth in the third quarter slowed but not as sharply as many economists expected and some Fed officials feared.
But parts of the economy, particularly manufacturing, have stuttered in recent months as the global economy slowed. Businesses have pared investment in response to the U.S.-China trade war that both raised tariffs on many goods, and also made the world a riskier place to make long-term commitments.
While that has not had an obvious impact yet on U.S. hiring or consumer spending, Fed officials felt a round of ""insurance"" rate cuts was appropriate to guard against a worse outcome. The Fed cut rates in July and again in September, and by doing so hoped to encourage businesses and consumers with more affordable borrowing costs.
The approach was successful in the 1990s when risks developed during another prolonged period of economic growth."
261,By Investing.com,"<span>Oct 30, 2019 02:26PM ET</span>","Fed Cuts Rates by Quarter Point Amid Concerns About Global Economy, Trade","Investing.com - The Federal Reserve cut interest rates by 25 basis points Wednesday, in what was a widely expected decision, amid persistent concerns over the sluggish pace of inflation and the slowdown in the global economy.
The Federal Open Market Committee cut its fed funds rate to a range of 1.5% to 1.75% from a previous range of 1.75% to 2.00%.
In the accompanying monetary policy statement, the Fed said economic activity had been rising at a ""moderate"" rate, though it pointed to ""muted inflation pressures"" as one the reasons for cutting rates.
The core price consumption expenditures (PCE) index, the Fed's preferred measure of inflation, has remained shy of the central bank's 2% target.
The first reading of third-quarter U.S. GDP, released earlier Wednesday, showed that the pace of economic growth slowed in the third quarter from the second, as ongoing strength in the consumer was offset by a slowdown in business investment. 
The Fed acknowledged the two opposing forces on economic growth, saying that ""although household spending has been rising at a strong pace, business fixed investment and exports remain weak.""
 
It was the third rate cut in as many meetings, with the Fed sticking to its guidance that it would “act as appropriate” to keep economic growth alive.
But the Fed has been quick to rein in investor expectations that a prolonged period of easing may follow, characterizing the previous rate cuts – in July and September – as an insurance policy against downside risks to its outlook.
That has done little to appease its detractors, who believe the central bank should accelerate rate cuts, potentially into negative territory.
""The Fed doesn’t have a clue! We have unlimited potential, only held back by the Federal Reserve,"" President Donald Trump wrote on Twitter Tuesday.
In the lead-up to the Fed meeting, Scotiabank Economics said that since the central bank's last meeting in mid-September there’s “increased evidence of a synchronous deterioration in global growth prospects and continued uncertainty toward Brexit and trade policy developments with as yet nothing resolved.”
Looking ahead, the Fed continued to suggest that it would monitor incoming economic data to assess future monetary policy action. 
Traders are expected to shift attention to Fed Chairman Jerome Powell's press conference at 2:30 PM ET (18:30 GMT) for more insight into the central bank's thinking on monetary policy."
262,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 30, 2019 12:09PM ET</span>",Consumers support U.S. economy as business spending slumps,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. economic growth slowed less than expected in the third quarter as a further contraction in business investment was offset by resilient consumer spending, further allaying financial market fears of a recession.
The Commerce Department's report on Wednesday was, however, unlikely to discourage the Federal Reserve from cutting interest rates again amid lingering threats to the longest expansion on record from uncertainty over trade policy, slowing global growth and Britain's imminent departure from the European Union. 
The Trump administration's trade war with China has eroded business confidence, contributing to the second straight quarterly contraction in business investment. The fading stimulus from last year's $1.5 trillion tax cut package is also sapping momentum from the expansion, now in its 11th year.
There are concerns that the slump in business investment will eventually spill over to consumer spending and significantly restrain economic growth.
""An orderly economic slowdown is in progress,"" said Sung Won Sohn, a business economics professor at Loyola Marymount University in Los Angeles. ""If the business caution continues, there will be fewer jobs and slower income growth eventually adversely impacting consumer spending and economic growth.""
Gross domestic product increased at a 1.9% annualized rate in the third quarter, also as businesses maintained a steady pace of inventory accumulation, exports rose and the housing market rebounded after contracting for six straight quarters, the government said in its advance estimate of GDP. 
The economy grew at a 2.0% pace in the April-June period. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast GDP increasing at a 1.6% rate in the July-September quarter. Third-quarter growth marked a further slowdown from the brisk 3.1% rate notched in the first three months of the year. Still, the economy is expanding at its potential, estimated between 1.7% and 2.0%. 
The GDP report, which was published hours before Fed officials wrapped-up a two-day policy meeting, showed the overall trend in inflation remaining moderate last quarter. 
The U.S. central bank is expected to cut interest rates for the third time this year on Wednesday. The Fed cut rates in September after reducing borrowing costs in July for the first time since 2008. 
The dollar was little changed against a basket of currencies ahead of the Fed rate decision, while U.S. Treasury prices rose. U.S. stocks were trading lower. 
RECESSION FEARS EBBING
Recession fears have subsided in recent months mainly on hopes of a resolution to the 15-month trade war. President Donald Trump this month announced a truce, delaying additional tariffs that were due in October. But a trade deal is far from certain. Sources close to the negotiations say Trump's demand that Beijing commit to big purchases of American farm products has become a major sticking point in talks.
Despite last quarter's better-than-expected performance, the economy is expected to again miss the White House's ambitious goal of 3.0% annual growth this year. It grew 2.9% last year. 
""The economy is still laboring against the headwinds of trade war uncertainty,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG in New York. ""Even if growth miraculously soars 4.0% in the fourth quarter the economy won't grow faster than 2.8% in 2019.""
Growth in consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, slowed to a still-healthy 2.9% rate last quarter after surging at a 4.6% pace in the second quarter, the fastest since the fourth quarter of 2017. 
Consumer spending is being powered by the lowest unemployment rate in nearly 50 years. But moderating job growth, ebbing consumer confidence and stalling wage gains are raising doubts about the consumer's resilience. 
Income at the disposal of households rose at a 4.5% rate in the third quarter compared to a 4.8% pace in the prior period.
A separate report on Wednesday showed private payrolls increased by 125,000 jobs in October after rising 93,000 in September. Job gains have been slowing this year because of slowing demand and worker shortages.
""If hiring weakens any further, unemployment will begin to rise,"" said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics. 
Trade tensions are undercutting capital expenditure. Business investment dropped at a 3.0% rate in the third quarter, the sharpest contraction in more than 3-1/2 years, after falling at a 1.0% rate in the second quarter. It was pulled down by declines in spending on equipment and nonresidential structures such as mining exploration, shafts and wells. 
Design problems at aerospace giant Boeing (N:BA) have also hurt business investment. The world's largest planemaker last week reported a 53% drop in quarterly profit because of the grounding in March of its best-selling 737 MAX jets following fatal crashes in Indonesia and Ethiopia.
While that undermined investment, the planes rolling from the production lines contributed to the $69.0 billion pace of increase in inventories last quarter. Inventories rose at a $69.4 billion rate in the April-June period. They trimmed GDP growth by only 0.05 percentage point in the third quarter compared to 0.91 percentage point in the second quarter.
""It appears as though aircraft, including the 737 MAX, accounted for at most one-fourth of the increase in private inventories in third quarter,"" said Michael Feroli, an economist at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) in New York. 
The rebound in exports blunted a surge in imports, leading to a narrowing in the trade deficit. Trade subtracted a negligible 0.08 percentage point from GDP growth in the third quarter after cutting 0.68 percentage point in the prior period.

Government spending cooled after rising at its fastest pace in 10 years in the second quarter. Spending on homebuilding increased at a 5.1% rate, rising for the first since the fourth quarter of 2017.

263,By Bloomberg,"<span>Oct 30, 2019 10:21AM ET</span>","Bank of Canada Hold Rates, Shifts to More Negative Tone on Global Risks","(Bloomberg) -- The Bank of Canada forecast a weaker outlook for the domestic economy amid heightened global downside risks, potentially giving itself more leeway to lower borrowing costs.
In a decision Wednesday, policy makers kept their current 1.75% policy rate unchanged for an eighth straight meeting, calling the level “appropriate” even as they cut their growth forecasts for the next two years.
But there were changes to the statement compared with the one from September that suggest officials have become less confident in the face of a weakening global economy. These include removing explicit references to Canadian rates being stimulative and to the nation’s economy operating close to potential. Wednesday’s statement also referred to the recent gain in the country’s dollar.
The central bank “is mindful that the resilience of Canada’s economy will be increasingly tested as trade conflicts and uncertainty persist,” policy makers led by Governor Stephen Poloz said in the statement. “In considering the appropriate path for monetary policy, the Bank will be monitoring the extent to which the global slowdown spreads beyond manufacturing and investment.”
Neutral Stance
The statement and the fresh batch of more pessimistic growth forecasts will raise questions about the central bank’s commitment to a neutral stance on rates, particularly in the face of global easing in many other countries that has made the Bank of Canada an outlier. If the Federal Reserve lowers its interest rates later today, as expected, the Bank of Canada would have the highest policy rate in the industrialized world.
As recently as last month, Deputy Governor Larry Schembri used a speech to note the central bank’s confidence in Canada’s resiliency to negative global shocks.
Before the statement, investors were pricing in less than a 50% percent chance of a rate cut over the next 12 months. The Canadian dollar dropped on the statement, falling 0.4% to C$1.3137 per U.S. dollar at 10:05 a.m. in Toronto trading.
“Bank of Canada held its target overnight rate unchanged, as expected, but with a slightly more dovish tilt,” Brett House, deputy chief economist at Scotiabank, said by e-mail. “While not entirely setting up a cut at its next meeting, this leaves open the door a bit further for a December cut.”
The next rate decision is Dec. 4.
Trade Tensions
In contrast, the central bank on Wednesday highlighted the impact of trade conflicts and uncertainty on global growth which officials said is hurting business investment, exports and commodity prices, even with global monetary easing.
The bank lowered its growth forecast for Canada to 1.7% next year, from a July estimate of 1.9%, and 1.8% in 2021 from a previous projection of 2%. It also forecast an outright decline in exports and business investment in the second half of this year, when growth is expected to average a sluggish 1.3%.
As a result, the level of economic output will be “slightly lower” at the end of 2021 than predicted in July.
Officials also noted -- in a rare reference to the Canadian dollar in a rate statement -- that “despite” lower commodity prices, the currency hasn’t weakened against the U.S. dollar and is actually stronger against other currencies.
At the same time, the central bank is projecting inflation will remain at the 2% target over the projection horizon, in part because of a small downward revision to its estimates for potential growth and expectations the “modest” output gap -- primarily in oil-producing regions -- will narrow.
Global financial conditions meanwhile have eased, helping offset the impact of growing trade uncertainty, officials said.
More Bullish
The Bank of Canada was more bullish on consumption and housing -- which is being fueled by a robust labor market -- with forecasts little changed or even higher for those sectors in 2020 and 2021.
Another source of future growth could be additional stimulus from Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s re-elected Liberal government, which has promised to implement new spending and tax cuts next year.
The Bank of Canada “will pay close attention to the sources of resilience in the Canadian economy -- notably consumer spending and housing activity -- as well as to fiscal policy developments,” policy makers said in the statement.

264,By Bloomberg,"<span>Oct 30, 2019 10:20AM ET</span>",U.S. Economy Holds Up With 1.9% Growth on Consumer Strength,"(Bloomberg) -- A resilient American consumer helped the U.S. economy expand more than forecast in the third quarter, assuaging concerns for now of a more pervasive slowdown tied to weakening business investment and faltering export markets.
Gross domestic product expanded at a 1.9% annualized rate, according to Commerce Department data Wednesday that topped forecasts in a Bloomberg survey that called for 1.6% growth.
The gain mainly reflected strength in consumer spending, the biggest part of the economy, which increased at a 2.9% rate and exceeded projections for a 2.6% rise. For businesses, nonresidential fixed investment fell the most since late 2015.
Final sales to domestic purchasers rose an annualized 2% after 3.6% in the previous three months, signaling a moderation in underlying demand.
The growth figures come just hours before Federal Reserve officials are expected to announce a third-straight interest-rate cut to support the expansion and ahead of Friday's jobs report, which economists project will show hiring slowed further. Signs of stabilization may be a welcome sign for President Donald Trump as he campaigns on his economic record, though his trade war with China and faltering global growth have weighed on the expansion.
Investment, Exports
The report's composition showed a second-straight contraction in nonresidential investment, which fell an annualized 3% after declining 1% in the second quarter. Net exports were a slight drag on the expansion, subtracting 0.08 percentage point from growth as inventories also weighed slightly. Federal spending drove a gain in government consumption.
The report on GDP, the broadest measure of all goods and services, isn’t likely to swing the Fed’s rate decision as officials close a two-day meeting, though they may see greater consumer strength as an important sign that the economy is weathering sluggishness from overseas markets.
The International Monetary Fund recently cut its projection for global growth this year to 3%, the lowest since the financial crisis, as signs of stress menace economies from China to Europe. U.S. goods-trade figures this week showed exports and imports both fell in September to the lowest levels in more than a year.
As the longest U.S. expansion on record shows more signs of cooling, in part because of the fading effects of the 2018 fiscal stimulus, different parts of the world's largest economy are giving mixed signals.
Disposable Incomes
The unemployment rate has fallen to a half-century low, underpinning consumers and keeping sentiment readings near historical highs. Today's report showed disposable incomes after inflation increased an annualized 2.9% after a 2.4% pace in the prior quarter.
On the flip side, manufacturing, which makes up 11% of the economy, has weakened further as a widely watched private gauge hit a 10-year low. Companies, including oil and gas exploration firms, have reined in capital outlays to preserve shareholder value.
The weakness in business investment was led by structures and equipment, which both dropped the most in more than three years. Structures contracted at a 15.3% rate, shaving nearly a half a percentage point from growth, driven by a decrease in oil and gas exploration. Computers and aircraft led the decrease for equipment.
Personal consumption contributed 1.93 point while government added 0.35 point. Residential real estate contributed to growth for the first time since the end of 2017 amid lower mortgage rates, giving a 0.18 percentage point boost as the sector rebounded to a 5.1% growth pace.
The Fed's preferred underlying inflation measure, the personal consumption expenditures price index excluding food and energy, rose at a 2.2% annual pace in the quarter, about in line with policy makers' 2% objective.

Government consumption slowed to a 2% annualized gain, boosted by federal spending, after a 4.8% increase during the prior three months.
The second-quarter figures will be revised in November and December as additional source data are compiled.

265,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 30, 2019 09:22AM ET</span>",Mexican economy takes tiny step forward in third quarter,"MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexico's economy grew by 0.1 percent in the third quarter compared with the previous three-month period but fell short of market expectations, a preliminary estimate from the national statistics agency showed on Wednesday.
The seasonally-adjusted increase compared with a forecast of a Reuters poll of economists for gross domestic product (GDP) to expand by 0.2% in the July-September period after the economy stagnated in the second quarter.
Compared with the same quarter a year earlier, the economy shrank by 0.4 percent when measured in both seasonally adjusted and unadjusted terms, the statistics agency said.
The result was the first annual decline in GDP in adjusted terms since the final quarter of 2009, a year in which Mexico suffered a sharp recession brought on by the financial crisis.
A breakdown of the data showed that secondary activities, which include manufacturing, slipped one-tenth of a percentage point from the previous quarter, while services stagnated and the category that covers farming, fishing and mining grew 3.5%.
Mexico has been flirting with recession since President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador took office in December pledging to ramp up economic growth to an average of 4% per year. The economy contracted during the first quarter.
Investor confidence in Mexico, Latin America's second largest economy, has been shaken by some policy moves made by Lopez Obrador, a leftist exponent of economic nationalism.

In particular, his decision to cancel a partly built, $13 billion airport for Mexico City and his retreat from the prior government's opening of the oil and gas industry to private capital have raised doubts about his economic credentials.

LONDON (Reuters) - The number of people entering insolvency in England and Wales rose sharply in the three months to September compared with a year ago, according to official data that add to questions about the financial resilience of British consumers.
The government's Insolvency Service said the number of people officially entering financial distress rose to 30,879 in seasonally adjusted terms, up 23% on a year ago though little changed from 30,690 in the second quarter.
The rolling 12-month rate of individual insolvencies per 10,000 people rose to an eight-year high of 27.4, the figures showed.
""Today's figures provide a worrying insight into the state of personal finances,"" said Duncan Swift, president of insolvency and restructuring trade body R3.
Britain has relied on consumer spending to drive the economy this year as businesses, unnerved by the escalating Brexit crisis, have held back on investment.
Individual voluntary arrangements - a form of debt relief short of declaring bankruptcy - accounted for more than half the total insolvencies in the third quarter.
The figures showed the number of underlying corporate insolvencies in England and Wales rose by 1.6% compared with the third quarter of 2018.
Law firm Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer, which deals with restructuring, highlighted rising financial problems among retailers.
""Normally, you don't see many retail insolvencies in the run up to Christmas because owners and lenders wait until the seasonal stock is sold in the Christmas and New Year sales and turned into cash,"" Freshfields insolvency partner Richard Tett said.
""This shows the depth of the problems on the high street.""

267,By Investing.com,"<span>Oct 30, 2019 08:32AM ET</span>",Strong Consumers Keep U.S. Q3 GDP Growing at 1.9%; Investment Falls,"
Investing.com - The U.S. economy grew quickly than expected in the third quarter, as a strong labor market supported consumer spending. But business investment fell sharply under the shadow of the U.S.-China trade war.

Gross domestic product grew at an annualized rate of 1.9% in the three months to September, the Commerce Department said in its initial estimate on Wednesday.

That topped economists’ forecasts for growth of 1.6%, although it was down from 2.0% in the previous quarter.

On a straight year-on-year comparison, third-quarter GDP was up 2.0% from a year earlier, the weakest rate since the final quarter of 2016. That reflected to a large degree a sharp drop in business investment. Non-residential investment fell at an annualized 3.0% in the quarter, the Commerce Department said. Even the strength in consumer spending was relative: its growth slowed to 2.9% from 4.6% in the second quarter.

The U.S. economy hasn’t grown at an annualized rate below 2% for nearly three years, with the exception of the fourth quarter of 2018. Hiring and consumer spending rose as tax cuts last year sent growth surging. 

Jeroen Blokland, an economist with asset manager Robeco, said that the economy had slowed to a rate ""roughly equal to potential growth, down from above 3% in 2018 when the economy was on #tax steroids.""

The numbers came out only hours before the Federal Reserve is expected to cut interest rates for the third time this year. Although the headline rate may suggest less of a need to cut rates, Dean Baker, senior economist at the Center for Economic and Policy Research, noted that the price components of the GDP report were still within the Fed's comfort zone for inflation.
Core personal consumption expenditures, the Fed's preferred measures of inflation, rose just 1.7% last year, ""still well below Fed's 2.0 percent target,"" Baker said. He also noted that the savings rate, at 8.1%, offered some reassurance that strong consumption isn't being financed by an unsustainable rise in borrowing.

U.S. stock and bond markets were little changed by the data, suggesting that the numbers had done little to change expectations of what the Fed will do. The US Dollar Index Futures was effectively unchanged at 97.447.

Economists surveyed by Reuters had forecast the ADP (NASDAQ:ADP) National Employment Report would show a gain of 120,000 jobs, with estimates ranging from 40,000 to 190,000.
Private payroll gains in the month earlier were revised down to 93,000 from an originally reported 135,000 increase.

Economists polled by Reuters are looking for U.S. private payroll employment to have grown by 80,000 jobs in October, down from 114,000 the month before. Total non-farm employment is expected to have increased by 85,000.

PARIS/BERLIN (Reuters) - Strong domestic stimulus is helping France shrug off a global slowdown even as export-dependent Germany heads closer to a recession, starkly divergent data on the euro zone's two leading economies showed on Wednesday.
France saw national output rise 0.3% in the third quarter - defying forecasts for slightly slower growth - as unemployment in Germany rose faster than expected and its chambers of commerce warned that exports would shrink next year for the first time since the financial crisis as world trade friction mounts.
The contrast in national fortunes was underlined as incoming European Central Bank chief Christine Lagarde doubled down on her predecessor Mario Draghi's calls on Germany to use some of its budget surplus to invest in growth-enhancing measures.
""Those that have the room for maneuver, those that have a budget surplus, that's to say Germany, the Netherlands, why not use that budget surplus and invest in infrastructure? ... Why not invest in education, why not invest in innovation, to allow for a better re-balancing?"" she told France's RTL broadcaster.
France's economy, which has long relied more on domestic consumption than that of its northern neighbor, got a boost from President Emmanuel Macron's injection of 10 billion euros in stimulus to quell the ""yellow vest"" protests this year.
Most of that money went on boosting benefits for minimum-wage earning workers. Paris has also said it would cut taxes by more than 10 billion euros in total next year.
""At the same time, measures enacted in recent years .. have contributed to make the French labor market more flexible and have lowered labor costs for corporates,"" JP Morgan's Raphael Brun-Aguerre said of reforms begun under Macron's predecessor Francois Hollande and pursued by him.
""HUGE CHALLENGE""
A separate read-out by the European Commission in Brussels showed that economic sentiment across the 19-country euro zone as a whole deteriorated in October for a second straight month as pessimism in industry spread to services and consumers.
A breakdown showed that sentiment fell in Germany for the second straight month and to its lowest level in more than six years. France also saw a small dip but remained above the euro zone average.
The Germany economy shrank 0.1% in the second quarter, and third-quarter output figures next month are expected to show another fall, putting the country in recession by the standard definition.
Export-reliant Germany is also more exposed than most to the disputes triggered by U.S. President Donald Trump's ""America First"" policies and a cooling of Chinese growth.
""For our economy, with its strong industrial core, this is a huge challenge,"" DIHK Chambers of Industry and Commerce President Eric Schweitzer said when presenting the association's latest business sentiment survey of more than 28,000 managers.
DIHK said it expects Germany's annual export growth to wither to 0.3% this year from 2.1% in 2018, adding that exports are likely to shrink by 0.5% next year. Germany has in recent years averaged export growth of around 5.5%, Schweitzer said.
Data from the Federal Labour Office showed the number of people out of work increased by 6,000 to 2.287 million in seasonally adjusted terms. That compared with the Reuters consensus forecast for a rise of 2,000.
The jobless rate held steady at 5.0%. That was slightly above the record German low of 4.9% reached earlier this year and much lower than the 8.5% recorded in France in the second quarter, itself the lowest level reached since the end of 2008.
Draghi's acknowledgement after re-launching ECB asset purchases in September that monetary policy could not go much further to help the euro zone, has added to pressure on Germany in particular to adopt a more expansionary policy.
The coalition government in Berlin has consistently rejected those calls and says it is already using the room for maneuver created by lower borrowing costs to spend where necessary."
270,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 30, 2019 06:16AM ET</span>",Euro zone economic sentiment worsens as gloom spreads to services,"By Francesco Guarascio
BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Euro zone economic sentiment deteriorated in October for a second straight month, data showed on Wednesday, as pessimism in industry spread to services and consumers in a bad sign for the bloc's growth prospects.
The European Commission said its main indicator for economic sentiment in the 19-country currency bloc fell to 100.8 points in October from 101.7 a month earlier and 103.1 in August.
The fall was bigger than market consensus of 101.1 points in October, and brought the indicator to its lowest point since January 2015.
Pessimism in industry worsened to well below the long-term average, as the export-driven sector feels the impact of global trade wars.
In October the gloom spread also to the much larger services sector and to consumers in a sign of possible spillover from the crisis in manufacturing.
That could have negative fallouts on the euro zone's economic growth that has already been slowing this year mostly because of weakening production.
Economists polled by Reuters already forecast euro zone economic growth will drop to 0.1% in the third quarter from 0.2% in the previous one. The EU statistics agency Eurostat will release official estimates on Thursday.
Sentiment in services, which account for two-thirds of the euro zone economy, was positive in September despite the overall pessimism, but eased to 9.0 points in October from 9.5 the month before. This is the lowest level since June 2015.
The mood turned sour also among consumers, triggering a drop also in sentiment in the retail sector, where sentiment fell into negative territory for the first time since July.
Consumers in October expected higher prices in the coming months, which could partly explain their worsening sentiment.
That would be positive news for the European Central Bank which is struggling to raise inflation closer to its target of nearly 2%.
However, selling price expectations among industry and services managers remained largely unchanged.
In a separate release, the Commission said the business climate indicator, which points to the phase of the business cycle, rose to -0.19 points in October from -0.23 a month earlier, against market forecasts that it would have dropped further in negative territory to -0.24."
271,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 30, 2019 05:18AM ET</span>",French growth beats expectations in third quarter after Macron splashes out,"By Michel Rose
PARIS (Reuters) - France's economy defied forecasts for a slowdown in the third quarter after the government injected billions of euros of stimulus, boosting consumer demand and offsetting a slump in trade that could yet push neighboring Germany into recession.
The resilience in French gross domestic product, which expanded 0.3%, will be good news for President Emmanuel Macron at a time of concerns about the impact of international trade disputes on the global economy.
It may also back up the view of the French government and others, including incoming European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde, that Germany should follow Paris's example and spend more to support its economy.
Analysts surveyed by Reuters had forecast 0.2% growth for the French economy, the euro zone's second-largest, in the three months to the end of September.
Many forecasters expect Germany, the largest economy in the bloc and France's main trading partner, to have slipped into recession in the same three months by logging its second successive quarter of contraction.
Export-driven Germany is much more reliant on trade than France, whose economy was given an additional fillip by Macron's decision to announce 10 billion euros in budget measures to quell the so-called yellow vest crisis earlier this year.
Most of that money went on boosting benefits for minimum-wage earning workers. Paris has also said it would cut taxes by more than 10 billion euros in total next year.
 Barclays  (LON:BARC) economist Francois Cabau said the first reading for GDP supported his ""cautiously optimistic view on France"".
""We continue to think that the domestic fundamentals are well oriented and, in particular, private consumption should do well,"" he said, adding that falling unemployment would keep growth going at a rate of 0.3% to 0.4% in the coming quarters.
Domestic demand was the main driver in the last three-month stretch, adding 0.5 percentage points to growth, while trade subtracted 0.4 points.
Household spending picked up, growing at a 0.3% pace in the third quarter after expanding 0.2% in the previous three months, while business investment slowed to an increase of 0.9% this quarter from a 1.2% gain in April-June.
The negative effect of trade reflected a faster increase in imports than exports. 

Forward-looking economic indicators such as the purchasing managers index show French business activity has continued to expand this month, although morale among manufacturers fell to its lowest level since March 2015 this month.

273,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 29, 2019 11:08PM ET</span>","Japan retail sales rise most since 2014, but outlook murky","By Tetsushi Kajimoto
TOKYO (Reuters) - Japanese retail sales grew at the strongest pace in 5-1/2 years in September as consumers rushed to buy big-ticket items to beat a rise in the country's sales tax, raising concerns spending could pull back sharply in the coming months.
The increase in national sales tax to 10% from 8% on Oct. 1 is seen as crucial for fixing the industrial world's heaviest public debt at more than twice the size of Japan's economy.
But some analysts worry the twice-delayed tax hike could tip the world's third-largest economy into recession, underscoring the challenge for the central bank to sustain growth and accelerate inflation towards its 2% inflation target.
Wednesday's data is among key indicators to be scrutinized by the Bank of Japan, which holds its two-day policy review that ends on Thursday when it issues its quarterly projections of economy and prices.
The BOJ may hold off on loosening policy at its review as stable markets, a truce in U.S.-China trade talks and robust domestic demand give it room to save its limited ammunition.
Retail sales in September jumped 9.1% from a year earlier, boosted by a 16.9% increase in car sales, and household durables such as refrigerators, computers and TV, and cosmetics, food and clothing, trade ministry data showed on Wednesday.
The surge in spending ahead of the sales tax hike bodes ill for fourth-quarter private consumption, some analysts say, although it may help push up economic growth in the last quarter.
""The data released today suggests that private consumption may have risen by 1.5% quarter-on-quarter in the third quarter,"" Marcel Thieliant, senior Japan economist at Capital Economics, said.
""The risks to our forecast of a 1.7% quarter-on-quarter drop in consumption in the fourth quarter are probably tilted to the downside.""
The retail sales reading handily beat a 6.9% gain expected by economists in a Reuters poll, posting the fastest annual growth since March 2014 when retail sales jumped 11% one month before the previous tax hike.
Seasonally-adjusted retail sales grew 7.1% month-on-month in September, the data showed.
The trade ministry raised its assessment of retail sales to describe it as increasing.
But it added that it must stay vigilant to consumer sentiment after the tax hike and monitor any effects a recent slew of natural disasters may have on the economy.
The previous tax hike to 8% from 5% triggered a deep slump in private consumption and the broader economy as a big pull-back in demand followed the last-minute buying by consumers ahead of the hike.
Policymakers maintain that such a big swing in demand has not occurred this time round, given the smaller extent of the tax hike and various government measures to ease the burden of higher costs, such as shopping vouchers and other incentives."

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australian consumer prices cooled a notch last quarter, underscoring the challenge the country's central bank faces in bringing back inflation and interest rates to what is considered 'normal' levels.
The headline consumer price index (CPI) rose 0.5% in the September quarter, matching economists forecasts but slowing from 0.6% gain in the previous three-month period.
Annual CPI inflation climbed 1.7%, also matching expectations, data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) released on Wednesday showed.
Closely watched measures of core inflation undershot the central bank's 2% to 3% target band for a 15th straight quarter, the longest stretch since the series began.
The most significant price falls in the quarter were automotive fuel and fruits and vegetables, while international holidays, tobacco and childcare had the largest increases.
Prices for utilities and new dwelling purchases by owner-occupiers both fell slightly through the year to the September quarter, while rents recorded only a small rise.
""Annual inflation remains subdued partly due to price rises for housing-related expenses remaining low, and in some cases falling in annual terms,"" Bruce Hockman, chief economist at the ABS, said.
In a bid to revive stubbornly low inflation and slowing economic growth, the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) has chopped interest rates by 75 basis points since June to an all-time low of 0.75%.
Lower lending rates have over the past couple of months helped boost sentiment in the housing market where prices had been in a downfall since 2017 though activity elsewhere remains subdued.
But that has yet to have an impact in government data.
In the third quarter, one of the RBA-favoured measures of inflation - trimmed mean - rose 0.4%, unchanged from the prior quarter. On an annual basis, it held at 1.6% against the RBA's target band of 2% to 3%.
The two key measures of underlying inflation - trimmed mean and weighted median - also undershot the RBA's goal, averaging around 1.4% for the year."
275,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 29, 2019 01:25PM ET</span>","U.S. consumer confidence slips, housing stabilizing","By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. consumer confidence fell for a third straight month in October amid concerns about the short-term outlook for business conditions and job prospects, but remained at levels consistent with continued growth in consumer spending.
Other data on Tuesday suggested lower interest rates were lending some support to the struggling housing market. Contracts to purchase previously owned homes jumped in September to their highest level in nearly two years and house prices increased solidly in August. A stabilizing housing market could underpin consumer spending, which is the economy's growth engine. 
""We see nothing in today's report to suggest consumers will pull the rug out from the economy with a reduction in their purchases that could slow the economy to a crawl,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG in New York. ""Consumer spending is likely to remain moderate going into 2020.""
The Conference Board said its consumer confidence index slipped to a reading of 125.9 this month from an upwardly revised 126.3 in September. The index was previously reported at 125.1 in September. It was 12 points lower than its reading in October last year.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast it rising to 128.0 in October. The survey's present situation measure, based on consumers' assessment of current business and labor market conditions, increased to 172.3 this month from 170.6 in September. But the expectations index drawn from consumers' short-term outlook for income, business and labor market conditions declined to 94.9 from 96.8 last month.
The survey was published as officials from the Federal Reserve began a two-day policy meeting. The Fed is expected to cut interest rates for the third time on Wednesday. The U.S. central bank cut rates in September after reducing borrowing costs in July for the first time since 2008.
Consumer confidence has been declining, largely blamed on a 15-month trade war between the United States and China, which has thumped business sentiment, leading to a decline in capital expenditure that has contributed to a downturn in manufacturing. Still the confidence index remains relatively high.
""In the past, confidence declined steadily when the economy was headed toward recession,"" said Ryan Sweet, a senior economist at Moody's Analytics in West Chester, Pennsylvania. ""The index would need to be around 110 before it would send a stronger recession signal.""
The dollar was trading lower against a basket of currencies, while U.S. Treasury prices rose. Stocks on Wall Street were mostly higher.

MIXED LABOR MARKET READINGS
The Conference Board survey's so-called labor market differential, derived from data on respondents' views on whether jobs are plentiful or hard to get, increased to 35.1 in October from 33.5 in September. That measure closely correlates to the unemployment rate in the Labor Department's employment report.
The share of consumers expecting more jobs in the months ahead fell to 16.9% this month from 17.6% in September, while those anticipating fewer jobs rose to 17.8% from 15.4%.
Consumers' buying plans were mixed in October. Plans to buy a home increased, but were little changed for major appliances. This would suggest a limited rebound in retail sales in October after they dropped in September for the first time in seven months.
Consumer's intentions to buy a home were supported by a separate report on Tuesday from the National Association of Realtors showing its Pending Home Sales Index, based on contracts signed last month, advanced 1.5% to a reading of 108.7, the highest since December 2017. 
Economists surveyed by Reuters had forecast pending home sales rising 0.9% in September. Pending home contracts become sales after a month or two, and last month's increase suggested a rebound in existing home sales, which declined 2.2% in September. Pending home sales surged 3.9% in September from a year ago. 
""It looks like the drop in mortgage rates relative to late last year has helped boost activity in the housing market,"" said Daniel Silver, an economist at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) in New York. ""We think there will be additional increases in existing home sales in upcoming reports.""
But a chronic shortage of homes for sale is constraining the housing market despite the lower mortgage rates. Builders continue to complain that a lack of land and labor is making it difficult to break more ground especially on homes priced below $200,000, which are most sought after.
In September, home purchase contracts increased 2.6% in the populous South. Contracts rose 3.1% in the Midwest. They declined 1.3% in the West and fell 0.4% in the Northeast. 
Separately, the S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller national house price index increased 3.2% from a year ago in August after rising 3.1% in July. That was the first year-over-year acceleration in the rate of home price growth since March 2018. 
""Persistently low mortgage rates have seemingly ended what might have otherwise been a home price race-to-the-bottom this late in our economic expansion,"" said Ralph McLaughlin, deputy chief economist at CoreLogic.

276,By Bloomberg,"<span>Oct 29, 2019 11:36AM ET</span>",U.S. Consumer Confidence Falls to Lowest Since June,"(Bloomberg) -- U.S. consumer confidence unexpectedly fell to a four-month low as economic expectations dimmed, a warning sign that the consumer spending that’s been propping up the expansion may face challenges.
The Conference Board index, monitored by analysts as a signal of future consumer spending, dropped in October to 125.9 for a third-straight decline. The reading Tuesday missed the median forecast in a survey of economists, who had projected an increase. At the same time, the measure of views on present conditions rose, keeping it near historical highs.
Key Insights
The unexpected decline and the weakest reading on expectations since January underscores how weakness in some corners of the economy may spread to the consumer. A key manufacturing gauge has fallen deeper into contraction and the labor market, while still robust, has shown some cracks recently with slower wage growth and a weaker pace of hiring.The measure of those saying they expect fewer jobs in six months rose to the highest since September 2016, while those seeing more jobs in the same period dropped.The report contrasts with other data on consumer confidence from the University of Michigan survey showing that sentiment rose in October as both current conditions and expectations increased.President Donald Trump tweeted Tuesday morning that consumer confidence was “very good” and that September housing sales were “up nicely.” Pending U.S. home sales posted the biggest annual gain since 2015, according to a National Association of Realtors report earlier Tuesday. Separately, the S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller index showed home prices declined in August for the first time in a year.Official’s View
Lynn Franco, director of economic indicators at the Conference Board, struck a more optimistic note: “Expectations weakened slightly as consumers expressed some concerns about business conditions and job prospects,” she said in a statement. “However, confidence levels remain high and there are no indications that consumers will curtail their holiday spending.”

277,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 29, 2019 10:31AM ET</span>",U.S. consumer confidence slips in October,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. consumer confidence unexpectedly fell in October amid household concerns about the short-term outlook for business conditions and job prospects.
The Conference Board said its consumer confidence index slipped to a reading of 125.9 this month from an upwardly revised 126.3 in September. The index was previously reported at 125.1 in September. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast it rising to 128.0 in October.
The survey's present situation measure, based on consumers' assessment of current business and labor market conditions, increased to 172.3 this month from 170.6 in September. The expectations index based on consumers' short-term outlook for income, business and labor market conditions declined to 94.9 from 96.8 last month.
""Expectations weakened slightly as consumers expressed some concerns about business conditions and job prospects,"" said Lynn Franco, director of economic indicators at The Conference Board. ""However, confidence levels remain high and there are no indications that consumers will curtail their holiday spending."""
278,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 29, 2019 10:06AM ET</span>",U.S. pending home sales increase more than expected,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Contracts to buy previously owned homes increased more than expected in September, suggesting that the housing market was getting a lift from lower mortgage rates though tight supply remains a constraint.
The National Association of Realtors said on Tuesday its Pending Home Sales Index, based on contracts signed last month, advanced 1.5% to a reading of 108.7.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast pending home sales rising 0.9% in September.
Pending home contracts become sales after a month or two, and last month's increase suggested a rebound in existing home sales, which declined 2.2% in September. Pending home sales surged 3.9% in September from a year ago.
A persistent shortage of homes for sale has constrained the housing market despite lower mortgage rates and a slowdown in prices. Builders continue to complain that a lack of land and labor is making it difficult to break more ground especially on homes priced below $200,000, which are most sought after.
Investment in homebuilding has contracted for six straight quarters, the longest such stretch since the Great Recession.
In September, home purchase contracts increased 2.6% in the populous South. Contracts rose 3.1% in the Midwest. They declined 1.3% in the West and fell 0.4% in the Northeast."
279,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 29, 2019 05:41AM ET</span>",UK consumers more cautious about borrowing in run-up to Brexit deadline: BoE,"LONDON (Reuters) - British consumers showed further signs of caution as their borrowing increased at the slowest pace in more than five years in September ahead of a Brexit deadline which has since been postponed, data showed.
The growth rate in unsecured consumer lending slowed to 6.0% in the 12 months to September, the weakest increase since July 2014 and down from 6.1% in August, the figures from the Bank of England showed.
Consumers, bolstered by low unemployment and rising wages, have helped drive Britain's economy since the Brexit referendum decision to leave the European Union more than three years ago.
But there have been signs of a turn in the mood of households recently as the prospect of a no-deal Brexit grew with Britain's parliament deadlocked on how to move ahead.
Earlier on Tuesday, mortgage lender Nationwide said British house prices rose by just 0.4% on the year, the 11th month in a row that annual price growth remained below 1%.
The BoE said the number of mortgages approved for house purchase rose minimally to 65,919 in September, above economists' forecasts of 65,000 in a Reuters poll.
Net mortgage lending rose by 3.85 billion pounds in September, roughly in line with the Reuters poll forecast.
Consumer lending increased by 0.83 billion pounds, the smallest monthly increase since March, compared with a forecast for a rise of 0.9 billion pounds on the month.
Last week industry body UK Finance said the number of new mortgages approved by British banks hit a six-month low in September while annual growth in consumer credit rose to a 19-month high.
The BoE said it had revised upwards its data for annual growth in consumer credit over the past two-and-a-half years."

The INSEE national statistics office said its measure of consumer confidence for October stayed at 104, like last month - the highest mark since it reached 105 points in January 2018.
A Reuters poll of 17 economists had forecast 104 points for the October levels.
INSEE said that, at 104, the indicator stayed above its long-term average, which is currently at 100.
The statistics office added that the French households were feeling as confident over their personal financial situations as last month but were more inclined to make big purchases."

Vietnam’s exports dropped 0.8% in October compared to the prior year -- far below expectations for 10% growth in a Bloomberg survey of economists --as shipments of phones, crude oil and coffee fell, according to data from the General Statistics Office in Hanoi.
Overseas coffee sales in October were 100,000 tons, down 27% from a year ago, as farmers held off selling beans with prices at their lowest in a decade. In addition, Samsung Electronics (KS:005930) Co. reduced its phone and accessories shipments between September and October, the government said. There were also significant declines in Vietnamese exports of crude oil and steel.
Imports jumped 3.5% in October from a year earlier. Exports for January through October were estimated at $217 billion, up 7.4% from the year-ago period, after the country reported a 8.2% increase in exports for January through September, the government said.

282,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 29, 2019 12:31AM ET</span>","South Korea's October exports to fall for eleventh month on weak China, chip demand","By Joori Roh
SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea's exports likely contracted in October, falling for an 11th straight month, pressured by weak sales to China and sluggish global demand for semiconductors.
Economists expect the decline to bottom out as favorable base effects will likely kick in starting from November.
October shipments were seen slumping 13.8% from a year earlier, according to the median forecast of 15 economists polled, nearly matching the worst decline in 3-1/2 years in August, when exports fell a revised 13.9%.
The projected October fall would be a fifth month of double-digit percentage decline for the export-reliant economy.
In October 2018, exports surged 22.5% mainly driven by the traditional three-day Chuseok holidays.
""Sustained weakness in semiconductor exports seen after the release of the interim figures is worrisome given that base effects helped semiconductors turn positive in October,"" said Oh Suk-tae, economist at  Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN).
Oh said favorable base effects on overall exports should kick in from November, adding ""we will carefully monitor whether there are any signs of true recovery in exports"".
Preliminary data showed South Korea's exports plunged 19.5% over the first 20 days of October from a year earlier, with chip sales diving 28.8% and sales to China falling 20.0%.
South Korea's economic growth slowed more than expected in the third quarter due to a slump in domestic spending and global trade headwinds, but exports signaled some signs of recovery.
The world's sixth-largest exporter has been one of the worst-hit economies in the wake of a prolonged U.S.-China trade war and as global demand continues to cool, dampening business confidence and investment.
While the leaders of the world's two biggest economies are working to agree on the text for a ""Phase 1"" trade agreement, U.S. President Donald Trump said on Monday he expected to sign a significant part of the trade deal with China ahead of schedule without elaborating on the details.
But economists are still skeptical about a recovery as external conditions remain challenging.
""Though U.S.-China trade tensions are seen easing lately, the global manufacturing industry and external demand remain weak due to the mounting impact from tariffs,"" Ahn So-eun, economist at IBK Securities.
Economists also forecast that South Korea's consumer prices would be negative for a second month, easing a median 0.3% in October, slightly better than last month's 0.4% fall, the first negative reading since data began in 1965.
Earlier this month, the Bank of Korea trimmed its policy interest rate for the second time in three months to 1.25%, matching a record low.
A state-run think tank said on Monday the central bank should focus more on meeting its inflation target than on financial stability, hinting that more rate cuts would be needed to lift falling prices.
The Reuters poll also sees industrial output in September rising by a seasonally adjusted 0.6% from a month earlier.
September industrial output data is due at 8 a.m. on Thursday (2300 GMT Wednesday).
October trade data will be published at 9 a.m. on Friday (0000 GMT) while inflation figures are expected an hour earlier (2300 GMT Thursday)."
283,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 29, 2019 12:27AM ET</span>",Hong Kong shops shutter as months of protest darken economic gloom,"By Felix Tam and Donny Kwok
HONG KONG (Reuters) - Hong Kong jeweler Jun Lam has already closed one shop. His remaining outlet sits in an almost deserted shopping mall at the heart of a district regularly hit by sometimes violent protests that have rocked the Chinese-ruled city since June.
Restaurants, hotels and retail outlets like Lam's, many of which cater to mostly mainland Chinese tourists, form a central pillar of a small business sector that employs more than one million people in the city.
But with visitors deterred by months of violence, many firms have closed or are struggling to turn a profit.
""It's only a third of the pedestrian flow compared with the past. On some days, almost no shops were open in this mall,"" Lam said. To stay afloat, he has closed his other store in the New Territories district of Tseun Wan, the site of some violent demonstrations between protesters and police.
When Reuters visited The Capital shopping mall, where Lam's remaining shop sits, almost half the units were closed or emptied.
In the surrounding Tsim Sha Tsui shopping and hotel precinct, many shutters on closed shops bore 'To Let' signs or letters demanding rent from landlords.
Just last Sunday, the district was blanketed in tear gas during cat-and-mouse clashes between police and pro-democracy protesters.
It was the 21st consecutive weekend of protests over fears Beijing is tightening its grip on the territory, the worst political crisis since colonial ruler Britain handed Hong Kong back to China in 1997.
The unrest has dealt a double blow to the financial hub, which was already grappling with sluggish economic growth.
Government support has been modest, and there is little optimism amid a record decline in retail sales, rising unemployment and bankruptcies that have started to hit banks' bottom lines.
Larger firms impacted by the protests can often fall back on their wider footprint, access to emergency capital or international business, industry watchers say, but for many small firms there is no such safety net.
""It's a very serious situation,"" said Brian King, associate dean of the School of Hotel and Tourism Management at Hong Kong Polytechnic University.
""There is no buffer for the owners - it's not easy for them to get loans and there's not a particularly strong welfare system in Hong Kong.""
""WAITING TO DIE""
Confirming the city entered recession in the third quarter, the city's finance chief Paul Chan on Sunday urged an end to violence.
Chan earlier this month said at least 100 restaurants have closed due to the unrest with about 2,000 employees affected.
Hong Kong is home to around 340,000 small and medium sized firms, according to official figures, providing jobs for about 1.3 million people. That accounts for around 45% of total employment, excluding the civil service, and 98% of business units covered by quarterly government surveys.
High street rents in the city, among the most expensive in the world, fell the most since the 1998 Asian financial crisis in the third quarter, while authorities have repeatedly called for landlords to cut rents during the crisis.
But, for many small firms, that may not be enough to stave off closure.
""Many stores are waiting to die,"" said Bob Yip, operator of Wing Li Dispensary, located on the popular protest route of Causeway Bay on Hong Kong island.
Yip said his business, which mainly caters to tourists from mainland China, has dropped by 80%, while his local custom has dwindled due to regular closures of the transport network during the protests.
Yip said the government was not doing enough to resolve the disputes with pro-democracy demonstrators.
Others say police tactics are making the situation worse.
On Sunday, a tear gas canister landed inside a pharmacy during clashes in Yau Ma Tei district, sending spluttering shoppers and workers fleeing from the cramped, smoke-filled store, local media coverage of the incident showed.
The shopkeeper, surnamed Wu, told local media four representatives of the police visited the store on Monday morning and said they were sorry, without explaining why tear gas was fired at the pharmacy.
""We already half-closed our shutter when the tear gas canister was thrown into our shop suddenly,"" Wu told local broadcaster RTHK. ""We all ran outside. There weren't many people on the streets but the police fired tear gas nevertheless."""
284,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 28, 2019 11:25AM ET</span>",Ebbing flows curb U.S. goods trade deficit; inventories mixed,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. goods trade deficit fell in September as trade tensions restricted the flow of goods, but that did not change views that economic growth decelerated further in the third quarter amid slowing consumer spending and declining business investment.
The report from the Commerce Department on Monday also showed inventories at retailers rising moderately last month, but stocks at wholesalers dropping, leading the Atlanta Federal Reserve to trim its gross domestic product growth estimate for the third quarter by one-tenth of a percentage point to a 1.7% annualized rate. The economy grew at a 2.0% rate in the second quarter, slowing from the January-March quarter's 3.1% pace. 
The economy is losing momentum largely because of a 15-month trade war between the United States and China, which has sapped business confidence and undermined capital expenditure. Though President Donald Trump this month announced a truce in the trade war with China, delaying additional tariffs that were due in October, economists say the longest economic expansion on record remains in danger without all import duties being rolled back.
Trump said on Monday he expected to sign a significant part of the trade deal with China ahead of schedule but did not elaborate on the timing. 
Economists, however, remain skeptical of the White House's so-called Phase 1 trade deal and warned slower economic growth around the world would lead to a global recession.
""America's trade deficit with the world is narrowing but it's not because the U.S. is winning and bringing factories and production and jobs back, it's because the world has stopped trading as much with one another,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG in New York. 
""One of the causes of the Great Depression was trade tariffs and it will be a miracle if the world economy can continue to thrive if nations keep throwing up protectionist trade barriers.""
The goods trade gap dropped 3.6% percent to $70.4 billion last month. Exports declined 1.6%, pulled down by plunges in shipments of soybeans, as well as automobiles. Goods imports tumbled 2.3% amid decreases in imports of industrial supplies, capital goods, motor vehicles and consumer goods.
The decline in imports, centered around consumer and capital goods, points to a step down in consumer spending and further contraction in business investment. 
""Until trade issues are resolved in a more permanent and comprehensive way, the trade war will remain a drag on the global economy,"" said Emily Mandel, an economist at Moody's Analytics in West Chester, Pennsylvania.
U.S. financial markets were little moved by the data.
WEAK DATA STREAM
The Commerce Department also reported retail inventories rose 0.3% in September after dropping 0.2% in the prior month. Retail inventories, excluding motor vehicles and parts, the component that goes into the calculation of gross domestic product gained 0.3% after slipping 0.2% in August.
But wholesale inventories dropped 0.3% last month after being unchanged in August. With September data in hand, economists at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) estimated inventories increased at a $44 billion rate in the third quarter after rising at a $69.4 billion pace in the April-June period. 
They said that suggested inventories cut off 0.6 percentage point from third-quarter GDP growth. Both trade and inventories were a drag on GDP growth in the second quarter.
The reports on Monday came on the heels of data this month showing a cooling in job growth in September and retail sales dropping for the first time in seven months. Manufacturing output also declined last month in part as a strike at General Motors (NYSE:GM) depressed auto production. 
According to a Reuters survey of economists, GDP likely increased at a 1.7% rate in the third quarter. The government will publish its snapshot of third-quarter GDP on Wednesday. The waning stimulus from last year's $1.5 trillion tax cut package is also constraining growth.
""The projected pullback in the real pace of inventory growth in the third quarter means that inventories could be less of a headwind for growth in the future than we had previously anticipated,"" said Daniel Silver, an economist at JPMorgan. 

""But prospects for fourth-quarter growth don't look especially good given weak trajectories for some source data related to capex and consumer spending though September.""

285,By Bloomberg,"<span>Oct 28, 2019 09:56AM ET</span>","U.S. Goods Exports, Imports Drop As Tariffs Weigh on Firms","(Bloomberg) -- U.S. exports and imports of goods both slumped in September to the weakest levels in more than a year, the latest sign President Donald Trump’s tariffs are weighing on the economy.
The steeper decline for imports unexpectedly narrowed the merchandise trade deficit to $70.4 billion from $73.1 billion in August, according to Commerce Department data released Monday that compared with a projected gap of $73.5 billion in Bloomberg’s survey.
Exports declined 3% from a year earlier to $135.9 billion, the lowest in more than a year and a half, while imports were down 4.6% to a nearly two-year low of $206.3 billion.
The figures add to indications that Trump’s trade policies are challenging American companies as rising tariffs aimed at China muddle supply chains and add to uncertainty. Other data have shown that the tensions with China have helped to reduce business investment and slow the pace of hiring.
Shipments of foods, feeds and beverages tumbled 12.6% from the prior month, and exports of vehicles dropped 7.2%. Imports of consumer goods were down 5%.
Trump said minutes after the release of the report that the U.S. is ahead of schedule with finalizing sections of the first phase of a trade deal with China that could be signed soon. “We’re a little bit ahead of schedule, probably a lot ahead,” he said.
Stockpiles Shift
The government’s advance report also showed wholesale inventories dropped 0.3% while retail stockpiles were up 0.3%.
Analysts look to these numbers to adjust estimates for economic growth during the quarter. Before Monday’s report, economists had forecast that the government’s first estimate for third-quarter gross domestic product due Wednesday will slow to a 1.6% annualized pace from 2% in the prior quarter.
Exports and imports of goods account for about three-fourths of America’s total trade; the U.S. typically runs a deficit in merchandise and a surplus in services.
Monday’s figures cover goods only. The Commerce Department will release full September data for international trade Nov. 5, including services and more details on merchandise shipments.

286,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 28, 2019 06:43AM ET</span>",Hong Kong enters recession as protests again erupt in flames,"HONG KONG (Reuters) - Hong Kong has fallen into recession, hit by five months of anti-government protests that erupted in flames at the weekend, and is unlikely to achieve any growth this year, the city's Financial Secretary said.
Black-clad and masked demonstrators set fire to shops and hurled petrol bombs at police on Sunday following a now-familiar pattern, with police responding with tear gas, water cannon and rubber bullets.
TV footage showed protesters, who streamed into the Kowloon hotel and shopping artery of Nathan Road on Sunday, setting fire to street barricades and squirting petrol from plastic bottles on to fires at subway entrances amid running battles with police.
At one station, activists rolled a flaming metal barrel down a long staircase toward police below.
""The blow (from the protests) to our economy is comprehensive,"" Paul Chan said in a blog post, adding that a preliminary estimate for third-quarter GDP on Thursday would show two successive quarters of contraction - the technical definition of a recession.
He also said it would be ""extremely difficult"" to achieve the government's pre-protest forecast of 0-1 % annual economic growth.
The rallying cry of Sunday's protests was to fight perceived police brutality and defend Muslims and journalists. Police last weekend fired water cannon at a group of people standing outside a mosque and journalists have been wounded in clashes. 
The programming staff union of public broadcaster RTHK said on Monday it had called on police to identify officers who ""attacked and ripped the face mask"" off one of its journalists on Sunday. It said she was wearing a reflective vest clearly identifying herself as a journalist.
Pictures circulating online suggested she was wearing a gas mask, to protect against tear gas and pepper spray. Ordinary face masks were banned this month under a resurrected colonial-era emergency law.
Hong Kong Free Press, an online news service, called for the release of a freelance photographer arrested on Sunday after she had asked to see a police officer's warrant card.
The city's Foreign Correspondents' Club condemned the arrest in a statement calling for an independent investigation into ""police violence against journalists and interference with the media's right to cover the protests under Hong Kong law"".
The police, who deny using excessive force, told reporters they had repeatedly asked journalists to keep their distance so police can do their job.
They said an officer had removed a journalist’s mask, which had seemed an ""undesirable"" incident, but they said they did not know the full context. The Hong Kong Free Press reporter was arrested for failing to show ID and being uncooperative and obstructing police.
Protesters have routinely torched store fronts and businesses including banks, particularly those owned by mainland Chinese companies and vandalized the city's MTR Corp metro which has shut down services to stop protesters gathering. 
The MTR has closed early for the past few weeks and said it will again shut down two hours early on Monday to repair damage.
Protesters are angry about what they view as increasing interference by Beijing in Hong Kong, which returned to Chinese rule in 1997 under a ""one country, two systems"" formula intended to guarantee freedoms not seen on the mainland.
China denies meddling. It has accused foreign governments, including the United States and Britain, of stirring up trouble.
Tourists numbers have plummeted, with visitor numbers down nearly 50 percent in October, a decline Chan called an ""emergency"".
Retail operators, from prime shopping malls to family-run businesses, have been forced to close for multiple days over the past few months.
While authorities have announced measures to support local small and medium seized enterprises, Chan said the measures could only ""slightly reduce the pressure"". 

""Let citizens return to normal life, let industry and commerce operate normally, and create more space for rational dialogue,"" he wrote.

287,By Bloomberg,"<span>Oct 28, 2019 02:38AM ET</span>","China’s Slowdown Rolls On Into October, Early Indicators Show","(Bloomberg) -- China’s third-quarter slowdown continued into October, with only a few signs of stabilization evident amid the weakest pace of expansion in almost thirty years.
Bloomberg Economics’ gauge aggregating the earliest available indicators from financial markets and businesses showed the economy cooling for a sixth month, with indicators for trade, factory prices, iron ore and copper all worsening.
Easing tensions with the U.S. in September and October are too recent to have any effect on trade, which continues to worsen on slowing global demand and the effects of the tariff war. South Korean exports in the first 20 days of October, a leading indicator for intra-Asian trade and for the tech cycle, dropped almost 20%, extending their decline to 10 months.
Factory prices dropped faster than in September, according to Bloomberg’s producer price tracker, which was at the lowest since mid-2016. The tracker is a leading indicator for the official price data, which is due early next month, and shows that there will be no immediate improvement to the price declines which hurt both company profits and their ability to repay debt.
Solid signs of stabilization remain elusive. Sales managers were the most confident they’ve been in 19 months, though sub-indices including market growth and staffing indicate still-weak activity, according to World Economics, which compiles the data. Data for small and medium-sized companies did show signs of improvement in October, according to  Standard Chartered  (LON:STAN) Plc.
“Sub-indices for ‘current performance,’ ‘expectations,’ and ‘credit conditions’ rose during the month, increasing the likelihood of a tepid recovery in the fourth quarter on continued counter-cyclical policy measures,” Economists Lan Shen and Ding Shuang from Standard Chartered wrote in a note. “Domestic demand recovered slightly, driven largely by a strong performance in the construction and manufacturing sectors,” although external trade remains a major headwind, they wrote.
Stock prices also rebounded in the month, with a strong recovery in real-estate stocks, on the back of resurgent investment into the property sector. Iron ore prices dropped as supply increased.
“Higher tariffs and trade war uncertainties may continue to hurt corporate earnings and manufacturing sector investment,” UBS Economist Tao Wang wrote in a recent note. “We expect policy support to strengthen in 2020 but with less monetary easing. We see more financing for infrastructure investment, support for SMEs and social safety net, and further structural reforms and opening up of the domestic market.”

288,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 26, 2019 10:33PM ET</span>",China's industrial profits fall 5.3% in Sept as trade war toll mounts,"BEIJING (Reuters) - Profits at China's industrial firms contracted for the second straight month in September as producer prices continued their slide, highlighting the toll a slowing economy and protracted U.S. trade war are having taken on corporate balance sheets. 
Industrial profits fell 5.3% in September from a year earlier to 575.6 billion yuan ($81.48 billion), data released by the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) on Sunday showed. That compared with a 2% decline in August.
China's vast industrial sector has come under pressure amid trade tensions and tit-for-tat tariffs with the United States. Profits have slowed visibly since the second half of last year, though the sector has seen some transitory rebounds as Beijing steps up support measures. 
The decline in profits contrasted with the slight improvement in the manufacturing sector in September, with factory surveys and better-than-expected industrial production growth pointing to a pick-up in domestic demand. 
But factory gate prices, considered a key barometer of corporate profitability, fell at the steepest clip in more than three years as economic growth ground to a fresh near 30-year low in the third quarter.
For January-September, industrial firms earned profits of 4.59 trillion yuan, down 2.1% year-on-year, and worse than the 1.7% reading in the first eight months.
The drop was mainly due to factors such as a decline in the ex-factory price of industrial products and slowdown in sales growth, said Zhu Hong, a senior statistician with the NBS. 
Profits for state-owned firms slipped 9.6 percent in the first three quarters of the year.
The most impacted sector was the oil, coal and other fuel processing industries, where profits fell 53.5 percent in the January-September period.
Profits for the non-ferrous, electrical machinery and equipment manufacturing and alcoholic beverages sectors all bucked the trend though, recording rising profits.
U.S. and Chinese trade negotiators are working on nailing down a ""Phase 1"" trade deal for their presidents to sign next month, as the world's two biggest economies try to end a more than a year-long trade war that has disrupted global trade. 
China's economic growth is expected to slow to a near 30-year low of 6.2% this year and cool further to 5.9% in 2020, a Reuters poll showed, underlining the challenges faced by Beijing even as it steps up stimulus amid a bruising Sino-U.S. trade war.
Industrial firms' liabilities increased 5.4% from a year earlier to 66.49 trillion yuan at end-September, compared with a 5.0% increase in August.
Private sector profits rose 5.4% in January-September, slowing from 6.5% growth in the first eight months.
The data covers companies with more than 20 million yuan in annual revenue from their main operations.

289,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 25, 2019 03:49PM ET</span>",U.S. government's annual budget deficit largest since 2012,"By Lindsay Dunsmuir
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. government ended fiscal year 2019 with the largest budget deficit in seven years as gains in tax receipts were offset by higher spending and growing debt service payments, the Treasury department said on Friday.
It is the first time since the early 1980s that the budget gap has widened over four consecutive years. The figures reflect the second full budget year under U.S. President Donald Trump, a Republican, and come at a time when the country has an expanding tax base with moderate economic growth and an unemployment rate currently near a 50-year low.
The U.S. budget deficit widened to $984 billion, which was 4.6% of the nation's gross domestic product. The previous fiscal year deficit was $779 billion, with a deficit-to-GDP-ratio of 3.8%. Total receipts increased by 4% to $3.5 trillion but outlays rose by 8.2% to $4.4 trillion.
""Americans from all walks of life are flourishing again thanks to pro-growth policies enacted by this administration,"" Acting Office of Management and Budget Director Russ Vought said in a statement accompanying the figures.
The deficit reached a peak of $1.4 trillion in 2009 as the Obama administration and Congress took emergency measures to shore up the nation's banking system during the global financial crisis and provide stimulus to an economy in recession.
The annual budget deficit had been reduced to $585 billion by the end of former President Barack Obama's second term in 2016 and Republicans in Congress during that time criticized Obama, a Democrat, for not reducing it further.
Since then, the budget deficit has jumped due in part to the Republican's overhaul of the tax system, which in the short term reduced revenues, and an increase in military spending. By the end of fiscal 2019, corporate tax payments were up 5%. Customs duties, which have been boosted by the Trump administration's levying of tariffs on China and others, were up 70% year-on-year to a record high.

GROWING DEFICITS
""This is an administration that came in talking about reducing the deficit and over their term in office, they've quite frankly been increasing,"" said Bill Hoagland, Senior Vice President at the Bipartisan Policy Center. ""We normally reduce deficits in times of growth.""
The economy grew 2.9% in 2018 but activity is slowing as the stimulus from the $1.5 trillion tax cut package fades and the prolonged U.S-China trade war weighs on business investment.
There was higher spending on defense, healthcare and social security programs, the data showed. The United States has an ageing population and economists have warned that the cost of mandatory spending on Social Security and Medicare as well as federal retirement programs for the elderly will be fiscally unsustainable.
Earlier this year the U.S. Congress passed a two-year budget deal backed by Trump that would increase federal spending on defense and other domestic programs.
Some of the widening of the deficit came from more spending on interest payments on the national debt. Borrowing has increased over the past year.
For September, the U.S. government recorded an $83 billion surplus, a 31% drop from the same month last year. When accounting for calendar adjustments, the surplus last month was $17 billion compared with an adjusted surplus of $51 billion the previous year. For the fiscal year, the adjusted deficit was $1 trillion.
Outlays were $291 billion in September, up 30% from the same month a year earlier while receipts totaled $374 billion, an increase of 9% from the year-ago month."
290,By Bloomberg,"<span>Oct 25, 2019 02:28PM ET</span>",U.S. Annual Budget Deficit Nears $1 Trillion With 26% Increase,"(Bloomberg) -- The U.S. budget deficit widened to almost $1 trillion in the latest fiscal year, surging to the highest level since 2012 as President Donald Trump cut taxes and boosted spending.
The gap increased by 26% to $984 billion in the 12 months through September, representing 4.6% of gross domestic product, the Treasury Department reported Friday. The fourth straight increase confirms that the deficit under Trump is on pace to expand to historic levels.
Few economists outside the administration expect the GOP’s $1.5 trillion in tax cuts to deliver a sustainable economic boost that would narrow the gap. The deficit -- which has little precedent at these levels outside recessions or wartime -- is set to widen further as spending increases for mandatory programs and interest payments.
The ballooning gap has stirred vigorous debates over how much the government can borrow and spend without driving up interest rates or inflation. At the same time, price gains and yields remain historically low despite the expanding deficit.
For the 12-month period, spending rose 8.2%, the most since 2009, totaling $4.45 trillion on increased outlays for the military, health care and education. Revenue advanced 4% to $3.46 trillion, helped by $70.8 billion in customs duties. For September alone, the surplus was $82.8 billion, compared with $119.1 billion a year earlier.
“President Trump’s economic agenda is working,"" Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said in a statement accompanying the release. “In order to truly put America on a sustainable financial path, we must enact proposals -- like the president’s 2020 budget plan -- to cut wasteful and irresponsible spending.""
The non-partisan Congressional Budget Office has forecast that the deficit will top $1 trillion in 2020, with estimates showing a shortfall of about $1.2 trillion each year over the next decade. That would amount to nearly 5% of total gross domestic product, a measure that puts the deficit in context of the overall economy.
Election Campaign
Trump’s 2020 election bid is beginning to ramp up and he’s eager to show that his three-pronged economic agenda of tax cuts, deregulation and new trade deals have spurred growth. However, key indicators, such as business investment in equipment and machinery, have cooled lately despite incentives from tax policy. In addition, the trade tariffs are causing businesses to become hesitant with spending, while research has shown that the tax cuts are most favorable to higher-income Americans.
The president has repeatedly blamed the Federal Reserve for hampering the economy by raising interest rates too high last year and failing to cut quickly enough. The central bank is projected by economists to cut interest rates next week for the third time in three months. Officials may also telegraph that they are likely to pause for some time before making another rate move.
Fed Chairman Jerome Powell has repeatedly warned that the U.S. is on an unsustainable fiscal path. But economists are revisiting traditional ideas about how much debt can be issued, and markets don’t appear worried.
Democratic candidates seeking to challenge Trump in 2020 are pushing plans to widen access to health care and education that could cost trillions of dollars. And yields on U.S. Treasuries have fallen sharply this year to the lowest level since 2016 amid a weaker growth outlook as well as investors seeking better returns than even lower-yielding bonds from overseas.
Tariff Revenue
The deficit may have exceeded $1 trillion had it not been for the trade war with China, where Trump has escalated levies over the past year. The customs-duties revenue represented a 71% increase from 2018, as American companies paid more at the border for Chinese imports, steel and other goods. While the countries came to a preliminary agreement that’s delayed at least one planned increase in levies, current tariffs aren’t being rolled back yet.
Government outlays have provided a sizable boost to U.S. GDP amid a slowdown in business investment. Federal spending rose at an annualized pace of more than 5% in the first half of the calendar year, more than double growth in the economy as a whole, according to the Commerce Department. That was helped particularly by military spending.
The tax cuts have also been credited with helping juice economic growth last year. Yet the effects of the reductions have since faded.
Even without the tax cuts and higher defense spending, outlays are increasing at a relatively fast clip. Mandatory allocations, which include Medicare and social security payments, are growing amid an aging population and with one of the world’s least efficient health-care systems. Interest payments are also adding up, now comprising about 8.4% of total outlays."

The benchmark rate was cut to 6.5% from 7%, according to a statement published on Friday. The central bank last opted for a 50 basis-point cut almost two years ago. Eighteen economists out of 40 in a Bloomberg survey correctly forecast the move, while 22 expected a smaller cut.
“Disinflationary risks exceed pro-inflationary risks over the short-term horizon,” the central bank said. “The Bank of Russia will consider the necessity of further key rate reduction at one of the upcoming Board of Directors’ meetings.”
Russia has already cut rates three times this year, but central bank Governor Elvira Nabiullina turned more dovish last week when she indicated that more needed to be done to prevent a sustained period of low inflation. The bigger-than-expected cut echoes similar moves this week by central banks in Turkey and Ukraine.
The Bank of Russia lowered its end-of-year inflation forecast to 3.2%-3.7% from 4%-4.5% and said that it sees consumer-price growth at 3.5%-4% by the end of 2020. Inflation may go “slightly” below 3% in the first quarter of next year, according to the statement.
Real interest rates among the highest in emerging markets and low growth means that Russia still has ample room to cut interest rates.Analysts at  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS). and Sberbank CIB forecast this week that the central bank will need to cut by another 50 basis points in December to contain the slow down in inflation.The central bank’s dovish turn has added fuel to a bond rally in Russia this year that has already handed investors a 27% return."

Ifo said its business climate index was unchanged from the prior month in October at 94.6. That was just above the consensus forecast for 94.5.
""The German economy is stabilising,"" Ifo President Clemens Fuest said in a statement.
Europe's economic powerhouse contracted in the second quarter and many economists expect it to have shrunk in the third quarter. That would put it in recession - usually defined as a period of at least two consecutive quarters of contraction.
But Ifo economist Klaus Wohlrabe told Reuters: ""For the fourth quarter, we expect a slight expansion.""
Ifo's index on current conditions fell to 97.8 from 98.6 in September. But its expectations index rose to 91.5 from 90.9.
Germany's export-reliant economy has been suffering from slower global growth and business uncertainty caused by U.S. President Donald Trump's 'America First' trade policies and Britain's planned, but delayed, exit from the European Union.
""The uncertainty stemming from Brexit remains high,"" Wohlrabe said, but added: ""The downward trend in industry has stopped for the time being.""
German sportswear group Puma (DE:PUMG) said on Thursday it would take a hit from U.S. tariffs on China in the fourth quarter but still raised its sales forecast.

The consumer sentiment indicator, published by the Nuremberg-based GfK institute and based on a survey of around 2,000 Germans, fell to 9.6 going into November, the lowest reading since November 2016.
The reading was lower than the 9.8 forecast in a Reuters poll. The October reading was revised down to 9.8 from a previously reported 9.9.
Trade conflicts and fears that Britain could crash out of the European Union without an agreement have contributed to a recession among Germany's export-dependent manufacturers, and the slowdown is starting to spread to services.
Europe's largest economy, which has been mainly relying on consumption and state spending for growth, is expected to dip into recession in the third quarter.
Chancellor Angela Merkel's coalition of conservatives and Social Democrats (SPD) has resisted calls for a stimulus package despite signs that the job market is weakening and fears that the auto industry will shed thousands of jobs.
""These events have dampened the mood of consumers again and optimism is dwindling,"" GfK researcher Rolf Buerkl said in a statement.
""Nevertheless, private consumption will remain an important pillar for the German economy this year – assuming that the current crises do not escalate further and both policy and the economy counter the rising fear of job losses.""
GfK said a sub-index measuring economic expectations fell to its lowest since December 2012, as consumers fear that a global slowdown could hit exports and spell more hardship for manufacturers.
German carmakers, which are struggling to adapt to tougher emissions standards and spending billions on a shift to electric cars, could be hit most by a worsening of the global economy, GfK added.
""Several automobile manufacturers as well as their suppliers have already announced redundancies,"" it said. ""This loss of jobs at car manufacturers will be further intensified in future by the forthcoming transition to electro-mobility.""
Consumers, however, maintained a relatively high inclination to buy, GfK said, suggesting that the economic downturn was not discouraging Germans from taking their wallets out.
The European Central Bank kept the door open for even more stimulus on Thursday, with inflation in the euro zone still less than half the central bank's target and growth barely holding in positive territory.
The bank's easy-money policy and record-low interest rates will continue to encourage usually frugal Germans to spend instead of stacking their cash in bank accounts that yield no interest, which should keep supporting German growth."

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - New orders for key U.S.-made capital goods fell more than expected in September and shipments also declined, a sign that business investment remains soft amid the fallout from the U.S.-China trade war but other data on Thursday showed the spat has yet to have much effect on the overall jobs market.
The Commerce Department said orders for non-defense capital goods excluding aircraft, which are seen as a measure of business spending plans on equipment, fell 0.5% last month on less demand for transportation equipment, motor vehicles and parts, and computers and electronic products.
The auto sector was bruised by an ongoing strike at General Motors (NYSE:GM). The United Auto Workers union reached a tentative agreement with the Detroit automaker last week on a new four-year-contract but members remain off work until they finish voting on the proposal this Friday. 
Data for August was also revised down to show core capital goods orders falling 0.6% instead of declining 0.4% as previously reported. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast core capital goods orders dipping 0.2% in September.
""The data are volatile, but through the volatility, trends have slowed significantly,"" said Jim O'Sullivan, an economist at High Frequency Economics. U.S. Treasury prices rose following the report while U.S. stocks were little changed.
Core capital goods orders increased 1.0% on a yearly basis while shipments of such goods dropped 0.7% last month. Core capital goods shipments are used to calculate equipment spending in the government's gross domestic product measurement. Shipments for August were flat after being revised from a previously reported 0.3% gain.
The U.S. Federal Reserve has cut interest rates twice this year and investors currently see another reduction in borrowing costs when policymakers meet next week as the economy grapples with the headwinds from more than a year of U.S.-China tit-for-tat tariffs and slowing global growth.
The manufacturing sector, which makes up about 11% of the U.S. economy, has been hobbled by the trade dispute, which has hurt business confidence and investment, and cast a cloud of uncertainty over the economic outlook.
U.S. manufacturing output fell more than expected in September, Fed data showed last week while business investment fell at a 1.0% annualized rate last quarter, the biggest drop since the fourth quarter of 2015, the government reported last month.
Earlier this month, U.S. President Donald Trump outlined the first phase of a deal to end the trade war with China and suspended a threatened tariff hike, but officials on both sides said much more work needed to be done before an accord could be agreed.
Overall orders for durable goods, items ranging from toasters to aircraft that are meant to last three years or more, declined 1.1% in September after edging up a revised 0.3% in the prior month. Orders for non-defense aircraft and parts were hit hardest, slumping 11.8%, due to ongoing problems at Boeing (NYSE:BA).
LABOR MARKET STRENGTH
There were few signs, however, that the weakness was spreading to the jobs market. The number of Americans filing applications for unemployment benefits unexpectedly fell last week, pointing to a still-tight jobs market even as hiring and economic growth has slowed.
Initial claims for state unemployment benefits declined 6,000 to a seasonally adjusted 212,000 for the week ended Oct. 19, the Labor Department said on Thursday. Data for the prior week was revised to show 4,000 more claims than previously reported.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast claims edging higher to 215,000 in the latest week. The Labor Department said no states had claims estimated last week.
The overall decrease was despite the General Motors strike. While striking workers are not eligible for unemployment benefits, the work stoppage has affected production, impacting non-striking employees at suppliers.
The four-week moving average of initial claims, considered a better gauge of labor market trends as it irons out week-to-week volatility, declined 750 to 215,000 last week.
Elsewhere, the Commerce Department reported on Thursday sales of new U.S. single-family homes dipped in September as low inventories continue to weigh on sales even as prices saw the biggest monthly fall in five years. 
Sales declined 0.7% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 701,000 units last month, matching expectations, but sales were still up 15.5% from a year ago. August's sales pace was revised down to 706,000 units from the previously reported 713,000 units. 

New home sales, which comprise about 11.5% of housing market sales, are drawn from permits and tend to be volatile on a month-to-month basis.

The housing market has had mixed fortunes this year despite would-be homebuyers being bolstered by a reduction in interest rates. The Federal Reserve has lowered borrowing costs twice this year to offset headwinds caused by a more than year-long trade war between the United States and China, and slowing global growth.
The 30-year fixed mortgage rate has dropped more than 125 basis points since last November's peak to an average of 3.69%, according to data from mortgage finance agency Freddie Mac.
A report last week showed single-family home construction rose for a fourth straight month, and building permits also increased. But the housing market continues to struggle with a dearth of properties for sale and annual price growth that has been outpacing wage gains.
Sales of previously owned homes also fell in September as rising prices hurt sales, particularly in the lower-price end of the market, data on Tuesday showed.
New home sales in the South, which accounts for the majority of transactions, edged down 0.2% in September. Sales in the West dropped 3.8%. In the Northeast, sales fell 2.8% but there was a jump of 6.3% in the Midwest.
There were 321,000 new homes on the market last month, down 0.6% from August. At September's sales pace it would take 5.5 months to clear the supply of houses on the market, unchanged from August.

298,By Bloomberg,"<span>Oct 24, 2019 04:48AM ET</span>","Indonesia Cuts Key Rate Again, Says Future Moves Depend on Data","(Bloomberg) -- Indonesia’s central bank cut its key interest rate for a fourth straight month amid a deteriorating outlook for global growth, saying any further moves would depend on incoming economic data.
Bank Indonesia lowered the seven-day reverse repurchase rate by 25 basis points to 5% Thursday, as predicted by 23 out of 30 economists surveyed by Bloomberg. The rest had forecast no change.
“The decision is in line with an inflation estimate that remains under control and investment yields that remain attractive, also as a pre-emptive step to push the domestic economy amid a slowing global economy,” Governor Perry Warjiyo told reporters in Jakarta.
While the bank’s policy stance remains generally accommodative, its future course will “be data dependent from one month to another,” he said.
Thursday’s easing comes after the International Monetary Fund revised down its forecast for global growth and cut its 2019 projection for Indonesia to 5% from 5.2% in July. Despite signs of an impending deal between the U.S. and China, the trade war between the two behemoths is continuing to weigh on Indonesia’s economy, which grew at its slowest pace in two years in the second quarter.
Supporting Growth
“The move to cut rates again is aimed at supporting the growth momentum in the face of slowing retail sales, falling automotive sales and sluggish investment,” said Josua Pardede, an economist at PT Bank Permata in Jakarta. “Depending on GDP growth in the third quarter of this year, we think the room for another BI policy rate cut is still open in the following months.”
Bank Indonesia raised interest rates by 175 basis points last year as it battled an emerging-market rout that was pressuring Indonesia’s currency, but this year its focus has shifted to supporting growth.
The Jakarta Composite Index was up 1% as of 3:12 p.m. local time, but didn’t move much on the decision. The rupiah, which has gained 2.5% against the dollar this year, fell 0.1% to 14,045 per dollar after the decision. Yields on 10-year government bonds pared an earlier drop and were little changed on the day at 7.08%.
Gareth Leather, a senior Asia economist at Capital Economics, said the likelihood of rising global risk aversion -- which could scare investors away from emerging-market currencies like the rupiah -- might limit Bank Indonesia’s options going forward.
“Given Indonesia’s high level of foreign currency debt, we doubt the central bank would want to cut aggressively” in such a scenario, Leather said.
Forecasts Stable
Indonesian policy makers remain comfortable with a relatively subdued inflation environment that has allowed them to lower borrowing costs since July. Consumer prices rose 3.39% in September from a year ago, well within Bank Indonesia’s target band of 2.5%-4.5% for this year.
The bank kept its economic forecasts broadly unchanged from last month:
Gross domestic product growth is seen below the midpoint of the 5%-5.4% forecast range, and is set to move toward the midpoint of a 5.1%-5.5% range for 2020Inflation this year will likely come in below the midpoint of the 2.5%-4.5% target range, and stay within the 2%-4% range in 2020The current-account deficit should be around 2.5%-3% of GDP this year and next“BI’s rate cut today was no surprise given the combination of sluggish growth, benign inflation and a reasonably stable” rupiah, said Krystal Tan, an economist at Australia & New Zealand Banking Group Ltd. in Singapore. “As long as external stability is maintained, the bias is probably toward a deeper easing cycle.”"

IHS Markit’s Composite Purchasing Managers’ Index rose to 50.2 in October, missing economist estimates of 50.3. The reading above 50 -- a level that divides expansion from contraction -- signals that the private sector in the euro area is barely growing at the start of the fourth quarter.
The outlook is gloomy, with future expectations sinking to its worst since 2013, according to Markit. A rebound in French services provided a boost while the pace of German decline slowed, while the rest of the region showed weakness.
A key divergence between France and Germany remained trade, with the former seeing modest growth in new business from abroad, while Germany’s exports remained in steep decline.
European Central Bank President Mario Draghi is presiding over his last policy meeting on Thursday, and is expected give a further rallying cry for governments to turn on the spending taps to bolster growth. He hands over the top job to Christine Lagarde next month.
“ Mario Draghi’s tenure at the helm of the ECB ends on a note of near-stalled GDP, slower jobs growth, near-stagnant prices and growing pessimism,” said Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit. That is “piling pressure on Christine Lagarde to drive new solutions to the euro zone’s renewed malaise.”"

Markit's flash Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) survey showed that the slight fall in employment was mainly the result of job losses in the manufacturing sector, where staffing numbers fell to their lowest level in almost 10 years.
The slowdown in Germany's export-dependent manufacturing sector, in recession due to trade conflicts and uncertainties linked to Britain's planned departure from the European Union, is leaving a bigger mark on services, the survey also showed.
Job creation in the services sector fell to its lowest level in 3-1/2 years, IHS Markit said.
""Hopes of a return to growth in Germany in the final quarter have been somewhat dashed by the PMI numbers, which show business activity in the euro zone's largest economy contracting further and underlying demand continuing to soften,"" said Phil Smith, principle economist at IHS Markit.
""Manufacturing remains the main weak link, though here there are some signs of encouragement with rates of decline in production and new orders easing and business confidence improving to a four-month high,"" he added.
IHS Markit's flash composite PMI, which tracks the manufacturing and services sectors that together account for more than two-thirds of the economy, rose to a two-month high reading of 48.6, from 48.5 in September.
The reading was below the 48.8 consensus forecast in a Reuters poll of economists and remained below the 50 mark that separates growth from contraction for the second consecutive month.
The flash manufacturing PMI remained in contraction territory at 41.9, slightly higher than September's 10-year low reading of 41.7.
The flash services PMI by contrast fell to a 37-month low of 51.2 from 51.4 in September, as new business in the sector fell at the fastest pace since June 2013, IHS Markit said.
The German economy is expected to contract for the second successive quarter in the July-September period, which would mean a technical recession.
The government expects the economy to grow by 0.5% this year and has cut its economic growth forecast for 2020 to 1%. It has resisted calls for a stimulus package to reverse the slowdown, saying the economy is not facing a crisis.
Economists say the forecasts do not factor in a possible escalation in the trade conflict between the United States and the EU and are based on the scenario that Britain will leave the bloc in an orderly manner.
If any of those risks becomes reality, the outlook for Germany would be grimmer, they say."

PARIS (Reuters) - French business activity picked up more than expected in October, boosted mainly by a firmer service sector but also by resilient manufacturing, a monthly survey showed on Thursday.
Data compiler IHS Markit said its preliminary composite purchasing managers index rose to 52.6 points from 50.8 last month, topping economists' average estimate for 51.0.
The unexpectedly strong improvement brought the index further away from the key 50-point threshold, demarcating an expansion from a contraction in business.
The improvement was driven by the dominant service sector where the index rose to 52.9 from 51.1, easily beating expectations for 51.6.
Meanwhile, the manufacturing sector, which is more exposed to the fortunes of international trade, improved unexpectedly, rising to 50.5 from 50.1 and defying economists' expectations for a retreat to 50.3.
The service sector saw a pick up in new business, in a sign of firm demand in the domestic French economy, which has so far held up well despite the global slowdown in the face of international trade tensions.
""The data are consistent with the continuation of solid gains in both official economic output and employment heading into the end of the year,"" IHS Markit economist Eliot Kerr said.
The euro zone's second-biggest economy has managed to maintain a largely steady growth rate so far this year thanks to an improving labor market and government measures like tax breaks to boost households' income after a series of violent protests.
However, the upbeat PMI data contrasted with a separate survey from the INSEE official statistics agency, which found on Wednesday that industry morale fell to its lowest level this month since March 2015."

Japan’s factory activity fell to the lowest level in three years, adding to concerns over the impact of a delayed pickup in the global economy as the Bank of Japan concludes a review on the economy and inflation next week.
The Jibun Bank Manufacturing Purchasing Managers Index fell to 48.5 in October, the lowest level since June 2016, as new orders dropped at the fastest pace in nearly seven years. A number below 50 indicates a contraction.
A sharp fall in the service sector index to 50.3 is another cause concern. Recent growth in Japan’s economy has been heavily reliant on resilience outside Japan’s factory gates.
Joe Hayes, an economist at IHS Markit which compiles the survey, flagged a recent typhoon that disrupted supply chains and a sales tax that may have front-loaded activity as temporary factors that could be overstating the weakness seen in the survey.
“Japan’s economy hit a widely-expected bump in October following the consumption tax increase which took effect during the month,” Hayes said. “The latest data suggests the service sector is going to have a lot of slack to account for.”"

South Korea’s economy grew at a slower pace in the third quarter, putting it on track for the smallest expansion since the global financial crisis as trade uncertainties weigh on investment.
Gross domestic product increased 0.4% from the previous quarter, the Bank of Korea said in a statement, compared with an estimate by economists of 0.5%. From a year earlier, the economy expanded 2%, as projected in a Bloomberg survey.
While exports rose in the quarter, improving from the sharp falls seen at the beginning of the year, the extended run of export weakness and doubts about the strength of overall growth are weighing on investment. Concerns over weakening investment provide another reason for the government and central bank to continue bolstering their support for the economy.
Following the BOK’s rate cut last week to support prices and growth, Governor Lee Ju-yeol said the effects of the trade war would likely trim South Korea’s economic growth by 0.4 percentage point this year.
That leaves the economy needing a sharp acceleration in the last three months of 2019 to stop growth from falling below 2%. An expansion of almost 1% in the fourth quarter will be needed to achieve that, with annual growth of 1.8% more likely, according to Cho Yong-gu, a fixed-income strategist at Shinyoung Securities.
The improvement in exports, which grew 4.1% in real terms from the second quarter, indicates that weakness in the global tech sector may be over the worst. The BOK noted growth in semiconductor and car shipments compared with the previous three months.
“There are some signs of a recovery in exports,” Cho said. “But the trade war has clearly taken a toll on shipments and falling exports have led to a slump in facilities investment.”
Governor Lee acknowledged the likelihood of growth falling below 2% in parliament after the release of the GDP data. With interest rates already at a record low Lee said the government’s fiscal policy had a role to play in boosting growth in the fourth quarter. Lee has said there’s no need for non-conventional policy support yet, though the central bank is looking at its options.
Bank of Korea in Easing Mode Spurs Speculation QE May Be Needed
President Moon Jae-in said earlier this week that an expansionary fiscal policy was essential over the coming year, given the economy’s “grave situation” amid the spread of trade protectionism.
Still, some economists said the central bank would have to keep playing its part as the government ramps up spending to prop up growth and prices, which recently began to fall.
“South Korea is where the world confirms the impact of the U.S.-China trade war on economic growth,” said Lee Sang-jae, chief economist for Eugene Investment & Securities. The problem for Korea is that because its small economy is so open to global trends, the power of fiscal policy is more limited than in other less export-reliant economies.
“Deflationary trends are growing chronic and the BOK faces a choice like other global central banks to pursue an aggressive monetary policy,” he said.
What Bloomberg’s Economists Say
“South Korea’s stepped-up policy support failed to offset downward pressure on the economy in 3Q from the U.S.-China trade war. A drop in investment and drag from net exports weighed on growth, while consumption slowed. We expect more policy support to shield the economy from external risks -- with fiscal policy taking the lead as the Bank of Korea’s policy ammunition runs low.”--Justin Jimenez, Bloomberg EconomicsClick here to read the report

304,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 23, 2019 07:51PM ET</span>",UK employers plan to rein in pay rises in 2020: XpertHR,"LONDON (Reuters) - British employers plan to scale back their pay rises for staff next year, an industry survey showed on Thursday, suggesting overall earnings growth is likely to slow from its current 11-year high.
Human resources data company XpertHR said the 123 private-sector employers it surveyed expect to offer a median 2.1% annual pay settlement between now and the end of August 2020, compared with an average 2.5% over the past 12 months.
""While the strong labour market continues to put pressure on employers to raise wages, other costs and an uncertain outlook could well mean lower pay rises for employees,"" XpertHR analyst Sheila Attwood said.
Average wage growth - which usually exceeds pay settlements, due to the effect of promotions and job changes - rose to an 11-year high of 3.9% according to official figures for the three months to July, before slowing slightly in August.
Unemployment is also close to its lowest since the mid-1970s at 3.9%, but there was an unexpectedly sharp fall in hiring in the three months to August, raising concerns that the slowdown in the rest of the economy is spreading to the job market.
The Bank of England is watching pay pressures closely - as well as the Brexit process - as it assesses whether it should change interest rates.
The British Retail Consortium said in a separate report on Thursday that a long-term decline in the number of retail jobs had continued into the third quarter, though more firms planned to add seasonal staff in the run-up to Christmas than in 2018.
""Weak consumer demand and Brexit uncertainty continue to put pressure on retailers already focused on delivering the transformation taking place in the industry,"" BRC chief executive Helen Dickinson said.
Manufacturers surveyed by the Confederation of British Industry said earlier this week that they faced unprecedented political uncertainty, and that the outlook for orders and new hiring was the weakest since 2009.
Parliament has refused to fast-track approval of a new Brexit deal negotiated by Prime Minister Boris Johnson.
XpertHR said concerns about Brexit and profits were the main factors pushing down on the pay that businesses were willing to offer, while staff retention and a desire to keep pay rates competitive were putting upward pressure on pay."

Canadian wholesales fell 1.2% in August, Statistics Canada reported Wednesday from Ottawa. That missed the 0.3% gain that economists surveyed by Bloomberg were expecting.
Decreases were widespread, with five of seven subsectors declining. Stripping out price effects, wholesale volumes fell 1.3% from July.
Machinery and equipment fell for the second month in a row, leading declines and falling 2.6% in August. Construction, forestry, mining, and industrial machinery and equipment were the main downside contributors. A continued slowdown in these sectors may be worrying signal when it comes to the investment outlook in Canada.
Wholesale inventories also fell for the first time in a year, down 0.3% in August. Still, the inventory-to-sales ratio ticked up to 1.45, remaining at one of the highest levels since the early 1990s -- a possible risk to future growth prospects.

306,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 23, 2019 04:40AM ET</span>",French industry morale at 4 1/2-year low as trade tensions bite,"By Leigh Thomas
PARIS (Reuters) - French industry morale fell unexpectedly in October to its lowest level since early 2015 as France and its European partners became the latest target of U.S. trade actions, a monthly survey showed on Wednesday.
Until now France's industrial sector had resisted a slowdown that has hit German industry particularly hard as it is far more dependent on exports.
However, France found itself this month dragged into the middle of global trade frictions as Washington prepared to hit a range of European Union goods with tariffs after winning WTO clearance in a long-running dispute over Airbus subsidies.
France's INSEE official statistics agency said its index of industrial morale dropped to 99 points this month from 102 in September, hitting the lowest level since March 2015.
It also fell markedly short of expectations for an average reading of 102, with estimates in a Reuters poll of 18 economists ranging from 103 to 101.
INSEE said its overall index of business confidence fell marginally to 105 points from 106 in September, comfortably above the long-term average of 100.
While industry morale plunged, the index in the service sector, which is much less exposed to the vagaries of international trade, was steady at 106.
""The trade war is clearly weighing on business sentiment, and the new tariffs against some French products are a negative in that respect,"" said Gilles Pradere, senior fixed income manager at Geneva-based firm RAM Active Investments. 
""But there are certainly other factors at play such as the transition in the auto sector due to new regulations and a slowing Chinese economy,"" he added.
Despite warnings from Paris that the EU would retaliate, the United States on Friday pressed ahead with 10% tariffs on Airbus planes, which are one of France's biggest exports and support a network of suppliers across the country. 
Washington also levied 25% duties on a range of products, including French wine, Scottish whisky and cheeses from across Europe.

While Germany's industrial slump has pushed Europe's biggest economy to the brink of recession, France's economy has so far held up well, boosted by strong demand at home thanks to an improving job market and purchasing power gains for consumers.

The companies signed up for $10 billion in new loans, leases and lines of credit last month, up from $8.5 billion a year earlier. Borrowings rose 9% from the previous month.
""Consumer spending continues to fuel the economy, notwithstanding signs of caution and concern raised by some over the impact of trade frictions with China, a pull-back in the U.S. manufacturing sector and recent geopolitical events in Syria, Hong Kong and elsewhere,"" ELFA Chief Executive Officer Ralph Petta said in a statement.
Washington-based ELFA, which reports economic activity for the $1 trillion equipment finance sector, said credit approvals totaled 76.3%, down from 76.6% in August.
ELFA's leasing and finance index measures the volume of commercial equipment financed in the United States. It is designed to complement the U.S. Commerce Department's durable goods orders report, which it typically precedes by a few days.
The index is based on a survey of 25 members that include Bank of America Corp (N:BAC), BB&T Corp (N:BBT), CIT Group Inc (N:CIT) and the financing affiliates or units of  Caterpillar  Inc (N:CAT), Dell Technologies Inc (N:DELL),  Siemens  AG (DE:SIEGn), Canon Inc (T:7751) and Volvo AB (ST:VOLVb).

308,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 22, 2019 11:39AM ET</span>",U.S. existing home sales drop more than expected in September,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. home sales fell more than expected in September as the market continues to struggle with a dearth of properties for sale, especially for cheaper homes.
The National Association of Realtors said on Tuesday that existing home sales fell 2.2% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.38 million units last month, reversing two straight months of gains. August's sales pace was upwardly revised to 5.50 million units.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast existing home sales declining 0.7% to 5.45 million units.
The U.S. Federal Reserve has cut interest rates twice this year, which has bolstered the housing market by lowering mortgage rates. Investors expect another interest rate cut when policymakers meet next week. 
The 30-year fixed mortgage rate has dropped more than 125 basis points since last November's peak to an average of 3.69%, according to data from mortgage finance agency Freddie Mac.
But home sales have seesawed for much of this year as a chronic lack of properties on the market has inflated prices, keeping them unaffordable for many would-be homeowners. Land and labor shortages have also crimped supply.
There were 1.83 million homes in the market last month, a decline of 2.7% compared to a year ago. It was the fourth consecutive month of year-on-year inventory declines.
Data last week showed homebuilding tumbled from a more than 12-year high in September, but single-family home construction rose for a fourth straight month.
The median existing house price increased 5.9% from a year ago to $272,100 in September, the strongest price appreciation since January 2018. It was the 91st consecutive month of year-on-year price gains.
""We had hoped price increases would be in line with wages...but that is not the case,"" said NAR Chief Economist Lawrence Yun.
Existing home sales rose 3.9% from one year ago, the NAR said. Sales fell across the nation's four regions last month. They dropped 3.1% in the Midwest and 2.8% in the Northeast. They declined 2.1% in the South and edged 0.9% lower in the West. 
At September's sales pace, it would take 4.1 months to clear the current inventory, down from 4.4 months a year ago. A supply of six to seven months is seen as a healthy balance between supply and demand.

310,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 22, 2019 07:23AM ET</span>",UK industry outlook weakest since 2009 on Brexit and world slowdown: CBI,"By David Milliken
LONDON (Reuters) - British manufacturers expect the most widespread drop-off in orders for a decade over the next three months due to the slowing global economy and Brexit uncertainty, a survey by the Confederation of British Industry showed on Tuesday.
The CBI said its quarterly expected orders balance sank to -19 in October from +10 in July, the lowest since April 2009, driven by a steep drop in orders expected from overseas.
Britain is due to leave the European Union on Oct. 31 if Prime Minister Boris Johnson can persuade parliament to rush through a new exit deal he negotiated last week, though a delay looks likely if lawmakers want more time for scrutiny.
On top of this, the trade conflict between the United States and China is hitting demand for exports far beyond those two countries' borders.
Factories said they expected their competitiveness to deteriorate at the fastest rate since the survey began more than 40 years ago, due to a record amount of political uncertainty and the biggest concern about trade barriers since 1983.
Economist Samuel Tombs of Pantheon Macroeconomics described the CBI data as ""dire"".
""Manufacturers appear to be experiencing the full force of the global downturn and aren't enjoying any relief this time from preparations ahead of the October Brexit deadline,"" he said.
In October alone, manufacturers reported the biggest fall in export demand since December 2009, during the depths of the financial crisis, while the overall orders balance for October sank to -37 from -28 in September, below all forecasts in a Reuters poll and its lowest since March 2010.
""A combination of Brexit uncertainty and weaker global growth are clearly hitting sentiment and export prospects, with job prospects at their weakest since the global financial crisis,"" CBI chief economist Rain Newton-Smith said.
The CBI data has not always matched subsequent official measures of industrial output, particularly at times when political turmoil has hit sentiment.
But it bodes poorly for business investment and hiring intentions.

Firms planned to scale back investment on the broadest basis since 2009, while hiring - which has held up well by comparison since 2016's Brexit referendum - is expected to be the weakest in a decade as well.

312,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 21, 2019 03:06AM ET</span>","China September home price growth flatlines, fewer cities see price gains","By Yawen Chen and Ryan Woo
BEIJING (Reuters) - New home prices in China grew at a steady pace in September, with fewer cities reporting price gains, a relief for policymakers who remain wary of high debt and bubble risk and are refraining from stimulating the sector as the economy cools.
The property sector has held up as one of the few bright spots in the world's second-largest economy with other parts hit as factories struggle to land new orders from abroad amid Beijing's bruising trade war with the United States. 
Average new home prices in China's 70 major cities rose 0.5% in September from August, when it also grew at the same pace -the slowest since February, Reuters calculated based on National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) data on Monday.
Home prices in September rose 8.4% from a year earlier, slowing from an 8.8% gain in August, and the slowest since September last year.
""A broad trend of slowdown in property price growth is emerging,"" said Zhang Dawei, an analyst with property agency Centaline.
Chinese regulators have vowed to refrain from stimulating the property sector as rapidly-growing household debt and rising home prices have deepened fears about a sudden market correction and concerns over housing affordability.
Property prices increased for the 53rd straight month. Most of the 70 cities surveyed by the NBS still reported monthly price increases for new homes in September, though the number was down to 53 from 55 in August.
Slower price gains are partly due to developers cutting prices to attract buyers in September just ahead of the week-long National Day holiday, a peak sales season, said Yan Yuejin, director of the Shanghai-based E-house China Research and Development Institution.
On Monday, the central bank surprised markets by keeping the new benchmark lending rate unchanged, suggesting Beijing is keen to avoid overly loosening monetary policy for fear it may push up already-high debt levels across the economy.
""To balance short-term growth stability against long-term financial risks, it has become increasingly evident that Beijing's new master plan features 'no flood of credit' and targeted monetary easing that excludes the property sector,"" Nomura analysts wrote in a note last Friday. 
The government has clamped down on speculative investment in the housing market since 2016 to prevent a sharp correction as prices soared. But Beijing has been careful to tread its policy line to defuse risk without triggering a market collapse. 
As local governments are given more autonomy in policymaking, price trends have been mixed, with some cities showing signs of rapid cooling while others are still plagued with overheating risks.
Some analysts have pointed to upside risks in some markets where regional governments have rushed to make it easier for out-of-towners to obtain local residency under the household registration system, which will allow them to overcome existing home purchase curbs on outside speculators.
Nanning, a city in southern China near the border with Vietnam, was the top price performer in the month, with prices increasing 2.1% on a monthly basis.
Centaline's Zhang noted ""whack-a-mole"" style tightening measures will likely continue at the city level, but if price trends start to falter, some loosening measures will also be introduced to cushion the economy.
""A price spike does not spell 'stability', neither does a drastic fall,"" he said.
MIXED SIGNS
While property investment stayed buoyant in September boosted by a rise in new construction activity, growth in property transactions slowed during what is traditionally China's ""Golden September"" peak season for new home sales. Sales were hurt by persistent pressures in the sector as a crackdown on speculators showed little signs of abating.
Economists noted some developers will likely ramp up sales promotion and slash prices towards the year-end to bolster their performance and secure revenues, though any sharp drop in home prices will not be tolerated by local governments. 
""The current pace of construction is not sustainable given underlying housing demand. Developers are now slowing the launch of new projects in response to tighter access to financing and subdued sales,"" analysts at Capital Economics said in a recent note. 
Beijing has been clamping down on domestic and onshore financing for the sector, and kept down-payment requirements high for individual buyers in major markets.
More recently, Chinese regulators have stepped up efforts to press banks to raise mortgage rates and rein in mortgage lending amid concerns about property prices and rising household debt.

Moody's said financially weak developers will face increased refinancing risks, although most rated Chinese developers will still maintain adequate liquidity despite tighter financing control.

The 10 biggest housing estates tracked by Centaline Property Agency Ltd. recorded 20 sales over the weekend, more than three times the weekend before. That’s despite violent protests that have rocked the former British colony now since June.
Separately, Sing Tao reported that China Evergrande Group’s Emerald Bay project in Tuen Mun received 1,100 applications, more than double the number of apartments available.
The government’s decision to allow first-time buyers to purchase more expensive homes with a downpayment of just 10% has boosted transactions, said Louis Chan, the CEO of Centaline’s residential division. “Buyers who have been adopting a wait-and-see attitude are worried that if they don’t buy now, homes will get pricier. So they speed up their purchases,” he said.
Secondary home transaction volumes have dropped since demonstrations against the now-withdrawn extradition bill began, while prices have slipped about 5%, data from Centaline show.
“The government’s decision to relax the loan-to-value ratio may help first-time buyers and upgraders who were previously only able to buy new flats because developers could offer financial benefits,” Joseph Tsang, chairman of Jones Lang LaSalle Inc. for Hong Kong, said. “With this change, buyers will shift to the secondary market, which offers plenty of potential stock and lower property prices.”"

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's exports contracted for a 10th straight month in September, adding to speculation the central bank could ease monetary policy as soon as next week to support an economy hit by a slowdown in global demand.
A bitter Sino-U.S. trade war and slowing growth in China have heightened the risks of a global recession, darkening the outlook for Japan's economy, the world's third-largest.
Exports in September slumped 5.2% from a year earlier, Ministry of Finance data showed on Monday, dragged down by car and airplane parts to the United States and semiconductor production equipment to South Korea.
The fall was larger than a 4.0% drop expected by economists and marked the longest run of declines in exports since a 14-month stretch from October 2015 to November 2016.
In volume terms, exports fell 2.3% in the year to September, the second consecutive month of declines.
The extended fall in exports comes after the government lowered its assessment of the economy on Friday, raising a warning flag over weakness in exports.
That, among other factors, has triggered calls from some Japanese policymakers the government is ready to take fiscal measures if extra economic support was needed.
""There is a possibility that there will be another fall in exports hereafter,"" said Yuichi Kodama, chief economist at Meiji Yasuda Life Insurance. 
""Though overall conditions are currently stable, it would become a factor for monetary easing if it did affect Japan's economy as a whole.""
Markets are rife with speculation the Bank of Japan could ease at its Oct. 30-31 meeting, after it said at its rate review last month it would take a more thorough look at whether rising overseas risks could derail Japan's fragile economic recovery.
The BOJ will ""certainly"" reduce short- to medium-term interest rates if it needed to ease monetary policy, Governor Haruhiko Kuroda told Reuters on Saturday.
By region, exports to China, Japan's biggest trading partner, slipped 6.7% year-on-year in September, down for the seventh month as shipments of auto parts declined, offsetting a rise in those of electronic chips for semiconductors.
Exports to Asia - which account for more than half of Japan's overall exports - dropped 7.8% in the year to September, falling for the 11th month, hurt by a 18.7% slide in semiconductor manufacturing parts, especially those to South Korea, which has been in a trade dispute with Japan.
Japan's exports to the United States fell 7.9% in the year to September, weighed down by reduced shipments of cars over 3000cc and aircraft motors and parts.
Imports from the United States slipped 11.6% in September, causing Japan's trade surplus with the world's top economy to narrow by 3.5% from a year earlier to 564.1 billion yen ($5.2 billion), the trade data showed.
Washington and Tokyo signed a limited trade deal last month that cuts tariffs on U.S. farm goods, Japanese machine tools and other products while further reducing the threat of higher U.S. car duties.
Japan's overall imports dropped 1.5% year-on-year, a smaller decline than the median estimate for a 2.8% decrease.
In volume terms, imports gained 6.8% which analysts said was largely because of front-load demand before a nationwide sales tax hike to 10% from 8% which kicked in at the start of this month.
""Going forward, imports are going to decline as consumption will be hurt"" by the tax hike, said Takeshi Minami, chief economist at Norinchukin Research Institute.
""The trade deficit is likely going to be reduced over the coming months.""

The trade balance came to a deficit of 123.0 billion yen, versus a 54.0 billion yen surplus seen by economists.

Exports during the first 20 days of October fell 20% from a year earlier, data from the Korea Customs Service showed Monday. Shipments to China, South Korea’s biggest trading partner, also dropped 20%.
South Korea’s exports plunge extends the gloomy outlook for the world economy after Japan’s exports dropped for a 10th month in September. Higher tariffs and uncertainties from the U.S.-China trade war have probably cut South Korea’s growth by 0.4 percentage point this year, Bank of Korea Governor Lee Ju-yeol said Oct. 18 in Washington.
Japan’s Exports Continue to Drop as Global Slowdown Weighs
The trade weakness is also hurting domestic demand and helped push South Korea’s consumer prices index below zero for the first time ever in September. With Asia’s fourth-biggest economy headed for the slowest expansion since the global financial crisis, the government is ramping up spending while the Bank of Korea last week cut interest rates for a second time this year to support growth.
The latest trade data indicates there’s no immediate sign of the outlook improving for the economy, despite a tentative truce in the U.S. and China trade war. Considering the difference in the number of working days, daily exports value fell 13.5% on average during the first 20 days of October from a year earlier, the data from the customs office show.
“The worst for exports may be over, but a meaningful rebound also appears challenging,” Angela Hsieh, an economist for  Barclays  (LON:BARC) Bank PLC, wrote in a report.
Semiconductor sales, which account for the largest share of exports, declined 29%. Overseas shipments of automobiles dropped 6.5%.
Overall imports fell 20% in the first 20 days of October from a year earlier. Exports to the U.S. slid 17%, while imports dropped 22%.
Shipments to Japan dropped 21%, while imports plummeted 30%. The two neighbors are embroiled in a trade spat linked to lingering disagreements over Japan’s colonial past.

317,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 20, 2019 08:51PM ET</span>",UK property asking prices show weakest October rise since 2008: Rightmove,"LONDON (Reuters) - Asking prices for British houses put on sale in October showed the smallest seasonal increase since the financial crisis, as all but the most determined sellers waited for greater certainty over Brexit, industry figures showed on Monday.
Rightmove said that the average asking price for homes sold via its website was 0.6% higher in October than in September, well below the average 1.6% rise seen for the time of year and the smallest increase since October 2008.
""With upward pricing power now pretty flat, some sellers who are motivated by maximizing their money seem to be holding back. They may be waiting for more certainty around both achieving their price aspirations and also the Brexit outcome,"" Rightmove director Miles Shipside said.
Average asking prices in October were 0.2% lower than in October 2018, compared with an annual rise of 0.2% in September.
Britain's housing market has slowed since June 2016's referendum on leaving the European Union, and official data last week - based on completed sales - showed annual house price growth of 1.3% in the year to August, up from a near seven-year low of 0.8% in July.
Consumers have become warier about making major purchases in general.
A quarterly survey of consumer sentiment by accountants Deloitte, also released on Monday, showed morale fell to its lowest since late 2018 in the third quarter of 2019, despite wages growing at their fastest rate in a decade.
""Up to now we have seen a slowdown everywhere but in the jobs market and in the consumer economy,"" Deloitte economist Ian Stewart said. ""A decline in consumer confidence this quarter, combined with a fall in official unemployment figures, show that the period of remarkable resilience ... is coming to an end."""

The country's gross domestic product contracted by 26.8% in the first quarter of 2019 with respect to the same period a year earlier, the bank said, part of an economic crisis that has forced more than 4 million people to leave the country.
The central bank stopped releasing basic economic indicators around four years ago, but this year has started doing so at irregular intervals.
The opposition-run congress, which began releasing its own economic indicators several years ago, said prices rose 23.5% in September. Generally, the legislature tends to report higher figures than the central bank.

The Teranet-National Bank Composite House Price Index, which measures changes for repeat sales of single-family homes, showed that prices rose 0.1% last month from August.
The gain was below the 21-year average of 0.2% for September but was the second straight month that the index was higher after correcting for seasonal pressure, said Marc Pinsonneault, a senior economist at National Bank of Canada.
The Bank of Canada said last month that activity in Canada's housing market has recovered more quickly than expected, helped by lower mortgage rates.
The Montreal market rose 1%, while the index for Ottawa-Gatineau was up 0.8%. In contrast, Vancouver's index fell 0.5%, the 14th straight month it was down, according to Pinsonneault.
Compared to the same month one year ago, the composite index gained 0.7%. That was much less than the rate of inflation but was the second straight month that the year-over-year increase accelerated, Pinsonneault said.

China’s economic growth in the third quarter slowed more than expected to 6.0% from last year, the National Bureau of Statistic reported. Analysts expected GDP to grow 6.1% year-on-year.
Meanwhile, industrial output gained 5.8% year-on-year in September, compared with a 5.0% growth expected by analysts.
Retail sales rose by 7.8% year-on-year, in line with expectations.
Fixed asset investment grew 5.4% year to date, also matching expectations.
“Momentum has been easing since the second half of 2018, driven by industrial weakness and moderating consumer demand,” said Li Wei, a senior economist at Standard Chartered, in a Bloomberg report.
“The protracted U.S.-China dispute, which now goes well beyond just trade, has hit the sentiment badly. More policy stimulus can be expected as growth is now on the brink of sliding below the official target.”
Other analysts said China’s economy could slow further. 
“Despite a stronger September, pressure on economic activity should intensify in the coming months,” said Julian Evans-Pritchard, senior China economist at Capital Economics.
“Cooling global demand will continue to weigh on exports, fiscal constraints mean that infrastructure spending will wane in the near-term and the recent boom in property construction looks set to unwind,” added in a note cited by CNBC.

Gross domestic product rose 6% in the July-September period from a year ago, the slowest pace since the early 1990s and weaker than the consensus forecast of 6.1%. Factory output rose 5.8% in September, retail sales expanded 7.8%, while investment gained 5.4% in the first nine months of the year.
Policy makers are allowing the world’s second-largest economy to drift lower as they seek to clean up the financial system and curb excessive credit growth. With a drop off in exports to the U.S. expected to continue as the trade war hits, the economy is likely to continue struggling as deflationary pressures hit company profits.
Even with the slowdown, year to date growth of 6.2% suggests the government can hit its 6% and 6.5% for 2019. Until now, officials have focused on limited, targeted measures such as reserve-ratio cuts and credit support, wary of expanding the nation’s already heavy debt load.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. homebuilding tumbled from more than a 12-year high in September, but single-family home construction rose for a fourth straight month, suggesting the housing market remains supported by lower mortgage rates even as the economy is slowing.
The moderation in economic growth was underscored by other data on Thursday showing manufacturing output falling last month and factory activity in the mid-Atlantic region decelerating in October. The economy is being constrained by a 15-month trade war between the United States and China, which has dented business sentiment and caused a drop in capital expenditures.
Ironically, manufacturing has borne the brunt of the trade tariffs, which the White House argues are necessary to protect industries from what it says is unfair foreign competition. Other parts of the economy are also starting to show cracks from the trade war, with retail sales dropping in September for the first time in seven months and services sector growth slowing.

Many economists expect the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates for the third time later this month to limit the drag on the economy from the trade war and keep the longest expansion on record, now in its 11th year, on track. 
""It inches them forward to taking out a little more insurance to help support the economy that continues to face the headwinds of reduced world trade from tariffs,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG in New York. 
Housing starts declined 9.4% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.256 million units last month as construction in the volatile multi-family housing segment dropped, the Commerce Department said. Data for August was revised higher to show homebuilding accelerating to a pace of 1.386 million units, which was the highest level since June 2007, instead of marching to a rate of 1.364 million units as previously reported.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast housing starts decreasing to a pace of 1.320 million units in September. Housing starts rose 1.6% on a year-on-year basis in September.
The housing market, the most sensitive sector to interest rates, has perked up in recent months as mortgage rates have plunged from last year's multi-year highs. 
But the sector, which accounts for about 3.1% of the economy, continues to be hampered by land and labor shortages. A survey on Wednesday showed confidence among homebuilders jumped to a more than 1-1/2-year high in October.
The 30-year fixed mortgage rate has dropped more than 135 basis points to an average of 3.57%, according to data from mortgage finance agency Freddie Mac. 
Economists expect a mild rebound in residential investment in the third quarter after it contracted for six straight quarters, the longest such stretch since the 2007-2009 recession.
Single-family homebuilding, which accounts for the largest share of the housing market, rose 0.3% to a rate of 918,000 units in September, the highest level since January. Starts for the volatile multi-family housing segment plunged 28.2% to a rate of 338,000 units in September.
U.S. financial markets were little moved by the data as investors focused on news that Britain had clinched an eleventh-hour deal on its exit from the European Union. The dollar weakened against a basket of currencies, while stocks on Wall Street rose. U.S. Treasury prices fell.

LAYOFFS REMAIN LOW
In a separate report on Thursday, the Fed said manufacturing production fell 0.5% last month as a strike by about 48,000 workers at General Motors (N:GM) hammered motor vehicle output. Production at factories increased 0.6% in August.
Excluding motor vehicles, manufacturing output dropped 0.2% after surging 0.7% in August.
Manufacturing has also been hurt by an inventory glut, especially in the automobile sector, and design troubles at Boeing (N:BA). The fading boost from last year's $1.5 trillion tax cut package is also compounding manufacturing's woes.
Though President Donald Trump announced a temporary truce in the trade war last Friday, which delayed additional tariffs that were due this month, economists saw little change in fortunes at factories without all import duties being rolled back. 
Manufacturing production rebounded at a 1.1% rate in the third quarter after declining for two straight quarters. While the increase in the so-called hard data could offer hope that the manufacturing downturn could be close to an end, factory surveys, which are considered leading indicators, remain weak. 
""As we would not expect this disconnect to last for long, there remains a downside risk that hard data could weaken further,"" said Veronica Clark, an economist at Citi in New York. 
In a third report, the Philadelphia Fed said its business conditions index for the region that covers eastern Pennsylvania, southern New Jersey and Delaware fell to a reading of 5.6 in October from 12.0 in September. 
The survey's measures of new orders and employment rose. Its six-month business conditions index jumped to a reading of 33.8 this month from 20.8 in September. The survey's six-month capital expenditures index increased to 36.4 from a reading of 25.9 in the prior month.
Despite the slowing economy, companies are holding on to their workers. In a fourth report, the Labor Department said initial claims for state unemployment benefits increased 4,000 to a seasonally adjusted 214,000 for the week ended Oct. 12.
Last week's claims data covered the survey period for the nonfarm payrolls component of October's employment report.
Claims rose 4,000 between the September and October survey period, suggesting little change in the moderate pace of job growth this month. But the General Motors strike could weigh on payrolls in October.
Striking workers, who did not receive a paycheck during the payrolls survey period, are counted as unemployed. GM and the United Auto Workers union reached a tentative deal on Wednesday to end the month-long strike. 
""The claims data may be sending an overly optimistic signal about the upcoming October payroll report,"" said Daniel Silver, an economist at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) in New York. ""The near 50,000 workers that have been on strike recently likely will be removed from the October payroll count.""

324,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 17, 2019 09:31AM ET</span>","U.S. manufacturing production falls in September, hurt by GM strike","WASHINGTON, (Reuters) - U.S. manufacturing output fell more than expected in September, hampered by a strike at General Motors (NYSE:GM), and the outlook for factories remained weak amid slowing global growth and unresolved trade tensions.
The Federal Reserve said on Thursday that manufacturing production fell 0.5% last month after an upwardly revised 0.6% rise in August. Excluding motor vehicles and parts, overall industrial production and manufacturing output still fell 0.2%.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast manufacturing output would decline 0.2% and industrial output would slip 0.1% in September. Production at factories dropped 0.9% in September on a year-on-year basis.
The Fed's measure of the industrial sector comprises manufacturing, mining, and electric and gas utilities. Industrial output declined 0.4% in September after an upwardly revised gain of 0.8% in August as a result of the manufacturing softness and drop in mining production.
The manufacturing sector, which makes up about 11% of the U.S. economy, has been weakened by a 15-month trade war between the United States and China, which has hurt business confidence and investment.
A separate survey of the sector released earlier this month showed manufacturing activity fell to a 10-year low in September as trade tensions weighed on exports.
U.S. President Donald Trump last Friday outlined the first phase of a deal to end the trade war with China and suspended a threatened tariff hike, but officials on both sides said much more work needed to be done before an accord could be agreed.
With overall output declining, the percentage of industrial capacity in use decreased 0.4 percentage point to 77.5 in September from an unrevised 77.9 in August."

Initial claims for state unemployment benefits increased 4,000 to a seasonally adjusted 214,000 for the week ended Oct. 12, the Labor Department said on Thursday. Data for the prior week was unrevised.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast claims rising to 215,000 in the latest week. The Labor Department said claims for Maryland, New York, Virginia and Puerto Rico were estimated last week because of Monday's Columbus Day holiday.
The four-week moving average of initial claims, considered a better measure of labor market trends as it irons out week-to-week volatility, rose 1,000 to 214,750 last week.
Employers are hanging on to their workers as the pool of qualified workers continues to shrink. Despite the low layoffs, the labor market is losing momentum also as demand for labor cools, especially in manufacturing, in line with slowing economic growth.
The Federal Reserve said in its Beige Book report on Wednesday that labor market tightness was widely cited as a factor restraining hiring. The U.S. central bank also noted that ""a number of districts reported that manufacturers reduced their headcounts because orders were soft.""
A 15-month trade war between the United States and China has weighed on business confidence, undercutting capital expenditure and pushing manufacturing into recession.
Though President Donald Trump announced a truce in the U.S.-China trade war last Friday, which delayed additional tariffs that were due this month, economists say the longest economic expansion on record remained in danger without all import duties being rolled back. The fading stimulus from last year's $1.5 trillion tax cut package is also restraining growth.

Consumer spending has been the biggest driver of British economic growth since June 2016's referendum to leave the European Union, but there have been increasing signs that this is starting to soften.
Monthly retail sales volumes were flat in September and annual sales growth picked up to 3.1% from a weak 2.6% in August, the Office for National Statistics said on Thursday - slightly less of a recovery than economists had forecast in a Reuters poll.
Looking at the third quarter as a whole, which strips out monthly volatility, quarterly sales growth held steady at 0.6% while the annual pace of expansion dropped to 3.1% from 3.6%, the weakest growth since the final quarter of 2018.
""Food shops bounced back after a weak few months, but there was yet more bad news for department stores, with sales continuing to fall in September,"" ONS statistician Rhian Murphy said.
Some retailers also said bad weather had hurt demand too, the ONS added.
Sales in the 'non-specialized stores' category - which includes department stores - dropped by an annual 2.0% in the third quarter, the biggest decline since the first three months of 2009 when Britain was mired in recession.
The figures chime to a degree with a British Retail Consortium survey that showed the biggest fall in retail spending of any September since at least the mid-1990s.
In recent months, surveys by the BRC and Confederation of British Industry have painted a weaker picture of the retail sector than subsequent official data - in part due to the former focusing more on large high-street chains.
The ONS data has a broader sample that includes more online and small retailers, though it too is frequently volatile on a monthly basis.
The ONS's measure of retail spending showed annual sales growth slowing to 3.5% in the third quarter from 4.1% in the second quarter, its weakest growth rate in more than three years.
Until recently consumers appeared to have largely taken Brexit in their stride, helped by weaker inflation and stronger growth in wages which are rising at the fastest pace in more than a decade.
That has aided the world's fifth-biggest economy at a time when many companies have been cutting back on investment because of uncertainty about Brexit.
But there have been signs that consumers are turning more cautious as Britain's political crisis drags on.
Several British retailers, including supermarkets Asda (N:WMT) and Morrisons (L:MRW) and home improvement group  Kingfisher  (L:KGF), have highlighted the drag of Brexit uncertainty on bigger ticket sales.
But clothing retailer  Next  (L:NXT) attributed a disappointing start to autumn trading to unusually warm weather in parts of Britain, rather than shoppers holding back on buying new items because of Brexit."

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australian employment boasted another solid gain in September while the jobless rate dipped for the first time in seven months as fewer people went looking for work, a tentative hint of a much-needed tightening in the labor market.
The local dollar blipped up a quarter of a cent to $0.6783 after Thursday's data showed 14,700 net new jobs were added in September, matching forecasts. Full-time positions made up all the gains with a rise of 26,200.
That helped nudge the jobless rate down a tick to 5.2%, from a one-year peak of 5.3%, the first drop since February when it got as low as 4.9%.
The improvement will be welcome news to the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) which has sought to revive the economy by cutting interest rates three times this year to a record low of 0.75%.
Yet the jobless rate still remains well above the RBA's aspirational goal of 4.5%, and further declines would likely be needed to lessen the case for more stimulus.
RBA Deputy Governor Guy Debelle in a speech earlier on Thursday cautioned that a downturn in home building had been a larger drag on the economy and jobs than first expected and was set to get worse before it got better. [S9N23B02F]
""The RBA will breathe a sigh of relief after the unemployment rate dipped,"" said Marcel Thieliant, an economist at Capital Economics. ""But employment surveys point to jobs growth slowing and we expect unemployment to reach 5.5% by early next year.""
""We expect the RBA to cut interest rates to 0.5% in December.""
The futures market implies around a 20% chance of a cut in November, rising to 60% by December.
SO MANY WORKERS
The RBA's own forecasts are for unemployment to be at 5% or higher right out to late-2021, a major reason the bank's board dismissed arguments against a move when it cut rates earlier this month.
""Members noted that the strong demand for labor had been met by an equally strong increase in supply,"" minutes of the meeting released this week showed.
""Almost all of the strength in employment growth over the preceding three years had been matched by higher participation, so there had been little progress on reducing unemployment.""
Indeed, jobs growth ran at a rapid 2.5% in the year to September, well above the latest U.S. performance of 1.4%, yet participation was also near record peaks at 66.1%.
Add in those who wanted to work more hours, and the underutilization rate was a still-high 13.5%.
This phenomenon is partly the government's work. Policies to extend child care and disability payments have helped boost the share of females in the workforce to all-time peaks.
The conservative government of Prime Minister Scott Morrison has also kept the doors wide open to skilled migration, with net arrivals running at 300,000 in the year to August and almost matching the entire increase in net new jobs in Australia."
330,By Bloomberg,"<span>Oct 16, 2019 11:25PM ET</span>",China Office Vacancies Reach Decade High on Slowing Economy,"(Bloomberg) --
China’s deepening economic slowdown and a glut of supply has pushed the nation’s office vacancy rate to the highest since at least 2008.
The vacancy rate in 17 major cities climbed to 21.5% in the third quarter, according to  CBRE  Group Inc (NYSE:CBRE). The “spike” in vacancies this year is the worst since the depths of the global financial crisis a decade ago, said Sam Xie, the firm’s head of research in China.
China’s office market is being buffeted by a confluence of forces, driving vacancy rates to the highest among global business centers. Overseas companies are waiting for an end to hostilities in the U.S. trade war before committing to new leases; skyscrapers built during the boom years are unleashing a wave of supply; and cost-conscious tenants are moving to cheaper buildings as the economy slows.
In Lujiazui on the banks of Shanghai’s Pudong River -- one of Asia’s most expensive business districts -- vacancy rates reached 16% last quarter, up from about 3% three years earlier, CBRE said.
Among the departures was Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc., which moved to the New Bund Time Square (NYSE:SQ) building in the emerging business zone of Qiantan, where rents are about 50% cheaper than Lujiazui.
In an effort to attract tenants, landlords are offering incentives including longer rent-free periods. Even so, rents declined in 14 of the 17 cities last quarter, including the major hubs of Beijing and Shanghai, CBRE’s Xie said.
In Shenzhen, authorities have offered rent discounts of as much as 50% to attract tenants to Qianhai, an emerging business zone. Nine years after it was established as a future financial-services hub, two-thirds of office space in the area is empty, according to Colliers International Group Inc.

331,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 16, 2019 01:34PM ET</span>",Weak U.S. retail sales cast pall over slowing economy,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. retail sales fell for the first time in seven months in September, suggesting that manufacturing-led weakness could be spreading to the broader economy, keeping the door open for the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates again later this month. 
The downbeat report from the Commerce Department on Wednesday came on the heels of data this month showing a moderation in job growth and services sector activity in September. Signs of cracks in the economy's main pillar of support, ahead of the holiday season, could further stoke financial market fears of a sharper slowdown in economic growth.
The economy is being hamstrung by a 15-month trade war between the United States and China, which has soured business sentiment, leading to a decline in capital expenditure and a recession in manufacturing. 
""This morning's report solidifies concerns of the consumer's inability to perpetually support the economy alone,"" said Lindsey Piegza, chief economist at Stifel in Chicago. ""With business investment declining and manufacturing activity deteriorating, many investors brushed off fears of a slowdown because the consumer was still spending.""
Retail sales dropped 0.3% last month as households cut back spending on motor vehicles, building materials, hobbies and online purchases. That was the first drop since February. Data for August was revised up to show retail sales rising 0.6% instead of 0.4% as previously reported. 
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast retail sales would climb 0.3% in September. Compared to September last year, retail sales increased 4.1%.
Excluding automobiles, gasoline, building materials and food services, retail sales were unchanged last month after advancing by an unrevised 0.3% in August. These so-called core retail sales correspond most closely with the consumer spending component of gross domestic product. 
Last month's drop and August's unrevised gain in core retail sales prompted economists to cut their third-quarter consumer spending growth estimates to around a 2.5% annualized rate from a 3.0% pace. Consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of the economy, increased at a 4.6% rate in the second quarter, the most in 1-1/2 years.
That, together with another report from the Commerce Department showing business inventories were unchanged in August, led economists to lower their GDP forecasts for the third quarter to a range between 1.2% pace and 1.9% rate.
The economy grew at a 2.0% pace in the April-June quarter, slowing from the first quarter's brisk 3.1% rate. The government will publish its snapshot of third-quarter GDP later this month. 
Some economists speculated the cooling in hiring, marked by the smallest three-month average gain in private employment in seven years in September, was probably making Americans more cautious about spending. 
Others believed a strike by about 48,000 General Motors (N:GM) workers was a factor. GM and the United Auto Workers union reached a tentative deal on Wednesday to end the month-long strike.
The National Retail Federation blamed trade tensions and difficulties stripping seasonal fluctuations from the data at the end of summer and the start of the new school year. Retailers also said an early Labor Day holiday could have pulled into August some purchases which normally take place in September.
The dollar (DXY) fell to a four-week low against a basket of currencies, while prices of U.S. Treasuries largely rose. Stocks on Wall Street were trading lower. 
FURTHER DECELERATION EXPECTED
Though President Donald Trump announced a truce in the trade war with China last Friday, which delayed additional tariffs that were due this month, economists say the longest economic expansion on record remained in danger without all import duties being rolled back. 
Trump on Wednesday said he was unlikely to sign any trade deal with Beijing until he met with Chinese President Xi Jinping at next month's APEC forum in Chile.
The International Monetary Fund warned on Tuesday that the U.S.-China trade war would cut 2019 global growth to its slowest pace since the 2008-2009 financial crisis, and expressed caution over Trump's so-called Phase 1 trade deal, saying more details were needed. 
Growth is also being restricted by the fading stimulus from last year's $1.5 trillion tax cut package.
""The outlook is for further deceleration in household spending,"" said Joel Naroff, chief economist at Naroff Economic Advisors in Holland, Pennsylvania. ""With job growth, wage gains and hours worked easing back, the gains in income needed to sustain strong consumption are just not there.""
With consumer spending slowing, a full trade deal still elusive and details of Britain's exit from the European Union unclear, many economists expect the Fed to cut interest rates at its Oct. 29-30 policy meeting to keep the expansion, now in its 11th year, on track. 
The U.S. central bank cut rates in September after reducing borrowing costs in July for the first time since 2008. 
Retail sales in September were weighed down by a 0.9% drop in auto sales, despite lower lending rates. That was the biggest drop in eight months and followed a 1.9% acceleration in August. Receipts at service stations fell 0.7%, likely reflecting cheaper gasoline. 
Sales at electronics and appliance stores were unchanged, getting no boost from the launch of Apple's (O:AAPL) new iPhone model. Sales at building material stores fell 1.0%. Online and mail-order retail sales dropped 0.3%, the most since December 2018. That followed a 1.2% increase in August. Spending at hobby, musical instrument and book stores dipped 0.1%. 

But receipts at clothing stores rebounded 1.3% last month after falling 0.7% in August. Sales at furniture stores increased 0.6%. Sales at restaurants and bars gained 0.2%.

332,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 16, 2019 10:21AM ET</span>",U.S. business inventories unchanged in August,"WASHINGTON, (Reuters) - U.S. business inventories were unexpectedly flat in August as stocks at retailers were weaker than initially thought, suggesting inventory investment could remain a drag on economic growth in the third quarter.
The Commerce Department said on Wednesday the unchanged reading in business inventories followed a 0.3% gain in July. Inventories are a key component of gross domestic product. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast inventories would rise 0.2% in August.
Retail inventories dipped 0.1% in August instead of being unchanged as estimated in an advance report published last month. That followed a 0.7% increase in July.
Motor vehicle inventories dropped 0.1% in August, rather than edging up 0.1% as previously reported. Retail inventories excluding autos, which go into the calculation of GDP, declined 0.2%, instead of being unchanged as reported last month.
The pace of inventory accumulation has been slowing after stocks surged from the third quarter of 2018 through the first quarter of this year. The inventory overhang has led to businesses placing fewer orders at factories, contributing to a downturn in manufacturing activity.
The slowdown in inventory accumulation in the second quarter helped to restrict economic growth to a 2.0% annualized rate during the period. Some of the moderation in the pace of accumulation reflects an acceleration in consumer spending in the second quarter.
Businesses are also carefully managing stock levels as the economy's outlook has dimmed against the backdrop of trade tensions between the United States and China, as well as slowing growth overseas. Economists say a truce in the U.S.-China trade war announced by President Donald Trump on Friday was unlikely to reverse the economy's fortunes, as it left the tariffs that have already been imposed in place.
The economy grew at a 3.1% pace in the first quarter. Growth estimates for the third quarter range from as low as a 1.3% annualized rate to as high as a 2.0% pace.
Wholesale inventories rose 0.2% in August, while stocks at manufacturers were unchanged.
Business sales increased 0.2% in August after the same gain in the prior month. At August's sales pace, it would take 1.40 months for businesses to clear shelves, unchanged from July.
Motor vehicle sales surged 1.9% in August after edging up 0.1% in July. The auto inventory-to-sales ratio fell to 2.31 months from 2.36 months in July."

OTTAWA (Reuters) - Canada's annual inflation rate unexpectedly held steady at 1.9% in September, Statistics Canada said on Wednesday in its last major release of economic data before a national election, further reducing analysts' expectations the Bank of Canada will cut rates later this month.
Canada is in the midst of a tight national election campaign with polls showing the governing Liberals are in a statistical tie with the opposition Conservatives, who have focused their campaign on issues related to the cost of living. Canadians vote on Oct. 21.
""The headline CPI inflation increase I think was a little softer than expected,"" said Nathan Janzen, a senior economist with the Royal Bank of Canada. Analysts in a Reuters poll had forecast an annual inflation rate of 2.1%. 
The Canadian dollar weakened to C$1.3243, or 75.51 cents U.S.
The Bank of Canada has held its overnight interest rate steady since October 2018, citing strong domestic economic data. The central bank's next rate decision is set for Oct. 30.
""This is perfect for the Bank of Canada, it doesn't really show any need for them to change tack with their current stance,"" said Simon Harvey, a FX market analyst for Monex Europe and Monex Canada.
""I think we can pretty much disregard a Bank of Canada rate cut for this year,"" he added.
Statistics Canada said prices for goods rose 1.3% year-over-year in September while prices for services increased by 2.2%.
Meanwhile, consumer prices for gasoline fell 10.0% year-over-year in September following a 10.2% decrease in August. The agency said the decline was partially due to continued low global demand for oil as well as refineries switching from summer-blend gasoline to the less expensive winter blend.
Meat prices rose 5.5% year-over-year last month, with fresh or frozen beef rising 4.7% compared to August, Statistics Canada said. Passenger vehicles were also up, jumping 3.4% in September compared to a year earlier.
CPI common, which the central bank says is the best gauge of the economy's underperformance, was at 1.9%. 
CPI median, which shows the median inflation rate across CPI components, was at 2.2%, while CPI trim, which excludes upside and downside outliers, was at 2.1%. August's CPI trim was revised down to 2.0% from 2.1%

In a separate release, Statistics Canada said foreign investors bought a net C$4.99 billion ($3.78 billion) in Canadian securities in August, while Canadian investors sold a net C$4.71 billion worth of foreign securities, led by sales of foreign stocks.

Treasuries rose and U.S. stock futures fell.
The value of overall sales fell 0.3% in September from the prior month after an upwardly revised 0.6% increase in August, Commerce Department figures showed Wednesday. The median estimate in a Bloomberg survey called for a 0.3% advance.
Sales in the “control group” subset, which some analysts view as a more reliable gauge of underlying consumer demand, were little changed, missing projections for a 0.3% increase. The measure excludes food services, car dealers, building-materials stores and gasoline stations.
The surprise drop in retail sales is the first decline since February and may indicate cracks are forming in the consumer spending that’s propped up economic growth in recent months. Together with weaker business investment and manufacturing, along with a lingering trade war, weaker consumption would increase risks to the nation’s longest economic expansion on record and complicate President Donald Trump’s re-election prospects in 2020.
While consumer spending and job gains were likely solid overall during the third quarter, the latest figures as well as the employment report earlier this month suggest a loss of momentum heading into the last part of 2019. With global weakness and trade headwinds already leading Fed officials to lower interest rates at the last two meetings, some policy makers may see reason to cut again at the central bank’s next gathering Oct. 29-30 in Washington.
See our tracker: U.S. Recession Chances Hit 27% Within Next 12 Months
The retail sales report showed seven of 13 major categories posted declines. Nonstore retailers, which includes online shopping, fell 0.3%, the biggest drop since December. General merchandise stores were down 0.3%, building materials fell 1% and sporting goods, hobby, musical instrument and book stores dropped 0.1%.
Increases were led by apparel, health and personal care, and furniture and home furnishings. One sector, electronics and appliance stores, was unchanged.
Filling-station receipts decreased 0.7%, the report showed, after energy prices dropped in last week’s consumer-price data. The retail figures aren’t adjusted for price changes, so sales could reflect changes in gasoline costs, sales, or both.
Spending at automobile dealers dropped 0.9%, the biggest decline since January, after increasing 1.9% in the previous month. Industry data from Wards Automotive Group previously showed the volume of auto sales rose for a second month in September.
Excluding automobiles and gasoline, retail sales were little changed, after a 0.4% gain the previous month.

336,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 16, 2019 06:42AM ET</span>","Euro zone inflation drops more than foreseen, trade surplus widens","By Francesco Guarascio
BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Euro zone inflation dropped to its slowest pace in nearly three years in September, more than previously estimated, the European Union statistics agency said on Wednesday.
The drop is likely to raise new concerns on the state of the euro zone economy and may reignite a debate within the European Central Bank on how to pursue its goal of keeping inflation close to but below 2% over the medium term.
Eurostat said prices in the 19-country euro zone rose 0.8% on the year, down from its earlier estimate of 0.9% and lower than the market consensus of 0.9%. 
Eurostat also said the bloc's trade surplus with the rest of the world rose to 14.7 billion euros ($16.2 billion) in August, from 11.9 billions the previous year, as imports fell more than exports.
The revised inflation reading marked a more pronounced slowdown than August's 1.0%. It was the lowest rate since November 2016, when prices rose 0.6%.
However, a narrower inflation indicator, which strips out volatile energy and unprocessed food prices and is monitored closely by the ECB, rose to 1.2% in September from 1.1% in August, in line with earlier Eurostat estimates on Oct. 1.
Excluding energy, food, alcohol and tobacco, inflation grew 1.0% in September, Eurostat said, confirming earlier figures. 
The revision of the headline figure was caused by lower-than-expected inflation for industrial products, another worrying sign for euro zone manufacturers, who are facing drops in output and in confidence.
Prices for industrial goods, excluding energy, went up 0.2% on the year in September, Eurostat said, revising its earlier 0.3% estimate. 
Energy prices were confirmed falling by 1.8%. Inflation for service, the largest segment of the euro zone economy, rose 1.5%, in line with previous estimates. 
The trade data also released on Wednesday confirmed manufacturing's difficulties. Exports of goods to the rest of the world fell by 2.2% on the year in August.
Imports dropped even more, 4.1%, as global trade tensions seemed to take their toll. Trade among euro zone states also fell 5.6% on the year.
Despite U.S. threats and sanctions against global partners, the latest data showed widening gaps. The EU trade surplus with the United States grew to 102.7 billion euros in the period from January to August, from 90.6 billions the year before.
The EU's trade deficit with China grew to 127.4 billion euros over the same period, from 116.3 billions a year earlier.

Consumer prices rose at an annual rate of 1.7% in September, matching August's rate that was the lowest since December 2016, the Office for National Statistics said on Wednesday. A Reuters poll of economists had pointed to a 1.8% increase.
The figures suggest the Bank of England's forecast in August that inflation would average 1.6% in the final quarter of this year looks on track.
""Motor fuel and second-hand car prices fell, but were offset by price increases for furniture, household appliances and hotel rooms,"" ONS statistician Mike Hardie said.
Fuel prices fell by 2.1% compared with a year earlier, their biggest drop since August 2016, the ONS said.
Surveys show expectations of inflation for the next year among the British public have started to cool after reaching their highest level in years.
The BoE has said that underlying inflation pressures mean it may still need to raise interest rates over the medium term -- if there is an end to persistent Brexit uncertainty and the global economy recovers from its slowdown.
The fortunes of the labor market are key to the outlook for British inflation.
Britain's jobs boom has weakened in the approach to Brexit with the number of people in work unexpectedly falling by the most in over four years and unemployment rising, official data showed on Tuesday.
The ONS labor market data showed a dip in the pace of pay
growth which recently hit its fastest in more than 10 years.
Underlying inflation pressures are modest for now.
An ONS measure of core inflation, which excludes energy, fuel, alcohol and tobacco, rose to 1.7% from 1.5%, as expected.
The ONS figures also suggested less short-term pressure in the pipeline for consumer prices.
Among manufacturers, the cost of raw materials - many of them imported - fell 2.8% in annual terms last month, the biggest drop in three years and driven down by the falling cost of crude oil.
That was a bigger drop than any economist had forecast in the Reuters poll, which had pointed to a 1.8% drop.
Manufacturers increased the prices they charged by an annual 1.2% last month compared with 1.7% in August, again weaker than the consensus forecast for a 1.3% rise.
The ONS said house prices in August rose by an annual 1.3% across the United Kingdom as a whole compared with July's seven-year low of 0.8%, marking the first increase in house price inflation in five months. Prices in London alone fell by 1.4%."
338,By Bloomberg,"<span>Oct 15, 2019 10:24PM ET</span>",Bank of Korea Cuts Interest Rates Again and Warns on Growth,"(Bloomberg) -- South Korea’s central bank cut its policy rate for the second time this year and warned that growth would be weaker than forecast as a global economy hit by trade tensions slows.
The move comes amid a wave of rate cutting by central banks around the world to shore up growth and highlights the sense of urgency at the Bank of Korea to offer further support for the economy, especially with consumer prices falling. Governor Lee Ju-yeol had repeatedly said the BOK had some policy room to act while expressing doubts over whether the bank’s growth forecast for this year could be achieved.
The decision to lower the main policy rate to 1.25%, matching a previous record low, was forecast by 21 of 25 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. The rest expected the bank to leave the rate unchanged. Markets showed little response to the rate reduction, an indication that it had largely been priced in.
Central banks have been adding stimulus as the effects of a global slowdown seep into economies around the world, with Australia, India, and Singapore among those to have taken action this month. Judging by the pace and extent of cuts so far, the BOK has been on the cautious side in taking rates lower as it remains wary of financial risks from too-low interest rates.
Recent data have continued to paint a gloomy picture of South Korea’s economy. Exports dropped for a tenth month in September, industrial production contracted more than expected in August, and consumer prices have started to fall in lockstep with declining producer prices.
In July, the BOK forecast the economy would expand at 2.2% this year, a projection that it now sees as untenable. In a statement, the central bank reiterated its intention to keep judging whether it was necessary to adjust the degree of policy accommodation, leaving the door open to another possible cut.
The International Monetary Fund added to the increasingly gloomy view for the outlook with its latest forecasts predicting the slowest expansion of the world economy this year since the global financial crisis. The IMF also slashed its projection of growth for South Korea this year to 2% from an earlier view of 2.6%.
While a truce between China and the U.S. may offer some relief to global trade, previous developments in the tariff tussle have shown tensions can quickly flare up at any time
Rate Path
Central bank watchers will be looking to see whether Governor Lee will hint at further moves to come at his press conference later in the day.
“The key question is when the BOK will cut again, and given the economic fundamentals are not looking good, markets should be prepared for another cut,” said Cho Yong-gu, a fixed-income strategist at Shinyoung Securities. “It may come in the first half of next year or later and the BOK may opt to cut rates to aid an economic recovery if tech demand bottoms out.”
According to a Bloomberg survey conducted Oct. 1-8, about half of the 25 respondents expect the policy rate to remain unchanged at 1.25% throughout 2020, while a slightly smaller group forecast a further lowering of rates to 1% or 0.75%. Two still expect a hike sometime next year.
The BOK is scheduled to update its gross domestic product and inflation projections at its November meeting. Signals of a significant downgrade by Lee on Wednesday may prompt analysts to bring forward their projected rate cut timing, or amend their calls for no change.
“We think growth will continue to struggle for momentum over the coming quarters,” Alex Holmes, an economist at Capital Economics, wrote in a note after the decision. The firm expects further rate cuts next year to guard against the threat of a prolonged period of damaging deflation, Holmes wrote.
Still, reasons remain for a cautious approach by the BOK. Heightened concerns over low rates leading to a property bubble in some parts of Seoul, or potential capital outflow and won weakness, may bolster views for a prolonged holding pattern at the latest rate level. Lee has said South Korea’s lower bound on rates needs to be higher than those for key currency economies, without specifying a figure.
What Bloomberg’s Economists Say
“We think limited policy space and concerns about financial risks mean the BOK will likely keep its benchmark rate steady in the year ahead -- barring a significant escalation in trade tensions or sharper deterioration in global growth. An expansionary fiscal stance from the government should also help support the economy.”

SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea's central bank cut its policy interest rate for the second time in three months on Wednesday, as expected, to support slowing economic growth and address mounting deflationary pressures.
The Bank of Korea's monetary policy board trimmed the base rate by 25 basis points to 1.25%, a media department official said. BOK Governor Lee Ju-yeol is due to hold a news conference from 0220 GMT.
The rate cut follows a July easing and was in line with forecasts in a Reuters survey of 31 analysts. The new rate matches a record low seen until late 2017.
Local financial markets showed little reaction to the widely expected decision as investors awaited clues on future policy direction from the governor's news conference.
""We see a further rate reduction, possibly between January and February next year, because economic growth really is not going to pick up soon,"" said Kong Dong-rak, fixed-income strategist at Daishin Securities.
The BOK's move comes amid a wave of monetary easing globally, including by the U.S. Federal Reserve, as the world economy loses steam. The Fed is expected to deliver its third rate cut this year later this month.
South Korea's economic growth has tumbled in recent quarters, hit by cooling global demand and the prolonged U.S.-China tariff war, due to its heavy reliance on the export of chips, cars and ships.
Global investment banks have slashed their 2019 economic growth forecasts for Asia's fourth-largest economy to as low as 1.6%, compared with the central bank's projection for 2.2% from actual growth of 2.7% last year.
In its regular update on the global economic outlook released late on Tuesday, the International Monetary Fund slashed South Korea's 2019 and 2020 economic growth forecasts by 0.6 of a percentage point each to 2.0% and 2.2%, respectively.
The economy grew just 1.9% in the first half of this year from a year earlier, down sharply from a 2.5% gain in the second half of last year and a 2.8% rise in the preceding six-month period, central bank data shows.
The usually robust economy now faces the serious threat of deflation as consumer prices in September posted their first annual decline in the country's modern history.
Underlining deflationary pressures, central bank data released early on Wednesday showed import prices fell in September for a fourth consecutive month from a year earlier, the longest losing streak since late 2016.
Signs of progress in U.S.-China trade negotiations have provided some cause for optimism in South Korea's economy but uncertainties over the trade war are still high and exports have yet to show firm evidence of bottoming out."
340,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 15, 2019 07:01PM ET</span>","New Zealand inflation quickens in third quarter, but rate cut view stays","WELLINGTON (Reuters) - New Zealand's inflation accelerated at a slightly faster than expected pace in the third quarter, driven by higher household costs, but it did little to change the view that interest rates would be cut further this year to bolster the economy.
Statistics New Zealand said on Wednesday that consumer prices rose 0.7% in the September quarter and 1.5% from the same period a year earlier, faster than the Reserve Bank of New Zealand's (RBNZ) forecasts and the consensus of economists polled by Reuters.
Consumer prices rose 0.6% in the previous three month period and 1.7% on year. The Reserve Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ) had forecast a 0.5% quarterly and 1.3% year-on-year rate of inflation.
The annual increase in inflation was driven by higher prices for rents, cigarettes and tobacco, the agency said in a statement. The quarterly CPI increase was due to price rises for local authority rates and payments, vegetables, and meat and poultry, it said.
The New Zealand dollar rose 0.25% to $0.6308 after the inflation data as dovish traders eased some of their bets.
However, the data did little to change the market view that RBNZ would cut rates again this year to boost an economy facing headwinds from global uncertainty and a slowdown in activity and business confidence.
Kiwibank Chief Economist Jarrod Kerr said in a note that while today's data was above expectation, RBNZ still needs to do more and he expects a rate cut in November.
The central bank kept the official cash rate (OCR) at a record low of 1.0% last month, after stunning markets with a steep 50 basis-point rate cut in August.
RBNZ has said the reduction in the OCR this year was needed to ensure inflation increases to the 2% mid-point of its target 1-3% range, and employment remains around its maximum sustainable level.
""Today's data just reduces the case that the RBNZ needs to put all 50 bps of stimulus through in November as market pricing has recently suggested was a possibility – albeit a slim one,"" said Kerr.
Markets are now pricing an 87% chance of a rate cut by 25 basis points at RBNZ's next meeting on Nov. 13."
341,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 15, 2019 02:06PM ET</span>",Narrow majority of Fed banks wanted to keep discount rate unchanged: minutes,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Seven out of the 12 regional Federal Reserve banks wanted to leave unchanged the rate commercial banks are charged for emergency loans ahead of the U.S. central bank's last policy meeting, minutes from the discussion of the discount rate showed on Tuesday.
Despite that, the Fed decided to lower the discount rate to 2.50% from 2.75% at its Sept. 17-18 meeting at the same time that it cut its benchmark overnight lending rate by a quarter of a percentage point to a target range of between 1.75% and 2.00%.
Directors of the Fed banks of Boston, New York, Philadelphia, Richmond, Cleveland, Atlanta and Kansas City all wished to maintain the existing discount rate, citing a ""strong labor market and inflation near its symmetric 2% objective.""
The directors of the Fed banks of Minneapolis, Chicago, Dallas and San Francisco pushed for the quarter-percentage-point cut in the discount rate that was ultimately implemented.
The discord echoes the debate among U.S. central bank policymakers about how much slowing global growth and the fallout from the Trump administration's trade wars are harming the U.S. economy.
Policymakers are split into those who think the Fed's two interest rate cuts this year suffice for now to keep the longest economic expansion on record going, others who think the Fed should lower borrowing costs more, and some who see a rate rise by the end of the year, according to projections released last month.
St. Louis Fed President James Bullard called for a half-percentage-point cut at the Fed's September policy meeting. Directors of the St. Louis Fed likewise wanted the discount rate cut to 2.25% ahead of the meeting, the minutes showed.
Investors currently expect another reduction in borrowing costs when the Fed's rate-setting committee next meets at the end of this month."

The latest survey results, released on Tuesday, showed a boost in confidence about the state of the job market, and in expectations for wage growth and access to credit - a sign of household resilience alongside weak September job growth.
At the median, consumers expected earnings growth over the next year would be 2.5%, up from 2.3% in the August survey of 1,300 households. The perceived risk of losing a job over the next year fell to 13.4%, from 14.2%.
The expected probability that the unemployment rate would increase over the next year remained flat, at 38.4%.
The outlook for household consumption growth remained unchanged from August, with consumers at the median expecting their spending to rise 3.3%.
Those results bolster what U.S. Federal Reserve officials expect will be continued support for the U.S. economy's 10-year recovery from rising household income and continued high levels of employment.
The inflation result, however, is more problematic for a central bank that has fallen short of its 2% inflation target since it was first established in 2012.
Consumer expectations about prices in the coming year, which are measured on a slightly different scale than the Fed's 2% goal, rose slightly to 2.5% in September, from 2.4% in August.
Over a three-year time frame, however, consumers expected inflation of just 2.4%, slightly below the August result.
The Fed's preferred measure of inflation stood at 1.8% as of August, excluding the more volatile measures of food and energy costs.
Weak inflation has led some Fed policymakers to call for further reductions in the central bank's target interest rate beyond the two quarter-percentage-point cuts approved in July and September.
Investors expect the Fed to reduce rates at least once more this year. Rate cut advocates at the central bank argue the Fed should do more to prove it is serious about meeting its inflation target.
Fed officials watch estimates of consumer expectations closely, concerned that falling expectations mean households might be losing faith in the strength of the economy, and losing confidence in the central bank's ability to meet its inflation target."

Chinese policymakers have been trying to boost bank lending and lower corporate financing costs, especially for the small and private companies vital for growth and jobs, but they have also cautioned against aggressive stimulus amid worries over debt risks.
Separate data on Tuesday showed China's factory-gate prices fell at their fastest pace in more than three years in September, adding to a slew of data in recent months that underline increasing pressure on the world's second-biggest economy.
Consumer inflation accelerated to 3% in September -- the highest since October 2013 -- but analysts attributed this to the supply-side impact of rising food costs, driven by surging pork prices as African swine fever diminishes hog supplies.
Chinese banks extended 1.69 trillion yuan ($238.98 billion)in new loans in September, up from August and exceeding analyst expectations, data released by the People's Bank of China (PBOC) showed on Tuesday.
Analysts polled by Reuters had predicted new yuan loans would rise to 1.4 trillion yuan in September, up from 1.21 trillion yuan in August but largely in line with the tally in September last year.
Banks have boosted lending for the real economy, underscored by a pick-up in medium- and long-term corporate loans, Ruan Jianhong, head of statistics at the PBOC, told reporters. She added that property loans have been slowing.
Corporate loans jumped to 1.01 trillion yuan in September from 651.3 billion yuan in August. Household loans, mostly mortgages, rose to 755 billion yuan last month from 653.8 billion yuan in August, central bank data showed.
Sun Guofeng, head of the central bank's monetary policy department, told the same briefing that the PBOC will rely on reforms to improve policy-transmission mechanisms and help lower borrowing costs.
Sun also said the central bank should manage inflation expectations, although there is no basis for continued inflation and deflation.
Broad M2 money supply in September grew 8.4% from a year earlier, above the 8.2% forecast in the Reuters poll, which was unchanged from August.
Outstanding yuan loans grew 12.5% from a year earlier, quicker than August's 12.4%. Analysts had expected a 12.3% growth.
MORE EASING SEEN NEEDED
Analysts expect the central bank to ease policy further to support growth, despite some signs of easing in trade tensions between Beijing and Washington.
U.S. President Donald Trump said on Friday the two sides had reached agreement on the first phase of a deal and suspended a tariff increase, but officials said much work still needed to be done.
""The upshot is that policy easing is still failing to meaningfully lift credit growth. We think this will ultimately push the PBOC to cut the rates on its lending facilities more decisively,"" Martin Lynge Rasmussen, China economist at Capital Economics, said in a note to clients after the data release.
China's economic growth in the third quarter is expected to slow to 6.1% year-on-year, just below the 6.2% pace in the second quarter, according to a Reuters poll.
Analysts in the latest Reuters poll expect the PBOC will ease policy further by cutting banks' reserve retirement ratios (RRR) and the one-year loan prime rate (LPR), its new benchmark lending rate.
The PBOC has already cut RRR seven times since early 2018, in addition to two modest reductions in the one-year LPR since August.
Central bank Governor Yi Gang said late in September large interest rate cuts were not urgently needed, following Beijing's reiteration that it would not use ""flood-like"" stimulus measures.
BOND DEFAULTS RISING
Despite prodding from Beijing, several bankers have told Reuters they have little appetite for lending to smaller companies because of the uncertain economic outlook, the trade war and a years-long drive to purge risks from the financial system. Some companies also say banks are sharply reducing credit lines.
Corporate bond defaults, meanwhile, look set for another record year, though most have been by smaller, private firms.
Growth of outstanding total social financing (TSF), a broad measure of credit and liquidity in the economy, rose 10.8% in September from a year earlier.
The central bank has revised TSF growth in August to 10.8% from 10.7% after a change in the way it calculates TSF.
TSF includes off-balance-sheet forms of financing from outside the conventional bank lending system, such as initial public offerings, loans from trust companies and bond sales.
In September, TSF rose to 2.27 trillion yuan, according to PBOC. It also revised up August' s figure to 2.02 trillion yuan from 1.98 trillion yuan.
Many analysts believe high debt levels -- a legacy of massive stimulus sprees in the past -- are making policymakers more cautious in their stimulus and more tolerant of slower growth as long as it is gradual."

National statistics bureau ISTAT reported that the underground economy, which comprises illegal activities and business and labor hidden from the authorities, was worth 211 billion euros ($232.21 billion) in 2017, or 12.1% of gross domestic product.
Some 192 billion euros was undeclared business. Another 19 billion came from illegal activities such as drug trafficking and some forms of prostitution.
False earnings declarations in tax returns amounted to more than 97 billion euros, ISTAT estimated, while undeclared or irregular jobs increased by 25,000 to 3.7 million.
The government of the anti-establishment 5-Star Movement and the centre-left Democratic Party (PD) is preparing a raft of measures in the budget to tackle tax evasion, encouraging the use of easily traced credit cards rather than opaque cash transactions.
The draft budget is due to be approved by the cabinet later on Tuesday, before being sent to the European Commission for scrutiny.
According to government sources, the budget may introduce sanctions for retailers and service providers that do not accept credit cards. It may also set a lower rate of value-added tax for purchases made by card rather than cash.
The government is also considering lowering to 1,000 euros from 3,0000 euros the threshold above which it is illegal to make transactions in cash."
347,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 15, 2019 05:48AM ET</span>",German investor sentiment falls less than expected in October,"BERLIN (Reuters) - The mood among German investors worsened less in October than analysts had expected, a survey showed on Tuesday, amid concern that Europe's biggest economy might be headed for a recession.
In its monthly survey, ZEW said that an index showing economic sentiment among investors fell to -22.8 points in October from -22.5 points in the previous month. A second index, measuring investors' assessment of the economy's current shape, fell to -25.3 from -19.9 points.
""The recent settlement in the trade dispute between the USA and China does not seem to diminish economic scepticism at this stage,"" ZEW President Achim Wambach was quoted as saying.
U.S. President Donald Trump last week outlined the first phase of a deal to end a trade war with China and suspended a threatened increase in tariffs, but officials on both sides said more work needed to be done before an accord could be reached.
The trade conflict between the United States and China, along with other factors such as uncertainty surrounding Brexit, has dragged Germany's export-oriented industry into a recession, sparking fears that the negative trend could spill over to the rest of the economy.
ZEW's headline economic sentiment index, which reached its lowest in almost seven years in August, appears to have stabilized. But the investor assessment of the German economy's current condition in October was as pessimistic as it was in 2010.
The economy ministry said on Monday that Germany was unlikely to slide into a prolonged recession, but the economy was stuck in stagnation.
Chancellor Angela Merkel's coalition government of conservatives and social democrats has resisted calls for a stimulus package to counter the slowdown.
Germany's leading economic institutes have cut their growth forecasts, predicting an expansion of 0.5% this year and 1.1% in 2020.
The government will publish its growth forecasts, which often follow the institutes' estimates, this week."

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's jobs boom has weakened in the approach to Brexit with the number of people in work unexpectedly falling by the most in over four years and unemployment rising, official data showed on Tuesday.
Employment fell by 56,000 to 32.69 million in the three months to August, the Office for National Statistics said. Economists polled by Reuters had expected growth of 23,000.
The number of people out of work rose by 22,000 to just over 1.31 million, the ONS said.
Britain's strong labor market has been the silver lining for the economy since the Brexit referendum in 2016, something many analysts attribute, in part, to firms hiring workers that they can later lay off rather than making longer-term commitments to investment.
But there were signs in Tuesday's figures that employers were turning more cautious.
The unemployment rate unexpectedly rose to 3.9% from a 3.8%, which had been its joint lowest since the mid-1970s, while vacancies fell to their lowest level since the three months to November 2017.
""Challenging economic conditions are starting to take the shine off the UK’s job boom,"" Tej Parikh, chief economist at the Institute of Directors, an employers group, said.
""Business leaders’ long-lasting drive to expand their workforce has put the labor market in a strong position. However, firms are now increasingly coming up against uncertainty and the shrinking supply of available talent.""
Many employers are worried about Prime Minister Boris Johnson's pledge to take Britain out of the European Union on Oct. 31 without a transition deal to smooth the economic shock if necessary. However, lawmakers have passed legislation that they say will force him to seek a delay from Brussels.
A survey published separately on Tuesday by Britain's main auto industry group showed jobs cuts at one in three firms in the sector, which risks being a big loser from Brexit. That was up from one in eight just under a year ago.
As well as worries about Brexit, Britain's economy is feeling the drag from rising U.S-China trade tensions which have weighed on global growth.
The ONS labor market data showed a dip in the pace of pay growth which recently hit its fastest in more than 10 years.
Total earnings growth, including bonuses, rose by an annual 3.8% in the three months to August, slowing from 3.9% in the three months to July and weaker than the median forecast of 4.0% in the Reuters poll.
Excluding bonuses, which smoothes out some volatility, pay growth similarly slowed slightly to 3.8%, but was a touch ahead of the Reuters poll forecast of 3.7%.
The trend in pay growth is being watched closely by the Bank of England.
Deputy Governor Dave Ramsden said in a newspaper interview published on Sunday that wage costs were ""picking up quite significantly, which will drive domestic inflationary pressure.""

However, the BoE is waiting for more clarity on Brexit before any decision to resume its gradual and limited program of interest rates hikes.

Aggregate financing was 2.27 trillion yuan ($321 billion) last month, compared to about 1.98 trillion yuan in August, the People’s Bank of China said Friday. The median estimate by economists was 1.9 trillion yuan.

BEIJING (Reuters) - China's factory gate prices declined at their fastest pace in more than three years in September, reinforcing the case for Beijing to unveil further stimulus as manufacturing cools on weak demand and U.S. trade pressures.
The producer price index (PPI), considered a key barometer of corporate profitability, dropped 1.2% year-on-year in September, National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) data showed on Tuesday. That marked the steepest decline since July 2016 but matched forecasts in a Reuters survey of analysts.
In contrast, China's consumer prices rose at their fastest pace in almost six years driven mostly by the surge in pork prices as African swine fever ravaged the country's hog herds. However, core retail inflation pressures remain modest, giving policymakers room to introduce measures to prop up demand.
""We continue to anticipate further loosening in the next few quarters as demand-side pressures remain muted and factory-gate deflation deepens,"" Martin Lynge Rasmussen, China Economist at Capital Economics, wrote in a note. 
The grim outlook is unlikely to change even as tensions in the year-long trade war between Beijing and Washington have eased somewhat. U.S. President Donald Trump said on Friday the two sides had reached agreement on the first phase of a deal and suspended a tariff hike, but officials said much work still needed to be done.
Weak prices were mainly seen in oil and raw material sectors. PPI deflation could deepen due to weakening domestic demand, falling energy and raw material prices and the value-added tax cut that became effective in April this year, analysts at Nomura said.
Some analysts expect China's GDP growth rate to slip below 6% in the third quarter. The government has set a growth target of 6.0%-6.5% this year.
Trade data released on Monday showed contractions in both exports and imports as U.S. tariffs implemented on Sept. 1 came into effect, underscoring the continued impact of the bilateral dispute.
China has taken a cautious approach in dealing with the slowing economy. Stimulus to date has largely avoided dramatic increases in government spending and the central bank has also mainly used the reserve requirement ratio for banks instead of sweeping interest rate cuts. 
Chinese central bank governor Yi Gang said late in September there was no urgent need to implement large interest rate cuts following Beijing's reiteration that it would not use ""flood-like"" stimulus measures.
Analysts say they expect greater stimulus measures at the end of the month, however, when China's Politburo, the top decision making political body, is expected to meet.
""Since there is very limited policy autonomy at ministries, local governments, and SOEs (state-owned enterprises), the policy decision pass-through has to come from the above,"" said analysts last week in a note from Bank of America Merrill Lynch (NYSE:BAC).
The People's Bank of China cut a reserve ratio for banks in September, freeing up $126 bln for loans.
PORK PRICES CONTINUE TO SOAR
Data released by NBS Tuesday showed China's consumer price index (CPI) rose 3% from a year earlier, higher than 2.9% tipped by analysts and marking the fastest increase since October 2013, when it rose 3.2%.
While September's data showed headline inflation at China's official target of around 3% and core CPI growing a benign 1.5%, food costs continue to soar, driven mainly by rising pork prices as African swine fever diminishes hog supplies.
A 69.3% surge in pork prices in September year-on-year pushed the food price index up 11.2%, accelerating from 10% in the previous month. In August, pork prices rose 46.7% from a year earlier.
China has been fighting the devastating African swine fever and has implemented a series of policies to try to replenish its herds, including flying in 900 breeding pigs from Denmark.
Many analysts still expect pork prices to trend higher in the coming months as the disease spreads and hog stocks get slashed, despite a flurry of government measures to ramp up supply to the market.
But few expect that would have a material impact on China's monetary policy-making for now.

""We do not think the pork-price-driven CPI inflation will have a significant impact on the PBoC’s monetary policy stance, as the pork price inflation was caused by a supply shock rather than a monetary phenomenon,"" said analysts at Nomura.

356,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 14, 2019 08:04AM ET</span>","China September exports, imports in deeper contraction as tariffs take toll","By Yawen Chen and Gabriel Crossley
BEIJING (Reuters) - A slide in China's exports picked up pace in September while imports contracted for a fifth straight month, pointing to further weakness in the economy and underlining the need for more stimulus as the Sino-U.S. trade war drags on.
Analysts say it could take time for Chinese exports to recover given slowing global growth, despite tentative signs of a thaw in tense trade relations between the world's top two economies. 
On Friday, U.S. President Donald Trump outlined the first phase of a deal to end the trade war with China and suspended a threatened tariff hike set for Oct. 15. But existing tariffs remain in place and officials on both sides said much more work needed to be done.
September exports fell 3.2% from a year earlier, the biggest fall since February, customs data showed on Monday. Analysts in a Reuters poll had expected a 3% decline after August's 1% drop.
""The headline figures suggest that global demand softened last month, adding to the pressure from the U.S. tariffs that went into effect in September,"" said analysts at Capital Economics.
Economists also attributed the export slowdown to a fading in the so-called ""front-loading"" effect. Some Chinese firms had rushed to ship goods to the United States ahead of the September deadline, supporting overall July and August export readings. 
""We expect shrinking exports will likely be one of the biggest drag on China's economic growth in the coming months, as the tariff impact will be further in place, along with the pay-back effects,"" said Ting Lu, chief China economist at Nomura.
Total September imports fell 8.5% after August's 5.6% decline, the lowest since May, and were expected to fall 5.2%.
Some sectors held a silver lining. China's industrial metals imports, including iron ore and copper, surged in September fueled by firm demand at steel mills.
But analysts at ANZ noted volumes were buoyed by recovery from recent disruptions in Australia and Brazil, and may also have been lifted by restocking ahead of China's 70th anniversary celebrations, suggesting overall demand remains weak.
Nomura's Lu pointed to subdued imports in the raw material processing sector and softening global commodity prices possibly playing a role in depressing overall imports.
Despite more than a year of growth boosting measures, China's domestic demand has remained stubbornly weak as economic uncertainty weighs on business and consumer confidence and discourages fresh investment.
Downward pressure on China's economy is increasing and the government will make good use of counter-cyclical adjustments to keep economic growth within a reasonable range, state television quoted premier Li Keqiang as saying.
TRADE SURPLUS
China reported a trade surplus of $39.65 billion last month, compared with a $34.84 billion surplus in August. Analysts had forecast $33.3 billion. 
Its trade surplus with the United States stood at $25.88 billion in September, narrowing from August's $26.96 billion. 
China's exports to the United States fell 10.7% from a year earlier in dollar terms in January-September, while U.S. imports dropped 26.4% during that period, the customs data showed.
September had marked a major escalation in the trade row, with Washington imposing 15% tariffs on more than $125 billion in Chinese imports from Sept. 1, and Beijing hitting back with retaliatory levies.
Though President Trump had agreed not to proceed with a hike in tariffs set for Tuesday, U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer said Trump had not made a decision about tariffs that were subject to go into effect in December.
Analysts are also skeptical that the ""mini deal"" would mark a major breakthrough. 
""It is difficult to take that much comfort from the latest signs of progress given that we've had plenty of apparent truces in recent months end abruptly in a sudden further escalation in trade tensions,"" said analysts at Capital Economics.
Customs spokesman Li Kuiwen told a news conference on Monday China's stable domestic economy had provided a strong cushion against external challenges, but added that trade development in the future was still complicated and severe.
Economists at UBS expect further pressure on China's job market as the impact of the latest U.S. tariff escalations filter through to struggling manufacturers.
""We think the time to watch for potentially significant job losses is from December this year until March 2020, assuming all announced tariff hikes are implemented. Job losses may be more concentrated in a few sectors that have higher exposure to foreign final demand, such as textiles, computers and electronics and electrical equipment, among others.""
Analysts believe China's economic growth cooled further in the third quarter from a near 30-year low of 6.2% hit in April-June, and is threatening to breach the lower end of the government's full-year target of 6.0-6.5%.

A growing number of economists are forecasting growth could fall into the upper 5% range in 2020 due to lingering trade tensions and a combination of cyclical and structural factors.

The European Union statistics agency Eurostat said industrial output in the 19-country bloc grew in August by 0.4% on the month, above the market consensus of a 0.3% rise.
The increase, only the third monthly increase in 2019, fully offset the 0.4% drop recorded in July.
The reading could reduce concerns about a slowdown of the euro zone economy in the third quarter. A first estimate of gross domestic product will be released by Eurostat on Oct. 31.
The euro zone economy grew by a mere 0.2% in the second quarter after expanding 0.4% in the first three months of the year. Growth could slow further in the third quarter, amid a manufacturing crisis in Germany, the bloc's largest economy.
The IHS Markit's Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI), an indicator of economic sentiment, recorded in September the worst reading for Germany since 2009, when the global financial crisis plunged the country's economy into recession.
But on a more positive note, Eurostat's estimates showed on Monday a growing appetite for investment among factory managers. Production of capital goods, such as machinery, went up 1.2% on the month in August, after a 2.1% rise in July, pointing to an expansion of capacity.
Output also rose for intermediate goods, but dropped for durable and non-durable consumer products, in a sign that manufacturers may be expecting at least a short-term slowdown in sales."

Total auto sales fell 5.2% from the same month a year earlier to 2.27 million vehicles, the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers (CAAM) said on Monday.
That followed declines of 6.9% in August and 4.3% in July. Car sales in 2018 declined from a year earlier, the first annual contraction since the 1990s against a backdrop of slowing economic growth and a crippling trade war with the United States.
September and October, nicknamed ""Golden September, Silver October"" by China's auto insiders, are regarded as the high season for auto sales in the country, with customers traditionally returning to make purchases after summer. 
The association had previously said it expected sales in the second half to improve, but that overall annual sales would fall 5% year-on-year to 26.68 million vehicles in 2019.
""Sales have risen in the second half but they have not hit expectations and the pace has been slow,"" said Chen Shihua, CAAM assistant secretary general. 
As recently as three years ago automakers had enjoyed double-digit annual growth in China, before the brakes came on with the first annual contraction since the 1990s last year.
Fifteen cities and provinces which account for over 60% of car sales in China implemented new vehicle emission standards earlier than the central government's 2020 deadline, hurting sales particularly of traditional-fuel vehicles, according to CAAM, analysts, dealers and consumers.
Sales of new energy vehicles, which China has been a keen supporter of, have also been impacted by subsidy cuts, falling 34.2% in September following a 15.8% decline in August, CAAM said. NEV sales jumped almost 62% last year as the broader auto market contracted.

NEVs include plug-in hybrids, battery-only electric vehicles and those powered by hydrogen fuel cells.

The University of Michigan's preliminary sentiment index advanced to a three-month high of 96 from September’s 93.2, data showed Friday. The median estimate of economists was for a decline to 92. The gauge of current conditions climbed to the highest level this year while the expectations index improved.
Key Insights

Even with the improved sentiment, lower inflation expectations -- closely monitored by the Federal Reserve -- could lend more support to a third straight interest-rate cut later this month. Inflation expectations over the next five to 10 years dropped to 2.2% in October, the lowest level in records back to 1979, from 2.4% a month earlier.
The second-straight advance in sentiment is just the first back-to-back gain since March. While consumers continue to enjoy steady job and income growth, concerns about the economy’s prospects in light of the trade war continue to linger though lessened slightly in October, according to the report.
The report showed a widening gap between consumer expectations by political party, with Republicans growing more confident and Democrats' sentiment the weakest since October 2008. Overall, “the impeachment inquiry has not had a significant negative impact on economic prospects,” the report showed.
Consumers' outlooks of their inflation-adjusted incomes increased to the “most favorable level in two decades,” the report showed, helping to boost buying plans. Views of the economic outlook showed more modest expectations, with some expecting a slight uptick in the unemployment rate.

Official's View
“Overall, the data indicate that consumption spending will be strong enough to offset weakness in business investment spending so as to keep the economy expanding into 2020,” Richard Curtin, director of the University of Michigan consumer survey, said in a statement.
Consumer expectations for inflation in the year ahead dropped to 2.5% -- matching the lowest since late 2017 -- from 2.8%. A measure of buying conditions for big-ticket durable goods increased to a four-month high of 160.One caveat in the report: About one-third of consumers expected unemployment to rise, compared with 20% anticipating a further decline and 46% seeing no change."

BRASILIA (Reuters) - Brazil's services sector activity fell in August more steeply than economists expected, official figures on Friday showed, providing another indication that the broader economic recovery remains sluggish and uneven.
The 0.2% fall from July and 1.4% decline from the same period a year ago follows other August data releases that show retail sales barely rose and the service sector purchasing managers index (PMI) slipped from July.
Services account for over 70% of Brazil's economy, the largest in Latin America. It shrank 0.2% in the first quarter of the year but rebounded 0.4% in the second, raising hopes that growth would consolidate around that pace in the third quarter.
But the decline in services activity in August was greater than the 0.1% monthly decline and 1.0% year-on-year fall economists had expected, according to the median estimate in a Reuters poll of economists.
The monthly fall was the fifth out of eight this year, and the annual decline was the fourth, figures from government statistics agency IBGE show.
Service sector activity in the 12 months to August rose 0.6%, IBGE said, marking a slowdown from 0.7% in the year to June and 0.9% in the year to July. Year-to-date growth slowed to 0.5% from 0.8% in July.
Brazil's economy is expected to grow by less than 1.0% this year, according to estimates from the government, central bank and most private sector economists. Low growth and weak inflation are likely to prompt further cuts in official interest rates to new lows this year."

Data for August was revised to show import prices dropping 0.2% instead of the 0.5% decline previously reported.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. consumer prices were unchanged in September and underlying inflation retreated, supporting expectations the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates in October for the third time this year amid risks to the economy from trade tensions.
A strong labor market could, however, complicate matters for the Fed amid divisions among officials on the appropriate response to the rising headwinds to growth. Other data on Thursday showed an unexpected decline in the number of Americans filing claims for unemployment benefits last week. 
Layoffs remain low even as companies are becoming hesitant to hire more workers because of a slowing economy. The unemployment rate is near a 50-year low of 3.5%. 
The longest economic expansion on record, now in its 11th year, is under threat from the 15-month-old U.S.-China trade war, slowing growth overseas and a likely disorderly exit from the European Union by Britain. The trade war has undermined business investment and helped to drive manufacturing into recession. Growth is also being restricted by the fading stimulus from last year's $1.5 trillion tax cut package.
""The downside risks from slower global growth, trade disruptions and the contraction in U.S. manufacturing could carry more weight among Fed officials,"" said Ben Ayers, senior economist at Nationwide in Columbus, Ohio. ""The odds of a rate cut in October are moving up with domestic economic data turning softer in recent months."" 
The Labor Department said the flat consumer price index last month was the weakest reading since January and came as increases in the cost of food and rents were offset by decreases in the prices of gasoline and used cars and trucks. The CPI edged up 0.1% in August. In the 12 months through September, the CPI increased 1.7% after advancing by the same margin in August. 
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the CPI nudging up 0.1% in September and rising 1.8% on a year-on-year basis.
Excluding the volatile food and energy components, the CPI climbed 0.1% after gaining 0.3% for three straight months. The so-called core CPI was restrained by moderate gains in healthcare costs, as well as declines in apparel, new motor vehicles and communications prices. In the 12 months through September, the core CPI increased 2.4%, matching August's rise.
The report came on the heels of data on Tuesday showing the biggest drop in producer prices in eight months in September.
Minutes of the U.S. central bank's Sept. 17-18 policy meeting published on Wednesday showed that while officials agreed risks to the economy ""had increased somewhat,"" they were divided on what the appropriate response should be.
The minutes showed ""several"" favored keeping rates unchanged at that meeting as they felt the policy stance was ""already adequately accommodative,"" while a ""couple"" preferred a 50 basis point rate cut. 
The Fed cut rates by a quarter point last month after reducing borrowing costs in July for the first time since 2008. A further reduction is expected at the Oct. 29-30 meeting.
U.S. stocks rose after President Donald Trump confirmed he would meet Chinese Vice Premier Liu He on Friday for further trade talks, raising hopes for a deal. The dollar weakened against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices fell.
LAYOFFS REMAIN LOW
The Fed tracks the core personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index for its 2.0% inflation target. The core PCE price index rose 1.8% on a year-on-year basis in August and has fallen short of its target this year.
Economists said based on the CPI and PPI data, they expected the monthly core PCE price index to tick up 0.1% in September, matching August's gain. That would lower the annual increase in core inflation to 1.7% from 1.8% in August.
While benign inflation has increased households' purchasing power and boosted consumer spending, it has led to moderate annual increases for Americans receiving Social Security benefits. Based on July, August and September inflation data, recipients could see a 1.6% cost of living adjustment in the new fiscal year, according to Labor Department calculations.
Economists expect inflation will pick up and breach the Fed's target in 2020 following the recent broadening of U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods to include a range of consumer goods. A tightening labor market is also expected to support inflation. 
In another report on Thursday, the Labor Department said initial claims for state unemployment benefits dropped 10,000 to a seasonally adjusted 210,000 for the week ended Oct. 5.
Economists had forecast claims unchanged at 219,000 in the latest week. Employers are holding on to their workers, even as demand for labor is ebbing.
""While the claims data have been upbeat, we still have seen job growth slow lately, with this cooling tied primarily to reduced hiring rather than increased layoffs,"" said Daniel Silver, an economist at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) in New York. 
Job openings fell to a 1-1/2-year low in August. Nonfarm payrolls rose by 136,000 jobs in September, down from 168,000 in August. The three-month average gain in private employment fell to 119,000, the smallest since July 2012, from 135,000 in August.
The CPI report showed gasoline prices declined 2.4% after falling 3.5% in August. Food prices gained 0.1% after being unchanged for three straight months. Owners' equivalent rent of primary residence, which is what a homeowner would pay to rent or receive from renting a home, rose 0.3% in September after rising 0.2% for two consecutive months. 
Healthcare costs climbed 0.2% last month after jumping 0.7% in August, which was the biggest gain in three years. Apparel prices fell 0.4% after gaining 0.2% in the prior month. 

Used motor vehicles and trucks prices decreased 1.6% in September, the most in a year, after rising for three straight months. Prices for new motor vehicles dipped 0.1%. There were increases in the costs of household furnishings, motor vehicle insurance, airline fares and tobacco.

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's economy looks to have dodged recession in the run-up to its deadline for leaving the European Union this month but the pace of growth has sagged as exporters felt the impact of the slowing world economy, official data showed on Thursday.
Gross domestic product in the three months to August was 0.3% higher than in the previous three months, beating all forecasts in a Reuters poll of economists and accelerating from an upwardly revised 0.1% in the three months to July.
But the stronger performance largely reflected revisions to earlier months and the most recent figures were weak.
Output in August alone dropped by 0.1% on the month versus economists' average forecast for it to hold steady, the Office for National Statistics said.
Sterling edged up against the U.S. dollar  following the stronger-than-expected data.
The world's fifth-biggest economy shrank in the second quarter, driven by a sharp decline in April when businesses found themselves holding unnecessary stockpiles of raw materials after Brexit was delayed from the original date of March 29.
The Bank of England predicted last month that Britain's economy would grow by 0.2% in the third quarter, bolstered in part by higher public spending.
BoE Governor Mark Carney said the underlying rate of growth was even weaker and Thursday's data ""is consistent with that picture"".
Investec economist George Brown said Britain was set to avoid a recession. ""But at the same time it is apparent that growth is fragile amid the uncertainty surrounding Brexit and the global economic backdrop,"" he said.
The annual rate of GDP growth slowed to 1.1% from 1.3%, matching a seven-year low set in June. 
RECESSION RISK DIMINISHES
Prime Minister Boris Johnson has promised to take Britain out of the EU by Oct. 31, without a transition period if necessary - despite parliament telling him to delay Brexit again if he cannot negotiate a fresh deal. Businesses say a no-deal Brexit risks causing major disruption to imports. 
Two consecutive quarters of contraction would mean Britain's economy met a commonly used definition of recession, but the ONS said the economy would need to shrink by an almost unprecedented 1.5% in September alone for this to happen.
As well as Brexit, manufacturers across Europe have been hit by a rise in trade tensions between the United States and China.
The new managing director of the International Monetary Fund, Kristalina Georgieva, warned earlier this week that the world economy was suffering a ""synchronised slowdown"".
So far the Bank of England has not followed the U.S. Federal Reserve and European Central Bank and cut interest rates but last month one BoE policymaker, Michael Saunders, said this might prove necessary.
September's IHS Markit purchasing managers' index data released last week for the private sector pointed to a 0.1% contraction in the third quarter, with businesses reporting that foreign customers were staying away before Brexit.
The ONS said it had not received any substantive anecdotal evidence of the effect of Brexit preparations on the economy in August.
Industrial output dropped by 1.8%, the biggest annual fall in six years. Soft global demand was hurting demand for manufactured exports, the ONS said, and despite bright spots such as film and television production, growth in the dominant services industry slowed to zero in the month of August alone.
Reflecting slower export growth, August trade data showed Britain's goods trade deficit widened slightly to 9.8 billion pounds ($12.0 billion) from 9.6 billion pounds in July, broadly as expected by economists.

The total trade deficit for goods and services narrowed slightly to 1.5 billion pounds from 1.7 billion.

Initial claims for state unemployment benefits dropped 10,000 to a seasonally adjusted 210,000 for the week ended Oct. 5, the Labor Department said on Thursday. Data for the prior week was revised to show 1,000 more applications received than previously reported.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast claims unchanged at 219,000 in the latest week. The Labor Department said only claims for Nebraska were estimated last week.
Claims had risen for three straight weeks. Some of the increase in claims could have been the result of an ongoing strike by about 50,000 workers at General Motors (N:GM). 
While striking workers are not eligible for unemployment benefits, the work stoppage has affected production, impacting non-striking employees at suppliers.
Despite the low layoffs, the labor market is slowing as demand for labor cools against the backdrop of a step down in economic growth. 
Some of the loss in economic momentum is because of a 15-month trade war between the United States and China, which has weighed on business confidence and pushed manufacturing into recession. The fading stimulus from last year's $1.5 trillion tax cut package is also restraining growth.
Job openings fell to a 1-1/2-year low in August, the government reported on Wednesday.
The report came on the heels of data last week showing nonfarm payrolls rose by 136,000 jobs in September, down from 168,000 in August. The three-month average gain in private employment fell to 119,000, the smallest since July 2012, from 135,000 in August.
Job growth has averaged 161,000 per month this year, compared to a monthly gain of 223,000 in 2018. Job gains remain above the roughly 100,000 per month needed to keep up with growth in the working-age population. The unemployment rate fell to near a 50-year low of 3.5% in September from 3.7% in August.
The four-week moving average of initial claims, considered a better measure of labor market trends as it irons out week-to-week volatility, rose 1,000 to 213,750 last week.

The number of people receiving benefits after an initial week of aid increased 29,000 to 1.68 million for the week ended Sept. 28. The four-week moving average of the so-called continuing claims rose 2,500 to 1.67 million.

369,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 10, 2019 08:31AM ET</span>",U.S. industrial energy use falls as manufacturers struggle: Kemp,"By John Kemp
LONDON (Reuters) - U.S. industrial energy consumption is falling as manufacturing activity and freight movements decline, contributing to the surplus of natural gas and diesel, and intensifying downward pressure on prices.
Total energy consumption by the industrial sector fell for the first time since the slowdown of 2015/2016, after growing rapidly last year, data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration show.
Total consumption – including coal, gas, petroleum and electricity – fell slightly in the three months from April to June compared with the same period a year earlier.
Industrial energy consumption is likely to have fallen even further since then, given statistical indicators showing manufacturing and freight movements continued to decline during the third quarter.
In recent decades, there has been a close correlation between the Institute of Supply Management’s purchasing managers’ survey, the Federal Reserve’s industrial production index, and fuel consumption.
Volumes of gas delivered to industrial users fell more than 1% in the three months from May to July compared with a year earlier (“Monthly energy review”, EIA, Sept. 2019).
Gas deliveries to industry were down for the first time since the start of 2016, after growing at an annual rate of more than 4% in mid-2018 (https://tmsnrt.rs/2OBkKiI).
Diesel consumption was down by almost 2% year-on-year in May-July, a sharp turnaround from growth of 4% a year earlier.
Diesel consumption data is for all users, but most of the fuel is used by freight firms, manufacturers, miners, oil and gas drillers and farmers.
The slowdown in diesel mirrors a downturn in rail freight and a slowdown in road freight as the trade war with China and heightened business uncertainty have taken a toll on imports and the durable goods sector.
The number of shipping containers hauled by the major railroads was down 6% in the three months from June to August compared with a year earlier.
Truck tonnage was still up by around 4% year-on-year in June-August, but growth has halved since the middle of 2018, according to the Bureau of Transportation Statistics.
Slack consumption from industrial users has come at a time when oil and gas output is still growing thanks to the lagged effect of last year’s drilling boom.
The result has been a persistent oversupply of natural gas which has kept prices under pressure for much of the year as the market tries to rein in gas production.
Diesel prices have been firmer – but only because refiners have throttled back crude processing and diesel production rates since the second quarter to avoid flooding the market with fuel.

BERLIN (Reuters) - German exports fell by more than expected in August, data showed on Thursday, reinforcing expectations that a manufacturing slump is pushing Europe's largest economy into recession.
Reliant on exports, German factories are suffering from a slowing world economy and uncertainty linked to the trade dispute between the United States and China, as well as Britain's planned but delayed exit from the European Union.
The Federal Statistics Office said seasonally adjusted exports fell 1.8% on the month while imports rose 0.5%. The trade surplus narrowed to 18.1 billion euros ($19.9 billion) after an upwardly revised 20.5 billion euros in the prior month.
A Reuters poll of economists had pointed to a 1.0% drop in exports and a 0.2% fall in imports. The trade surplus was expected to come in at 19.1 billion euros.
The economy shrank by 0.1% in the second quarter, and recent data has pointed to continued weakness in manufacturing in the third quarter. Most economists define a recession as two straight quarters of contraction in gross domestic product (GDP).
""We will likely have a contraction in GDP in the third quarter, and thus a recession,"" said Uwe Burkert, economist at LBBW, a bank.
August's drop in exports was the steepest since April. A regional breakdown of annual trade figures showed the biggest slump in exports - a 4.8% drop - was to so-called 'third countries' beyond the European Union, which include China.
Data published on Monday showed German industrial orders fell more than expected in August on weaker domestic demand.
Prolonged weakness in Germany, a bellwether for the economic health of the euro zone, would be a headache for the European Central Bank, which in September pledged indefinite stimulus to revive the bloc's economy.
With the ECB already deploying hefty monetary stimulus, economists and German business lobby groups have urged Chancellor Angela Merkel to ditch her policy of no new debt and borrow to fund a stimulus package for the economy.
Last Wednesday, leading economic institutes slashed their growth forecasts for the economy for this year and next, blaming weaker global demand for manufacturing goods and increased business uncertainty linked to trade disputes.
The institutes also called on the coalition government to take on more debt if the growth outlook deteriorates. It has so far refused to do so.
Merkel's government has managed to raise public spending without incurring new debt since 2014, thanks to an unusually long growth cycle, record-high employment, buoyant tax revenues and the European Central Bank's bond-buying plan.
But with the economy slowing and tax revenues waning, the fiscal room to counter a recession is getting smaller. At the same time, Germany's borrowing costs have turned into premiums, which means investors are actually willing to pay the state a bonus for being able to lend it billions of euros."

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Approvals for new home loans in Australia jumped again in August with lending to investors rising the most in three years, in yet another sign that recent rate cuts and easing of lending rules was boosting activity in the housing market.
Home loans, a leading indicator for housing prices, showed a solid 3.2% gain in August to A$33.5 billion ($22.60 billion), Thursday's data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) showed.
Lending to property investors increased 6%, the largest increase since September 2016.
The figures will likely provide some support to housing prices and in turn consumer confidence, which hit a four-year low this month. Australia's housing stock is valued at A$6.8 trillion ($4.83 trillion), or almost four times the country's annual gross domestic product.
""This reinforces our view of a mini-boom for loans towards 20% y/y and prices nearing 10% y/y,"" said UBS economist George Tharenou
""If loans and prices surprisingly continued to boom, it would...raise the risk it stops the RBA from easing next year,"" added Tharenou, who expects further rate cuts by mid-2020.
The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) reduced its benchmark rate to a record low of 0.75% last week following two back-to-back easings in June and July to revive economic growth, employment and inflation. It has signaled to do more if needed.
RBA's aggressive cuts have helped revive home prices across Australia's capital cities since the middle of this year, although on a year-on-year basis they are still in negative territory.
Economic activity outside of housing is still subdued, however, with tepid wage growth and rising unemployment weighing on consumer spending.
Thursday's data showed personal finance commitments fell 2.2% in August followed by a 3.8% drop in July. Lending to businesses, which includes commercial as well as lease finance, slipped 2.1% to be down more than 6% from a year ago.
And despite the gains in home prices recently, many market players and analysts still have misgivings about a strong revival in the housing market.
A CoreLogic research released on Thursday showed the number of new real estate listings across Australia's capital cities over the past 28 days tracked at the lowest level for this time of the year since 2007.
""Despite rising home values in some cities and a lift in buyer numbers, the seasonal ramp up in fresh real estate listings has been mild relative to prior years,"" CoreLogic's head of research Tim Lawless wrote.
Lawless cited high transaction costs and dour consumer confidence among reasons.
""Historically, the seasonal peak in new listing numbers is around the second week of November, so there is still some time for the spring/early summer listing season to ramp up."""

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's core machinery orders slipped for the second consecutive month in August, suggesting deeper fissures in business investment and the broader economy from slowing global trade.
A slowdown in China and the U.S.-China trade war have emerged as risks for Japan's recovery prospects, but policymakers have put their faith in spending by consumers and businesses at home to offset the risks to the outlook.
Japan's core orders, a highly volatile data series regarded as an indicator of capital spending in the coming six to nine months, fell 2.4% in August from the previous month, Cabinet Office data showed on Thursday.
The drop was largely in line with a 2.5% decline predicted by economists in a Reuters poll and followed a sharp 6.6% fall in July, the largest month-on-month loss since a 7.8% drop in May.
From a year earlier, core orders, which exclude those of ships and electricity, lost 14.5% in August, the biggest year-on-year drop since November 2014, Refinitiv data showed.
""(The reading) suggests capital spending is weakening,"" said Atsushi Takeda, chief economist at Itochu Economic Research Institute.
""It's likely it has peaked out from a cyclical perspective, as pressure from the U.S.-China trade war continues and focus is also on the impact of the sales tax hike.""
Capital expenditure has been among the few areas of strength in the economy as non-manufacturers continue to invest heavily on automation to cope with a tight labor market, offsetting the weakness in manufacturers' spending. Declines in capex could add to speculation the government will boost spending.
The Bank of Japan has faced heightened expectations it could ease policy at its Oct. 30-31 board meeting to dampen the impact from weakening external demand.
Japan's economy has recently benefited from strong domestic demand, although there are concerns the country's higher consumption tax this month could hurt the outlook. A Reuters Tankan poll earlier on Thursday showed Japanese manufacturers' business outlook was less pessimistic in October while service-sector sentiment rose to a three-month high.
Some consolation this week also came from household spending data, which rose for a ninth straight month in August, the longest such streak since comparable data became available in 2001, data on Tuesday showed.
A bright spot in Thursday's data was a 21.3% month-on-month jump in orders from overseas, the biggest rise since October 2015, though it was mainly driven by big-ticket items, including for railway cars and planes.
Still, the outlook for Japan's economy, the world's third-largest, remains murky as manufacturers face challenges from prolonged contractions in exports and production.
While the economy grew an annualized 1.3% in the second quarter, some analysts have warned it could be left without growth drivers if domestic demand falters.
The Cabinet Office on Thursday maintained its assessment on machinery orders to say they are showing a pick up.
""There was a big rise in June and that was followed by a fall in July and August,"" said Yoshiki Shinke, chief economist at Dai-ichi Life Research Institute. 
By sector, core orders from manufacturers fell 1.0% in August from the previous month, declining again after rising in July, while those from the service-sector fell 8.0%, the Cabinet Office data showed.

TOKYO - Japanese manufacturers' business outlook was less pessimistic in October while service-sector sentiment rose to a three-month high, the Reuters Tankan poll found, likely easing fears for now of the world's third-largest economy falling into a recession.
The results could bolster the government's expectations that solid domestic demand will help counter the drag from exports, as the Sino-U.S. trade war and global slowdown weigh on the country's economic growth. That offers relief to policymakers who are under pressure to deploy further stimulus to prevent the trade-dependent economy from falling into a recession.
Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has vowed to take ""all possible steps"" if risks to the economy mount, echoing a pledge made by the central bank and signaling the prospect of fiscal stimulus in case this month's sales tax increase triggers a sharp economic downturn.
Underlining the rocky road ahead, the monthly poll, which tracks the Bank of Japan's (BOJ) closely-watched tankan quarterly survey, foresees manufacturers' mood slipping over the coming three months and service-sector morale sliding.
In the Reuters poll of 504 large- and mid-sized companies, in which 248 firms responded on condition of anonymity, manufacturers voiced worry about the protracted trade war and slowdown in China's economy -- Japan's largest trading partner.
Still, some Japanese firms do not see the impact of the global slowdown immediately hurting the export-reliant economy.
A manager of an electrical machinery maker said business conditions had turned out to be ""unexpectedly"" good, although the domestic economy was likely to worsen due to slowdown in China, Asia and the United States from the trade war.
""Demand for capital expenditure at manufacturers has proven surprisingly resilient, and it looks to be avoiding the kind of slump we had expected,"" the manager wrote in the survey.
The sentiment index for manufacturers stood at minus 5, up two points from the prior month's 6-1/2-year low of minus 7, according to the survey conducted Sept. 26 to Oct. 7.
The index is expected to swing to minus 6 in January.
The service-sector index climbed to plus 25, up from plus 19 in the previous month, led by retailers who have likely benefited from consumers rushing to beat the Oct. 1 sales tax which went up to 10% from 8%.
Still, retailers' sentiment index was seen falling to zero in January, after surging 20 points to plus 30 in October. The sharp retreat highlights concerns over the effects of the tax hike on private consumption, which accounts for around 60% of the economy.
The overall service-sector index is expected to fall to plus 15 in January.
The BOJ's last tankan in early October showed that big manufacturers' business confidence worsened to a six-year low in the July-September quarter, a sign the year-long U.S.-China trade war was taking a heavier toll on the Japanese economy.

The Reuters Tankan indexes are calculated by subtracting the percentage of pessimistic respondents from optimistic ones. A negative figure means pessimists outnumber optimists.

The Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (RICS) said new sales instructions fell last month at the fastest pace since June 2016, when Britain voted to leave the EU in a referendum.
New buyer inquiries were down by the most since April, and sales fell by the most since February.
""Unless there is a speedy resolution to the ongoing impasse it does seem inevitable that the stand-off between purchasers and sellers will deepen,"" RICS economist Simon Rubinsohn said.
Prime Minister Boris Johnson has vowed to take Britain out of the EU by Oct. 31, without a transition deal if necessary. But parliament has ordered him to delay Brexit if he cannot broker a new deal to smooth the economic shock.
RICS's headline house price index edged up, rising to a three-month high of -2 from -4 in August, compared with economists' average forecast in a Reuters poll for a dip to -7.
RICS said the index was consistent with a broadly flat trend in national house price inflation.
Downward pressure on prices was once again strongest in the London area, while RICS said house price gains remained solid in Northern Ireland, Scotland and northwest England.
RICS members expect more widespread price falls over the next three months before a pick-up over the coming year.
Mortgage lender Halifax said on Monday that average house prices rose by 1.1% in the year to September, the smallest rise in more than six years."
375,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 09, 2019 03:34PM ET</span>",Decreasing U.S. job openings point to cooling labor market,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. job openings fell to a 1-1/2-year low in August and hiring declined, suggesting employment growth was slowing largely because of ebbing demand for labor as the economy loses momentum.
Despite the third straight monthly drop in vacancies reported by the Labor Department on Wednesday, job openings are still plenty enough to ease financial market fears of a looming recession. Job openings are being closely watched for signs of whether an erosion in business confidence, which has weighed on capital investment, is spilling over to hiring.
A 15-month trade war between the United States and China has hurt business confidence, leading to a retrenchment in business spending and a downturn in manufacturing. The trade war has stoked financial market fears of a recession.
""The labor market is slipping a little, but it's not flashing any recession signals yet,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG in New York. ""You can't have a recession with 7 million help wanted signs posted up in factory and store windows around the country.""
Job openings, a measure of labor demand, dropped by 123,000 to a seasonally adjusted 7.05 million in August, the lowest level since March 2018, the government said in its monthly Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey, or JOLTS.
Job openings have been trending lower this year since scaling an all-time high of 7.63 million in late 2018. The job openings rate fell to 4.4% in August from 4.5% in July.
While the Federal Reserve continues to view the labor market as strong, minutes of the U.S. central bank's Sept. 17-18 policy meeting showed some officials believed ""it would be important to be vigilant in monitoring incoming data for any sign of softening in labor market conditions.""
This was in response to a recent estimate from the Labor Department that the economy created 501,000 fewer jobs in the 12 months through March 2019 than previously reported, the biggest downward revision in the level of employment in a decade. 
That suggested job growth over that period averaged around 170,000 per month instead of 210,000. 
U.S. stocks were trading higher as a report that China was open to a partial trade deal soothed investor nerves ahead of high-level talks on Thursday. The dollar was little changed against a basket of currencies and U.S. Treasury prices fell.
The reduction in vacancies in August was led by manufacturing, with job openings in the nondurable goods industries falling by 49,000. Manufacturing, which the Trump administration has sought to boost with import tariffs, has ironically borne the brunt of the trade war. 
The White House says the duties are necessary to protect manufacturing from what it says is unfair foreign competition.
There were 47,000 fewer job openings in the information sector in August. Economists said the JOLTS data would be closely monitored for clues as to when the longest economic expansion in history, now in its 11th year, might end.

HIRING FALLS
""Although we only have data for the two prior recessions, on both occasions there was a decline in the job openings rate before the onset of recession,"" said John Ryding, chief economist at RDQ Economics in New York. 
""The job openings data bear close watching in the coming months to see if the softening in corporate demand for capex (capital expenditures) is beginning to spill over in the demand for labor."" 
Hiring declined by 199,000 jobs to 5.8 million in August, led by decreases in the private sector, which fell by 219,000. Federal government hiring increased by 35,000, likely reflecting recruitment for the 2020 Census. The hiring rate slipped to 3.8% from 3.9% in July.
The decrease in hiring fits in with a declining trend in job growth. Nonfarm payrolls rose by 136,000 jobs in September, down from 168,000 in August, the government reported last Friday. The three-month average gain in private employment fell to 119,000, the smallest since July 2012, from 135,000 in August. 
Job gains remain above the roughly 100,000 per month needed to keep up with growth in the working-age population. The unemployment rate fell to near a 50-year low of 3.5% in September from 3.7% in August.
There were 1.17 unfilled jobs for every unemployed person in August. With the labor market slowing, the number of workers voluntarily quitting their jobs dropped.
The quits rate fell to 2.3% from 2.4% in July. The quits rate is viewed by policymakers and economists as a measure of job market confidence. Layoffs were little changed in August, with the rate holding at 1.2%. 
Slowing economic growth was underscored by a separate report from the Commerce Department on Wednesday showing wholesale inventories rose by a revised 0.2% in August. Stocks at wholesalers were previously estimated to have advanced 0.4%.
August's gain matched July's increase, suggesting inventory investment could remain a drag on economic growth in the third quarter. The pace of inventory accumulation has been slowing after stocks increased strongly from the third quarter of 2018 through the first quarter of this year. 
The inventory overhang has led businesses to place fewer orders at factories, contributing to the manufacturing slump.
""The current inventory glut spells problems for U.S. production and output growth over the next few quarters,"" said Maria Cosma, an economist at Moody's Analytics in West Chester, Pennsylvania. ""As long as the inventory-to-sales ratio remains elevated, producers do not have the go-ahead to ramp up production."" 

A slower pace of inventory accumulation in the second quarter contributed to holding back economic growth to a 2.0% annualized rate during the period. The economy grew at a 3.1% pace in the first quarter. Growth estimates for the third quarter range from as low as a 1.5% annualized rate to as high as a 2.0% pace.

The Commerce Department said on Wednesday that wholesale inventories rose 0.2% in August instead of the previously reported 0.4% gain. Stocks at wholesalers increased 0.2% in July. They advanced 6.2% on a year-on-year basis in August.
The component of wholesale inventories that goes into the calculation of gross domestic product rose 0.2% in August.
The pace of inventory accumulation has been slowing after stocks increased strongly from the third quarter of 2018 through the first quarter of this year. The inventory overhang has led businesses to place fewer orders at factories, contributing to a downturn in manufacturing activity.
Inventory accumulation slowed in the second quarter, helping to hold back economic growth to a 2.0% annualized rate during the period. Some of the moderation in the pace of accumulation reflects an acceleration in consumer spending in the second quarter.
Businesses are also carefully managing stock levels as the economy's outlook continues to darken amid lingering trade tensions between the United States and China, which have stoked financial market fears of a recession.
The economy grew at a 3.1% pace in the first quarter. Growth estimates for the third quarter range from as low as a 1.5% annualized rate to as high as a 2.0% pace.
In August, wholesale auto inventories edged up 0.1% after jumping 0.7% in the prior month. Hardware inventories surged 1.8%, the most since October 2018. There were also increases in machinery, apparel, electrical and lumber inventories.
But furniture and professional equipment inventories fell. Petroleum inventories tumbled 4.5%, the most since December 2018, after dropping 0.9% in July.
Sales at wholesalers were unchanged in August after rising 0.2% in July. Motor vehicle sales increased 0.8% in August after rising 0.5% in the previous month. Apparel sales dropped 5.1%, the largest decline in a year, after falling 2.1% in July.
At August's sales pace it would take wholesalers 1.36 months to clear shelves, unchanged from July."
377,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 09, 2019 06:06AM ET</span>","Zimbabwe quadruples electricity prices, pummelling impoverished consumers","By MacDonald Dzirutwe
HARARE (Reuters) - Zimbabwe hiked its average electricity tariff by 320% on Wednesday to ramp up power supplies at a time of daily blackouts, but the move will anger consumers already grappling with soaring inflation that is eroding their earnings.
The southern African nation is experiencing its worst economic crisis in a decade, seen in triple-digit inflation, 18-hour power cuts and shortages of U.S. dollars, medicines and fuel that have evoked the dark days of the 2008 hyperinflation under late President Robert Mugabe.
The second increase in the price of electricity inside three months follows sharp rises in fuel and basic goods prices in the last week. But salaries have not kept pace, prompting citizens to blame President Emmerson Mnangagwa's policies for the crisis.
The Zimbabwe Energy Regulatory Authority (ZERA) said it had approved an application by Zimbabwe Electricity Transmission and Distribution Company (ZETDC) to raise the tariff to 162.16 cents (10.61 U.S. cents) from 38.61 cents.
ZERA said the tariff hike was necessary after inflation soared - the IMF says it was about 300% in August - and due to a plummeting Zimbabwe dollar currency, which was re-introduced in June. 
The currency has since then lost 58.61% of its value against the U.S. dollar on the official market and more on a thriving black market.
Consumers seem set for more increases after the energy regulator said starting November, the power utility would index its tariff to the U.S. dollar to enable it ""to recover from inflation and exchange rate changes.""
The new tariff would allow ZETDC to raise money to repair its generators, as well as pay for imports from South Africa's Eskom and Mozambique which cost U.S. $19.5 million every month, the regulator said.
Hopes that Zimbabwe's economy would quickly rebound under Mnangagwa, who took over after the late Robert Mugabe was deposed in a coup in November 2017, have faded fast as ordinary people grapple with soaring inflation which has eroded earnings and savings.
On Monday, treasury data showed the economy was worse off than initially thought as it is projected to contract by up to 6% this year due to the power cuts that have hit mines, industry and homes and an El Nino induced drought that has left the country needing to import food. 

Mnangagwa, who critics accuse of lacking commitment to political reforms and using his predecessor's heavy-handed tactics to stifle dissent, has pleaded for time and patience to bring the economy back from the ""dead.""

378,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 08, 2019 07:11PM ET</span>",English house builders report weakest demand since 2013,"LONDON (Reuters) - Demand for newly built houses in England has fallen to a six-year low as home buyers await more certainty over Brexit before going ahead with a major purchase, according to an annual survey of small construction companies.
The Federation of Master Builders (FMB), a trade body, said its members considered land, finance and skilled workers easier to find than a year ago, but that demand from home buyers had slowed further to its lowest since 2013.
""Small house builders are starting to see the effects of Brexit uncertainty taking its toll on consumer confidence. Many prospective homeowners are clearly holding off buying until there is more political and economic certainty,"" FMB chief executive Brian Berry said.
Britain is due to leave the European Union on Oct. 31 and Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said he will do so without a transition deal if necessary, despite a parliamentary vote ordering him to delay Brexit if he cannot reach an agreement.
Other business surveys have also shown a downturn in recent months. September's IHS Markit construction purchasing managers' index (PMI), which focuses on larger construction companies, fell to its second-lowest reading since the financial crisis.
Small construction companies, which typically build fewer than 10 homes a year, account for about a quarter of house building in Britain, according to the FMB, with most construction dominated by a handful of larger firms.
A shortage of small plots of land with development permission remained the biggest barrier facing firms, followed by financing conditions.
The proportion of builders reporting constraints due to a lack of skilled workers fell especially sharply, dropping to 26% from 44% - in contrast to widespread reports of skill shortages in the sector - though firms expected worse shortages next year.
The survey was based on responses from 154 small construction companies, all operating in England."
379,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 08, 2019 12:09PM ET</span>",Soft U.S. producer inflation supports case for Fed rate cut,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. producer prices unexpectedly fell in September, leading to the smallest annual increase in nearly three years, likely giving the Federal Reserve further room to cut interest rates for the third time this year in October.
The weak producer inflation readings reported by the Labor Department on Tuesday came against the backdrop of a slowing economy amid trade tensions and cooling growth overseas. The Trump administration's 15-month trade war with China has eroded business investment and pushed manufacturing into recession.
Economists say the broad weakness in producer inflation was a reflection of the downturn in the factory sector. 
""This is helping to build the case for the Fed to take out some more insurance to guard against a broader downturn in the economy ,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG in New York. ""The trade war is hurting margins and pricing power for manufacturers, making it hard to see how America is winning this trade war with the world.""
The producer price index for final demand dropped 0.3% last month, weighed down by decreases in the costs of goods and services, the government said. That was the largest decline since January and followed a 0.1% gain in August.
In the 12 months through September the PPI increased 1.4%, the smallest gain since November 2016, after rising 1.8% in August. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the PPI nudging up 0.1% in September and advancing 1.8% on a year-on-year basis.
Excluding the volatile food, energy and trade services components, producer prices were unchanged last month after jumping 0.4% in August. The so-called core PPI increased 1.7% in the 12 months through September after climbing 1.9% in August.
The Fed, which has a 2% annual inflation target, tracks the core personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index for monetary policy. The core PCE price index rose 1.8% on a year-on-year basis in August and has undershot its target this year.
Some economists expect the U.S. central bank could cut rates at its Oct. 29-30 policy meeting amid signs that the U.S.-China trade war was impacting the broader economy. 
While the unemployment rate dropped to near a 50-year low of 3.5% in September, hiring slowed significantly, with the three-month average gain in private payrolls falling to 119,000 jobs, the smallest since July 2012, from 135,000 in August.
In addition, private services industry growth slowed to a three-year low in September.
A report on Tuesday from the National Federation of Independent Business showed confidence among small businesses dropped in September. The NFIB said the trade war was ""adversely impacting many small firms,"" noting that ""owners are more reluctant to make major spending commitments.""
The Fed cut rates in September after reducing borrowing costs in July for the first time since 2008, to keep the longest economic expansion on record, now in its 11th year, on track.
U.S. financial markets were little moved by the inflation data as investors digested news that the White House was moving ahead with discussions around possible restrictions on capital flows into China, with a focus on investments made by U.S. government pension funds.
The dollar inched up against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices rose. Stocks on Wall Street were trading lower. 
BROAD WEAKNESS
Though the relationship between producer and consumer inflation has weakened following the revamping of the PPI basket several years ago, economists expect a weak consumer price index reading in September. According to a Reuters survey of economists, the CPI likely rose 0.1% in September after a similar gain in August. 
""The drop in the PPI in September does lend some downside risk to the CPI forecast,"" said Ryan Sweet, a senior economist at Moody's Analytics in West Chester, Pennsylvania.
The CPI data will be published on Thursday.
In September, wholesale energy prices fell 2.5%, matching August's decline. They were pulled down by a 7.2% decline in gasoline prices, which followed a 6.6% percent drop in August.
Gasoline accounted for three quarters of the 0.4% drop in goods prices last month. Goods prices decreased 0.5% in August. In the 12 months through September, goods prices declined 0.5%, the most since August 2016. 
Wholesale food prices rebounded 0.3% in September, lifted by a 26.8% surge in the cost of chicken eggs. Food prices dropped 0.6% in August. Core goods prices fell 0.1% last month. They were unchanged in August. 
The cost of services fell 0.2%, the most since February 2017, after increasing 0.3% in August. Services were dragged down by a 1.0% tumble in trade services, which measure changes in margins received by wholesalers and retailers.
Nearly half of the drop in services was attributed to a 2.7% decrease in machinery and vehicle wholesaling. 
The cost of healthcare services rose 0.3% after climbing 0.2% in August. The cost of hospital outpatient care surged 1.1%, the biggest rise since 2014, after slipping 0.1% in August. 
There were gains in the costs of doctor visits and hospital inpatient care. Portfolio management fees were unchanged last month after increasing 0.5% in August. Those fees and healthcare costs feed into the core PCE price index.
Economists at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) said while they expected medical care costs in the core PCE price index to jump 0.4% in September after being soft in August, they did not anticipate a similarly strong core inflation reading.
""The broader core PCE price index may not be especially strong given softness in some other PPI components that are used as source data for PCE prices,"" said JPMorgan economist Daniel Silver. 

The September PCE price index data will be published at the end of the month.

The dollar fell.
Excluding food and energy, producer prices decreased 0.3% in September from the prior month, compared with forecasts for a 0.2% increase, a Labor Department report showed Tuesday. The gauge was up 2% from a year earlier, the smallest gain in two years. The overall producer-price index also dropped 0.3% from August and was up 1.4% from a year earlier, the least since November 2016.
Key Insights
The biggest monthly drop in the core PPI since February 2015 suggests weaker demand is forcing companies to lower prices and preventing them from passing along any higher costs resulting from tariffs. Subdued inflation, at the producer and consumer levels, provides space for the Fed to lower borrowing costs with little concern that price gains will surpass the central bank’s goal. Policy makers next meet Oct. 29-30.The report, which measures wholesale and other business selling costs, reflected monthly declines in indexes for machinery and vehicle wholesaling, as well as fuels and apparel retailing. Transportation and warehousing prices also dropped, while the index for hospital outpatient care increased.The U.S.-China trade war intensified in September when a new 15% tariff on about $112 billion of Chinese products took effect. This tranche, along with the batch that will impact about $160 billion worth of goods in December, more directly targets American consumers.Analysts monitor this report to assess potential price pressures set to show up at the consumer level. A more closely-watched measure of inflation, the core consumer price index, is estimated to have risen 2.4% from a year earlier in data released Thursday, which would equal the August reading.Get More

The National Federation of Independent Business’s optimism index declined 1.3 points to 101.8 in September, the third drop in four months, according to data released Tuesday. While the gauge remains elevated by historical standards, it’s the lowest since March and close to January’s 101.2, which was the weakest since Trump’s term began in early 2017. Analysts expected a reading of 102.
The report adds to signs that the economy is cooling but not yet sliding into recession. Data last week showed the U.S. added fewer jobs than expected in September, while services and manufacturing activity weakened. At the same time, unemployment at a half-century low indicates the labor market remains tight, and the Federal Reserve’s two straight interest-rate cuts should support growth.
Most components in the NFIB index declined. Twenty-two percent of respondents said the next three months is a good time to expand, the lowest since February, and a net 9% said they expect business conditions to be better six months from now, the lowest since January.

383,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 08, 2019 05:33AM ET</span>",Surprise rise in German output is just 'flash in the pan',"BERLIN (Reuters) - German industrial output rose unexpectedly in August but analysts said Europe's biggest economy remains at risk of recession after months of contraction in manufacturing. 
Industrial output rose 0.3% on the month after two successive monthly drops, Statistics Office figures showed on Tuesday, defying expectations of a 0.1% decline.
The rise was driven by production of intermediate and capital goods, the Economy Ministry said. Manufacturing rose 0.7% while construction fell by 1.5%, the data showed.
Germany's export-dependent manufacturing sector is already in recession. That has dragged on the economy as a whole, which shrank in the second quarter. Economists expect another slight economic contraction in the July-September period.
Uncertainties linked to Britain's planned departure from the European Union and global trade disputes are starting to hurt Germany's labor market, which has been the backbone of a consumption-driven growth cycle as exports weaken.
""Given that industrial output provides us with a deep look into the economic development in the third quarter, one could entertain the idea that the German economy will just about avoid a recession,"" Thomas Gitzel of VP Bank wrote in a note.
""But unfortunately one must consider the industrial production data for August as a flash in the pan,"" he added. ""We expect production in September to be negative. This means that GDP will contract at least slightly in the third quarter.""
In another sign that the gloom in manufacturing will continue, the BGA trade association on Tuesday slashed its 2019 trade forecasts. It expects exports to grow by a maximum of 0.5% this year from a previous prediction of 1.5%.
STIMULUS NEEDED
July's output reading was revised up to a fall of 0.4% from a previously reported drop of 0.6%. On Monday, data showed that industrial orders had fallen more than expected in August on weaker domestic demand.
Chancellor Angela Merkel's right-left coalition government has resisted calls for a substantial spending package to offset the slowdown and put the economy back on a growth path. 
Peter Vanden Houte of ING warned it was too early to talk about a trend reversal in German manufacturing despite August's rise in output, adding that the big picture remains negative.
""The omen remains bleak,"" he wrote in a note. ""As long as world trade stagnates, German industry and by extension the whole German economy is almost certainly bound to languish.""
Prolonged weakness in Germany, a bellwether for the economic health of the euro zone, would be a headache for the European Central Bank, which in September pledged indefinite stimulus to revive the bloc's economy. 
Economists and German business lobby groups have urged Merkel to ditch her policy of no new debt and borrow to fund a stimulus package for the economy.
Pressure on her to act will intensify if the economy continues to weaken.
""We believe that at the beginning of next year, additional budgetary stimulus might be put in place, paving the way for an economic upturn in the course of 2020,"" said ING's Vanden Houte.

Confidence among businesses has ebbed to its lowest levels since the global financial crisis.
The labor market, which has long been a silver lining for the economy, is also starting to show signs of slowing, raising questions about the strength of consumer spending.
The different Brexit scenarios for the world's fifth-largest economy make it hard to gauge the outlook for the year ahead, not least for the Bank of England, and some investors fear Britain is already flirting with recession.
Economists polled by Reuters last month put the probability of a recession within a year at 35%. [ECILT/GB]
Below are some indicators of the British economy and how they have changed since the June 2016 Brexit vote.
BUSINESSES STRUGGLE
Pessimism among businesses has reached the highest levels in years.
The gauges of future activity in the Lloyds (LON:LLOY) Business Barometer, CBI Growth Indicator and IHS Markit/CIPS surveys have all turned weakened recently.

HOUSEHOLDS STILL SPENDING
Household spending has supported Britain's economy since the Brexit vote, although there are signs that households have spent more on non-discretionary goods such as food, while spending in restaurants and hotels has weakened.
As of the second quarter, spending on the latter was about 1.5% lower than in mid-2016, but nearly 7% higher for food and non-alcoholic drinks, according to official data.
Figures from the British Retail Consortium and payment card company Barclaycard published on Monday showed shop chains had their worst September since records started in 1995, although spending on entertainment increased.

LABOR MARKET
The labor market is the strong point of Britain's economy but some cracks have appeared recently. Employment fell in annualized terms in the six months to July 2019 to the greatest extent since early 2012.
Wage growth is at a decade-high although the BoE has said it may have peaked and there has been no pickup in productivity.
A measure that BoE policymakers like to look at -- the three-month annualized growth rate of private sector earnings, excluding bonuses -- slowed in July from an almost five-year high of 5.9% in June.

INVESTMENT
Although the Office for National Statistics has revised up the level of business investment in Britain's economy lately, the figures still show capital expenditure has stagnated since the Brexit vote.
Business investment is running about 5 billion pounds lower than it would have been had it followed its pre-Brexit vote trend since the financial crisis, according to the latest data.

386,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 07, 2019 10:13PM ET</span>",China services sector growth falls to seven-month low: Caixin PMI,"BEIJING (Reuters) - China's services sector grew at its slowest pace in seven months in September despite a strong increase in new orders, as operating expenses continued to rise at the end of the third quarter, a private survey showed on Tuesday. 
Services account for more than half of China's economy, providing a key buffer as persistent trade tensions with the United States weigh heavily on the country's manufacturing sector. 
The Caixin/Markit services purchasing managers' index (PMI) fell to 51.3 last month, the weakest since February, versus August's 52.1. It has stayed above the 50-point that separates growth from contraction on a monthly basis since late 2005. 
The fall was in line with the marginal drop in the official non-manufacturing PMI published by the National Bureau of Statistics. It was also in step with signs of general cooling this year as the world's second-largest economy continues to lose momentum.
New orders for services in September grew at the fastest pace since January 2018, buoyed by product launches and stronger customer demand.
But operating costs hit a one-year high because of an increase in labor, fuel and raw material expenses. 
A continued push among firms to stay competitive also limited the increase in prices that they charged, pressuring profit margins. 
""China's economy showed signs of marginal recovery in September, as the labor market improved and domestic demand increased at a faster pace,"" said Zhong Zhengsheng, director of macroeconomic analysis at CEBM Group, in a statement alongside the data.
""However, fluctuations in exchange rates, and rising costs of labor and raw materials increased pressure on companies, which restrained business confidence.""
The volume of new work from abroad received increased for the third straight month in September. But after seasonal adjustments, the pace of growth further eased from July. 
Expectations regarding the one-year outlook for business activity softened slightly in September. But services firms added jobs at the fastest pace since January 2017. 
Beijing has rolled out a mix of fiscal stimulus and monetary easing since early 2018 to cushion the economic slowdown, including hundreds of billions of dollars in infrastructure spending and tax cuts for companies.
But those measures have been slow to trickle through the economy, and with U.S. trade pressure persisting, analysts say a deeper downturn could be inevitable without further policy support. 

Caixin's composite manufacturing and services PMI, also released on Tuesday, rose to a five-month high of 51.9 in September from 51.6 in August, though new export orders again contracted.

National Australia Bank Ltd's (NAB) (AX:NAB) index of business conditions inched up 1 point to +2 in September, but still recorded a sixth consecutive below-average month. The survey's volatile measure of business confidence declined to 0.
""While both conditions and confidence remain below average levels of +6 index points - the broad-based trend decline since mid-2018 appears to have slowed,"" NAB Group Chief Economist Alan Oster said.
""Rate cuts will help but will lag and with weak consumer (sentiment) and higher global uncertainty, we are unlikely to see a material improvement in the short-term.""
Australia's A$1.95 trillion ($1.31 trillion) economy has dodged recession since the early 1990s but has now hit a soft patch, with sluggish consumer spending and lackluster wage growth leading to a broader slowdown.
The Reserve Bank of Australia has responded to recent gloomy data by slashing interest rates for a third time this year to a record low 0.75%, with the most recent easing just last week. Financial futures imply one more 25-basis-point cut by year-end.
Still, forward-looking indicators in the NAB survey remained subdued in September. Forward orders, historically the most reliable indicator of domestic demand, clocked at -2 from -4 in August.
Measures of inflation were also sluggish with labor and retail costs easing modestly.
In the face of slowing business activity and a pull-back in expansion plans, the employment index rose 1 point to +3."

An index of vacancies in a monthly labor market survey from the Recruitment and Employment Confederation (REC) fell to its lowest since January 2012 at 52.6, down from 52.8 in August.
The survey of recruitment firms chimes with official data which showed job creation in Britain started to wane ahead of the October Brexit deadline, although wage growth has risen to an 11-year high in recent months.
""Businesses are positive about their own prospects, but ongoing Brexit uncertainty has led many firms to delay projects and hiring decisions,"" REC chief executive Neil Carberry said.

Real wages dipped 0.6% in August from a year earlier, labor ministry data showed on Tuesday, following a revised 1.7% annual drop in July.
Monthly wage data showed nominal total cash earnings fell 0.2% in August, down for a second straight month.
Regular pay, which accounts for the bulk of monthly wages, was up 0.3%, rising for a second month in a row.
One-off special payments declined 11.4% in August from a year earlier, after a revised 3.3% decline in July.
Overtime pay was up 0.9% in August from a year earlier, up for a second straight month.
Weak wages add to worries that Japan's sales tax increase to 10% from 8% could cut into consumer spending. A previous tax increase in 2014 hurt sentiment and helped lead to an economic downturn.
Japan's economy has slowed as the U.S.-China trade war and weak external demand hurt the export-reliant economy. The affect of the higher levy could slow the pace of recovery.
Revelations this year that labor ministry officials used faulty polling methods, which forced revisions, cast doubt on the accuracy of the ministry's wage data from 2004 to 2017.
The error has made it harder to assess the actual status of wages."

The ""Golden Week"" break, which started with National Day on Oct. 1 and ended on Monday, provides an important snapshot of Chinese consumers and tourists and their changing tastes and habits.
Overall revenue from retail and dining during the period rose 8.5% from a year earlier to 1.52 trillion yuan ($212.6 billion), helped by higher sales of white goods and increased spending on tourism and entertainment, state media reported, citing data from the commerce ministry.
That compares with a drop of 6.7% during the National Day holiday last year, the only decline since at least 2009 when the data became publicly available.
However, this year's gain is still modest compared with the double-digit percentage increases in previous years.
Monthly growth in China's retail sales of consumer goods has slowed to single-digits since the start of 2018 from gains of more than 10% in previous years, weighed down by softer domestic demand.
The retail sales data is published by the National Bureau of Statistics, and does not include spending on consumer services. The bureau will release retail sales figures for September later this month.
China said in August it would roll out a plan to boost disposable income in 2019 and in 2020 to spur private consumption. No details were given. [nL4N25C28S]
It also said local governments that have restrictions on auto sales should explore gradually relaxing or removing those curbs, while they should also encourage the purchases of new energy vehicles.
To encourage consumption, some Chinese cities have extended retail hours to promote ""the night economy"", loosely defined as the 6 p.m. to 6 a.m. period, with cinemas, museums, gyms, supermarkets and tourist sites open for longer.
The city of Beijing has also offered subsidies to households looking to buy electrical appliances like a television or a refrigerator.
In the run-up to the National Day holidays this year, many local governments across the country had ramped up tourism campaigns, enticing tourists with new destinations and promises of cheaper holidays."

Data from the national statistics agency showed that when adjusted for seasonal swings, the gauge of spending on machinery, equipment and new construction in Latin America's second-largest economy tumbled by 9.1% compared to July 2018.
The annual decline was the biggest since November 2009.
Gross fixed investment has fallen in annual terms in all but one of the eight months for which data has been reported since Lopez Obrador took office in December last year.
Investor confidence has been unsettled by a number of decisions made by Lopez Obrador, notably his cancellation of a partly-built, $13 billion Mexico City airport, a project he said was tainted by corruption and geologically unsound.
The veteran leftist has also cast doubt on other projects agreed under the previous government, including several natural gas pipeline contracts that he argued were unfair to Mexico.
That led to a renegotiation of the payment structure for the gas pipeline contracts which the government said would ultimately save Mexico $4.5 billion.
Lopez Obrador assumed power promising to rev up economic growth to an average of 4% per annum during his six-year term. But the economy has struggled to gain traction and narrowly avoided slipping into a recession in the first half of 2019.
Compared with the previous month, gross fixed investment fell in July by 0.7% in adjusted terms, the third consecutive monthly decrease, the statistics agency's data showed.
In unadjusted terms, Mexican gross fixed investment was 7.6% lower than in July 2018, the agency said."

Italy's new government, made up of the anti-establishment 5-Star Movement and the center-left Democratic Party, has promised an expansionary 2020 budget to try to revive chronically stagnant growth in the euro zone's third largest economy.
Investment spending in Italy amounts to 2% of gross domestic product, a third less than at the start of the decade. Private investments are also below pre-crisis levels having shrunk by 30% between 2007 and 2013, according to the Bank of Italy.
Gualtieri told a conference organized by Italian business lobby Confindustria that the 2020 budget would renew the tax breaks, which would otherwise expire at the end of the year.
""We also want to extend the incentives to those investments that support the transition to environmental sustainability,"" he added.
The government must present its next budget by mid-October.
The measures currently in place, introduced by the center-left government of former Prime Minister Matteo Renzi under the ""Industry 4.0"" label, allow businesses investing to write off more quickly the value of ""smart equipment"" - reducing tax payments.
Gualtieri, who last week presented updated budget forecasts, said that also European Union budget rules should offer ""a more favorable framework for investments""."
393,By Bloomberg,"<span>Oct 07, 2019 07:57AM ET</span>",Euro-Area Investor Sentiment Drop Highlights ECB Stimulus Limits,"(Bloomberg) -- The European Central Bank’s latest stimulus salvo is failing to spark animal spirits, with investor sentiment in the region falling to the lowest level in more than six years.
The Sentix economic index for the euro area dropped to -16.8 in October, the weakest level since April 2013. The slump comes just weeks after the ECB cut interest rates and decided to restart bond purchases, adding fresh evidence that investors may be losing faith in the central bank’s ability to boost economic growth.
“Fears of recession are and remain immanent,” Sentix managing director Patrick Hussy said, drawing particular attention to a continued slide in investors’ assessment of the current situation. “The central bankers have not succeeded in breaking the downward spiral with the measures taken so far.”
Economic indicators are flashing red as a slump in manufacturing, which started as a temporary obstacle to growth last year, increasingly affects domestic demand. Germany, once the engine of the 19-nation euro area, has probably fallen into recession and momentum in the rest of the region is faltering.
Policy makers at the ECB have called on European governments to step in with fiscal support, arguing that monetary stimulus alone can’t deliver the necessary boost. Yet governments have been reluctant, with Chancellor Angela Merkel’s administration indicating that the situation has to deteriorate before significant aid will be unlocked.
“There is a lack of awareness on the part of politicians and the public that quick answers must be found in order to counter the pace of the downturn,” Hussy said. “Monetary impulses are expected to produce wonders that they are increasingly no longer able to achieve on their own. The reaction of investors to this is clear.”"
394,By Bloomberg,"<span>Oct 07, 2019 07:54AM ET</span>",German Factory Slump Deepens as Investors See Eurozone Recession,"(Bloomberg) -- Europe’s troubles intensified on Monday, with German industry suffering a fresh blow and investors turning more gloomy about the region’s economy.
German factory orders fell 0.6% in August, twice as much as forecast by economists. While the number can be volatile, it means demand has now fallen on a year-on-year basis for 15 straight months.
The decline is just the latest in a string of negative news that’s driving increased pessimism about the euro area. In a separate report, Sentix said its gauge for the region fell to a six-year low this month, and investors downgraded their view to “recession” from “downturn.”
The expansion of recession concerns to the broader euro area shows the mounting distress about Europe’s prospects. It also adds to evidence that investors may be losing faith in the European Central Bank’s ability to boost growth after it announced new monetary stimulus in September.
The gloom about Europe continues to drive demand for the safety of German bonds, where 10-year yields fell back to -0.6% on Monday. The euro slipped 0.1%, remaining below $1.10. It briefly dropped to the lowest since May 2017 earlier this month.
Much of the weakness is centered on Germany, which probably slipped into a technical recession in the last quarter. A manufacturing slump that initially looked like a temporary issue has proved more long-lasting, and prospects remain uncertain amid increased risks of a no-deal Brexit and an intensifying trade war.
Business expectations in Germany fell to the lowest in a decade in September, with the mood among factory executives cited as the main reason. Sentix’s German index is also at the weakest in 10 years, and industrial production figures on Tuesday are forecast to show a third straight decline.
What Bloomberg’s Economists Say...
“The German economy is probably already in recession. Factory orders dropped in August, having already plunged in July. That corroborates with other indicators that point to Germany’s industrial sector remaining in a funk.” -- Niraj Shah. 
Policy makers at the ECB have called on European governments to step in with fiscal support, arguing that monetary stimulus alone can’t deliver the necessary boost.
Yet governments have been reluctant, with Chancellor Angela Merkel’s administration indicating that the situation has to deteriorate before significant aid will be unlocked.

BERLIN (Reuters) - German industrial orders fell more than expected in August on weaker domestic demand, data showed on Monday, adding to signs that a manufacturing slump is pushing Europe's largest economy into recession.
Contracts for 'Made in Germany' goods fell 0.6% from the previous month, with demand for capital goods down 1.6%, the Economy Ministry said. The overall fall compared with a Reuters consensus forecast for a drop of 0.3%.
""The German economy is in the midst of a recession. Today's data make that clear again,"" said Thomas Gitzel, economist at VP Bank Group.
The economy shrank by 0.1% in the second quarter, and recent data have pointed to continued weakness in manufacturing in the third quarter. Most economists define a recession as two straight quarters of contraction.
""The German government will probably come under growing pressure to give up its strict budget policy,"" added Gitzel.
The government has so far stuck to its balanced-budget policy, despite pressure from economists and other governments to spend more to boost flagging demand.
Finance Minister Olaf Scholz said last week that Germany would be able to cope with an economic crisis but added that he did not expect a downturn to be as bad as it was in 2008/2009.
""The weakness in demand in industry continues,"" the Economy Ministry said in a statement accompanying Monday's data. ""The industrial sector remains subdued for the time being.""
Germany's export-reliant manufacturers are suffering from a slowing world economy and business uncertainty linked to a trade dispute between the United States and China as well as Britain's planned but delayed exit from the European Union.
Monday's weaker-than-expected data added to the sense of gloom around the German manufacturing sector.
A survey released last Tuesday showed the manufacturing recession deepened in September, with factories recording their weakest performance since the world financial crisis a decade ago.
Last Wednesday, leading economic institutes slashed their growth forecasts for the economy for this year and next, blaming weaker global demand for manufacturing goods and increased business uncertainty linked to trade disputes.
The institutes also called on Chancellor Angela Merkel's coalition government to ditch its budget policy of incurring no new debt if the growth outlook deteriorates. It has so far refused to do so.
Merkel's government has managed to raise public spending without incurring new debt since 2014, thanks to an unusually long growth cycle, record-high employment, buoyant tax revenues and the European Central Bank's bond-buying plan.

But with the economy slowing and tax revenues waning, the fiscal room to counter a recession is getting smaller. At the same time, Germany's borrowing costs have turned into premiums, which means investors are actually willing to pay the state a bonus for being able to lend it billions of euros.

WASHINGTON, (Reuters) - The U.S. unemployment rate dropped to near a 50-year low of 3.5% in September, with job growth increasing moderately, suggesting the slowing economy could avoid a recession for now despite trade tensions that are hammering manufacturing.
The Labor Department's closely watched monthly employment report on Friday, however, contained reminders that the risks to the longest economic expansion on record remained tilted to the downside. Wage growth stagnated and manufacturing payrolls declined for the first time in six months. The retail and utilities sectors also continued to shed jobs.
The report followed a string of weak economic reports, including a plunge in manufacturing activity to more than a 10-year low in September and a sharp slowdown in services industry growth to levels last seen in 2016, that heightened fears the economy was flirting with a recession.
""The unemployment rate usually rises ahead of a recession, so a fresh decline pushes out the timeline for any potential recession into late 2020 at the earliest,"" said Josh Wright, chief economist at iCIMS in New York.
The two-tenths of a percentage point drop in the unemployment rate from 3.7% in August pushed it to its lowest level since December 1969. The jobless rate, which had been stuck at 3.7% for three straight months, declined even as 117,000 people entered the labor force last month.
Nonfarm payrolls increased by 136,000 jobs last month, the government's survey of establishments showed. The economy created 45,000 more jobs in July and August than previously estimated. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast payrolls would increase by 145,000 jobs in September.
September's job gains were below the monthly average of 161,000 this year, but still above the roughly 100,000 needed each month to keep up with growth in the working-age population. The smaller household survey from which the unemployment rate is derived showed a jump of 391,000 in employment in September.
With signs that the Trump administration's 15-month trade war with China is spilling over to the broader economy, continued labor market strength is a critical buffer against an economic downturn. The trade war has eroded business confidence, sinking investment and manufacturing.
There is also political uncertainty in Washington after the Democratic-controlled U.S. House of Representatives launched an impeachment inquiry against President Donald Trump over accusations he pressed Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy to investigate former U.S. Vice President Joe Biden, a leading candidate for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination.
These factors, together with benign wage inflation, are likely to prompt the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates at least one more time this year, economists said. The U.S. central bank cut rates last month after reducing borrowing costs in July for the first time since 2008, to keep the economic expansion, now in its 11th year, on track.
Fed Chair Jerome Powell reiterated on Friday that the economy was ""in a good place,"" adding that ""our job is to keep it there as long as possible.""
The dollar (DXY) was little changed against a basket of currencies. Prices of U.S. Treasuries rose marginally. Stocks on Wall Street were trading higher.
STRONG GOVERNMENT HIRING
""We continue to expect the Fed to cut its target interest rate later this month,"" said Michael Feroli, an economist at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) in New York. ""We believe it would have taken a much stronger number to convince Fed leadership that they have already taken out enough insurance against downside risks.""
Economic growth estimates for the third quarter range from as low as a 1.3% annualized rate to as high as a 1.9% pace. The economy grew at a 2.0% pace in the second quarter, slowing from a 3.1% rate in the January-March period.
Slower growth was reinforced by a report from the Commerce Department on Friday that showed the U.S. trade deficit widened 1.6% to $54.9 billion in August.
A broader measure of unemployment, which includes people who want to work but have given up searching and those working part-time because they cannot find full-time employment, declined to 6.9% last month, the lowest level since December 2000, from 7.2% in August.
Despite the tight labor market, average hourly earnings were unchanged last month after advancing 0.4% in August. That lowered the annual increase in wages to 2.9% from 3.2% in August. The average workweek was unchanged at 34.4 hours.
Some economists believe wage growth is stalling because companies are hiring inexperienced workers in the face of labor shortages. Others blame the slowdown on ebbing demand for workers.
""With demand for labor softening and many companies contending with higher input costs as the trade war lingers and broadens, we do not expect to see any meaningful strengthening in wage growth in the coming months,"" said Sarah House, a senior economist at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) Securities in Charlotte, North Carolina.
Hiring is slowing across all sectors, with the exception of government, which is being boosted by state and local government recruitment. Private payrolls increased by 114,000 jobs in September after rising by 122,000 in August.
The three-month average gain in private employment fell to 119,000, the smallest since July 2012, from 135,000 in August.
Manufacturing shed 2,000 jobs last month, the first decline in factory payrolls since March, after a gain of 2,000 jobs in August. Manufacturing has ironically borne the brunt of the Trump administration's trade war, which the White House has argued is intended to boost the sector.
Last month's decline in manufacturing payrolls was led by the automotive sector, which lost 4,100 jobs. Further losses are likely if a strike by General Motors (N:GM) workers continues.
Construction employment increased by 7,000 jobs after rising by 4,000 in August. Retail payrolls fell by 11,400 jobs, marking an eighth straight monthly drop.
Government employment increased by 22,000 jobs in September after surging by 46,000 in August. Hiring was boosted by state and local governments. Only 1,000 workers were hired last month for the 2020 Census. Government payrolls have increased by 147,000 over the year, driven by local governments."

Hiring is slowing across all sectors, with the exception of government, which is being boosted by state and local government recruitment. Private payrolls increased by 114,000 jobs in September after rising by 122,000 in August. 
The three-month average gain in private employment fell to 119,000, the smallest since July 2012, from 135,000 in August. 
Manufacturing shed 2,000 jobs last month, the first decline in factory payrolls since March, after a gain of 2,000 jobs in August. Manufacturing has ironically borne the brunt of the Trump administration's trade war, which the White House has argued is intended to boost the sector. 
Last month's decline in manufacturing payrolls was led by the automotive sector, which lost 4,100 jobs. Further losses are likely if a strike by General Motors (N:GM) workers continues. 
Construction employment increased by 7,000 jobs after rising by 4,000 in August. Retail payrolls fell by 11,400 jobs, marking an eighth straight monthly drop.

Government employment increased by 22,000 jobs in September after surging by 46,000 in August. Hiring was boosted by state and local governments. Only 1,000 workers were hired last month for the 2020 Census. Government payrolls have increased by 147,000 over the year, driven by local governments.

399,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 04, 2019 01:26PM ET</span>","Who will buy Lebanon's Eurobond? Not us, say foreign fund managers","By Tom Arnold and Marc Jones
LONDON (Reuters) - Lebanon may need support from loyal local banks or even friendly Gulf states to buy a new Eurobond as foreign investors look set to shun the sale, citing the country's long list of troubles.
A Eurobond of around $2 billion is being prepared for sale this month, with cash raised earmarked for refinancing maturing debts and shoring up Lebanon's shaky public finances.
But international appetite appears muted, with fund managers wary of putting money into one of the world's most indebted countries as it grapples with a multitude of national and geopolitical concerns.
""I wouldn't touch it with a very large stick,"" said Aberdeen Standard portfolio manager Viktor Szabo. ""It looks like they are getting closer and closer to an implosion.""
Hopes that sovereign wealth funds or other regional allies may ride to the rescue are also fragile. If Saudi Arabia or wealthy Gulf backers plan to subscribe they have yet to say so.
With its debt-to-GDP ratio already at 140%, Lebanon needs to plug a widening balance of payments deficit and precariously low foreign exchange reserves. Worsening its plight has been a slowing of capital inflows from abroad, which Beirut has long relied upon to help meet its financing needs.

(GRAPHIC - Lebanon's falling FX reserves: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/12/6930/6861/Pasted%20Image.jpg)
The country has a heavy schedule of FX debt payments coming up, with $1.5 billion due in November and a further $2.5 billion between March and June next year, according to Refinitiv data.
Central bank governor Riad Salameh said this week it was ready to make those payments, but observers are sceptical about the sustainability of its debt burden without an injection of Gulf funds or reforms.
Lebanon has FX reserves of around $50 billion but analysts say that once money designated for specific things is subtracted, the useable amount is far smaller.
As the country's economic malaise has deepened this year, its dollar bonds have tumbled around 16% in price and the cost of insuring its debt against the risk of default has surged beyond most countries bar Argentina's. Lebanon might have to pay an interest rate of around 15% to access the market, said fund managers.
""With existing paper trading at a significant discount to par, it may be challenging to attract offshore interest for new bonds issued around par,"" said Yacov Arnopolin, PIMCO's senior portfolio manager for emerging markets external debt.
(GRAPHIC - Cost of insuring against Lebanon default rising: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/12/6932/6863/Pasted%20Image.jpg)
ONUS ON LOCAL BANKS, GULF
In the absence of institutional investor support for its Eurobond sale, Lebanon may have to rely on domestic banks that already hold much of its existing debt.
Local lenders have helped to keep Lebanon afloat for years by depositing fresh dollars at the central bank in an operation described by some analysts as financial engineering.
Nadim Munla, senior adviser to Lebanese Prime Minister Saad al-Hariri, told Reuters he hoped upcoming trips by Hariri to the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia would yield ""something concrete"" after ""encouraging signs"" of a readiness by Gulf allies to deposit funds in Lebanon.
Saudi Finance Minister Mohammed al-Jadaan said last month that the kingdom was discussing financial support with Beirut.
Munla said it would be up to the states in question to decide on the form of such aid but they would either be deposits at the central bank or ""most probably"" a subscription to Lebanese Eurobonds. He did not say whether he was referring to the planned new Eurobond or another one.
MIDDLE EAST STRIFE
Regional tensions that have flared between Iran on one side and Saudi Arabia and the United States on the other have added to the challenges facing Lebanon, where powerful Iran-backed Shi'ite group Hezbollah is an influential political player.
Lukewarm debt markets are also not helping. After a glut of supply in September, conditions have turned.
A tepid reception for Ukrainian steel and mining firm Metinvest's international bond sale this week suggests the market might be closing for riskier names, said Sergey Dergachev, a manager of emerging market debt at Germany-based Union Investment.
""I think this window of heavy supply is not a good signal for Lebanon,"" he said.
Any foreign support is likely to hinge on a speeding up of long-awaited structural reforms, such as fixing the power sector and fighting corruption.
Lebanon won pledges of $11 billion in financing at the ""Cedre"" conference in Paris last year. But foreign governments including France first want to see Beirut follow through on reforms.
The same goes for many institutional investors.
""Lebanon's sovereign risk profile looks increasingly challenging,"" said Leo Hu, senior portfolio manager at NN Investment Partners.
""If the government would agree on an executable fiscal reform budget, it could send a very positive signal to the market, hence help the country to access capital markets."""

OTTAWA (Reuters) - Canada's trade deficit shrank by almost a third in August to C$955 million ($718 million) as exports broke a two-month slump, rising by 1.8% on increased shipments of energy and aircraft, Statistics Canada said on Friday.
Market operators in a Reuters poll had predicted a shortfall of C$1.00 billion. Statscan revised July's deficit up to C$1.38 billion from a initial C$1.12 billion.
Overall, eight of 11 export categories posted gains.
The data ""should change little for the Bank of Canada"", which is due to announce its latest interest rate decision on Oct 30, said Benjamin Reitzes, a Canadian rates and macro strategist at BMO Capital Markets.
The central bank - which says trade tensions between the United States and China are a major risk to Canada's growth outlook - has remained on the sidelines since last October.
Market expectations of a cut on Oct. 30, as reflected in the overnight index swaps markets, are just 20%.
Higher prices helped boost exports of energy products, which increased by 3.9% after two months of strong declines. Crude oil export volumes though fell after months of high levels.
Exports of aircraft - a notably volatile sector - expanded by 38.7% in August, mainly on higher sales of business jets to the United States.
Ross Prusakowski, principal economist at Export Development Canada, said the data were ""a nice respite after a couple of months of declines ... at least Canadian exports are holding their own in an uncertain trade environment"".
But RBC Economics Research economist Rannella Billy-Ochieng, citing the drop in oil volumes and the unpredictable nature of aircraft exports, said the report was disappointing.
""We are mindful that global growth deceleration, alongside unresolved U.S.-China trade tensions, have left risks to the Canadian external sector – and the export-intensive manufacturing sector – tilted on the downside,"" she said in a note to clients.
The Canadian dollar was trading slightly higher on Friday morning at C$1.3306 to the U.S. greenback, or 75.15 U.S. cents, up from the near one-month low it observed on Thursday.
Imports grew by 1.0% as imports of metal and non-metallic products jumped by 9.4%, reflecting an increase in gold asset acquisitions by Canadian firms.
Canada sent 75.5% of all its goods exports to the United States in August. Exports to the United States rose by 3.1% while imports edged up by 1.8%."
401,By Investing.com,"<span>Oct 04, 2019 09:24AM ET</span>",U.S. Economy Added 136K Jobs; Nervous Market Reassured,"Investing.com - The September jobs report revealed some cracks in the labor market Friday, but overall the market considered the numbers to be pretty solid.
S&P 500 Futures were higher as nonfarm payrolls came about in line with forecasts with a gain of 136,000 versus expectations of 140,000. And the jobless rate fell to 3.5%.
Stock index futures rose after the report on relief after a week of miserable economic indicators, as much as anything else.
The report is “not weak enough to support the hypothesis of rapidly spreading economy-wide weakness ... but also not confirming that the domestic sector is immune from global pressure,” Allianz (DE:ALVG) Chief Economic Adviser Mohamed El-Erian tweeted.
The one outlier was wage growth, which was flat for last month. Year-over-year annual wage growth dropped to 2.9% from 3.2%.
That would usually be a boon those championing aggressive easing by the Federal Reserve, with no sign of wage inflation. But the chances of a rate cut this month actually dropped to 80.2% immediately after the report, according to Investing.com’s Fed Rate Monitor Tool.
One reason is certainly that an economy that is steadily adding jobs in the face of a lot of global economic headwinds doesn’t need a helping hand from lower rates just yet.
There is also the outlier in President Donald Trump.
Trump today tweeted touting the unemployment rate hitting a 50-year low. That may take some pressure of Fed Chairman Jerome Powell, who has been a target of Trump’s ire for not cutting rates to zero when the data looks negative and equities sell off."
402,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 04, 2019 09:11AM ET</span>",WTO win won't sway United States from its combative trade stance,"By Philip Blenkinsop
BRUSSELS (Reuters) - President Donald Trump has hailed a ruling by the World Trade Organization (WTO) that gives the United States the right to hit Europe with tariffs, but his new-found satisfaction with the WTO's rules-based approach is expected to prove short-lived.
In the coming week, Washington will be hosting a delegation of Chinese trade officials in the latest face-to-face test of wills, by far his preferred way of resolving trade stand-offs.
Over 60% of analysts polled by Reuters see a deterioration of U.S-China trade ties - not least because the poll also showed a broad view that the yuan will slip to a new decade low against the U.S. dollar by year-end, fuelling U.S. accusations that China is manipulating its currency.
The WTO meanwhile welcomes up to 3,000 trade experts next week officially to debate how it should respond to a changing world, but they are all too aware that the Geneva-based body is facing the biggest threat in its 24-year history.
In just over two months, the WTO's appellate body, which rules on international trade disputes, will be left with only one judge after Washington's repeated refusal to accept new appointments.
For long the champion of world trade, the United States is threatening the very dispute settlement system that on Wednesday rewarded it with the right to levy tariffs on $7.5 billion of EU products over illegal subsidies to Airbus (PA:AIR).
The U.S. Trade Representative's (USTR) office welcomed the award and Trump described it as a ""nice win"". But few are under any illusions that Washington is about to adopt a more consensual course.
""If you read the press statement from USTR... it's the best advertisement for the WTO appellate body that anyone could possibly have written,"" an EU diplomat said of a text that sounded on the surface like a ringing endorsement of it.
""But I think we have to assume there will be no appellate body after Dec. 10.""
The European Union will likely win similar damages next year in a parallel case over subsidies for U.S. planemaker Boeing (N:BA). But for the time being the EU is the loser, the champion of rules-based trade exposed as a rule breaker and now facing U.S. tariffs on a range of its exports.
""This is awkward for Europe,"" said one non-EU diplomat. ""The United States are supposed to be the bad guys.""
Dispute settlement is not the only field where multilateralism is under threat. The WTO's ""Doha Round"" of negotiations, designed to lower global trade barriers, stalled long ago, but the organization has pressed ahead with talks on e-commerce and fish subsidies.
However, the fish talks have also stalled because the 164 WTO members cannot agree on who should chair the committee to discuss the issue.
GLOBAL RULES ON SUBSIDIES
In the 15-year-old aircraft dispute, both sides have expressed a willingness to reach a settlement, but this is unlikely to happen any time soon, and certainly not before the United States expands its trade offensive with new tariffs on EU products on Oct. 18.
At the same time as the two battle over aircraft subsidies, they and Japan are in talks about revising global rules on subsidies as a whole, hoping to find a formula to curtail Chinese backing of its state-controlled companies. Two years of talks have so far not yielded results.
""Some of the parties have realized that strong and comprehensive discipline on subsidies to rein in China risks unintentionally also including their own domestic subsidies,"" said Hosuk Lee-Makayama, director of trade think tank ECIPE.
WHAT TO WATCH FOR NEXT WEEK
All eyes will be on Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell when he speaks in Denver on Tuesday. Till now, he has described the pair of Fed rate cuts since July as a ""mid-cycle adjustment"" rather than the start of a full-blown easing campaign. That stance is being tested by the southward turn in the latest round of data on the U.S. economy, although Friday's read-out of moderate September jobs growth may reassure some. 
Whether any progress is being made on the effort to lift U.S. inflation should also become clearer in the week ahead, with data on both producer and consumer prices due out. 
Next week is a big one for Germany-watchers, with industrial output, industrial orders and trade figures. In the UK, August GDP data on Thursday should give some idea of whether the UK is heading for a negative Q3 GDP reading and a technical recession.
In Paris, the OECD think-tank will release on Wednesday much-anticipated plans to overhaul international tax rules aimed at ensuring that big internet companies pay a bigger share.

The Commerce Department said on Friday the trade deficit rose 1.6% to $54.9 billion. The July trade gap was unrevised at $54.0 billion. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the trade gap would widen slightly to $54.5 billion in August.
The politically-sensitive goods trade deficit with China fell 3.1% to $31.8 billion on an unadjusted basis, with imports declining 0.8%. Exports to China increased 8.0% in August, boosted by soybean shipments. The goods trade deficit with the European Union jumped 23.7% to $15.3 billion.
The United States and China have been embroiled in a 15-month trade war. Washington announced this week tariffs on aircraft, other industrial products and agricultural products from the EU as part of a World Trade Organization penalty award in a long-running aircraft subsidy case.
Trade experts expect the EU will impose tariffs on U.S. goods next year over subsidies for Boeing (N:BA).
In August, goods exports rose 0.3% to $138.6 billion. They were lifted by exports of soybeans, which rose $0.3 billion.
Exports of industrial supplies and materials increased $1.5 billion, with shipments of crude oil rising $0.8 billion. But capital goods exports fell $1.4 billion, with aircraft shipments declining $1.3 billion.
Goods imports increased 0.6% to $213.0 billion in August. The import bill was boosted by a $1.9 billion surge in capital goods imports to the highest on record. Cellphone imports rose by $1.1 billion.
When adjusted for inflation, the goods trade deficit rose $0.3 billion to $85.7 billion in August. Trade could remain a drag on gross domestic product in the third quarter.
Growth estimates for the third quarter range from as a low as a 1.3% annualized rate to as high as a 1.9% pace. The economy grew at a 2.0% pace in the second quarter, slowing from a 3.1% rate in the January-March period."

The Bloc's top court, in a ruling given on Thursday, granted Polish consumers the right to ask courts to convert the loans into Poland's zloty currency or cancel their contracts.
""This judgement as based on the details that we currently have is very unlikely immediately to pose downside risks,"" Fitch's Arvind Ramakrishnan told reporters on the sidelines of an investment conference in Budapest.
On Friday Fitch affirmed Poland's credit rating at A- with a stable outlook.
In that review ""we did highlight that this is a tail risk to keep an eye on,"" he said. ""The Polish banking sector as a whole is still generally well capitalized with a stable asset quality.""
Ramakrishnan did however say that fiscal handouts were becoming an issue in Poland as well as Hungary, where ruling nationalist parties face elections this month.
""In Poland, a series of fiscal measures was announced starting in February and yet the government has announced that it will have a balanced state budget by 2020,"" Ramakrishnan said.
""It is not clear to us how a balanced state budget can be met even if there is a very heavy reliance on one-offs, which are the measures that have been announced.""
He also said such measures may turn problematic if economic growth slows sharply.
Ramakrishnan said while they had a positive impact on domestic consumption, they negatively affected fiscal metrics in Poland, and to a lesser degree, in Hungary.
""Taking the case of Poland, at the moment we believe that they still indent to adhere to the expenditure ceiling and debt reduction measures,"" Ramakrishnan said.
""If the economy slows to such an extent that we perceive that those fiscal adherences are at risk, then that would be a net negative or a risk negative for the rating."""

Five out of nine participants in the poll, which was carried out Sept. 30 to Oct. 4, predicted that the currency would gain this month. Two analysts saw it trading unchanged at about 389 per dollar, and two said it would slip.
The 12-month outlook was bearish, with all nine analysts forecasting a weaker tenge. The Central Asian nation's currency has slid 1.3% against the dollar so far this year.
Kazakhstan's central bank hiked its policy rate in early September, giving the tenge a brief boost, but the currency then fell with prices of crude oil, a major export, when they dropped after a short-lived spike on Saudi Arabian output disruption.
""In the medium term, the expected negative impact on the exchange rate from slowing global trade and investment will be partly offset by the soft monetary conditions in the United States and the euro zone,"" said Aigul Berdigulova, an analyst with the Eurasian Development Bank.

LONDON (Reuters) - The U.S. economy faces the greatest risk of outright recession for a decade as the slowdown spreads from manufacturing to the much larger and more stable service sector.
Most indicators show manufacturing has already started to shrink with purchasing managers' surveys and new orders pointing to a decline in activity levels in recent months.
The Institute for Supply Management's composite purchasing managers' index for manufacturing fell last month to its lowest level since the last recession in 2009.
The manufacturing downturn is now more widespread than either of the mid-cycle slowdowns in 2012 and 2015/16, according to the ISM survey (https://tmsnrt.rs/32Zt9An).
The survey's new orders component was far into contraction territory in both August and September which suggests activity is likely to decline further in the short term.
So far, the slowdown has been concentrated in manufacturing, driven by a sharp retrenchment in business investment plans and spending on other durable goods.
New orders for non-defense capital equipment excluding aircraft, a proxy for investment spending, fell marginally in the three months from June to August compared with the same period a year earlier.
New orders have slowed from growth of more than 8% at the same point in 2018 and are now falling for the first time since 2015/16.
SERVICE SECTOR
Service sector output and employment tend to be much less cyclical and volatile than in manufacturing (""Business cycles: theory, history, indicators and forecasting"", Zarnowitz, 1992).
The increasing dominance of services in the economy is one of the main reasons fluctuations in the business cycle have become much less extreme since 1945.
Expansions have generally become longer while recessions have become less frequent and shorter (with the notable exception of the post-financial crisis recession of 2008/09).
The service sector has added more inertia to the economic system, dampening short-term movements like a fly-wheel or the ballast on a ship.
Nevertheless, changes in services output and employment tend to follow the manufacturing sector, albeit with a delay and at a smaller magnitude.
The ISM's non-manufacturing survey, which covers service providers as well as construction and real estate firms, fell sharply in September to its lowest level since August 2016 and before that July 2012.
Unlike manufacturers, non-manufacturing firms continued to report growth last month, but it was not very widespread, and it has been trending consistently lower since the start of the year.
Services growth is decelerating as expected given the slowdown in manufacturing, in line with the historical relationship between the two indicators over the last 20 years.
PERSONAL INCOME
The other source of ballast/inertia in the modern economy stems from consumer spending, which is holding up well at the moment but also shows signs of decelerating.
Real personal income excluding current transfer payments such as social security, unemployment insurance and veterans' benefits is one of the indicators used by the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) to identify turning points in the business cycle.
Falls in real personal income minus current transfers is one reason NBER's business cycle dating committee, the widely accepted arbiter of recessions, identified recessions starting in March 2001 and December 2007 – but not in 2012 or 2015, when real personal income continued increasing despite weakness elsewhere in the economy.
In aggregate, real personal income minus current transfers was still up by 2.8% in the three months from June to August compared with the same period a year earlier, buoyed by employment and wage gains.
But real personal income growth has slowed sharply from around 4% in the first half of 2018 as job growth has slowed and the impact of tax cuts has faded.
Mirroring that slowdown, real personal consumer expenditures were up just 2.5% in the three months June to August compared with a year earlier, down from growth of 3.5% at the same point in 2018.
RECESSION RISK
The overall picture is one in which the most cyclically volatile parts of the economy are already contracting, and arguably in recession, while the more stable parts of the economy show continued but slowing growth.
The probability of the whole economy entering recession is now higher than at any time since 2008/09, which is reflected in the deep and sustained inversion in the U.S. Treasury yield curve.
The service sector and consumer spending can help provide continuing momentum and avert a formal recession – but only if the manufacturing situation does not worsen and starts to improve reasonably soon.

Last month’s 1.3% increase, driven by fleet demand rather than consumers, fell short of predictions, the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders lobby group said Friday. France and Germany posted 17% and 22% growth. Year-to-date registrations in the U.K. fell 2.5%.
“We expected to see a more significant increase in September, similar to those seen in France, Germany, Italy and Spain,” SMMT Chief Executive Mike Hawes said in the statement. “Instead, consumer confidence is being undermined by political and economic uncertainty.”
With less than a month to go before the U.K. is set to leave the European Union and no agreement in place, Britain’s automotive industry is bracing for the impact from a no-deal split, which could further dent demand. Manufacturers have warned that their just-in-time supply chains will be disrupted in such a scenario.
The latest figures “mask the continued low confidence of consumers caused by the political and economic uncertainty created by the continuing Brexit confusion,” Peter Barnes, an analyst at DWF, wrote in a note.
The new car market declined by 49,000 cars in the first nine months of this year, the group said. Electric vehicles, including full electric and plug in hybrids, were the only bright spot. Battery-driven car sales more than tripled to 7,704 units in September, driven by deliveries of models including the Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Model 3 and Nissan Leaf. Plug-in hybrids sales grew a more modest 23%, according to data from the group.
Last month, Jaguar Land Rover said it would close its British factories for a week in November to guard against disruptions to supply chains from a possible no-deal Brexit. The announcement followed a warning from more than 20 European trade groups that such a breakup would have an “immediate and devastating impact, undermining competitiveness and causing irreversible and severe damage.”

PRAGUE (Reuters) - Central Europe's leading currencies should firm against the euro over the next year, lifted by solid growth once global worries calm, although the expected gains will be less than previously forecast, a Reuters poll showed on Friday.
The Czech crown (EURCZK=), Polish zloty (EURPLN=) and Hungarian forint (EURHUF=) have struggled to reverse losses suffered in the last two months as they come under pressure from U.S.-China trade tensions and Britain's uncertain exit from the European Union.
Friday's poll showed the forint, which hit a record low of 336.28 to the euro last week, should regain some ground before the end of the year and firm the most over the next 12 months.
The zloty and crown will likely tread water in the last quarter of 2019 before returning to gradual gains in 2020.
Radomir Jac, chief economist for Generali (MI:GASI) Investments CEE, said local worries, such as relaxed monetary policy in Hungary and uncertainty over past foreign currency loans in Poland, have added to global risks.
""As some of these factors should be clarified in the coming weeks and months, I would expect regional currencies to recover,"" he said.
""Domestic fundamentals are supportive, certainly in the case of the Czech crown and Polish zloty, and I think that also the Hungarian forint has room to recover a bit from record lows.""
The median forecast in the poll saw Hungary's forint climbing to 328.25 to the euro in the next year, up 1.5% from Thursday midday trade. In a September poll, analysts had forecast a rise to 317 in 12 months.
(GRAPHIC: Hungarian forint - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/12/6889/6820/EURHUF.png)
The forint has lost close to 4% so far in 2019, more than double the declines of the zloty or Romanian leu (EURRON=).
Amid global worries, Germany's manufacturing sector - a key trade link for the central European region - is already battling recession. But central Europe has been resilient so far, with second-quarter growth between 2.0% and 4.9% thanks to domestic demand.
Inflation remains high and central banks in the region are in wait-and-see mode even while the European Central Bank and U.S. Federal Reserve loosen their policy.
But currencies have yet to benefit from interest rate differentials.
In the case of the crown, which the poll forecast to rise by 1.0% to 25.50 to the euro in a year's time, the Czech central bank (CNB) delivered its eighth rate hike in two years in May and continues to debate tightening.
Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) said despite short-term global worries, it expected the crown ""to appreciate moderately against the euro over the forecast horizon, not least due to the solid domestic economy and the more restrictive CNB relative to other central banks.""

The poll was conducted before a European Court of Justice ruling on Thursday that favored Polish consumers who took out mortgages in Swiss francs, allowing them to ask Polish courts to convert their loans into the local currency.
ING's EMEA FX and IR strategist Petr Krpata said the ruling could have a ""slow burning effect on the zloty as the court cases may take years to resolve.""
The zloty is forecast to gain 0.9% to 4.30 to the euro over the next 12 months.

Core machinery orders, a highly volatile data series regarded as an indicator of capital spending in the coming six to nine month, likely fell 2.5% in August from the previous month, the poll of 17 economists showed. In July, orders contracted 6.6%.
From a year earlier, core orders, which exclude those for ships and electric utilities, are forecast to have dropped 10.8% last month after it rose 0.3% in July.
""Worsening exports and factory output made manufacturers cautious about capital spending, while non-manufacturers' spending on labor-saving investment remained solid,"" said Takeshi Minami, chief economist at Norinchukin Research Institute.
Capital expenditure has been among the few bright spots in Japan's economy as non-manufacturers continue to invest heavily on automation to cope with a tight labor market, offsetting the weakness in manufacturers' spending.
A Bank of Japan Tankan survey released on Tuesday showed that despite waning business confidence big firms plan to raise their capital expenditure by 6.6% in the financial year that ends March 2020, versus economists' median estimate of a 7.0% increase.
The Cabinet Office will publish the machinery orders data at 8:50 a.m. on Oct. 10 Tokyo time (2350 GMT Oct. 9).
The poll also forecast Japan's household spending to have risen 1.2% in August from a year earlier, accelerating from a 0.8% gain in July.
""Some of the last-minute buying ahead of a sales tax hike seem to have helped. We expect consumer spending will grow ahead,"" said Kenta Maruyama, economist at Mitsubishi UFJ Research and Consulting.
Japan rolled out a twice-delayed increase in the sales tax to 10% from 8% on Tuesday, a move that is seen as critical for fixing the country's tattered finances. But there are fears the higher tax could hurt consumer spending and tip the economy into recession.
The internal affairs ministry will announce household spending data at 8:30 a.m. Japan time on Oct. 8 (2330 GMT, Oct. 7).
The nation's current account to expected to show a surplus of 2.07 trillion yen ($19.4 billion) in August, partly helped by gains in income from investments overseas, the poll found.
The finance ministry will publish the current account balance at 8:50 a.m. on Oct. 8.
The Bank of Japan's corporate goods price index (CGPI), which measures the prices companies charge each other for goods and services, was seen down 1.2% in September from a year earlier, declining for fourth straight month due to price falls in oil and coal related products.

BENGALURU (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar will continue its rally for at least another six months with no contender in sight to challenge its dominance, a Reuters poll of foreign exchange analysts found.
Deteriorating global trade conditions have hurt most economies, boosting demand for dollar-denominated assets since early last year, keeping the greenback strong.
""The factors that are keeping the dollar strong over the last eight months or so are likely to persist for a while and the dollar's strength will remain extremely thematic for now,"" said Jane Foley, senior currency strategist at Rabobank in London.
According to the latest data from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), currency speculators kept raising their total net long dollar positions, a trend unlikely to change in the near-term.
Two-thirds of 50 analysts who answered an additional question in the monthly Reuters poll taken Sept 30-Oct 3 said the dollar rally should continue for at least six months.
Still, the U.S. economy is showing some signs of recession risks. This week, news of weaker-than-expected consumer spending in August was followed by data showing manufacturing activity hit a more than decade low in September, probably due to the U.S.-China trade war and a strong dollar. 
That sent jitters through financial markets and renewed calls for further rate cuts from the Federal Reserve.
""The dollar is only going to start weakening when the data becomes pretty conclusively weak enough in the U.S. to make the markets think that we are getting more than precautionary easing,"" said Kit Juckes, FX strategist at  Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN) in London.
""We are at an extreme now and there are enough signs that U.S. growth is properly rolling over,"" he said. 
If the Fed heeds calls for further easing, it would narrow the interest rate gap between the United States and other major economies. 
But a significant minority of analysts - 18 of 49 - who answered another additional question said rate differentials would be the main reason for the dollar to remain strong.
Fifteen said an escalation in the U.S.-China trade war, 11 said positive returns on dollar-denominated assets and the other five gave varied opinions.
""There will be counter-forces on the dollar, there will be these interest rate differentials on one side, but the market is not going to entirely give up on the dollar because it will still have a safe-haven function,"" Foley said.
Analysts still expect most major currencies to post gains against the dollar in a year's time, a prediction that has repeatedly been wrong. Still, they forecast gains to be smaller than predicted in last month's poll.
The euro has lost around 4% this year but is forecast to trade at $1.10 by year-end, around where it was trading on Thursday. It is then expected to rise marginally to gain 3% to trade around $1.13 in a year.
That 12-month view for the common currency is the lowest since July 2017 and the sixth time this year median forecasts have been trimmed.
""We are mostly looking for EUR/USD to bottom more than a euro recovery really,"" said Rabobank's Foley.
Almost all responses in the poll were collected before the World Trade Organization gave Washington a green light to impose tariffs on $7.5 billion worth of EU goods annually, putting further pressure on the euro and the underlying economy which is struggling to grow.

""The euro area continues to lead the global race to the bottom on growth. This has already weighed on the euro all year. Not only does it warrant additional EUR weakening in our view, but is also likely to weigh on linked currencies,"" noted analysts at JP Morgan.

416,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 03, 2019 08:48PM ET</span>","UK business morale slides, especially in manufacturing: BCC","LONDON (Reuters) - British business activity wilted in the third quarter, especially in manufacturing, according to a survey on Friday that boded poorly for the country's economy in late 2019 as it faces the Brexit crisis and a global slowdown.
The British Chambers of Commerce's (BCC) survey of 6,600 companies showed domestic manufacturing sales fell at the fastest pace since late 2011. Growth in the much larger services sector also slowed.
Overall, the survey chimed with other signs of a sharp deterioration in business confidence in Britain as the Oct. 31 Brexit deadline nears with little clarity on how or if the country will leave the European Union.
The BCC survey also pointed to the biggest drop in manufacturing export orders in 10 years.
""Our findings point to a worrying drop-off in UK economic activity, with unrelenting uncertainty over Brexit and a notable slowing in global growth prospects dragging down almost all the key indicators in the quarter,"" BCC head of economics Suren Thiru said.
""Looking forward, weakening orders, confidence and investment intentions suggest that unless action is taken the UK's current weak growth trajectory could drift markedly lower over the near term.""
Consumer spending, boosted by the fastest wage growth in 11 years and low unemployment, has helped to offset the economic slowdown although there have recently been some signs of a weakening in job creation.
The BCC said more manufacturers reported a worsening of cash-flow than those reporting an improvement. The difference was the widest since late 2011. 
A renewed drive to stockpile to avoid disruption after the Oct. 31 Brexit deadline - shown in an IHS Markit/CIPS survey on Monday - is likely to put more pressure on manufacturers' finances.
Expectations for profits declined particularly sharply in the manufacturing sector, falling to their lowest level since late 2011, the BCC said.

The BCC survey was conducted between Aug. 26 and Sept. 16.

417,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 03, 2019 02:19PM ET</span>",U.S. holiday sales to rise up to 4.2% amid trade uncertainty: NRF,"(Reuters) - U.S. holiday sales in 2019 are expected to be higher than a year earlier, the National Retail Federation said on Thursday, even as the retail sector grapples with fears of slowing global growth due to an ongoing U.S.-China trade war. 
Sales in 2019 are estimated to grow between 3.8% and 4.2% to a range of $727.9 billion to $730.7 billion, the retail trade group said. That compares with sales of $701.2 billion, or 2.1% growth, in 2018. 
The forecast comes at the start of a tense fourth quarter as latest data points to the U.S. economy sliding into a recession.
""There has clearly been a slowdown brought on by considerable uncertainty around issues including trade, interest rates, global risk factors and political rhetoric,"" NRF Chief Executive Officer Matthew Shay said in a statement.
The tariffs on Chinese goods have now extended to consumer products such as flat panel television sets, cotton sweaters, bed linen and many types of footwear.
""There are many moving parts and lots of distractions that make predictions difficult,"" NRF Chief Economist Jack Kleinhenz said.
""There is significant economic unease, but current economic data and the recent momentum of the economy show that we can expect a much stronger holiday season than last year."" 
Retailers are expected to benefit during the holiday period, which typically generates a majority of their annual sales and profit, from near record low unemployment and steady wage growth.
(For interactive graphic click: https://tmsnrt.rs/2ABob0q)
This year's shopping period, which includes Black Friday, Christmas and New Year, however, is the shortest since 2013. 
The group also estimated seasonal hiring by retailers to be between 530,000 and 590,000 workers, compared with 554,000 in 2018.
U.S. retailers have also released holiday hiring numbers.
Macy's Inc (N:M) said earlier in the day it would employ 80,000 seasonal workers, unchanged from last year, while  Target  Corp (N:TGT) said last month it planned to hire about 130,000 store employees, 10,000 more than 2018. 
NRF's forecast is one of the most closely watched benchmarks and follows estimates from other market research firms such as AlixPartners and Deloitte.
AlixPartners has forecast holiday sales to rise between 4.4% and 5.3%, while Deloitte expects a 4.5% to 5% increase. 
Holiday sales grew a lower-than-expected 2.9% in 2018, NRF said in February, pressured by turmoil over trade and a government shutdown. The group has revised the growth rate to 2.1% after revisions to data by the government.

NRF's holiday retail sales forecast excludes automobiles, gasoline stations and restaurants, while considering indicators such as employment, wages and consumer confidence.

418,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 03, 2019 02:00PM ET</span>",U.S. recession risks up as services growth hits three-year low,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. services sector activity slowed to a three-year low in September amid rising concerns about tariffs, suggesting that trade tensions were spilling over to the broader economy. 
Coming on the heels of news this week that manufacturing activity plunged to a more than 10-year trough in September, the survey from the Institute for Supply Management (ISM) on Thursday increased the risks of a recession. For now, a solid labor market is keeping the economy on a moderate growth path.
The raft of weak data could prompt the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates again this month to keep the longest economic expansion in history, now in its 11th year, on track. The U.S. central bank cut rates last month after reducing borrowing costs in July for the first time since the 2008 financial crisis.
""This downturn is starting to spread and that means the tea leaf readers at the Fed are going to be teeing up a third rate cut this year when they next meet again at the end of this month,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG in New York.
The ISM said its non-manufacturing activity index fell to a reading of 52.6 in September, the lowest since August 2016, from 56.4 in August. A reading above 50 indicates expansion in the services sector, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the index falling to 55.1 in September.
The ISM reported on Tuesday that its measure of national manufacturing activity plunged in September to its lowest level since June 2009, when the Great Recession was ending. 
It said services industry businesses ""are mostly concerned about tariffs, labor resources and the direction of the economy."" The ISM said 13 industries, including public administration, and finance and insurance, reported growth last month. Educational services and other services reported a contraction.
The dollar fell against a basket of currencies on the services industry data, while U.S. Treasury prices rallied. Stocks on Wall Street were trading higher on expectations of a rate cut this month.
September's drop in services sector activity reflected declines in measures of production and new orders, which tumbled 6.6 points to a reading of 53.7, a three-year low. But order backlogs increased as did new bookings for exports, offering hope that activity in the sector could rebound.
A gauge of services industry employment fell to 50.4 last month, the lowest reading since February 2014, from 53.1 in August. The ISM said some businesses reported that the ""number of new employees starting to level off,"" and others said ""tightening workforce is leading to a more competitive market for qualified potential employees.""
This together with a sharp decline in the ISM's measure of manufacturing employment to more than a 3-1/2-year low last month bolstered economists' expectations that the government's closely watched employment report on Friday would show another month of moderate job growth in September.
According to a Reuters survey of economists, nonfarm payrolls probably increased by 145,000 jobs last month after rising by 130,000 in August. Job gains have averaged 158,000 per month this year, still above the roughly 100,000 needed each month to keep up with growth in the working-age population.
The unemployment rate is forecast unchanged at 3.7% for a fourth straight month in September. 
SOLID LABOR MARKET
Slowing job growth could curb consumer spending, which has been the economy's main growth engine.
""Yes, the economy is slowing,"" said Joel Naroff, chief economist at Naroff Economic Advisors, in Holland, Pennsylvania. ""No, it is not in recession and there is no reason to believe it will go into the red this year.""
The weak manufacturing and services sector surveys have prompted economists to slash their gross domestic product growth estimates for the third quarter to as low as a 1.3% annualized rate from as high as a 2.1% pace. The economy grew at a 2.0% pace in the second quarter, slowing from a 3.1% rate in the January-March period. 
In addition to the U.S.-China trade war, which is pressuring business investment, the economy is also losing momentum as the stimulus from last year's $1.5 trillion tax cut package fades.
Despite the deterioration in the ISM employment measures and also signs that employers are becoming cautious about hiring more workers, layoffs remain low. 
In a separate report on Thursday, the Labor Department said initial claims for state unemployment benefits increased 4,000 to a seasonally adjusted 219,000 for the week ended Sept. 28. 
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast claims increasing to 215,000 in the latest week. Claims have now advanced for three straight weeks.
Some of the rise in claims could be the result of an ongoing strike by workers at General Motors (NYSE:GM). While striking workers are not eligible for unemployment benefits, the work stoppage has affected production, impacting non-striking employees at suppliers. There was a jump in manufacturing claims in Michigan during the week ended Sept. 21.
""The initial claims data are consistent with our view that the trend in job growth will soften over time but that it will remain reasonably healthy,"" said Daniel Silver, an economist at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) in New York.

Another report from global outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas said job cuts announced by U.S.-based employers fell 22.3% to a five-month low of 41,557 in September.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Union has warned London not to overdo its campaign to independently negotiate trade deals around the world while still being a member of the bloc, according to a letter to the British ambassador to Brussels seen by Reuters. 
The promise of a ""global Britain"" assertively pursuing its interests in bilateral trade agreements around the world was central to the Brexit campaign. But, three years after Britons voted to leave, the fate of Brexit hangs in balance. 
As long as it remains an EU member, Britain is at liberty only to discuss - not enact - future trade deals, and must keep the bloc informed.
But a letter from the bloc's executive European Commission - which negotiates international trade deals for all member states - to the British ambassador to the bloc, Tim Barrow, dated Sept. 5, said: ""In several cases the necessary information on the international negotiations, which the United Kingdom intended to undertake... while still a Member State, and the outcome of these negotiations has not been provided in due time.""
It stressed that the situation ""does not allow the (European) Union to either take a position on the United Kingdom's intention to start negotiations or, where necessary, to authorize the latter"".
""I reiterate the request to your authorities to provide in a timely manner... all necessary information and documentation concerning the negotiations in areas of (European) Union competence that the United Kingdom is currently engaged into or intends to engage into.""
Asked for comment, the Commission said it was a ""standard letter reminding the UK of its obligation to inform us properly of the negotiations it is engaged in while still an EU Member State"".
A British government spokesperson said: ""We have kept the European Commission informed of our work to transition international agreements throughout this process and we will continue to act transparently as we prepare to leave the European Union on 31st October.""
Prime Minister Boris Johnson says he would take Britain out of the EU in 28 days.
With trade deals being complicated matters that take years to conclude, London is in talks with multiple parties to agree the temporary extension of the trading terms it currently enjoys as an EU member to prevent disruption should it leave the bloc with no divorce agreement. 
According to a British government website, London has sealed 14 such rollover agreements so far - from Chile to Israel to Switzerland and, most recently, South Korea. 
It lists some two dozen more as pending, with United States, Australia and New Zealand being key priorities.
An EU diplomat said the bloc was upset about a recent British fishing agreement with Norway and saw a potential conflict of interest in Britain's talks on sharing electronic evidence with the United States being conducted while the bloc was negotiating its own accord with Washington on exchanging such information in criminal cases.
""It is not entirely in line with the principle of sincere cooperation,"" the person said. 
Another diplomat added: ""We all know they can't do separate trade deals while still in the EU. And we all know they are kind of doing it anyway. So it's a reminder that we are watching.""

If and when Brexit takes place, Britain and the EU will also need to negotiate their new relationship, which is likely to prove even more daunting and more tortuous than the withdrawal arrangements.

Factory goods orders dipped 0.1% after surging by an unrevized 1.4% in July, the Commerce Department said on Thursday. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast factory orders would fall 0.2% in August.
Factory orders edged down 0.1% compared to August 2018.
Shipments of manufactured goods fell 0.1% in August after decreasing 0.3% in the prior month. Pointing to underlying weakness in the sector, which accounts for about 11% of the economy, unfilled orders at factories nudged up 0.1% after the same gain in July. Inventories were unchanged in August after ticking up 0.1% in July.
A survey from the Institute for Supply Management (ISM) on Tuesday showed a measure of national factory activity tumbled to more than a 10-year low in September. The ISM said comments from manufacturers ""reflect a continuing decrease in business confidence,"" and also noted that ""global trade remains the most significant issue.""
Ironically, manufacturing has borne the brunt of the 15-month U.S.-China trade war, which has thumped business confidence. The Trump administration has argued that trade tariffs are necessary to protect industries from what it says is unfair foreign competition.
Troubles in manufacturing, which are also the result of an inventory overhang and the grounding of Boeing's (N:BA) 737 MAX plane after two fatal crashes in Indonesia and Ethiopia, have been underscored by factories cutting overtime for workers.
Transportation equipment orders fell 0.4% in August after increasing 7.3% in July. Orders for civilian aircraft and parts dropped 17.1% after rising 52.2% in the prior month.
There were also decreases in orders for computers and electronic products and electrical equipment, appliances and components. Machinery orders, however, rose 0.4% in August after declining 1.0% in July.
The Commerce Department also said August orders for non-defense capital goods excluding aircraft, which are seen as a measure of business spending plans on equipment, fell 0.4% instead of the 0.2% drop reported last month.
Shipments of core capital goods, which are used to calculate business equipment spending in the gross domestic product report, increased 0.3% in August instead of rising 0.4% as previously reported. Business investment declined at its steepest pace in 3-1/2 years in the second quarter."

BRASILIA (Reuters) - Brazil's services sector activity expanded in September at the fastest pace in six months, a closely watched purchasing managers index survey showed on Thursday, with employment growth in the sector hitting its highest in over five years.
The latest IHS Markit PMI figures suggest Brazil is bucking a global trend consistent with sharply slowing activity and even recession across the United States, Europe and Asia.
Brazil's service sector PMI rose to 51.8 from 51.4 in August, the third consecutive reading above 50.0 and the highest since March, a sign that overall economic activity in the third quarter was pretty solid.
A PMI reading above 50.0 denotes expansion in activity, and a reading below denotes contraction. Services accounts for more than 70% of all economic activity in Brazil.
Coupled with the manufacturing PMI released earlier this week, Brazil's composite PMI rose to 52.5 in September, also the highest since March, from 51.9 in August, IHS Markit said.
""The latest PMI data bring welcoming news of a stronger expansion in private sector output across Brazil, with a widespread acceleration in growth rates in the manufacturing and service sectors,"" said Pollyanna De Lima, Principal Economist at IHS Markit.
""The relatively better demand environment, coupled with lower borrowing costs arising from further monetary policy easing, should boost consumption and investment in the near-term, ensuring that Brazil's economy remain on a recovery path,"" she said.
The service sector's employment sub-index rose to 51.8, the highest since February 2015 and above 50.0 for the second month in a row. It is also the first time this has happened since early 2015.
The outlook for the services sector dimmed for a second consecutive month, however, with the business expectations sub-index falling to 75.2 from 78.1, IHS Markit said.
Brazil's economy grew by 0.4% in the second quarter. Government officials, central bankers and most economists expect growth over the calendar year 2019 to be around 0.9% and accelerate to around 2.0% or more next year."

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's economy appears to have slipped into recession as firms brace for the risk of a disruptive Brexit in just a few weeks' time, according to a survey which showed the dominant services sector took an unexpectedly sharp downturn last month.
Prime Minister Boris Johnson has promised to take Britain out of the European Union by Oct. 31 come what may, despite parliament passing a law ordering him to seek a delay if he cannot secure a new transition deal to soften the economic blow.
September's IHS Markit/CIPS services Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) fell by more than any economist predicted in a Reuters poll, tumbling to a six-month low of 49.5, below the 50 level that divides growth from contraction.
It was also the worst reading for service PMIs among major advanced economies in September.
Combined with even weaker manufacturing and construction surveys this week, September's all-sector PMI sank to 48.8 from 49.7, its lowest since the month after the referendum decision to leave the EU in June 2016, and before that 2009.
IHS Markit said the figures suggested Britain's economy shrank by 0.1% in the three months to September.
""Coming on the heels of a decline in the second quarter, (this) would mean the UK is facing a heightened risk of recession,"" IHS Markit economist Chris Williamson said.
British government bond yields fell slightly on the news, which added to speculation that the Bank of England might cut interest rates. But sterling was little changed, and several economists said they believed the PMIs overstated the slowdown.
Ruth Gregory at Capital Economics said the PMI surveys did not cover Britain's relatively resilient retail sector nor a recent increase in spending on public services. She stuck to her forecast for 0.3% growth in the third quarter.
""Nonetheless, the surveys are probably giving us a reasonable steer on the underlying strength of economic activity, and the risks to our Q4/Q1 GDP growth forecasts appear to be firmly to the downside,"" she said in an email to clients.
Britain's economy shrank by 0.2% in the three months to June - the first decline since 2012 - and a second quarterly contraction would meet the recession definition used in Europe.
On Wednesday, Johnson sent new Brexit proposals to the EU and said that unless the bloc compromised, Britain would leave without a deal at the end of this month. The proposals received a cold reception in Brussels.
Leaving the EU without a deal risks causing major disruption to trade, at least in the short term, due to the immediate imposition of new tariffs and regulatory checks at ports.
Britain's economy is also slowing due to global trade tensions. On Wednesday the United States imposed 10% tariffs on Airbus planes partly made in Britain and 25% duties on whisky and cheese as punishment for EU aircraft subsidies.
""INSIDIOUS WEAKENING"" 
The PMI data are not a fail-safe guide to the outlook for the economy. They overstated economic weakness just before Britain was originally due to leave the EU in March and immediately after the 2016 Brexit referendum.
But longer-term trends in the all-sector PMI generally match up well with official quarterly growth numbers.
""September's decline is all the more ominous, being the result of an insidious weakening of demand over the past year rather than a sudden shock,"" Williamson said.
Firms said foreign customers were switching business away from Britain due to fears of a no-deal Brexit and new export orders fell at the sharpest rate since March.
Solid consumer demand has so far cushioned Britain's economy from some of the impact of Brexit uncertainty. But the latest survey added to signs from consumer sentiment surveys that jobs could be becoming less secure.

Taken as a whole, this week's PMIs pointed to the sharpest fall in employment since December 2009.

425,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 03, 2019 05:06AM ET</span>",Euro zone producer prices fall more than expected in August,"BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Euro zone producer prices fell more than expected in August because of a sharp drop in energy prices, data showed on Thursday, signaling weakening inflationary pressures in a slowing euro zone economy.
The European Union's statistics office Eurostat said prices at factory gates in the 19 countries sharing the euro fell 0.5 percent month-on-month in August for a 0.8 percent year-on-year decline. Economists polled by Reuters had expected only a 0.3 percent monthly and a 0.5 percent annual fall.
The decline is a result of a 1.9 percent monthly and a 4.9 percent year-on-year drop in energy prices. Without the volatile energy component producer prices were flat month-on-month and rose 0.5 percent year-on-year, Eurostat said.
Industrial producer prices signal inflationary pressure early in the pipeline because unless their change is absorbed by intermediaries and retailers, it is transmitted to the final consumer, impacting consumer inflation.
The European Central Bank wants to keep consumer inflation below, but close to 2 percent over the medium term, but has struggled to accelerate price growth for years despite program of government bond buying on the market.
The bank decided in September to re-launch the bond purchases as inflation remained to slow.
Separately, Eurostat said retail sales, an indication of domestic demand, in the euro zone rebounded in August from a slump in July, growing 0.3 percent month-on-month for a 2.1 percent annual increase, driven mainly by strong sales of electronics, computers and Internet shopping."

The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) food price index, which measures monthly changes for a basket of cereals, oilseeds, dairy products, meat and sugar, averaged 169.9 points last month unchanged from August.
The August figure was previously given as 169.8
FAO also predicted that cereal production would be slightly less abundant in 2019 than previously expected.
The FAO Sugar Price Index dropped 3.9% from August levels, mainly because of expectations of strong sugar stocks thanks to positive production prospects for the 2019/20 marketing season.
By contrast, the Vegetable Oil Price Index rose 1.4% month-on-month, marking its highest level in 13 months, while the meat index rose 0.8%.
The cereal price index was barely changed from August, although the various components moved in different directions. While wheat prices were firmer, maize quotations were down month-on-month because of large export availabilities and rice prices were marginally lower.
FAO lowered its forecast for global cereal production in 2019 by 2.2 million tonnes, pegging world cereal output at 2.706 billion tonnes, but still up 2.0% from 2018 levels.
""The latest cut emanates mostly from reduced prospects for global rice and wheat outputs, which outweighed a bigger production forecast for coarse grains,"" FAO said.
World cereal utilization in 2019/20 was forecast at 2.714 billion tonnes, down 1.7 million tonnes from September, but 1.3% higher than in 2018/19 and marking a record high.
FAO raised its forecast for world cereal stocks by the close of the 2020 season by 2.4 million tonnes to 850 million tonnes, down 2.0% from their opening levels."

The results will make disappointing reading for policymakers at the European Central Bank who pledged last month to provide indefinite stimulus to revive the 19-country currency bloc's ailing economy.
IHS Markit's September Euro Zone Composite Final Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI), considered a good indicator of overall economic health, sank to 50.1 from August's 51.9.
That was below a preliminary reading of 50.4 and barely above the 50 mark separating growth from contraction.
""The euro zone economy ground to a halt in September, the PMI surveys painting the darkest picture since the current period of expansion began in mid-2013,"" said Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit.
""The downturn also shows further signs of spreading from manufacturing to services.""
A manufacturing PMI on Tuesday showed factory activity contracted at its steepest rate in almost seven years last month and a services PMI published on Thursday dropped to 51.6 from August's 53.5 -- the lowest since the start of the year.
Williamson said the PMI indicated the bloc's economy would expand 0.1% this quarter at best, weaker than the 0.2% predicted in a Reuters poll last month.
Forward-looking indicators in the survey suggest there is no upside to those forecasts as overall demand fell at the fastest rate since mid-2013, leading firms to again run down backlogs of work to keep active. The composite new business index fell to 48.7 from 50.5.
As growth stalled, services firms cut back on hiring plans. The employment index fell to 53.0 from 53.2, its lowest since January."

IHS Markit's final services Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) dropped to 51.4 from 54.8 in August. It was the lowest reading in three years and came in weaker than the first estimate of 52.5.
""A technical recession now looks to be all but confirmed,"" IHS Markit economist Phil Smith said, pointing to expectations that the German economy will shrink again in the third quarter after having contracted by 0.1% in the second quarter.
""The drop in new business at services firms is an indication that domestic demand is struggling to offset the loss of new work from abroad, and is a downside risk to the sector's immediate growth prospects,"" Smith added.
German services providers continued to hire new staff, however, with employment growth still surpassing the long-run average of the survey, according to IHS Markit.
""The worry is, though, that staff shedding across manufacturing could soon outweigh the employment growth in the service sector,"" Smith said.
IHS Markit's flash composite PMI, which tracks the manufacturing and services sectors that together account for more than two-thirds of the economy, fell to 48.5 in September from 51.7 in the previous month.
It was the first time since April 2013 that the composite index fell below the 50 mark that separates growth from contraction and was below the flash reading of 49.1.
Germany's leading economic institutes on Wednesday slashed their growth forecasts for Europe's biggest economy for this year and next, blaming weaker global demand for manufacturing goods and increased business uncertainty due to trade disputes.
The institutes said they now expect the German economy to grow by 0.5% this year and 1.1% in 2020, down from their April estimates of 0.8% and 1.8% respectively.

Data compiler IHS Markit said its Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) for the services sector fell to 51.1 points in September from 53.4 points in August. The September level was also worse than a flash estimate for a reading of 51.6 points.
A reading of above 50 points signals an expansion in activity, while below 50 marks a contraction.
IHS Markit's overall composite PMI index, which includes the services and manufacturing sectors, fell to 50.8 points in September from 52.9 in August. The final reading for the September composite PMI index was also worse than a flash estimate reading of 51.3 points.
Data earlier this week showed that French manufacturing activity had also dipped in September.
""Private sector activity growth eased at the end of the third quarter, driven by a softer rise in services and a return to contraction in manufacturing,"" said IHS Markit economist Eliot Kerr.
""The results in services are particularly concerning as they suggest negative spillover effects from manufacturing are beginning to come to fruition,"" added Kerr, who noted that France was nevertheless faring better than other European economies."

The seasonally adjusted IHS Markit UAE Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI), which covers manufacturing and services, fell slightly to 51.1, from 51.6 in August.
Although the non-oil sector remained in growth territory -- figures above 50 indicate expansion and below that, contraction –- it was the UAE's weakest growth rate since May 2010.
New orders were at the softest they have been since the survey began more than 10 years ago, demonstrating weak demand in the country's non-oil economy.
Although it picked up from last month, output remained near a six-year low.
Employment growth was positive but weak, with most firms keeping employment unchanged following a contraction last month.
The UAE, which has the most diversified economy in the region, raised its expectations for economic growth in 2019 to 2.4% last month, driven by faster growth in the oil sector, after lowering them earlier this year.
The economy grew 1.7% in 2018, according to preliminary data released by the government.
""Companies reported further competitive pressures, while also seeing a slowdown in customer movement despite sustained price discounting,"" said David Owen, economist at IHS Markit and author of the report.

The seasonally adjusted IHS Markit Saudi Arabia Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) rose to 57.3 in September from 57.0 in August. Any reading above the 50 mark indicates expansion.
Growth has picked up this year after flagging in 2018 because of increases in fuel prices and the introduction of a 5% value-added tax. The PMI averaged 56.9 from January till September, against a 53.6 average for the same period last year.
""Output among non-oil private sector firms in Saudi Arabia grew at a sharp pace in September, with the rate of expansion quickening to the fastest since December 2017,"" said Amritpal Virdee, principal economist at survey compiler IHS Markit.
""At current levels, the PMI survey is consistent with year-on-year GDP growth of around 3% as we head into the final quarter of 2019,"" he said.
Saudi GDP contracted in 2017 before recovering to 2.2% growth last year, helped by strong oil output. Oil output cuts this year mean GDP is expected to show little growth or to contract.
Employment levels rose in September at the strongest rate of growth since March last year. The sub-index increased to 51.5 from 50.1 a month earlier.
""Non-oil private sector firms sought to add to their payrolls at the most marked pace in 18 months, buoyed by efforts to improve the quality of product offerings,"" Virdee said.
Output growth increased to 61.7 from 60.7 in August, but new orders edged down to 62.3 from 63.5 a month earlier.
New export orders rose only slightly, to 52.8 from 52.7, showing domestic demand was driving new business.
Fitch on Monday downgraded Saudi Arabia's credit rating to A from A+, citing rising geopolitical and military tensions in the Gulf following a major attack on its oil facilities last month and a deterioration of the kingdom's fiscal position.
""October data will provide the first opportunity to gauge the impact of the recent attacks on the critical oil processing facilities in Abaqaiq and Khurais on the wider economy,"" Virdee said."

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Hiring by U.S. private employers slowed further in September, suggesting that trade tensions, which have pressured manufacturing, could be spilling over to the labor market.
The ADP (NASDAQ:ADP) National Employment Report on Wednesday also showed private payrolls growth in August was not as strong as previously estimated, and said ""businesses have turned more cautious in their hiring,"" with small enterprises becoming ""especially hesitant.""
It came on the heels of a survey on Tuesday showing manufacturing activity tumbled to a more than 10-year low in September. The reports added to cooling consumer spending in suggesting that the economy was losing momentum, though a recession is probably not on the horizon. 
The economy's darkening outlook was also underscored by another report on Wednesday showing a measure of current business conditions in New York City dropped to a 40-month low in September. 
The longest economic expansion on record, now in its 11th year, is losing ground with the blame largely put on a 15-month trade war between the United States and China, which has eroded business confidence. 
Slowing job growth is a concern as it could curb consumer spending, which has been the economy's main growth engine.
Private employers added 135,000 jobs in September, the ADP National Employment report showed. Data for August was revised downward to show private payrolls increasing by 157,000 jobs instead of the previously reported 195,000 positions.
""We continue to believe that the underlying trend in job growth has slowed lately but that it remains decent,"" said Daniel Silver, an economist at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) in New York.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast private employment rising by 140,000 jobs in September.
The dollar was little changed against a basket of currencies, while U.S. Treasury prices rose. Stocks on Wall Street dropped to one-month lows.
WEAKER EMPLOYMENT REPORT?
The ADP figures come ahead of the Labor Department's more comprehensive nonfarm payrolls report due out on Friday, which includes both public- and private-sector employment. 
The ADP report, which is jointly developed with Moody's Analytics, has a poor record predicting the private payrolls component of the government's employment report. However, last month's job gains fit in with economists' expectations for moderate nonfarm payrolls growth in September. 
Some analysts believe a weaker employment report is likely.
""I believe that Friday's nonfarm payrolls will come in weaker than forecast,"" said Kevin Giddis, chief fixed income strategist at Raymond James in Memphis, Tennessee. ""In my opinion, a number below 100,000 is likely more probable. It just has that feeling."" 
According to a Reuters survey of economists, nonfarm payrolls probably increased by 145,000 jobs in September, after rising 130,000 in August. Job gains have averaged 158,000 per month this year, above the roughly 100,000 needed each month to keep up with growth in the working age population. 
The unemployment rate is forecast unchanged at 3.7% for a fourth straight month.
The ADP report showed employment in the goods-producing sector increased by 8,000 jobs in September. Manufacturing payrolls rose by 2,000 jobs last month and construction added 9,000 positions. Natural resources and mining shed 3,000 jobs. 
The services sector added 127,000 jobs last month, with gains concentrated in education and health services, professional and business services, and trade, transportation and utilities industries.
In a separate report on Wednesday, the Institute for Supply Management-New York current business conditions index dropped to a reading of 42.8 last month, the lowest since May 2016, from 50.3 in August. Businesses were also downbeat about the outlook over the next six months. 
The survey's six-month outlook gauge tumbled 26.2 points to 45.2 in September, the lowest reading since February 2009. Its employment measure dropped to a 19-month low of 52.5 from 69.0 in August. 
""Purchasing managers are struggling and are more nervous about the future than they have been at any point since the Great Recession,"" said Adam Kamins, an economist at Moody's Analytics in West Chester, Pennsylvania.
But there was some encouraging news on the housing market, which has been struggling since hitting a soft patch last year. The Mortgage Bankers Association said applications for loans to purchase a home increased 10% last week from a year ago.
The report added to data on homebuilding, building permits and home sales in suggesting that the housing market slump had probably run its course. Residential investment has contracted for six straight quarters, the longest such stretch since the Great Recession. 

The housing market is being lifted by lower mortgage rates, thanks to interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve.

HONG KONG (Reuters) - Hong Kong's August retail sales were the worst on record, the government said on Wednesday, as escalating anti-government protests that have gripped the Chinese-ruled city for nearly four months scared off tourists and battered spending.
Retail sales in August fell 23% from a year earlier, government data showed, worse than a 21.48% fall in September 1998, according to Refinitiv data, as violent clashes spread across shopping districts and took a heavy toll on malls.
Cat-and-mouse clashes on Tuesday spread from the shopping district of Causeway Bay to the Admiralty area and then on to the New Territories, with police firing tear gas and water cannon at petrol bomb-throwing activists.
Protesters were out again on Wednesday but there were no reports of serious trouble.
Market analysts say the outlook is overshadowed by the protests and a weak Chinese yuan that translates into lower spending.
Retail sales fell to HK$29.4 billion ($3.75 billion) in August, a seventh consecutive month of decline. July's drop was a revised 11.5%. In volume terms, retail sales in August fell 25.3%, compared with a revised 13.1% drop in July.
For the first eight months of 2019, retail sales fell 6% in value from a year earlier and 6.9% in volume terms.
""Retail sales will likely remain in the doldrums in the near term, as the worsened economic outlook and local protests involving violence continue to weigh on consumer sentiment and inbound tourism,"" a government spokesman said.
The government will monitor the implications for the labor market and the economy, he added.
Hong Kong is facing its first recession in a decade, with the government recently cutting its full-year 2019 growth forecast to 0-1%, down from 2%-3% previously.

TOURISM HIT
Hong Kong's finance minister had said earlier that anti-government protests were taking a heavy toll on the city's tourism and retail sectors, while hotels in some locations were only half-full with room rates plunging 40-70%.
August tourist arrivals fell 39.1% on year to 3.59 million, according to the Hong Kong Tourism Board, the biggest decline since May 2003 when an outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) hit. They were down 30.9% from July. (https:// The number of mainland visitors fell 42.3% in August, accounting for 77.5% of the total.
Many businesses have felt the pain, especially some of the city's large luxury retailers who rely heavily on mainland Chinese spending, as the protests show no sign of easing.
Sales of jewellery, watches, clocks and valuable gifts plunged 47.4% on-year in August, data showed, after a revised 24.3% drop in July.
Medicines and cosmetics fell 30% in August, compared with revised 16.5% fall in July. Department store sales dropped 29.9% in August, against a 10.4% fall in July.
Hong Kong-based skin care and cosmetics chain operator Sa Sa International (HK:0178) posted 32% year on year drop in its sales in Hong Kong and Macau in August and expected its performance in September to remain ""very weak"".

The IHS Markit/CIPS UK Construction Purchasing Managers' Index fell to 43.3 from 45.0 in August, below all forecasts in a Reuters poll of 17 economists that had pointed to an unchanged reading.
Far below the 50 dividing line for growth, September's reading was the second-worst since the financial crisis. Construction firms cut jobs at the fastest rate since December 2010, data company IHS Markit said.
Britain is due to leave the European Union on Oct. 31, and Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said he is prepared to leave without a deal if necessary, despite being ordered by parliament to seek a delay if he cannot negotiate acceptable terms.
Companies blamed escalating Brexit uncertainty and generally weak demand for hesitancy among their clients, the survey showed.
Overall, the data added to signs that businesses are struggling to make longer-term plans due to the risk of a disruptive no-deal Brexit in the coming years, although consumer spending has held up well.
""The commercial sector was a notable casualty in September, with building activity here falling at the fastest rate since April 2009, highlighting the damaging effects of project delays and belt-tightening,"" IHS Markit economist Joe Hayes said.
""Forward-looking indicators suggest that businesses are bracing themselves for a protracted construction slump, with input purchasing and employment both falling at rates unsurpassed since 2010,"" Hayes added.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japanese companies' inflation expectations continued to stagnate in the three months to September, a Bank of Japan survey showed, a sign the central bank is making little headway in hitting its 2% price target despite years of heavy money printing.
Companies expect consumer prices to rise an average 0.9% a year from now, unchanged from their projection three months earlier, according to a poll taken by the BOJ as part of its detailed ""tankan"" survey released on Wednesday.
Firms also said they expect consumer inflation to hit 1.0% three years from now and an annual 1.1% five years from now, both unchanged from three months ago, the survey showed.
The survey underscores the challenge the BOJ faces in changing public perception that price growth will remain stagnant for years to come.
""There's no change to the fact that Japan suffers from a deflationary structure, which is a combination of excess supply and a shortage of demand,"" said Yasunari Ueno, chief market economist at Mizuho Securities.
Japanese firms remain wary of raising prices of their goods and services for fear of scaring away cost-sensitive households, who have held their purse strings tight due to slow wage growth.
The BOJ's attempt to change such deflationary mindset with a wall of money has failed to fire up inflation to its 2% target, leaving the central bank with little ammunition to fight the next recession.

The IHS Markit Mexico Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index stood at 49.1 in September, barely higher than the 49.0 in August, which was the lowest reading in the survey's nearly 8-1/2 year history.
A figure above 50 signals expansion in the sector, while a reading below that threshold points to contraction.
It is the sixth time the sector has contracted since President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador took office in December 2018.
""Mexico ended the third quarter of 2019 with its worst manufacturing performance in the eight-and-a-half-year survey history, owing to a record deterioration in business conditions in August and a broadly similar performance in September,"" said IHS Markit economist Pollyanna De Lima, who wrote the report.
Mexico's economy barely escaped entering a recession in the first half of the year, after posting no growth in the second quarter and contracting in the first, underlining the economic challenge facing Lopez Obrador.
""Manufacturers cut their staffing numbers again and further reduced purchasing activity. The downturn was often attributed to challenging economic conditions, weak demand and subdued client confidence,"" said De Lima.
The report highlighted that business sentiment strengthened to a four-month high, but remained subdued by historical standards. Those firms that were optimistic cited upbeat projections for sales, exports, investment, advertising and new product launches.
A sub-index measuring output slipped to 47.7 from 48.6 the previous month, dipping to its lowest level on record.
Some of the decisions made by Lopez Obrador, a leftist proponent of economic nationalism, have shaken investor confidence in Mexico, dampening hopes for growth.
Confidence in Mexico also was rattled at the end of May when President Donald Trump threatened to impose tariffs on all Mexican imports to the United States if Mexico did not curb the flow of U.S.-bound migrants. A provisional deal to avert the tariffs was reached in June.
Mexico sends about 80% of its exports, much of which are manufactured goods like cars and televisions, to the United States.

Spending on private residential projects jumped 0.9%, the biggest gain since November 2018, after rising 0.6% in July. Housing starts and building permits surged to a more than 12-year high in August, government data showed last month, lifted by declining mortgage rates.

Mortgage rates have declined as the Federal Reserve has cut interest rates, twice so far this year, to keep the longest economic expansion in history on track. The expansion, now in its 11th year, is under threat from a trade war between the United States and China, and slowing growth.
Spending on private nonresidential structures, which includes manufacturing and power plants, dropped 1.0% in August to the lowest level since January 2018. Investment in private nonresidential structures decreased 1.6% in July.
Outlays on private nonresidential structures have been weighed down by a manufacturing downturn due to trade tensions and cheaper energy products. Investment in nonresidential construction fell at its steepest pace in more than three years in the second quarter. That contributed to business investment declining for the first time in more than three years.
Spending on private construction projects was unchanged in August after declining for four straight months.
Investment in public construction projects rose 0.4% after increasing 1.4% in July. Spending on state and local government construction projects gained 0.6%. That followed a 1.7% surge in July. Outlays on federal government construction projects dropped 2.2% in August after falling 2.5% in the prior month."

The IHS Markit Canada Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' index (PMI), a measure of manufacturing business conditions, rose to a seasonally adjusted 51.0 in September, its highest level since February, from 49.1 in August. A reading above 50 shows expansion in the sector.
""The latest PMI figures for Canada provide some cause for optimism at the end of the third quarter,"" said Andrew Harker, economics associate director at IHS Markit. ""Tentative signs of demand improving helped firms secure greater volumes of new business and increase production slightly, though conditions clearly remain challenging.""
Trade tensions this year between the United States and China have contributed to a slowdown in the global economy.
A measure of output rose to a six-month high at 50.2, from 49.4 in August, as new orders rose.
New orders climbed to 50.7, its highest since February, from 47.5 in August, while employment also reached a seven-month high, rising to 52.1 from 50.5 in the prior month.
Canada's job market has been robust this year, while the Bank of Canada has left interest rates on hold even as other central banks, including the U.S. Federal Reserve, have eased."

OTTAWA (Reuters) - Canada's economy was unexpectedly unchanged in July, following four months of growth, as the country's mining, quarrying and oil and gas extraction sectors contracted, Statistics Canada data showed on Tuesday.
Analysts in a Reuters poll had predicted an increase of 0.1% in July following a 0.2% increase in June. Overall, 12 of the 20 industrial sectors monitored expanded on the month, while eight declined, the national statistics agency said. 
The Canadian dollar weakened to C$1.3290 or 75.24 cents U.S. after the July GDP miss.
Canada is in the midst of a national election set for Oct. 21 where economic issues, like the cost-of-living, have played a central role on the campaign trail. Meanwhile, the Bank of Canada has held interest rates steady since last October as it monitors Canadian economic data.
""Today's data are consistent with the [Bank of Canada's] view that growth over the second half of the year is likely to be slightly slower than the first half,"" said Josh Nye, a senior economist with RBC Economics, adding there were ""few signs of a broader slowdown.""
""That gives the central bank time to be patient in assessing whether a bit more accommodation is needed to offset external headwinds,"" Nye said in a note.
Statscan said goods-producing industries were down 0.7% in July as outputs from all sectors - excepting utilities - declined. Services-producing industries were up for the fifth consecutive month, rising 0.3% as the majority of its subsectors grew.
Canada's mining, quarrying and oil and gas extraction sector dropped by 3.5% in July, the largest decrease since May 2016, Statistics Canada said. Support activities for those same industries slumped by 11.5%, the largest decline since December 2018, following three consecutive months of growth, as drilling and lower rigging services contracted.
Oil and gas extraction (except oil sands) fell 4.7%, the biggest monthly decline seen in a decade, the agency said - thanks, in large part, to a shutdown of some offshore production facilities in Newfoundland and Labrador because of maintenance issues.
Declines were also reported in the construction sector, which dropped by 0.7%. Manufacturing fell for the second straight month, falling 0.1%, while the transportation and warehouse sector contracted by 0.5% on slower rail transportation. 
Real estate and related industries increased 4.2%, while utilities rose by 1.5%. Wholesale trade jumped 1.1%, the sixth increase in seven months, Statscan said.

442,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 01, 2019 09:21AM ET</span>",Brazil's industrial output posts biggest rise in over a year,"By Jamie McGeever
BRASILIA (Reuters) - Industrial production in Brazil rose in August at its fastest pace in more than a year, official figures on Tuesday showed, a sign that Latin America's largest economy may slowly be turning a corner after flirting with recession earlier in the year.
The recovery may be on an uneven footing, however, as intermediate goods production was the only one of four broad economic categories to grow, and only 10 of the 26 narrower sectors surveyed managed to expand in the month.
Overall output jumped 0.8% in August from July, government statistics agency IBGE said, the first increase in four months and more than twice as fast as the 0.3% rise expected in a Reuters poll of economists.
It was the biggest increase since a 12.8% surge in June last year. Barring that anomalous rebound from an 11.1% plunge in the previous month because of a nationwide truckers' strike, it was the fastest rate of growth since December 2017.
The biggest driver was mining. It grew by 6.6% on the month, the fourth monthly increase, which brought the accumulated rise in that period to 25.2%. But IBGE noted that this followed three monthly declines when output fell an accumulated 24.2%.
""The better-than-expected rise in Brazilian industrial production was driven by rapid growth in the mining sector, which won't be sustained,"" William Jackson, an economist at Capital Economics, wrote in a client note.
""Even so, the figures add to the evidence that the economic recovery gathered momentum in the third quarter.""
Among the other best-performing sectors were petroleum and biofuels, which rose 3.6%, and food production, which was up 2.0%, IBGE said.
Of the four wider economic categories covered by IBGE, intermediate goods output rose 1.4%. Durable consumer goods production fell 1.8%, while output of semi-durable and non-durable consumer goods, and capital goods, shrank 0.4%.
While the monthly figures may offer a chink of light for Brazilian industry, the bigger picture is less rosy.
Output in August was down 2.3% from the same month a year ago, and is down 1.7% on a year-to-date basis and over the preceding 12 months, IBGE said."
443,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 01, 2019 07:21AM ET</span>",Euro zone inflation slows to three-year low on cheaper energy,"By Jan Strupczewski
BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Euro zone inflation slowed in September to near a three-year low because of cheaper energy although core inflation edged higher, highlighting the challenges facing the European Central Bank.
The divergence between the headline and core figures underlines the split of opinion over the state of the euro zone economy among the governors of the ECB. It wants to keep inflation below, but close to 2% over the medium term but has so far failed to boost price growth despite years of unconventional steps.
Eurostat said on Tuesday that consumer prices in the 19 countries sharing the euro rose 0.2% month-on-month in September for a 0.9% year-on-year gain. Economists polled by Reuters had expected an unchanged reading of 1.0%.
The weaker than expected September number, the lowest year-on-year figure since November 2016, was mainly due to a 1.8% year-on-year fall in energy prices.
Excluding energy and equally volatile unprocessed food, price growth accelerated to 1.2% in September from 1.1% in August. This number is called core inflation by the ECB which it monitors for monetary policy decisions,
An even more narrowly defined core inflation measure, which excludes energy, food, alcohol and tobacco and looked at by many market economists, also accelerated to 1.0% from 0.9% year-on-year.
""It should continue to rise slightly in the coming months. However, the strong increase in underlying inflation hoped for by the ECB is still not in sight,"" said Christoph Weil, economist at Commerzbank (DE:CBKG).
The ECB decided on Sept. 12 to resume asset purchases to inject more money into the slowing economy and in this way make prices grow more quickly.
But the decision was opposed by a third of ECB policymakers, including Germany's Sabine Lautenschlaeger who resigned before the end of her term last week.
ECB chief economist Philip Lane said last week the division was due to ""ambiguity"" over the state of the euro zone economy among ECB governors.
""We expect the central bank to take time to assess the impact of last month's easing package before taking further action,"" a team of  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) economists said in a note.
They saw only a minimal boost to the economy even once quantitative easing restarted in November, with inflation remaining subdued. There were also a variety of downside risks to growth.
""With fiscal policy remaining reactive for now, we expect the ECB to take further action. Our base case is for another 10 bp cut in March, though the timing remains rather uncertain at this stage,"" the Morgan Stanley note said."
444,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 01, 2019 07:11AM ET</span>","Australia central bank cuts rates to all-time low, signals may need more","By Swati Pandey
SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia's central bank cut interest rates for the third time this year on Tuesday in a bid to stimulate a sluggish economy and signaled it was prepared to do more if needed, knocking the local dollar to a one-month low.
The country's economy has expanded for 28 years without a recession, but risks have intensified over the past year, with growth slowing, inflation lukewarm, the property market subdued and unemployment ticking higher.
The Reserve Bank of Australia's (RBA) quarter-point cut took the cash rate to an all-time low of just 0.75%, leaving little room for more reductions and raising the possibility of unconventional policy easing.
RBA Governor Philip Lowe said moves by global central banks to ease monetary policy played a part in the decision as he signaled the need for an extended period of low interest rates.
""The Board will continue to monitor developments, including in the labor market, and is prepared to ease monetary policy further if needed...,"" Lowe said.
Financial futures are now pricing in a 60% chance of a fourth cut to 0.5% in November, compared with under 30% before the latest decision.
Expectations that rates will be lower for longer sent the Australian dollar slipping to $0.6706, its weakest since early September.
""In cutting rates so aggressively this year, the RBA is hoping to generate a stronger labor market, higher wage growth and to stimulate domestic consumption,"" said Anthony Doyle, a Sydney-based, cross-asset strategist at Fidelity.
""Fortunately for the RBA, the transmission mechanism of monetary policy is fairly quick in the Australian economy,"" he said, noting around 80% of mortgages were on variable rates.
The RBA's back-to-back easings in June and July have so far done little to boost activity outside of the housing market.
Indeed, figures earlier in the day showed home prices across Australia's capital cities jumped 1.1% in September, led by Sydney and Melbourne, but approvals to build new homes collapsed to the lowest since 2013.
Economists expect construction-related job losses in coming months which could take the unemployment rate to as high as 5.5% from 5.3% now and the RBA's goal of around 4.5%.
""The RBA now has only three, or possibly even fewer, more conventional cuts available to them before they will have to venture into unconventional monetary easing territory - negative rates, QE (quantitative easing), or bond yield targeting,"" Rob Carnell, chief Asia-Pacific economist for ING wrote in a note.
SLACK IN LABOR MARKET
Governor Lowe acknowledged the RBA's decision to lower rates was partly in response to slack in the labor market. The jobless rate in August worsened to a one-year high of 5.3%.
""The Board took the decision to lower interest rates further today to support employment and income growth and to provide greater confidence that inflation will be consistent with the medium-term target,"" Lowe said in a short statement accompanying the rate decision.
""The economy still has spare capacity and lower interest rates will help make inroads into that.""
Lowe sees a ""gentle turning point"" for the economy after annual growth hit a decade low of 1.4% in the quarter-ended June.
The governor is due to speak at a business event in Melbourne later in the day where he is expected to throw more light on future policy course.
Record low interest rates have boosted home prices, helping end two years of continuous declines which ate into household wealth and confidence in a blow to consumption and the broader economy.
Some economists believe the price revival could prove a blessing for the construction sector, which has seen a severe downturn in new home approvals, particularly for the once red-hot apartment sector.
Building approvals fell 1.1% in August, less than a sharp 10% slide in July but confounding market expectations for a bounce of 2.5%, data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) showed.
One positive sign in the data was a small bounce in approvals to build new apartments while non-residential construction surged 54%."

The IHS Markit/CIPS UK Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) showed the factory sector overall shrank for a fifth month in a row, its longest such run since mid-2009.
But the pace of contraction eased with the PMI's main gauge of activity rising to a four-month high of 48.3, helped by some companies accumulating stocks and buying more inputs for the first time in recent months.
The median forecast in a Reuters poll of economists had been for a fall to 47.0.
Britain's economy grew strongly in the first three months of 2019 when factories rushed to stock up on parts and finished goods rather than face the risk of border disruptions after March 29, the original Brexit deadline.
The date of Britain's departure from the European Union was subsequently delayed until the end of October.
Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said he will make sure Brexit happens on Oct. 31. But lawmakers have approved a law requiring him to seek a new delay, if London and Brussels have not renegotiated a transition deal in time.
Markit said only consumer goods makers saw growth in September while investment goods were hard hit by uncertainty about the economy, which has been affected by the global slowdown as well as the lack of clarity about Brexit.
Staffing levels fell at the fastest pace since February 2013, it said.
Manufacturing accounts for around 10% of Britain's economy. A PMI survey for the bigger services sector is due to be published on Thursday."
446,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 01, 2019 04:31AM ET</span>",Swedish manufacturers catch German cold as global woes hit home,"STOCKHOLM (Reuters) - Activity in Sweden's manufacturing sector dived to its lowest level since early 2013 in September as worries about global growth hit the hitherto resilient economy and boosted the chance the Riksbank will drop plans for a near-term rate hike.
While growth slowed in Sweden in the first half of the year, the downturn has been mild and the central bank has stuck with its forecast of it will tighten policy late this year or early next.
But recent figures have pointed to a faster slowdown. Unemployment has spiked and inflation has slowed as the effects of a trade spat between the United States and China, worries about a no-deal Brexit and a slowdown in Europe - not least its engine Germany - have begun to take their toll.
September saw the biggest monthly drop in Swedish manufacturing activity since 2008.
""Swedish manufacturers are simply going in the same direction as, for instance, in Germany,"" Nordea economist Torbjorn Isaksson said. ""The PMI report supports our view of the Riksbank cutting rates around the turn of the year.""
The Swedish crown (EURSEK=) fell sharply against the euro after the data.
NO RATE HIKE?
Comments by the majority of rate-setters since the Sept. 5 announcement, when the Riksbank held the repo rate unchanged at -0.25%, have underlined the view the economy is solid and that a rate rise would still leave policy very expansionary.
Deputy Governor Per Jansson, has been the sole doubter. He has questioned whether a hike is necessary, although he said there was a long way to go before the a rate cut would be on the cards.
Economists have long been skeptical about the Riksbank's plans pointing to inflation well under target, a slowing economy and rate cuts by the European Central Bank and the U.S. Federal Reserve.
Most believe rates will remain unchanged for the foreseeable future.
""It will take a lot for them to reverse and cut interest rates, but there is probably a limit to how weak the economy can get,"" Olle Holmgren, economist at banking group SEB said.
The Riksbank announces its next policy decision on Oct. 24.
Swedish PMI dropped to 46.3 points in September from a downwardly revised 51.8 points the previous month, data compilers Silf and Swedbank said on Tuesday.
The sub-indices for production and orders were the biggest contributors to the decline in the overall index. Three of the five sub-indices were below 50 points, the line dividing expansion in the sector from contraction.
Private sector activity in Germany shrank for the first time in 6-1/2 years in September. Activity in the manufacturing sector fell to 41.7 points.
The German economy is expected to shrink in the third quarter after contracting by 0.1% in the April-June period.

IHS Markit's September final manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) was 45.7, just above an earlier flash reading of 45.6 but its lowest since October 2012 and well below the 50 level separating growth from contraction.
An index measuring output which feeds into a composite PMI due on Thursday and seen as a good gauge of economic health, sank to 46.1 from 47.9. That was its lowest since December 2012 and marked its eighth month below the break-even level.
""The health of the euro zone manufacturing sector went from bad to worse in September. There's likely worse to come, with forward-looking indicators deteriorating further during the month,"" said Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit.
An index measuring new orders fell to 43.4 from 45.9, a low not seen since October 2012. This led firms to cut headcount for a fifth month and reduce their purchases of raw materials."

IHS Markit's Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) for manufacturing, which accounts for about a fifth of the German economy, fell to 41.7 from 43.5 in August. This was the lowest reading since June 2009.
""The downward trend in new orders, which fell the most in more than 10 years, is a particular worry, and continues to drive cutbacks in factory output, employment and prices,"" said Phil Smith, Principal Economist at IHS Markit.
Germany's export-reliant manufacturers are suffering from a slowing world economy and business uncertainty linked to a trade conflict between the United States and China as well as Britain's planned exit from the European Union.
The job losses in manufacturing broadened in September, reaching a scale at which they could start to weigh more heavily on so far relatively resilient consumer morale, Smith said.
The weakness seen for a long time across the intermediate and investment goods sectors also showed signs of spreading to consumer products, he added.
Germany's leading economic institutes are set to lower on Wednesday their growth forecast for the economy for this year and next, sources told Reuters on Monday, adding to fears that a recession among export-driven manufacturers is spreading.
But the German economy is showing bright spots despite expectations of a technical recession in the third quarter.
Data on Monday showed German unemployment fell unexpectedly in September and retail sales rose in August, allaying some concerns that a manufacturing slump is taking its toll on a consumption-driven growth cycle."

Data compiler IHS Markit said its final Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) for the manufacturing sector fell to 50.1 points in September from 51.1 points in August.
That was marginally lower than a preliminary 50.3 points level recorded for September, but nonetheless remained a touch above the 50-point threshold between an expansion in activity and a contraction.
France's economy has so far held up better than that of European powerhouse Germany, as tax cuts have propped up consumer and business morale in spite of a global economic slowdown.
The French manufacturing sector has consistently been weaker than the country's dominant services sector, however, as it is more exposed to the global trade slowdown.
""Following another brief recovery during August, output at manufacturers returned to contraction during September, continuing the subdued performance of the sector seen over the past year,"" said IHS Markit economist Eliot Kerr.
""The trend for new orders remained similar, signaling further weakness in demand. The latest contraction in new business was centered on the domestic market, with international sales unchanged from August,"" added Kerr."

The Nikkei Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index , compiled by IHS Markit, was 51.4 in September, unchanged from August.
While it has been above the 50-mark that separates growth from contraction for over two years, the growth rate in September and August was the slowest since May 2018.
Worryingly for the government and policymakers, overall demand only rose marginally in September, hurt by almost no growth in exports, and firms barely increased headcount last month, the survey showed.
Factories also cut back on purchases of raw materials, indicating they do not expect a marked pick up in demand.
India's economy expanded at an annual rate of 5.0% in the April-June quarter, the slowest in more than six years, official data showed in August, and the government has announced several measures to try and revive growth.

The final Jibun Bank Japan Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) fell to a seasonally adjusted 48.9 from a final 49.3 in the previous month, posting the quickest pace of decline since February.
The figure matched last week's preliminary September reading.
The index has stayed below the 50.0 threshold that separates contraction for a fifth month, marking the longest run of shrinkage since a six-month stretch from March to August 2016.
""Japan continues to suffer from the trade-led global growth slowdown,"" said Joe Hayes, economist at IHS Markit, which compiles the survey.
""Crucially, the stronger deterioration comes ahead of the consumption tax hike, and suggests that manufacturing and exports are both likely to have been drags on third quarter GDP (gross domestic product).""
The sales tax hike to 10% from 8% kicked in on Tuesday, the first such nationwide tax increase by the government since April 2014. The previous hike, to 8% from 5%, severely hurt consumer sentiment and triggered an economic slump.
To ease the burden on consumers from the hike this time around, the government has put in place stimulus steps worth 2 trillion yen ($18.55 billion), and refrained from increasing the tax on food and non-alcoholic beverages.
Manufacturing activity was largely pulled lower by frail output and total new orders, both of which shrank for a ninth straight month and at a faster pace than in August, the revised survey showed.
Businesses surveyed by IHS Markit indicated that underlying demand conditions had weakened, reflecting fewer sales from both domestic and foreign markets, with order book volumes reportedly falling in China, the United States and Europe.
More negative news came from Japan's factory output, with data on Monday showing production slipped more than expected in August in another blow to Japan's economy, the world's third-largest.
Separate data on Monday showed domestic demand might be stronger than thought, as retail sales climbed 2% in August from a year earlier, the sharpest rise since October last year, according to Refinitiv data.
""The service sector's ability to weather the sales tax hike in the fourth quarter will be crucial to keeping the economy afloat into the year-end,"" IHS Markit's Hayes added."

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japanese big manufacturers' business confidence worsened to a six-year low in the July-September quarter, a central bank survey showed, a sign the bitter U.S.-China trade war is taking a heavier toll on the export-reliant economy.
The service-sector mood also deteriorated with some retailers voicing concern over the potential impact of a sales tax hike kicking off on Oct. 1, the Bank of Japan's closely watched ""tankan"" survey showed on Tuesday.
The weak readings cast doubt on the BOJ's view that robust domestic demand will offset the pain from slowing global growth. This will keep the central bank under pressure to extend more monetary support for a fragile economy.
""Manufacturers from a wide range of sectors said the U.S.-China trade tension and slowing overseas growth were hurting sentiment,"" a BOJ official told reporters.
The tankan results are among key indicators the BOJ will scrutinize at its next policy review on Oct. 30-31, when it conducts a quarterly review of its price and price forecasts.
The headline index for big manufacturers' sentiment stood at plus 5 in September, versus plus 7 in June and economists' median estimate of plus 2 in a Reuters poll.
It marked the third straight month of decline and the lowest reading since June 2013, when it hit plus 4.
The big non-manufacturers' sentiment index stood at plus 21, compared with plus 23 in June and a median market forecast for plus 20.
Both big manufacturers and non-manufacturers expect sentiment to worsen in the next three months, clouding the outlook for the economy.
The survey also showed big firms plan to raise their capital expenditure by 6.6% in the financial year that ends March 2020, versus economists' median estimate of a 5.5% increase.
Capital expenditure has been among the few bright spots in Japan's economy as non-manufacturers continue to invest heavily on automation to cope with a tight labor market, offsetting the weakness in manufacturers' spending.
While the BOJ kept policy steady in September, it signaled the chance of expanding stimulus as early as this month by issuing a stronger warning against overseas risks.
The tankan's sentiment indexes are derived by subtracting the number of respondents who say conditions are poor from those who say they are good. A positive reading means optimists outnumber pessimists."

Consumer prices rose an annual 0.9% in September, well short of the just under 2% rate the ECB aims to achieve for the entire euro area. In their latest push, policy makers pledged to keep buying bonds until inflation is firmly tethered around their goal.
Subdued price trends stand in stark contrast to other economic developments in the region. The 19-nation bloc has enjoyed uninterrupted growth for more than six years, domestic demand remains robust despite political and trade risks, and unemployment continues to decline. A report earlier on Monday showed German joblessness dropped in September, remaining near a record low.
Domestic resilience was one factor ECB officials cited as a reason arguing against restarting quantitative easing. Executive Board member Sabine Lautenschlaeger, one of at least eight policy makers to balk at the decision, unexpectedly quit last week.
In an interview released on Monday, outgoing ECB President Mario Draghi said the institution can do more if needed. Yet monetary stimulus will be less effective and last longer unless European governments step up spending, he said."
459,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 30, 2019 08:26AM ET</span>","Euro zone unemployment drops, an encouraging sign for growth","BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The unemployment rate in the euro zone dropped in August to its lowest in more than 11 years, official data showed on Monday, as services appeared to offset weakening industry, an encouraging sign for the region's growth.
The jobless rate in the 19-country euro zone fell to 7.4%, the European Union statistics agency said, its lowest since May 2008 when the euro zone's economy began to suffer from the subprime mortgage crisis in the United States.
The drop from 7.5% in July prolonged a decline begun in August 2014 when unemployment was at 11.5%. Since then, the rate has fallen or has remained stable every month for five years. It also defied market forecasts that the unemployment rate remained unchanged from July.
The euro zone's economic growth has been slowing, mostly because of falling industrial output over global trade tensions. The unemployment reading partly allayed fears the manufacturing slowdown would spill over into the larger services sector.
""This comes as a relief and gives time to the service sector to continue to grow even though the decline in manufacturing production is worsening,"" ING economist Bert Colijn said. 
Last week, a European Commission confidence indicator showed morale in services rose in September after three consecutive monthly declines . Lower unemployment should push up salaries and consumer spending, thus helping economic growth.
The jobless rate fell in August in the countries where it is highest, a sign that economic differences among countries are shrinking, although they remain wide.
In Spain, the unemployment fell to 13.8% in August from 13.9% in July. In Italy it went down to 9.5% from 9.8%. In Greece, the country with the highest rate, it dropped to 17.0% in June, the last month for which data are available there.

In Germany, the euro zone's largest economy, the rate was stable at 3.1% in August. The actual number of people out of work in Germany dropped by 7,000, a minor change that did not affect the rate.

460,By Bloomberg,"<span>Sep 30, 2019 07:54AM ET</span>","European Jobs Offer Some Joy Amid Manufacturing, Inflation Gloom","(Bloomberg) -- Europe’s job market is giving some hope to the region’s economic story, which has been dominated by a deepening slump in manufacturing that’s tipped Germany close to recession.
Figures Monday showed the euro-area unemployment rate fell to 7.4% in August, the lowest in over 11 years. Italy also reported an unexpected drop in its rate to 9.5% and Germany saw the number of people out of work decline for the first time since April. However, Germany also saw a decline in vacancies, a sign of caution among companies about hiring.
While the labor market is a lagging indicator, the figures show it’s so far resisting weaker global demand and a contraction in industry. That’s good news for consumer spending and the services sector, which continues to show growth.
“As one of the main drivers of service sector growth, the labor market has taken center stage in predictions about a looming recession,” ING economist Bert Colijn said. “If unemployment continues to come down at a decent pace, this will boost household incomes and in turn fuel domestic demand.”
The relative buoyancy of the job market may reinforce the view among some that the economic situation isn’t as bad as feared. European Central Bank policy makers are already in disagreement over their response to the threat of a deep downturn.
The ECB unveiled a broad stimulus program earlier in September and called on governments to follow suit with a fiscal program. But the inclusion of quantitative easing in the ECB measures stimulus sparked dissent in the ranks of officials.
Pointing to job numbers may not be enough to allay concerns about the outlook. Reports on Tuesday will probably confirm a worsening situation for manufacturing across the bloc and little change in inflation from the low levels that have motivated the ECB’s action. The euro-area rate is forecast to remain stuck around 1% in September.

LONDON (Reuters) - Households helped to limit the damage to Britain's economy as it shrank in the second quarter ahead of Brexit, according to new data that also showed their financial health was less fragile than previously thought.
The Office for National Statistics (ONS) confirmed the economy contracted at a quarterly rate of 0.2% in the second quarter, a hangover from a stockpiling boom before the original Brexit deadline that was postponed until Oct. 31.
While British industry and investment wilted in the escalating Brexit crisis, household spending increased at a quarterly rate of 0.4%, marking the fastest growth in a year.
The new ONS data also showed Britain's households have been net lenders to the economy rather than net borrowers ever since the second quarter of 2017. Previous data had shown households were net borrowers non-stop since late 2016.
The status change reflected people donating less to charity than previously thought, meaning households held more assets, as well as landlords earning more money, ONS said.
""A healthier picture of households' balance sheets gives us some confidence that household spending will continue to underpin growth,"" Andrew Wishart, economist at consultancy Capital Economics said.
Changes to the measurement of student loans also contributed to change in the status of households to net lenders, although the figures still showed a ""significant"" deterioration since the 2016 Brexit vote.
Lending to British consumers slowed to its weakest rate in more than five years in August, a sign household demand may be softening in the run-up to Britain's departure from the European Union, Bank of England (BoE) figures showed on Monday.
Sterling and British government bonds showed little reaction to Monday's data.
DEFICIT WORRY
Monday's ONS figures showed Britain's current account deficit in the second quarter narrowed by less than expected, to 25.2 billion pounds ($31.02 billion) from 33.1 billion pounds.
At 4.6% of gross domestic product, the deficit was larger than any economist had expected in a Reuters poll which had pointed to a deficit of 19.5 billion pounds.
""The fact that the current account deficit was still elevated ... in the second quarter is a concern -- as an elevated shortfall is a potential source of vulnerability for the UK economy,"" economist Howard Archer from the EY ITEM Club consultancy said.
BoE Governor Mark Carney described Britain as dependent ""on the kindness of strangers"" before the 2016 Brexit referendum, and last month the BoE said the current account deficit still posed economic risks.
A drop-off in foreign investors' demand for British assets could trigger a further fall in sterling and make it harder for businesses and consumers to raise finance or borrow.
Britain's economy has slowed since the Brexit referendum, and now faces increased headwinds from trade tensions between the United States and China and a slowdown in Europe.
While most economists think the economy recovered some of its lost ground in the third quarter, the outlook further ahead is clouded by the global slowdown and the Brexit crisis.
A Lloyds (LON:LLOY) Bank survey on Monday showed pessimism among businesses about the economic outlook rose in September to its highest since June 2016, the month of the Brexit vote.
Monday's ONS figures showed the economy grew by 1.3% in the year to the end of June, revised up from an earlier estimate of 1.2%.
Spending from households and the government -- the latter rising at the fastest annual rate since late 2008 -- were among the few drivers of growth in Britain's economy in the second quarter, with business investment falling again."

Economists are upgrading their growth projections for Vietnam after data this weekend showed the economy surged more than 7% in the third quarter.
 Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C). revised its full-year forecast to 6.9% from 6.7% previously, on the basis of another solid performance in the fourth quarter. Analysts at Maybank Kim Eng Research Ltd. now see 7% growth for the year versus a prior call of 6.8%.
Solid exports and manufacturing growth underpinned the third-quarter gain of 7.31%, flouting a regional slowdown triggered by U.S.-China and Japan-South Korea trade tensions and waning global demand. The expansion was the fastest pace since the start of last year, and reflects growing foreign investment into Vietnam as businesses shift production from China to bypass higher tariffs.

465,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 29, 2019 09:52PM ET</span>",Japan's August factory output slips more than expected on slowing overseas demand,"By Daniel Leussink
TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's industrial output shrank more than expected in August in the latest warning that the economy and its manufacturers are facing intensifying pressure amid a bitter Sino-U.S. trade war.
Retail sales, however, expanded at a faster-than-expected pace, signaling strength in private spending ahead of October's nationwide sales tax increase.
Industrial output fell 1.2% in August, government data showed, dropping at a faster pace than a median market forecast for a 0.5% decline and almost completely reversing July's 1.3% increase.
Output was weighed down by reduced production of iron and steel products, factory production equipment and cars, offsetting a gain in electronic parts and chemicals, the data showed.
Manufacturers surveyed by the trade ministry expect output to rise 1.9% in September, but fall 0.5% in October.
Monday's output data paints a bleak picture for Japan's export-reliant economy, underlining broadening stress across the manufacturing sector from slowing global growth, though service-sector activity remains firm as it is less at risk from weakness in global trade.
""The lack of export growth because of the global economic slowdown is having a major impact,"" said Takumi Tsunoda, senior economist at Shinkin Central Bank Research Institute. ""The sales tax will be raised in October, so the deceleration of the economy will likely become stronger."" 
The ministry cut its assessment of activity on the whole, saying it has been somewhat weakening recently.
The world's third-largest economy has so far avoided buckling under a slowdown in overseas demand, growing for the third straight quarter in April-June, largely thanks to robust household consumption and public works spending.
The latest data showed Japan's exports slipped for a ninth month in August as the Sino-U.S. trade war hit demand from China and other Asian trading partners. Exports in volume terms, which strips away the exchange rate impact, also fell.
Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, however, has brought Japanese exporters some relief after signing a limited trade deal with U.S. President Donald Trump to cut tariffs on U.S. farm goods, Japanese machine tools and other products.
Although the agreement does not cover autos, Abe said he had received assurances from Trump that Washington would not impose previously threatened ""Section 232"" national security tariffs on Japanese car imports.
Still, even as the threat of higher U.S. tariffs on Japanese car imports was staved off, policymakers remain worried about the darkening outlook for the economy in light of frail external demand and global recession risks.
This month, the Bank of Japan signaled the chance of expanding stimulus as early as its October policy meeting by stepping up its rhetoric against threats to the economy from heightened overseas risks.
An upbeat sign in August factory output came from electronic parts production, which expanded for a second straight month, suggesting the global IT cycle could be coming closer to bottoming out, said Shinkin's Tsunoda.
""It usually expands for two to three years before getting worse for a year, and it has been contracting since around the fall of last year,"" he said.
Separate data on Monday showed domestic demand might be stronger than thought, as retail sales climbed 2% in August from a year earlier, reflecting robust spending ahead of a sales tax increase to 10% from 8% on Oct. 1. The reading was better than a median estimate for a 0.9% gain.

The Confederation of British Industry's (CBI) gauge of private sector activity held steady at -6% in the three months to September, the same as in the period to August.
But business expectations for the coming three months dropped to their lowest since December 2011, across the spectrum of manufacturing, services and distribution, according to the survey of 567 companies.
Business investment has stagnated since the 2016 Brexit vote, leaving the economy more reliant on household spending for its growth.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - It's no longer a probability, it's a reality: the escalating U.S.-China trade war and the strengthening dollar appear to be inflicting measurable damage on U.S. goods makers that rely on global markets.
Market participants will get a picture of the extent to which trade tensions and currency have hurt U.S. manufacturers when the Institute for Supply Management (ISM) releases its purchasing managers index (PMI)  for September on Tuesday.
Its August report showed the manufacturing sector, which accounts for about 12% of the U.S. economy, contracting in for the first time in 3-1/2 years, and more worryingly, its export component hit a more than 10-year low. 
""The exporters are at least a half a step or full step closer to the predicted recession,"" said Robert Pavlik, chief investment strategist, senior portfolio manager at SlateStone Wealth LLC in New York. 
The August report's New Export Orders plunged to 43.3, its lowest level since April 2009, when the United States was in the throes of the great recession.
A PMI reading below 50 indicates contraction.
In the August PMI survey, manufacturers told ISM ""business is starting to show signs of a broad slowdown,"" and that ""tariffs continue to be a strain on the supply chain and the economy overall.""
China already has implemented tariffs on about $110 billion in U.S. goods, in return for President Donald Trump's tariffs on Chinese imports. Beijing announced additional retaliatory increases in August. The first tranche took effect at the beginning of this month and the second is due to follow on Dec. 15.
U.S. goods would already be more expensive on global markets due to a stronger dollar, which has been boosted by simmering geopolitical unease and negative interest rates in Europe. Market-rattling tit-for-tat tariff hikes from Washington and Beijing have created a perfect storm.
""Geopolitical tensions do two things,"" said Peter Tuz, president of Chase Investment Counsel in Charlottesville, Virginia. ""They compel big companies to sit back and not spend as much as they would."" 
""And as tensions increase and the dollar rises, (U.S.)products become more expensive and you see demand fall off."" 
The dollar index (DXY), which measures the greenback against a basket of major world currencies, hit a 29-month high on Sept. 3, the very day ISM released its dismal PMI report.

Indeed, in the first quarter of 2018, during which Trump fired the opening salvo in the trade war, the negative currency impact on North American corporate earnings was an estimated $40 million, according to cloud treasury services firm Kyriba. One year later, that number ballooned to $23.4 billion. 
The arrival of third-quarter earnings season next month will provide a clearer view of the damage the trade war and strong dollar have wrought on companies' bottom lines.
Over the last year, third-quarter analyst earnings estimates for a basket of 15 top U.S. exporters by dollar value have dropped by an average of 17.3%, according to Refinitiv data, and by 12.3% in the last three months.
(Graphic: Earnings estimates Image, https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-STOCKS/0100B2D11H8/earnings-est-changes.png) 
Fourth-quarter estimates for the same companies have been revised down 15.6% on average since September 2018 by 10.3% since June. 
Third-quarter earnings estimates for Apple Inc (O:AAPL) are 7.4% lower than they were a year ago, and down 16.7% for the essential October-December holiday quarter. Non-U.S. revenue contributes 63.1% of the iPhone maker's total.
 General Electric  Co (N:GE) gets about 61.5% of its revenue from abroad. Analysts currently see the conglomerate's third-quarter earnings coming in 44.6% below the level seen a year ago, and its fourth-quarter EPS estimates are now 43.5% lower.
Chipmakers, particularly vulnerable to trade concerns and technology exchange issues, have seen their earnings estimates slashed most. 
Micron Technology Inc (N:MU) relies on non-U.S. business for 88.1% of its revenue. Third quarter earnings estimates for the company have plunged 83.4% over the last year and 42% from last quarter.
Overseas customers contribute 97.4% of Qualcomm Inc's (O:QCOM) revenue. Analysts have slashed their third quarter earnings estimates for the company by 47.7% over the last year.
 Nike  Inc (N:NKE), which derives 62.5% of its revenues from overseas, reported its first-quarter earnings for fiscal year 2020 on Tuesday. The sportswear company's revenue and profit beat analyst estimates, but it said currency and trade concerns remained headwinds and it expects the impact of tariffs will be ""most pronounced"" in the current quarter. 
""The manufacturing side of our economy is in the early stages of a recession and we should be concerned about the possibility of a full recession spreading here and around the world,"" said Tim Ghriskey, chief investment strategist at Inverness Counsel in New York. 

""If (the ISM PMI) export number remains weak that will point to deepening overseas weakness,"" Ghriskey added. ""But a strong number would surprise me given what's happening around the world.""

471,By Bloomberg,"<span>Sep 27, 2019 09:30AM ET</span>",U.S. Economy Cools as Consumer Spending Misses Forecasts,"(Bloomberg) -- The U.S. economy cooled in August as Americans spent less than projected and companies cut capital-equipment orders, with below-forecast prices also adding to concerns that may support the case for further Federal Reserve easing. Treasury yields pared gains.
Consumer spending on goods and services, which accounts for about two-thirds of gross domestic product, increased 0.1% from July, the smallest gain in six months, Commerce Department data showed Friday. The Fed’s preferred underlying price gauge rose 0.1% from July, missing the median 0.2% estimate, while the gain in incomes matched projections.
A separate Commerce Department report showed bookings for non-military capital goods excluding aircraft -- a proxy for business investment -- fell 0.2%, the weakest performance in four months, compared with forecasts for no change.
The data suggest growth continued to cool in the third quarter, adding focus to next week’s September jobs report to show whether the labor-market slowdown is deepening. At the same time, solid income gains and a still-healthy job market should keep supporting consumption and extend the record-long U.S. expansion in coming months, as wages and salaries posted the biggest increase since March.
Last week, Fed officials cut the benchmark interest rate by a quarter point for the second time in two months to protect the economy from global weakness and trade uncertainty. Central bankers’ quarterly forecasts signaled only a minority of officials saw the need to lower borrowing costs further this year.
The trend in non-military capital goods orders underscores how the U.S.-China trade war and slowing growth abroad are weighing on American companies. Policy uncertainty has muddled supply chains and contributed to delayed long-term investments in people and capital. The question is how much the weakness will filter through to the broader economy.
The business-equipment data reflect an escalation of tariff threats by President Donald Trump in August, but September figures will offer a fuller picture of the impact of the duties that went into effect Sept. 1. Nonresidential investment, which includes corporate outlays for structures, contracted in the second quarter for the first time since 2016.
The core personal consumption expenditures price index, which excludes food and energy, increased 1.8% from August of last year, matching estimates though the monthly figure was below forecast. The annual gain was the largest since January, offering some comfort to policy makers, who view the core gauge as a better indicator of underlying price trends.
The broader PCE price gauge, which the Fed officially targets for 2% inflation, was unchanged from the prior month -- missing estimates for a gain -- and rose 1.4% from a year earlier, matching the median projection in a Bloomberg survey.
Muted inflationary pressures have vexed policy makers throughout the expansion, and price gains remain relatively subdued despite a tight labor market and faster wage increases. Trump has cited low inflation as an argument for more aggressive rate cuts by the Fed.
After adjusting for the increase in inflation, spending also rose 0.1%. The gain in August was driven by recreational goods and vehicles, while services spending was little changed amid a decline in outlays on food services and accommodations.
The personal saving rate rose to 8.1% from 7.8% the prior month.Adjusted for inflation, disposable income was up 0.4% following no change.
The broader measure of bookings for all durable goods, or items meant to last at least three years, topped estimates with a 0.2% gain, as defense capital-goods orders rose the most since March.
Shipments of non-defense capital goods excluding aircraft -- a measure used in GDP calculations -- rose 0.4% following a 0.6% drop. The report showed the three-month annualized gain for business-equipment shipments fell to 0.5% from 0.9%, while it rose to 2.6% from 0.9% for orders, suggesting business investment remains muted."

LONDON (Reuters) - Factories have been the first victims of the Trump-era global trade rows. Now the question is how much their troubles will spread to other parts of the world's biggest economies: the so-called spillover effect.
This week's read-out from German purchasing managers showed an unexpected worsening of the recession in the manufacturing sector of Europe's largest economy. But just as alarming was news that growth in services - by far the largest contributor to German output - was also losing momentum.
A slew of data on Monday should give more insight into how much of a knock-on effect the manufacturing slump is having for the average German on the street, with retail sales figures due for August and jobless and inflation data for September.
Then on Wednesday, top economic institutes are scheduled to update their growth forecasts for the German economy for this year and next. With a possible no-deal Brexit and the risk of higher U.S. tariffs on automobile imports from Europe, it could be pretty grim.
Spillover from the US-China trade war was cited by Moody's this week as a risk for Asian economies and is being watched closely by U.S. policymakers. For next week, their focus will be on just how badly U.S. industry is being hit.
Some officials worry that the U.S. manufacturing sector may already be in recession.
St. Louis Federal Reserve President James Bullard - one of the Fed's leading policy doves - raised that concern as part of his argument for a half percentage point rate cut at the bank's meeting in mid-September, twice what the Fed delivered.
Next week has the ISM manufacturing index for September due on Tuesday and factory employment figures out on Friday as part of the nonfarm payrolls report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Early estimates from Wall Street economists point to a modest rebound for ISM and some negligible factory job gains. Factory orders for August are then due on Thursday.
So far, there are signs that economies on both sides of the Atlantic are just about containing the fallout. In the United States, consumer spending in the second quarter grew 4.6%, while sentiment is actually improving in euro zone services.
WHAT TO WATCH ELSEWHERE
Chinese manufacturing PMI for September due on Monday is expected to remain on hold notwithstanding the trade tensions with the United States.
Away from the vexed Brexit debate, there is also a big data day in the UK on Monday with revised second quarter GDP figures - including current account deficit and business investment - as well as Bank of England consumer credit and mortgage approvals numbers.
Among those banks with rate-setting meetings are those of India (Friday) and Australia (Tuesday). For now, the jury is out on whether they will follow the easing trend being set by the Fed, the ECB and others.
A LAST THOUGHT
Climate change and its link to the economy made headlines at the United Nations gathering this week, with companies such as online retailer Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) announcing plans to go carbon-neutral by 2040 and teenage campaigner Greta Thunberg slamming the ""fairy tale"" of never-ending economic growth.
That last thought is taboo in traditional economics, which holds that growth measured in Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is always desirable and is a proxy for a rise in general well-being.
A new paper released by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) was therefore notable in concluding that ""focusing on GDP outcomes alone can lead to suboptimal outcomes"", not least for tackling environmental degradation and poverty. It urged policymakers to look again at what constitutes economic success through the lens of well-being.

473,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 27, 2019 08:41AM ET</span>",New group tries to boost the EU's capital markets as Brexit looms,"By Huw Jones
LONDON (Reuters) - The European Union could speed up efforts to build an EU-wide capital market by creating euro denominated benchmarks for trading commodities, a new group backed by financial companies, former politicians and central bankers said on Friday.
The EU launched its capital markets union (CMU) project in 2014 to encourage more companies to raise funds by issuing stocks and bonds to cut the region's reliance on bank loans.
In the EU, companies are still heavy users of banks to get cash unlike in the United States where firms routinely tap the country's vast capital market to raise money by selling bonds or shares.
Progress toward an EU capital market has been slow but Brexit has created a sense of urgency because London, the region's biggest capital market, is due to leave the EU next month.
The group - Markets4Europe - will launch its blueprint to help to deepen the EU capital markets in Brussels on Wednesday, a month before a new European Commission comes into office.
Many of its recommendations try to tackle familiar unresolved issues, but Markets4Europe wants to talk directly to member states, whose support is needed to make progress, rather than call for another ""top down"" reboot from Brussels.
There are also new ideas, such as strengthening the international role of the euro by developing euro-benchmarks for commodity markets.
London dominates many of the major commodity benchmarks such as crude oil and gold as well as industrial metals like copper.
Markets4Europe suggests creating benchmarks for liquid gas, hydrogen and emissions-trading to attract liquidity to those markets and boost the EU’s role in global financial markets.
Another new idea is to create a so-called ""safe asset"" in the euro zone.
European Central Bank officials have suggested this could be composed of a pool of sovereign bonds to cut the heavy exposure of banks in the euro zone to their own national debt and help to knit cross-border markets by acting as collateral to back trades.
After Brexit, Brussels is keen to reduce Europe's reliance on London-based financial services through a trade-off between the level of financial market access granted to the UK and extent of EU capital market ""autonomy"".
Markets4Europe also wants more efficient cross-border clearing of securities within the EU. London currently dominates euro-denominated clearing in interest rate swaps.
The group is backed by Vitor Constancio, former vice president of the European Central Bank, Christian Noyer, former Bank of France governor, Viviane Reding, former vice president of the European Commission, and Germany's former finance minister Peer Steinbrueck.
Allianz Global Investors (DE:ALVG),  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) Euroclear,  Euronext  (PA:ENX), BlackRock (NYSE:BLK), SocGen (PA:SOGN), Deutsche Boerse (DE:DB1Gn), Nasdaq Stockholm (O:NDAQ) and UniCredit (MI:CRDI) are among the firms that contributed to the recommendations.
Viviane Reding, for example, will focus on national justice ministries to win backing for streamlining taxation and insolvency rules, two sensitive areas where progress has been slow so far, but essential for integrating the legal underpinnings of cross-border markets."

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japanese big manufacturers' confidence likely hit a 6-1/2 year low in the September quarter, a Reuters poll found, as the U.S.-China trade war and weakening global demand hit the business mood.
The Bank of Japan's quarterly tankan business sentiment survey is projected to show the headline index for big manufacturers' confidence fell to +2 in September from +7 three months earlier, the poll of 12 economists found.
It would be the third straight quarterly deterioration and the lowest since March 2013 when the index showed -8.
That also means the index likely fell to the lowest since the BOJ under governor Haruhiko Kuroda started its super-loose monetary policy in April 2013.
The sentiment index for big non-manufacturers also likely worsened to +20 in September from +23 seen in June survey, the poll showed.
""The intensified U.S.-China trade friction, slowdown in overseas economies and yen's appreciation hit firms' business sentiment,"" said Tsuyoshi Ueno, senior economist at NLI Research Institute.
In the December quarter, big manufacturers' business confidence is expected to worsen to +1 and non-manufacturers' sentiment is also seen falling to +16, the poll found.
Big companies are projected to raise capital spending plans by 7.0% for this fiscal year to March 2020, slightly down from 7.4% projected in the June survey.
""A deterioration in the export environment and concerns over the economic outlook after a sales tax hike in October, big companies are expected to downgrade their caped plans,"" said Takeshi Minami, chief economist at Norinchukin Research Institute.
BOJ Governor Kuroda signaled on Thursday a readiness to ease monetary policy further, vowing to guide policy appropriately ""without any preset conditions in mind"".
The BOJ will publish its tankan survey at 8:50 a.m. on Oct. 1 (2350 GMT on Sept. 30).
Meanwhile, Japan's factory output in August likely slipped 0.5% from the previous month, due to weak exports to Asian nations, after a 1.3% gain in July, another poll of 16 economists showed.
The trade ministry will announce the factory output at 0850 JST on Monday (2350 GMT Sept. 29).
Retail sales data, also released at 0850 JST on Monday, was expected to show a 0.9% growth in August from a year earlier, after a 2% fall in July, the poll showed.
Sales of summer items, auto and home electric appliances likely contributed to the growth in retail sales, analysts said.
The poll also expects the jobless rate rose to 2.3% in August from 2.2% in July, and the jobs-to-applicants ratio stood at 1.58, down from 1.59."

TOKYO (Reuters) - A leading indicator of Japan's core consumer inflation slowed for a second straight month to its lowest rate in more than a year, underscoring the challenge for the central bank in hitting its 2% price target.
Government data released on Friday showed core consumer prices in Tokyo, a leading indicator of nationwide price trends, rose 0.5% in September from a year earlier, slowing from a 0.7% gain in the previous month.
The rise in the core consumer price index for Japan's capital city, which includes oil products but excludes fresh food prices, undershot the median estimate of a 0.6% increase.
It was the slowest growth since May last year and weighed by declines in energy prices.
""October's sales tax hike will serve as one factor for lifting inflation temporarily, but that will be offset by government steps to make pre-school education free of charge,"" said Masaki Kuwahara, senior economist at Nomura Securities.
""For the time being, energy-related items will weigh on core inflation, which will remain in a downtrend.""
The stubbornly weak inflation and overseas headwinds are piling pressure on the Bank of Japan to ramp up an already massive stimulus program to forestall risks of a delay in hitting its elusive 2% inflation target.
The central bank will scrutinize the inflation data and other key indicators at its next rate-setting meeting on Oct. 30-31, when it conducts a quarterly review of its growth and price projections.
At its policy meeting last week, the BOJ signaled its readiness to expand stimulus as early as next month by issuing a strong warning about risks that threaten Japan's export-reliant economy.
But with interest rates at zero and companies wary about boosting spending amid growing uncertainty and risks, many analysts are skeptical that topping up monetary stimulus could accelerate inflation.
The so-called core-core CPI in Tokyo, which strips away the effects of both energy and fresh food prices, rose 0.6% in September, slowing from a 0.7% gain in August, the data showed.
Tokyo's overall CPI rose 0.4% in September from a year earlier, after 0.6% growth in the previous month.
Years of heavy money printing have failed to shake off entrenched deflationary mindset among the public and corporations, dashing the hopes of the central bank that aggressive stimulus will put an decisive end to deflation.
Under its current forecasts issued in July, the BOJ expects core consumer inflation to hit 1.0% in the current fiscal year ending in March 2020 and fall short of its 2% target for the following two years."
476,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 27, 2019 01:16AM ET</span>",China's Aug industrial profits fall as headwinds hit firms,"By Stella Qiu and Gabriel Crossley
BEIJING (Reuters) - Profits at China's industrial firms contracted in August, reversing the previous month's brief gain, as weak domestic demand and the trade war with the United States weighed on corporate balance sheets.
Industrial profits fell 2% in August from a year earlier to 517.8 billion yuan ($72.59 billion), data released by the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) on Friday showed. That compared with a 2.6% gain in July.
Profits have slowed since the second half of 2018, despite some transitory rebounds, with falling factory-gate prices threatening to further knock profits as economic growth skidded to a near 30-year low.
As a result, policymakers are widely expected to unveil more support measures to boost a slowing economy amid sluggish consumption, rising export pressure and faltering domestic demand.
The decline in profits was in line with grim manufacturing readings in August with industrial production growth falling to its weakest in 17-1/2 years while exports also tumbled.
""Given strong growth headwinds and elevated U.S.-China trade tensions, we expect the economy to worsen before getting better and believe Beijing will likely ramp up its policy stimulus,"" analysts from Nomura said in a note.
Producer prices, one key barometer of domestic demand and indicative of profitability, posted their sharpest fall in three years last month.
For January-August, industrial firms earned profits of 4.02 trillion yuan, down 1.7% year-on-year, the same as the reading in the first seven months.
Analysts expect economic growth could cool further this quarter from a near 30-year low of 6.2% hit in April-June.
Earlier this month, the People's Bank of China (PBOC) increased support for slowing growth by cutting banks' reserve requirement ratio (RRR) for the third time this year. China also cut a new one-year benchmark lending rate to free up credit to struggling smaller firms.
But analysts say Beijing will need to do more to ward off a steeper slowdown, although the scope for stimulus is limited as policymakers worry about rising debt risks and property bubbles.
Fuel processing industries, chemical fibers and paper manufacturing industries posted some of the steepest declines in profits over the January-August period.
Profit margins in car manufacturing and non-ferrous sectors improved slightly and the profit declines in telecommunications and electronic equipment manufacturing, which are more vulnerable to U.S. tariffs than other product classes, narrowed.
A nearly 15-month trade war between the world's two biggest economies has shown no signs of ending. Top U.S. and China trade negotiators are expected to meet in Washington in about two weeks to determine if they can chart a path out of the bruising trade war.
Industrial firms' liabilities increased 5.0% from a year earlier to 65.81 trillion yuan at end-August, compared with a 4.9% increase in July.
Private sector profits rose 6.5% in January-August, slowing from 7.0% growth in the first seven months."
477,By Bloomberg,"<span>Sep 27, 2019 12:56AM ET</span>",Slowing Economy and Deflation Cause China’s Company Profits to Drop,"(Bloomberg) -- Chinese industrial companies’ profits fell in August, with the 2% drop from a year ago another sign of how the slowing economy is hurting business and increasing problems for the government.
The fall was due to a slowdown in industrial production and sales, the deeper drop in producer prices and super typhoons hitting the nation, according to a statement from the National Bureau of Statistics Friday. For the first eight months, profits contracted 1.7%. Margins of state-owned enterprises dropped by 8.6% in the period, while private companies saw an increase of 6.5%, according to the NBS.
The weakness of the economy in August looks set to continue into September, according to a set of early indicators compiled by Bloomberg. Even with trade tensions with the U.S. easing somewhat since August, manufacturing this month is forecast to have contracted again, which will put more pressure on the government to act to counter already slowing growth.
“The decline in China’s industrial profits in August reinforces our concern that the economy continues to decelerate,” Bloomberg Economist David Qu wrote in a note. “We reiterate our view that further supportive, but measured, policies are necessary to stabilize growth. We expect the central bank and the government to step up stimulus accordingly.”

SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korean exports were seen contracting for the tenth consecutive month in September, although at a slower pace, as the U.S.-China tariff war continued to drag and uncertainty remained over a recovery in the semiconductor sector.
Shipments in September were forecast to fall a median 11.2% from a year earlier, according to a survey of 11 economists, slightly better than a 13.8% fall in August, which was the worst decline since January 2016.
""It may take quite some time for exports to make a significant rebound,"" said Ma Tieying, economist with DBS Bank. ""We currently look for marginally positive export growth in the first half of 2020.""
The majority of economists said uncertainties about the timing of an anticipated breakthrough in the U.S.-China stand-off and of a recovery in the semiconductor sector continued to be risks to the domestic economy.
United States and China trade negotiators are expected to meet in Washington next month, while Japan announced last month it would allow exports of some semiconductor manufacturing materials to South Korea.
The Reuters poll estimated that imports to South Korea, Asia's fourth largest economy, would decline 3.0% this month from a year earlier.
The economists saw South Korea's consumer price inflation dipping a median 0.3% in September, that would be slightly worse than the flat result in August and the first negative reading since inflation data release began in 1965.
The Bank of Korea (BOK) currently sees this year's annual inflation at 0.7%, far below its 2% target. The bank slashed this year’s economic growth forecast to 2.2% in July, but that is still far above projections by private-sector organizations, which are as low as 1.4%.
The BOK is widely expected to lower rates at its next meeting on Oct. 16, after holding fire at its last meeting in August. The central bank surprised markets with a cut in July, the first reduction in three years.
S&P Global Ratings chief economist Shaun Roache told Reuters on Wednesday that deflation pressure was the biggest domestic risk facing South Korea's economy, adding that he expected two more rate cuts by early next year.
The Reuters poll also expects industrial output in August to have contracted by a seasonally adjusted 0.5% from a month earlier.
August industrial output data will be released at 8 a.m. on Monday local time (2300 GMT Sunday).
September trade data is due to be published at 9 a.m. on Tuesday (0000 GMT) while inflation figures are expected an hour earlier (2300 GMT Monday)."

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. business investment contracted more sharply than previously estimated in the second quarter and corporate profit growth was tepid, casting a shadow on an economy that is being stalked by financial market fears of a recession.
The downturn in business spending has been blamed on the Trump administration's nearly 15-month trade war with China. The soft investment and sluggish profit gains, reported by the Commerce Department on Thursday, could raise doubts on consumers' ability to continue driving the economy. 
A strong labor market is fueling consumer spending, keeping economic growth on a moderate path. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell last week said trade policy tensions, which ""have waxed and waned, and elevated uncertainty is weighing on U.S. investment and exports,"" posing an ongoing risk to the longest economic expansion on record, now in its 11th year. 
Powell said U.S. central bank contacts had told policymakers that trade policy uncertainty ""has discouraged them from investing in their businesses."" The Fed cut interest rates again last Wednesday after lowering borrowing costs in July for the first time since 2008. 
""Given the uncertainty in the economy, businesses are very cautious about spending in construction as well as equipment, and this is not a very good sign,"" said Sung Won Sohn, a business economics professor at Loyola Marymount University in Los Angeles. ""After all, businesses are the ones hiring people, providing income and the buying power for consumers.""
Business investment declined at a 1.0% annualized rate last quarter, the government said in its third reading of second-quarter gross domestic product. That was the steepest decline since the fourth quarter of 2015. 
Business investment was previously estimated to have dropped at a 0.6% pace. It was pulled down by an 11.1% rate of decline in spending on structures, which reflected decreases in the categories of commercial and healthcare, and mining exploration, shafts and wells. 
After-tax profits without inventory valuation and capital consumption adjustment, which correspond to S&P 500 profits, increased at a downwardly revised $59.7 billion, or 3.3% rate. Profits were previously reported to have advanced by $86.0 billion, or at a 4.8% rate in the second quarter. 
There were downward revisions to profits from the rest of the world and domestic industry profits. 
Gross domestic product increased at an unrevised 2.0% rate in the second quarter as the strongest consumer spending in 4-1/2 years offset weak exports and a slower pace of inventory investment. The economy grew at a 3.1% rate in the January-March quarter. It expanded 2.6% in the first half of the year.
But when measured from the income side, the U.S. economy grew at a 1.8% rate in the second quarter. Gross domestic income (GDI) was previously reported to have increased at a 2.1% pace in the April-June quarter. It rose at a 3.2% rate in the first quarter. 
The average of GDP and GDI, also referred to as gross domestic output and considered a better measure of economic activity, rose at a 1.9% rate last quarter, rather than the 2.1% pace estimated last month. That was a slowdown from a 3.2% pace of growth in the first three months of the year.
Inflation was a little bit firmer than previously thought in the second quarter.
U.S. financial markets were little moved by the data as investors watched unfolding developments on the accusations President Donald Trump pressed Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy to investigate Democratic presidential front-runner and former Vice President Joe Biden.
The dollar was flat against a basket of currencies, while U.S. Treasuries rose. Stocks on Wall Street were trading lower.
LOSING ALTITUDE
The economy is largely losing speed as the stimulus from the White House's $1.5 trillion tax-cut package and a government spending blitz fades. Economists are forecasting growth this year around 2.5%, below the Trump administration's 3% target.
Growth in consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, surged at a 4.6% rate in the second quarter. That was the fastest since the fourth quarter of 2014 and was a slight downward revision from the 4.7% pace estimated last month.
Consumer spending is being driven by the lowest unemployment rate in nearly 50 years. A separate report from the Labor Department on Thursday showed initial claims for state unemployment benefits increased 3,000 to a seasonally adjusted 213,000 for the week ended Sept. 21.
Despite the strong labor market conditions, there are fears that a recent ebb in consumer confidence amid concerns about duties on Chinese consumer goods, which came into effect in September, could slow spending. Further tariffs are expected.
""If all the trade tariffs on China get pushed to 30% across the board then this will take a toll on U.S. economic growth next year, slowing the economy closer to the so-called 1% stall speed where bad things can happen,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG in New York.
There were minor revisions to trade and inventory investment estimates. Trade cut 0.68 percentage point from GDP growth last quarter and could remain a drag on GDP growth in the third quarter. A third report from the Commerce Department on Thursday showed the goods trade deficit rose 0.5% to $72.8 billion in August amid a rise in imports and small gain in exports.
Growth in inventories sliced off 0.91 percentage point from GDP growth last quarter as reported in August. Inventories could continue to weigh on output this quarter. The government also reported on Thursday that retail inventories were unchanged in August after rising 0.7% in the prior month. 
Retail inventories, excluding motor vehicles and parts, the component that goes into the calculation of GDP, were also flat last month after increasing 0.4% in July.

Government investment in the second quarter was raised as state and local government spending was much stronger than previously thought. Spending on homebuilding contracted for a sixth straight quarter, the longest such stretch since the Great Recession.

The National Association of Realtors said on Thursday its pending home sales index rose 1.6% to a reading of 107.3. July's index was unrevised. Compared to one year ago, pending sales were up 2.5%.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast pending home sales increasing 0.9% in August. Pending home contracts are seen as a forward-looking indicator for the wellbeing of the housing market because they become sales within a couple of months.
The housing sector has rebounded in recent months in response to a sharp drop in mortgage rates. Data last week showed housing starts and building permits jumped to a more than 12-year high in August, and existing home sales rose to the highest level in 17 months.
In August, contracts increased across the nation's four regions. Pending sales jumped 3.1% in the West and rose 1.4% in the Northeast and South. They edged up 0.6% in the Midwest.

Initial claims for state unemployment benefits increased 3,000 to a seasonally adjusted 213,000 for the week ended Sept. 21, the Labor Department said on Thursday. Data for the prior week was revised to show 2,000 more applications received than previously reported.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast claims increasing to 212,00 in the latest week. The Labor Department said only claims for Puerto Rico were estimated last week.
Despite trade tensions, which have weighed on business investment and manufacturing, layoffs remain low. That is helping to underpin consumer spending, which is largely driving the economy.
The four-week moving average of initial claims, considered a better measure of labor market trends as it irons out week-to-week volatility, fell 750 to 212,000 last week.
The number of people receiving benefits after an initial week of aid declined 15,000 to 1.65 million for the week ended Sept. 14, the lowest level since October 2018. The four-week moving average of the so-called continuing claims decreased 12,750 to 1.67 million.
Continuing claims data covered the week during which households were surveyed for September's unemployment rate. The four-week average of claims fell 32,500 between the August and September household survey weeks suggesting some improvement in the jobless rate, which is currently at 3.7%.
The economy created 130,000 jobs in August. Economists say it is unclear whether the loss of momentum in hiring is due to ebbing demand for labor or a shortage of qualified workers.
While job growth has slowed to an average of 158,000 per month this year from 223,000 in 2018, it remains above the roughly 100,000 per month needed to keep up with growth in the working age population."

Market research company YouGov said its monthly consumer sentiment indicator, compiled with economic consultancy Cebr, dropped to 103.4 in September from 104.0 in August, its lowest level since May 2013.
""It is clear now that the UK has shifted into a slower growth mode due to a combination of ongoing domestic political uncertainty and global economic headwinds,"" said Kay Neufeld, head of macroeconomics at Cebr.
Britain's economy unexpectedly contracted in the three months to June and the Bank of England and other economists predict only modest growth in the three months to September, with Britain still at risk of a disruptive Brexit on Oct. 31.
Uncertainty about the terms and timing on which Britain will leave the EU has depressed business investment, but consumer demand has proved resilient so far, according to official data.
There are tentative signs this may be starting to crack.
A separate survey by IHS Markit on Monday showed households' concerns about the outlook for their personal finances was the highest in nearly six years, and on Wednesday the Confederation of British Industry reported a fall in retail sales.
But in the short term British households are benefiting from record-low unemployment, as well as wages that are rising at the fastest rate in more than 10 years.
Figures from pay analysis company XpertHR, also released on Thursday, showed that the average basic pay settlement at large employers remained at a 10-year high of 2.5% in the three months to the end of August, unchanged since the start of the year.
Official measures of wage growth tend to run somewhat higher, as they also factor in pay rises achieved through promotions and job changes."

Consumers' median inflation expectations for the next 12 months fell to 1.8% in September, down from 2.0% in August and the lowest since the data was first released in February 2002.
The nation's consumer price index was unchanged in August from a year earlier, the weakest pace since the country began releasing inflation data in 1965 and far below the central bank's 2% target and annual forecast of 0.7%.
The composite consumer sentiment index, compiled from the same survey, edged up to 96.9 in September from 92.5 in August.
""The index sharply rebounded after falling for four months in a row as concerns over U.S.-China trade tensions eased (earlier this month),"" a central bank official told reporters on Wednesday, but added that future trends will likely depend on how global events develop such as the Sino-U.S. trade war.
The composite reading stands below 100, meaning that consumer sentiment is weaker than the long-term average, which currently covers 2003-2018.
The official also said the impact from the recent outbreak of African swine fever in South Korea is not reflected in the data yet. The first case was reported on Sept. 17 while the survey was carried out from Sept. 10 to 17.

The export-reliant economy is suffering from slower global growth and business uncertainty caused by U.S. President Donald Trump's 'America First' trade policies and Britain's planned exit from the European Union.
Ifo's gauge measuring export expectations fell to -5.2 from -2.3, its lowest reading since July 2009 when the global financial crisis hit the German economy.
""At the moment, there are hardly any positive signals from the global economy for German exporters,"" Ifo President Clemens Fuest said. The risk of a no-deal Brexit is already affecting German exporters through increased uncertainty, he said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Sales of new U.S. single-family homes rebounded more than expected in August, the latest sign that the sluggish housing market was starting to get a lift from lower mortgage rates.
The report from the Commerce Department on Wednesday also suggested the economy continued to grow moderately. It added to solid reports on August retail sales, industrial production, housing starts and home resales in allaying financial market fears of a recession.
A year-long trade war between the United States and China has heightened risks to the longest economic expansion in history, now in its 11th year, prompting the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates for the second time last week. The U.S. central bank cut rates in July for the first time since 2008.
""This positive data caps off a month of redemption for the housing market,"" said John Pataky, executive vice president at TIAA Bank in Jacksonville, Florida. ""If American consumers remain in good spirits, there is no reason this positive momentum can't continue, so long as prices remain in check and housing supply does not get critically low.""
The Commerce Department said new home sales increased 7.1% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 713,000 units last month, boosted by a surge in activity in the South and West. July's sales pace was revised up to 666,000 units from the previously reported 635,000 units.
It was the second time in three months that new homes sales jumped above 700,000. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast new home sales, which account for about 11.5% of housing market sales, increasing 3.5% to a pace of 660,000 units in August.
New home sales are drawn from permits and tend to be volatile on a month-to-month basis. Sales vaulted 18.0% from a year ago. New homes sales are benefiting from a shortage of previously owned homes. The median new house price rose 2.2% to $328,400 in August from a year ago.
The housing market, the sector most sensitive to interest rates, has perked up in recent months in response to a sharp drop in mortgage rates. Reports last week showed housing starts and building permits soared to a more than 12-year high in August, and home resales rose to the highest level in 17 months.
Homebuilders confidence increased in September. The 30-year fixed mortgage rate has dropped about 120 basis points from last year's highs to an average of 3.73%, according to data from mortgage finance agency Freddie Mac.
While other data from the Mortgage Bankers Association on Wednesday showed applications for loans to purchase a home fell last week, they were up strongly from a year ago.
The dollar rose against a baskets of currencies as investors were drawn to its safe-haven appeal after House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi on Tuesday announced that the Democrat-led House was moving forward with an official impeachment inquiry on President Donald Trump.
Stocks on Wall Street were trading higher after Trump said a trade deal with China could happen sooner than expected. U.S. Treasury prices fell.
REGAINING FOOTING
The recent improvement in housing data has raised optimism that the housing market could be regaining its footing after hitting a soft patch last year. Residential investment has contracted for six straight quarters, the longest such stretch since the 2007-2009 recession.
The Atlanta Fed is forecasting gross domestic product rising at a 1.9% annualized rate in the third quarter. The economy grew at a 2.0% pace in the second quarter, slowing from the January-March quarter's brisk 3.1% rate.
New home sales in the South, which accounts for the bulk of transactions, advanced 6.0% in August. Sales in the West accelerated 16.5%. But sales tumbled 5.9% in the Northeast and fell 3.0% in the Midwest. Sales last month were concentrated in the $200-749,000 price range. Homes priced below $200,000, the most sought after, accounted for only 10% of sales.
Builders have complained that land and labor shortages were making it difficult to construct more affordable houses.
""Builders remain focused on the upper end of the market,"" said George Ratiu, senior economist at online listings website realtor.com. ""Costs of construction remain an ongoing issue. The inventory of affordable new homes is likely to remain constrained this year.""
There were 326,000 new homes on the market last month, the fewest since September 2018 and down 1.2% from July. At August's sales pace it would take 5.5 months to clear the supply of houses on the market, down from 5.9 months in July.
About 63% of the houses sold last month were either under construction or yet to be built."

The Washington-based industry group's seasonally adjusted index on mortgage applications stood at 512.2 in the week ended Sept. 20, down 10.1% from the prior week. This was the biggest week-on-week decline since a 12.1% fall in the week of Dec. 23, 2016.
The average interest rate for 30-year fixed-rate mortgages, with conforming loan balances of $484,350 or less, edged up 1 basis point to 4.02%, the highest since the week of July 26. Two weeks earlier, it stood at 3.82%, which was the lowest since November 2016."

The French data is a bright spot of economic news for a euro zone fighting recession and will help President Emmanuel Macron push his case for Germany to act sooner rather than later to revive its own faltering economy.
The INSEE national statistics office said its consumer confidence index for September rose for a ninth straight month to 104 from a revised 103 in August - the highest since it reached 105 points in January 2018. A Reuters poll of 13 economists had forecast 102 points for September.
The data showed that a raft of tax cuts and bonus schemes earlier this year for the poorest workers and pensioners worth more than 10 billion euros ($11 billion) was beginning to alter household spending trends.
The data showed a further increase in consumers considering it to be a good time to splurge on big-ticket items. But it also suggested households might be more inclined to squirrel away extra income rather than spend it. The survey showed a jump in their confidence over their ability to save in the future.
Concerns about unemployment fell sharply for a second consecutive month to their lowest since January 2018 as France's labor market continues to see solid job creation.
The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development last week predicted French economic growth in 2020 would comfortably outpace German expansion, forecasting 1.2% growth in France and an anemic 0.6 percent in Germany.
While France's economy has so far shrugged off the sharp slowdown of Europe's biggest economy, Macron faces resistance on the streets to planned reforms to France's costly pension and unemployment benefit systems.
In a further sweetener to households and companies, Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire is expected to unveil more tax cuts, with little sign of a tightening of the purse strings, when he presents his 2020 budget to parliament on Friday."

One member was quoted as saying that ""there was a growing risk that the strengthening of the monetary easing stance by central banks in the United States and Europe would exert downward pressure on Japan's prices, mainly through foreign exchange rates. It was necessary to make a preventive and preemptive policy response to downside risks to prices.""
The BOJ left monetary policy steady at the July meeting but pledged to ease without hesitation to preempt risks that could hurt the chance of hitting its 2% inflation target.

492,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 24, 2019 12:36PM ET</span>","U.S. consumer confidence falls in September, trade fears dominate","By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. consumer confidence ebbed in September as an escalation in trade tensions fanned concerns about business and labor market conditions, a potentially worrying signal for consumer spending, which has been driving the economy.
The relatively downbeat survey from the Conference Board on Tuesday mirrors other confidence surveys and could renew financial market fears of a recession that had been assuaged somewhat by strong August retail sales, industrial production and housing data.
The Federal Reserve last week cut interest rates for the second time to offset the impact on the economy from the year-long trade war between the United States and China, and slowing global growth. The U.S. central bank lowered rates in July for the first time since 2008.
The longest economic expansion on record, now in its 11th year, is mostly being sustained by consumer spending, via the lowest unemployment rate in nearly 50 years. But there have been fears the U.S.-China trade war, which has weighed on business investment and manufacturing, could slam the brakes on consumer spending.
""We aren't in a recession yet, but the consumer is plainly worried,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG in New York. ""Consumer confidence is fragile and any further escalation of the trade war will probably be all it takes to push them and the economy over the edge.""
The Conference Board said its consumer confidence index dropped to a reading of 125.1 this month from a downwardly revised 134.2 in August. The index was previously reported at 135.1 in August. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast it declining to 133.5 in September.
The survey's present situation measure, based on consumers' assessment of current business and labor market conditions, decreased to 169.0 this month from 176.0 in August. The Conference Board said ""the escalation in trade and tariff tensions in late August appears to have rattled consumers,"" and that ""it appears confidence is plateauing.""
The White House announced a new round of tariffs on Chinese imports last month. Some of the new duties, which include a range of consumer goods, came into effect this month.
A trade deal between the two economic giants appeared elusive on Friday after Chinese officials unexpectedly canceled a visit to farms in Montana and Nebraska. President Donald Trump said on Tuesday he would not ""accept a bad deal for the American people.""
The Conference Board survey is now converging with the University of Michigan survey, which showed a sharp drop in consumer sentiment in August. While the University of Michigan's sentiment index edged up in September, worries about the impact of tariffs on the economy continued to weigh heavily on consumer's minds.
GROWTH ENGINE
""The trade war is beginning to more meaningfully weigh on confidence,"" said Tim Quinlan, a senior economist at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) Securities in Charlotte, North Carolina. ""Decreased confidence could weigh on consumer spending, but consumption should remain a key engine of growth in third quarter.""
The dollar was little changed against a basket of currencies, while U.S. Treasury prices rose. Stocks on Wall Street were trading slightly lower.
The Conference Board survey's so-called labor market differential, derived from data on respondents' views on whether jobs are plentiful or hard to get, fell to 33.2 in September from 38.3 in July. That measure closely correlates to the unemployment rate in the Labor Department's employment report.
The share of consumers expecting more jobs in the months ahead decreased to 17.5% this month from 19.9% in August, while those anticipating fewer jobs increased to 15.7% from 13.7%.
These findings are in line with a slowdown in job growth. Employers added 130,000 jobs to their payrolls in August. Job gains have averaged 158,000 per month this year, above the roughly 100,000 per month needed to keep up with growth in the working age population. The unemployment rate is at 3.7%.
Other data on Tuesday showed mixed readings on house price inflation in July. The Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) said house prices accelerated in July amid gains across the key regions, a trend that could offset some of the boost to the housing market from declining mortgage rates.
The FHFA said its house price index increased a seasonally adjusted 5.0% in July from a year ago. That followed a 4.8% rise in June. Prices rose 0.4% on a monthly basis after advancing 0.2% in June. The FHFA's index is calculated by using purchase prices of houses financed with mortgages sold to or guaranteed by mortgage finance companies Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.
Separately, the S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller house price index for 20 metro areas increased 2.0% from a year ago in July, the smallest gain since August 2012, after rising 2.2% in June.
""Lower mortgage interest rates and tight inventory levels are supporting home values, and we expect annual growth to stay close to 3% over the remainder of the year,"" said Matthew Pointon, property economist at Capital Economics in New York."

The Conference Board, an industry group, said its index of consumer attitudes fell to 125.1, from an downwardly revised 134.2 the month before. 
The 49 economists polled by Reuters had expected a reading of 133.5. September's reading marked the largest shortfall relative to Wall Street's expectations since 2010.
""The escalation in trade and tariff tensions in late August appears to have rattled consumers,"" Lynn Franco, Senior Director of Economic Indicators at The Conference Board, said in a statement. 
The reading for the month prior was revised down to 134.2 from 135.1. 

The expectations index – based on consumers’ short-term outlook for income, business and labor market conditions – declined to 95.8 in September from 106.4 last month.

The S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller index of property values increased 2% from a year earlier, the slowest since August 2012, according to data released Tuesday. Nationally, home-price gains remained steady, rising at a 3.2% pace.
Key Insights
The latest data highlight how the market continues to struggle despite solid wage gains for Americans and cheaper borrowing costs. A shortage of affordable inventory and construction constraints have helped lift home prices despite demand that has been somewhat tepid as elevated prices deter some potential buyers.Price gains may accelerate in coming months amid signs that lower rates may be luring more buyers into the market. Existing home sales rose in August to the best pace in more than a year, while the median sales price saw the second-fastest gain in the past year.Official’s View
“Year-over-year home prices continued to gain, but at ever more modest rates,” Philip Murphy, global head of index governance at S&P Dow Jones, said in a statement. “Gains remained positive in low-single digits in most cities, and other fundamentals indicate renewed housing demand.”

LONDON (Reuters) - British factories' expectations for output fell in September to their lowest in more than 10 years, according to a survey that showed Brexit and a global slowdown weighing on manufacturing.
The Confederation of British Industry's (CBI) monthly manufacturing order book balance fell to -28 in September from -13 in August, below expectations in a Reuters poll for a reading of -18.
The survey's gauge of output expectations for the next three months dropped to -19 from -1, its lowest since April 2009, as stocks of finished goods piled up at the fastest rate since the 2008-09 financial crisis.
(GRAPHIC: UK factory expectations hit 10-year low, https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/polling/1/615/611/factory%20output.png)
The figures chimed with a slew of dismal manufacturing data across Europe, after a survey on Monday showed German factories were at their lowest ebb last month in more than 10 years.
Trade conflict between the United States and China and a global downturn in the automotive sector have hammered manufacturers all over the world. The escalating Brexit crisis has additionally dampened investment in British manufacturing, which accounts for 10% of economic output.
""The survey does little to suggest that the manufacturing sector have been of much help to UK growth in the third quarter,"" economist Howard Archer from the EY ITEM Club consultancy said.
""The very real risk that a no-deal Brexit could yet occur on Oct. 31 could well fuel near-term concerns over manufacturers' supply chains and ability to meet future demand.""
Earlier on Tuesday, the Supreme Court ruled that Prime Minister Boris Johnson's decision to shut down the British parliament for five weeks in the run-up to Brexit was unlawful, a humiliating rebuke to him.
Capital Economics, a consultancy, put the odds of a no-deal Brexit at 40% on Tuesday.
""Each day of Brexit uncertainty sees firms forced to withhold key investment and recruitment decisions that make a huge difference to communities across the country,"" said Tom Crotty, group director of energy and chemicals company Ineos and chair of the CBI manufacturing council.
""It is therefore crucial that no more time is wasted in ending the Brexit deadlock, and that a damaging no-deal cliff-edge is avoided at all costs.""

498,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 24, 2019 04:46AM ET</span>","UK posts smaller-than-expected deficit in August, but year-to-date borrowing up strongly","LONDON (Reuters) - Britain ran a smaller than expected budget deficit last month but borrowing in the financial year to date rose by more than a quarter ahead of the country's planned departure from the European Union next month.
Public sector net borrowing in August totaled 6.418 billion pounds, excluding public-sector banks, down from 6.917 billion in August 2018 and below economists' average forecast of a 7.15 billion pound deficit in a Reuters poll.
Looking at the five months since the start of the current tax year in April, borrowing was up 28% percent from the same period in 2018, the Office for National Statistics said on Tuesday.
Tuesday's figures reflected a change in the ONS's treatment of student loans, to take account that around half of them will not be repaid. This added 12.4 billion pounds to the borrowing figures for the 2018/19 financial year that ended in March, the ONS said.
Along with corrected corporation tax data and changes to the way public sector pensions are recorded, the ONS estimated the deficit excluding public sector banks for 2018/19 at 41.4 billion pounds rather than 23.6 billion previously -- or 1.9% of GDP instead of 1.1%.
In March Britain's Office for Budget Responsibility forecast public borrowing would rise from a 16-year low of 1.1% of economic output in 2018/19 to 1.3% of GDP or 29.3 billion pounds in 2019/20, excluding the effect of future statistical changes.
However in July it predicted borrowing could jump by 30 billion pounds a year by 2020/21 if Britain leaves the EU without a transition deal on Oct. 31, triggering a recession.
Earlier this month new finance minister Sajid Javid said he was ""turning the page on austerity"" as he promised the biggest spending increases in 15 years, a move widely seen as part of Prime Minister Boris Johnson's push for an election to break the Brexit impasse.
Day-to-day spending, adjusted for inflation, will jump by 4.1% in the next financial year, with more money for education, healthcare and police, he said.
The full impact of this on the public finances will only become clear once the Office for Budget Responsibility publishes new forecasts when Javid presents a full annual budget before the end of the year.
On Saturday the Financial Times reported Javid wanted to hold this during the week starting Oct. 21, but that this would hinge on parliament having approved a deal to leave the EU. If a no-deal Brexit was probable, the budget would be delayed until after when the impact was clearer.
Tuesday's figures showed that public sector net debt totaled 80.9% of GDP in August, excluding public-sector banks, or 72.7% once the effect of a temporary Bank of England lending scheme was stripped out too.
There was little effect on the total from the statistical changes announced on Tuesday.
Britain's debt-to-GDP ratio was below 40% before the 2008/09 financial crisis."

ROME (Reuters) - Italy will cut its target for economic growth next year to around 0.6%, three sources close to the matter told Reuters on Monday, as the government prepares its 2020 budget to be presented to parliament later this month.
The previous target, issued in April, envisaged growth of 0.8%. Growth this year is now seen at just 0.1%, compared with an April projection of 0.2%.
Under an unchanged policy scenario, gross domestic product next year would be around 0.4%, which will be bolstered slightly by growth enhancing measures in the budget, said two of the sources who asked not to be named.
The new targets, which will form the framework of the budget, must be formally published by Friday.
The budget deficit will be targeted at close to 2.2% of gross domestic product, two of the sources said, though they added that marginal last-minute changes were possible due to ongoing negotiations with the European Commission.
The 2.2% target penciled in is more likely to be reduced than raised, they said.
This year's deficit is currently officially targeted at 2.04%, but the sources said it would come in somewhat lower.
Brussels' main request is that the so-called ""structural"" deficit, stripped of the effects of the business cycle and one-off items, should not increase next year, one of the source said.
The Treasury declined to comment."

The preliminary IHS Markit services purchasing managers' index for employment fell to 49.1 in September, the lowest since December 2009, from 50.4 the prior month, according to data released Monday. Readings below 50 indicate contraction. The overall services PMI rose by less than estimated to 50.9 from 50.7, while a similar gauge for manufacturing advanced to a five-month high of 51, exceeding analyst projections.
The figures suggest U.S. job gains will slow further, after the four-month average of hiring at companies fell to the lowest since 2012. Federal Reserve policy makers last week cut interest rates for the second time in two months as officials seek to protect the record-long expansion from global weakness and the trade war.
“Firms have become more risk averse and increasingly eager to cut costs,” IHS Markit chief business economist Chris Williamson said in a statement. “At current levels, the survey employment index is indicative of nonfarm payroll growth falling below 100,000.”
The U.S. gauges followed similar indexes from Europe showing manufacturing shrank in the euro area for an eighth month -- largely due to German weakness -- while services growth slowed. In addition, a factory PMI for Australia slid into contraction.

LONDON (Reuters) - British households are more worried about their financial prospects now than at any time since 2013, partly because of concerns about the economic and political outlook as the country prepares to leave the European Union, a monthly survey showed on Monday.
The IHS Markit Household Finance Index sank to a four-month low of 43.1 in September from August's 43.6, as households' relatively upbeat assessments of their current situation was undermined by darker future prospects.
Willingness to make major purchases such as cars or holiday bookings was the lowest since December 2013, and the assessment of their financial situation in 12 months was the most negative since November 2013.
""Political and economic uncertainty had caused nervousness surrounding job security,"" IHS Markit economist Joe Hayes said.
Prime Minister Boris Johnson is determined to take Britain out of the European Union by Oct. 31, without a transition agreement if necessary, despite opposition from parliament.
Although unemployment is low and wage growth is at an 11-year high, Britain's economy shrank in the last quarter and subsequent business surveys have been weak, as companies blame the United States-China trade conflict and no-deal Brexit risks.
""(The) latest data suggest that the robust performance of the UK labor market may not be sufficient to dispel the pessimistic financial outlook, which could ultimately see weaker consumption trends at a time where the economy hinges on domestic resilience,"" Hayes said.
Britain's Thomas Cook (L:TCG), the world's oldest travel company, collapsed on Monday after struggling to pitch itself to a new generation of tourists.
Despite their gloomier mood, households' expectations of Bank of England policy were little changed. Some 23% think the BoE will cut interest rates from the current 0.75% during the next 12 months, unchanged from August. Almost 60% think it will increase rates, up from 58%.

Unlike their counterparts in the United States and euro zone, Britain's central bankers say they still intend to gradually raise rates if the government concludes a Brexit deal and the economy picks up.

Germany’s economy is suffering its worst downturn in almost seven years as a manufacturing slump deepens, raising pressure on the government to add fiscal stimulus.
Factory activity is shrinking at the fastest pace in a decade and growth in services is softening, according to a monthly report by IHS Markit. There were also further signs that the labor market is taking a hit. That could have an adverse impact on demand and set off a negative spiral for Europe’s biggest economy.
Adding to the gloom, the nation’s VDMA engineering industry group said Monday there’s no turnaround in sight. It predicts production will drop 2% in 2020 after a similar decline this year.
The confluence of trade tensions, challenges for the auto industry and looming Brexit are threatening to push Germany into recession after the economy shrank in the second quarter. According to Markit, the economy may struggle to record any expansion at all for the rest of the year.
In a sign that the export-driven industrial slump is spreading into the rest of the economy, Markit said jobs growth is stalling after almost six years of uninterrupted growth.
The latest reports also showed weakness in France. For the euro area as a whole, manufacturing activity shrank for an eighth month -- largely due to German weakness -- while services growth slowed.
The slump in Germany’s economy has prompted louder calls for the government to provide fiscal support. While the European Central Bank earlier this month rolled out a new stimulus package for the euro zone, Germany has so far been reluctant to step up.
Chancellor Angela Merkel promised to stick to a policy of zero deficit spending on Friday, even as her administration announced a 54 billion-euro ($60 billion) package designed to help put its climate targets back on track.
“The manufacturing numbers are simply awful,” Markit economist Phil Smith said of Germany. “All the uncertainty around trade wars, the outlook for the car industry and Brexit are paralyzing order books, with September seeing the worst performance from the sector since the depths of the financial crisis in 2009.”

Consumer prices excluding fresh food rose 0.5% in August from a year earlier, matching economists’ median estimate, according to the internal affairs ministry. A drop in energy prices was the biggest factor in the slowdown.
Key Insights
Japan’s key inflation gauge hasn’t risen above 1% in years and is expected to remain subdued in the coming months as education costs weigh on prices.Governor Haruhiko Kuroda Thursday ordered a review to see if developments overseas have the potential to kill off momentum in Japanese prices toward the BOJ’s 2% target. Compared with a month ago, Kuroda said he’s now “more inclined” to go ahead with easing.Energy prices, which have been contributing less to price gains since October last year, fell overall for the first time since January 2017.Stripping out the effects of a drop in energy costs, August’s inflation data may leave room for the BOJ to argue that prices are actually moving in the right direction. Consumer prices excluding both fresh food and energy rose 0.6% pace in August, exceeding economists’ forecasts for a 0.5% gain and above last year’s average pace of 0.4%.“The BOJ will probably want to say price momentum is still upward,” said Hiroshi Miyazaki, a senior economist at Mitsubishi UFJ  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) in Tokyo. “But they’ve already been pushed into a corner by price and economic data and will have to think about additional easing.”A 2 percentage point sales tax hike that comes into effect next month presents another risk the BOJ will have to manage. The last increase to the tax in 2014 triggered a contraction of more than 7% the following quarter. Consumer spending has been supporting economic growth during an export slump this year.What Bloomberg’s Economists Say
“Any pickup toward the 2% target is going to take a long time. We think the Bank of Japan will need to prepare for a longer-term effort to stoke consumer prices with a more flexible operational approach to its stimulus.”

The short-term corporate debt, which companies use to finance inventories and payrolls, fell by $18.5 billion to $1.092 trillion in the week ended Sept. 18, its steepest one-week drop since the May 1 week.
Adjusted for seasonal factors, total commercial paper dropped $22.2 billion to $1.094 trillion, the biggest decline since the week of Feb. 6, according to the CP figures from the New York Fed.
At the start of the week, interest rates in the $2.2 trillion repurchase agreement, or repo, market, which banks and Wall Street dealers rely on for daily cash to fund loans and trades, were surging.
Overnight repo rates eventually peaked at 10% on Tuesday, about four times more than the Federal Reserve's target range on short-term rates.
Analysts have blamed quarterly corporate tax payments and settlement on $78 billion in coupon-bearing Treasury securities on Monday for a severe drop in cash for wholesale lending.
As repo rates rocketed higher to levels not seen during the global credit crisis in 2008, so did CP rates.
For example, one-day CP rates for AA-rated nonfinancial companies averaged 4.26% on Tuesday, up from 2.32% on Monday. They fell to 2.31% on Wednesday, N.Y. Fed data showed.
Repo, CP and other money market rates began retreating as the U.S. central bank began pumping billions in temporary cash into the financial system.
Since Tuesday, it has injected over $200 billion via overnight repo operations."

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The number of Americans filing applications for unemployment benefits increased less than expected last week, pointing to strong labor market conditions that should continue to support an economy growing at a moderate pace.
The steady economic growth pace was also underscored by other data on Thursday showing home resales rising in August to a 17-month high. While factory activity in the mid-Atlantic region slowed in September, orders remained solid, leading manufacturers in the region to increase employment and boost hours for workers.
The reports suggested that housing and manufacturing, the two weak spots in the economy, were stabilizing. The Federal Reserve cut interest rates by another 25 basis points on Wednesday, citing risks to the longest economic expansion in history from a year-long U.S.-China trade war and slowing economic growth overseas.
Fed Chair Jerome Powell said he expected the economy, now in its 11th year of expansion, to continue to ""expand at a moderate rate,"" but noted trade tensions were ""weighing on U.S. investment and exports."" 
The U.S. central bank cut rates in July for the first time since 2008. The Fed offered mixed signals on further monetary policy easing. Data, including retail sales, so far in the third quarter suggest the economy is growing close to the April-June quarter's 2.0% annualized rate. 
Financial markets have been flagging a recession. The Atlanta Fed is estimating gross domestic product rising at a 1.9% pace this quarter. 
""Fed officials are done cutting interest rates for the rest of this year and one of the reasons for this is that the economic data continue to surprise us on the upside,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG in New York.
Initial claims for state unemployment benefits rose 2,000 to a seasonally adjusted 208,000 for the week ended Sept. 14, the government said. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast claims increasing to 213,000 in the latest week. 
Layoffs remain low despite the trade tensions, which have weighed on business investment and manufacturing. But there are concerns that slowing job growth could take some shine off robust consumer spending, which is largely driving the economy.
Last week's claims data covered the survey period for the nonfarm payrolls component of September's employment report. Claims were little changed between the August and September survey periods suggesting a steady pace of job growth this month.
The economy created 130,000 jobs in August. Economists say it is unclear whether the loss of momentum in hiring is due to ebbing demand for labor or a shortage of qualified workers. 
Job gains have averaged 158,000 per month this year, still above the roughly 100,000 per month needed to keep up with growth in the working age population and sustain a healthy pace of consumer spending. 
""If there was a problem in the labor market it would be visible in initial claims and they are not raising any red flags,"" said Ryan Sweet, a senior economist at Moody's Analytics in West Chester, Pennsylvania. ""Though business confidence has dropped noticeably this year, it hasn't led businesses to lay off workers yet."" 
The dollar fell against a basket of currencies, while prices for U.S. Treasuries rose. Stocks on Wall Street were trading higher, with Microsoft's planned share buy-back helping to push the benchmark S&P 500 within striking distance of its record high.
SOLID HOME SALES
In a second report on Thursday, the National Association of Realtors said existing home sales increased 1.3% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.49 million units last month. 
That was the second straight monthly gain in sales and confounded economists expectations for a 0.4% drop to 5.37 million units.
The increase in home resales, which make up about 90 percent of U.S. home sales, came on the heels of data on Wednesday showing housing starts and building permits surged to a more than 12-year high in August. The housing market, which hit a soft patch last year, is being lifted by lower mortgage rates.
But the sector is not yet out of the woods as builders continue to grapple with land and labor shortages, which have constrained their ability to construct more of the sought-after lower-priced homes.
""It appears that the housing market is gaining some momentum as autumn approaches,"" said Matthew Speakman, an economist at online real estate database company Zillow. ""Even stronger sales volumes may be around the corner given that mortgage rates plummeted in August.""
In a third report, the Philadelphia Fed said its business conditions index fell to a reading of 12.0 in September from 16.8 in August. The survey's measure of new orders dipped to 24.8 this month from 25.8. 
Its measure of factory employment in the region that covers eastern Pennsylvania, southern New Jersey and Delaware jumped to a reading of 15.8 in September from 3.6 in the prior month. A gauge of the factory workweek increased to a reading of 13.0 from 6.8 in August.
Manufacturing, which makes up about 11% of the economy, has shouldered the brunt of the U.S.-China trade war. A measure of national manufacturing activity contracted in August for the first time in three years. 
While factory surveys have remained weak, so-called hard data have suggested the manufacturing downturn could soon run its course. Manufacturing production rebounded 0.5% in August after falling 0.4% in July, the Fed reported on Tuesday.

""It is hard to explain the month-to-month changes in the different business surveys and the differences across the various measures, but with manufacturing output rising in recent months, some of the other surveys that have been weak may start to firm up and look more like the Philadelphia Fed survey,"" said Daniel Silver, an economist at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) in New York.

508,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 19, 2019 12:10PM ET</span>",'Show me the money'; dollar-hungry businesses squeezed in Lebanon,"By Lisa Barrington and Ellen Francis
BEIRUT (Reuters) - Cars line up to fill their tanks but the worker at the gas station in Lebanon's capital city waves them off, standing by the 'Strike!' signs. ""No fuel today,"" he shouts.
The day of industrial action, replicated at petrol pumps across the country, was not really about fuel, it was about the dollars needed to pay for it, or rather the lack of them.
""We don't want a crisis ... the sector is bleeding,"" said Fadi Abu Chakra, a spokesman for fuel distributors who led the strike this week. ""We (get paid) in Lebanese pounds, and we need dollars to pay importers. Where are we supposed to get dollars if the banks are not giving them?"" 
A stagnant local economy and a slowdown in cash injections from Lebanese abroad have reduced the central bank's foreign currency reserves, making it difficult for businesses to buy the dollars they need from banks. 
Some say they are being forced to go to money exchange houses which charge rates above the official peg of 1,507.5 pounds to the dollar.
Lebanon has not seen such financial strains since its 1975-1990 civil war. The steady pressure has raised concerns for the stability of a country where political tensions - local and regional - are never far from the surface, and which hosts around a million Syrian refugees. 
Banks in the Middle Eastern state still sell dollars at the official exchange rate but some business owners say they are not able to get the quantities they need from them.
Saddled with one of the world's heaviest public debt burdens at 150% of annual gross domestic product, Lebanon's government has declared an economic emergency to try and get its finances under control.
""The economic situation is tough but we are not a collapsing country at the financial level,"" Finance Minister Ali Hassan Khalil told a news conference this week.
""Yes, there is not much liquidity in foreign currencies in people's hands in the market, but the dollar exchange rate is still maintained in the banks.""
Lebanon's banking association said banks were satisfying demand for foreign currency and dollars were available. The central bank said lenders were able to tap its supply of U.S. dollars to meet customer requests.
""When they are in shortage they buy (dollars) from the central bank,"" Governor Riad Salameh told Reuters.
However, three bankers contacted by Reuters said they were rationing the amount of dollars they could sell for Lebanese pounds. 
""The central bank gives a daily quota of dollars for each bank, but people are asking the banks for more dollars than the quota,"" said one senior banker, who asked to remain anonymous to speak freely. 
The central bank did not respond to a request for comment.
""It's the first time in the history of the Lebanese banking sector that the demand in the dollar market is not being met in this way,"" the banker said. 
The banking sources said there was no problem withdrawing from dollar or Lebanese pound deposit accounts.
""It's not an issue of dollar shortage but rather higher demand,"" said another banker, declining to be named because she was not authorized to discuss the matter publicly.
Seven importing companies contacted by Reuters said they were finding it harder or more expensive to obtain dollars. They asked to remain anonymous out of concern that speaking publicly would damage their businesses.
A leather importer said banks were taking a few days longer to turn pound cheques into dollars, ""and sometimes they tell us sorry, we can't exchange them.""
FINANCIAL STRAINS
The Lebanese pound has been pegged at its current level against the U.S. dollar for more than two decades and the government has pledged to keep it there. It wants to avoid a devaluation that could hurt people's savings and spending power.
Salameh, who has run the central bank for a quarter of a century, has since 2016 boosted reserves through a series of measures, including attracting inflows with high interest rates on long-term, high-value deposits. But this has absorbed liquidity from banks.
And amid anaemic economic growth and political instability, traditional sources of foreign exchange including tourism, real estate and money sent home by citizens abroad have slowed.
The central bank's foreign assets, excluding gold, fell around 15% from an all-time high in May last year to $38.7 billion in mid-September. The central bank said it had received a $1.4 billion dollar boost in late August from private depositors.
Reflecting the increased pressure on Lebanon's finances, Fitch ratings agency recently downgraded it deep into junk territory. Rival ratings agency S&P Global (NYSE:SPGI) kept Lebanon's credit rating at B-/B but warned that it could be lowered, saying it considered its foreign exchange reserves sufficient to service government debt in the ""near term"".
On Wednesday, Finance Minister Ali Hassan Khalil said Lebanon was committed to repaying its debts in all currencies.
""We have never been late to fulfil our commitments, not even for an hour,"" he said. 
Last year, foreign states and donors pledged $11 billion for Lebanon for a 12-year infrastructure investment program so long as the government enacts reforms.
""The currency peg risks being tested unless we see significant political commitment and implementation of announced reforms, which could be supported by the disbursement of some donor funds,"" said S&P's Lebanon analyst, Zahabia Gupta.
Both dollars and pounds are legal tender in Lebanon, which is a net importer of goods with a persistent need for dollars to fund trade and government deficits.
Amid the demand for dollars, some money exchange houses have raised the amount of Lebanese pounds required to buy dollars beyond the margins set by the central bank.
A Lebanese clothing company owner said it stopped importing material this summer and now sources locally, blaming sluggish demand and bank dollar conversions too small for currency needs.
""Getting dollars at the moment is difficult,"" said an importer of alcoholic drinks. ""The bank is adamant it will not exchange to dollars. You have to go to a (money) exchanger.""

His company, which imports around $10 million of goods annually, has not cut imports yet, he said.

Initial claims for state unemployment benefits rose 2,000 to a seasonally adjusted 208,000 for the week ended Sept. 14, the Labor Department said on Thursday. Data for the prior week was revised to show 2,000 more applications received than previously reported. 
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast claims increasing to 213,00 in the latest week. The Labor Department said no states were estimated last week. 
The Federal Reserve on Wednesday cut interest rates by another 25 basis points, citing risks to the longest economic expansion in history from a year-long trade war between the United States and China as well as slowing economic growth overseas.
Fed Chair Jerome Powell said he expected the economy, now in its 11th year of expansion, to continue to ""expand at a moderate rate."" Powell said ""the job market remains strong.""
The four-week moving average of initial claims, considered a better measure of labor market trends as it irons out week-to-week volatility, dipped 750 to 212,250 last week. 
Despite trade tensions, which have weighed on business investment and manufacturing, layoffs remain low. But there are concerns that slowing job growth could take some shine off robust consumer spending, which is largely driving the economy.
Last week's claims data covered the survey period for the nonfarm payrolls component of September's employment report. The four-week moving average of claims fell 2,750 between the August and September survey periods suggesting a steady pace of job growth this month.

Thursday's claims report also showed the number of people receiving benefits after an initial week of aid decreased 13,000 to 1.66 million for the week ended Sept. 7. The four-week moving average of the so-called continuing claims fell 3,750 to 1.68 million.

511,By Bloomberg,"<span>Sep 19, 2019 05:43AM ET</span>",Norway Delivers Rate Hike Most Economists Weren't Expecting,"(Bloomberg) -- Norway’s central bank broke further away from the pack, delivering its fourth interest-rate increase in a year in an effort to cool an economy stoked by oil investments.
Norges Bank raised its benchmark rate by a quarter of a percentage point to 1.50% on Thursday, the highest level in almost five years. Four of the six biggest Nordic banks had expected the move, but most other forecasters didn’t.
The krone rose as much as 0.5% against the euro but pared most of those gains as Norges Bank signaled it was unlikely to deliver more tightening for now.
“The executive board’s current assessment of the outlook and balance of risks suggests that the policy rate will most likely remain at this level in the coming period,” Governor Oystein Olsen said in a statement.
Dubbed by local economists as one of the “last hawks,” Norges Bank has stood out for its commitment to tightening as both the European Central Bank and the Federal Reserve deliver more stimulus. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell on Wednesday pointed to the fallout of a global trade war as something that should give monetary policy makers pause.
Olsen presented Norway’s rate decision on a day full of central bank announcements. Moments earlier, the Swiss National Bank had kept its main rate at a record low of minus 0.75%, following a cut by the Fed late on Wednesday.
Norway’s decision shows that “the rate path is marginally lower from June and signals that Norges Bank is basically done hiking rates,” said Joachim Bernhardsen, an analyst at Nordea in Oslo, said in a note to clients. “However, they maintain a small hiking bias indicating that a hike is more likely than a cut next year.”
The Norwegian economy has so far proved resilient. That’s allowed the government, which is backed by the world’s largest sovereign-wealth fund, to provide the kind of stimulus that most other European nations can only dream of. Norway will spend the equivalent of almost 8% of GDP this year to plug a budget shortfall. Against that backdrop, unemployment has stayed below 4% and inflation is above target.
Olsen has avoided unconventional policies, such as negative rates and asset purchases, and instead opted for a strategy he calls “leaning against the wind” to fight financial imbalances. Recent gains in the price of oil and a persistently weak Norwegian krone underpin the central bank’s commitment to tightening.

LONDON (Reuters) - British retail sales unexpectedly fell in August after shoppers bought less online than the month before, when an annual promotion by Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) appeared to have encouraged them to splash out, official figures showed on Thursday.
The figures gave little obvious sign that either the possibility of a no-deal Brexit on Oct. 31 or a fall in sterling over the summer had dealt a visible blow to consumer spending, which has solidly supported British growth in recent years.
Monthly retail sales volumes dipped by 0.2%, the Office for National Statistics said, compared with an average forecast for a flat reading in a Reuters poll of economists and the first fall in three months.
""No cause for alarm,"" economist Samuel Tombs of Pantheon Macroeconomics said in a note to clients. ""The modest fall in retail sales volumes does not change the overall picture of solid momentum in household spending.""
British consumers appear to have largely taken the prospect of leaving the European Union in their stride, helped by weaker inflation and stronger growth in wages that are now rising at their fastest rate in more than a decade.
On Thursday the boss of  Next  (L:NXT), one of Britain's biggest clothing retailers, reported a rise in profits and told Reuters that disappointing sales in recent weeks appeared to reflect unusually warm weather, rather than Brexit jitters.
The category of 'non-store retailing' - predominantly online shopping - dropped by 3.2%, the biggest decline since August 2015, and came a month after Amazon held its annual 'Prime Day' promotion which helped boost sales by 7.6% the previous month.
Compared with August 2018, sales were up by 2.7%, slowing from growth of 3.4% in July and again the weakest since May. The Reuters poll had pointed to annual sales growth of 2.9%.
Looking at the three months to August as a whole, sales rose 3.3% on an annual basis, broadly in line with their average over the past year, and there was no market reaction to the data.
The figures broadly chimed with a British Retail Consortium survey that showed spending in August was flat on a year earlier, as shoppers cut non-essential spending.
But the picture is less bleak than that presented by the Confederation of British Industry, which said its members reported the biggest fall since 2008 in its gauge of retail sales in August, as sentiment crumbled in the sector.
Many businesses are more cautious than consumers as Britain's political crisis drags on, and fear that a no-deal Brexit could lead to significant disruption to imports of fresh food and other goods.
Department store and supermarket operator John Lewis said last week a possible no-deal Brexit could worsen already difficult trading conditions after first-half operating losses at the group's department stores widened and that the impact could be ""significant"".
Separately on Thursday the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development said that if Britain leaves the EU without a deal, its economy was likely to be 2% smaller than otherwise in 2020-2021, pointing towards a recession, even if its exit is relatively well managed."
513,By Bloomberg,"<span>Sep 18, 2019 11:40PM ET</span>",Australian Unemployment Rises as Workforce Swells to New Record,"(Bloomberg) -- Australia’s jobless rate unexpectedly climbed in August as the labor force swelled to a fresh record, signaling additional labor-market slack that sets the scene for further easing by the central bank.
Unemployment climbed to 5.3%, the highest level in a year, and above the 5.2% forecast by economists, data from the statistics bureau showed in Sydney Thursday. The 34,700 increase in jobs for the month was swamped by the seemingly inexorable rise in the participation rate to 66.2%.
The result is the wrong direction for a Reserve Bank trying to push down unemployment and revive inflation that’s lain dormant for almost half a decade. Governor Philip Lowe has lowered the cash rate to 1% to support economic growth and is urging the government to add stimulus, an effort frustrated by a focus on returning the books to the black.
Just an hour prior to the release, Treasurer Josh Frydenberg announced an improved budget deficit of just A$690 million ($468 million) in the fiscal year that ended June 30. That dashed expectations of a surplus which may have allowed him to say the government had met its election promise and was now prepared to boost spending to support growth.
Thursday’s jobs report showed two key indicators of slack in the labor market worsening. The underemployment rate climbed 0.1 percentage point to 8.6% and underutilization -- the sum of the unemployment and underemployment rates -- advanced by the same amount to 13.8%.
“Stronger wage growth is unlikely for the foreseeable future,” said Callam Pickering, an economist at global jobs website Indeed, who previously worked at the central bank. “Rising unemployment is a negative for wages and inflation and justifies the Reserve Bank’s stance on rates. A rate cut at either their October or November meetings seems all but certain.”
The Aussie dollar fell after the report, buying 67.85 U.S. cents at 12:48 p.m. in Sydney from 68.13 before the data.
New Normal
Lowe earlier this year reduced the estimated level of full employment in the economy to 4.5% from around 5%, and cited the lower figure as justification for rate cuts in June and July. Money markets and economists expect him to ease twice more to 0.5%, a level that would be close to the lower bound of policy and open the door to unorthodox measures.
Two of the nation’s most-watched economists, Westpac Banking Corp.’s Bill Evans and JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) & Co.’s Sally Auld, think Lowe will move next month and again in February. The governor is due to speak Tuesday in an address titled “An Economic Update” and speculation is mounting that he could signal an imminent rate move then.
Meantime, Commonwealth Bank of Australia, the nation’s largest lender, said the government’s improved budget position provides scope for Frydenberg to help the central bank. With a potentially larger surplus also set for 2019-20, there were several policy measures that could compliment easier monetary policy, said Belinda Allen, a senior economist at Commonwealth.
“The first would be to bring forward shovel-ready infrastructure projects. RBA Governor Lowe has made this point repeatedly,” she said. “The second policy option would be to bring forward the tax cuts scheduled for 1 July 2022.”"

BRASILIA (Reuters) - Brazil's central bank cut its benchmark interest rate to a new record low of 5.50% on Wednesday as expected and suggested more rate cuts are in the pipeline, highlighting an increasingly uncertain global outlook and tame domestic inflation.
The decision by the bank's nine-person rate-setting committee known as Copom was unanimous, and the cut was the second half-percentage-point reduction under the presidency of former trader Roberto Campos Neto following a first move in July.
In their accompanying statement, policymakers maintained the language they have used in recent months to signal an additional rate cut, specifically that the ""benign"" outlook for inflation should permit ""additional adjustment of the degree of stimulus.""
Carlos Kawall, chief economist at Banco Safra in Sao Paulo, said he was lowering his Selic forecast to 4.50% next year from 5.00% on the back of what he said was a more dovish statement than in July.
""There is a bias to more easing, and the likelihood of another 50 basis points at the October meeting has increased,"" Kawall said. ""The possibility of going below 5.00% is now the more likely scenario.""
Copom outlined a ""hybrid"" outlook for 2020 inflation using the current exchange rate around 4.05 reais per dollar and the market consensus forecast for the Selic rate next year of 5.00%.
Even modeling with a weak currency and lower interest rate, Copom still estimated that inflation next year will be only 3.80%, below the central bank's official target of 4.00%.
Annual consumer price inflation is currently running at 3.43%, well below the central bank's official year-end target of 4.25%. Weak economic growth, high unemployment and substantial slack in the economy suggest inflation will remain below target this year and next, analysts say, requiring more easing.
Copom reiterated that the government must press on with economic reforms to help keep inflation expectations anchored. But it removed a reference in recent statements that the upside threat to inflation if these reforms stalled was the ""dominant"" risk.
The central banks of almost every major developed and emerging market economy, from the Federal Reserve and European Central Bank to Brazil's Copom and the South African Reserve Bank, are easing policy to boost flagging growth."

The jump in homebuilding activity last month added to strong retail sales data in suggesting the economy continues to grow moderately and is probably not flirting with a recession as has been flagged by financial markets. A year-long trade war between the United States and China has dimmed the economic outlook. 
The Federal Reserve cut interest rates by another 25 basis points on Wednesday to blunt the hit on the economy from the trade tensions, but offered mixed signals on the next move. The U.S. central bank said ""economic activity has been rising at a moderate rate."" The Fed lowered borrowing costs in July for the first time since 2008.
""A prolonged period of lower mortgage rates has perhaps finally encouraged prospective homebuyers to get off the sidelines,"" said John Pataky, executive vice president at TIAA Bank in Jacksonville, Florida. ""I'd like to see a couple more months of data like this before I'm convinced the market's fortunes have really changed.""
Housing starts jumped 12.3% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.364 million units last month, the highest level since June 2007, the government said. Data for July was revised up to show homebuilding falling to a pace of 1.215 million units, instead of decreasing at a rate of 1.191 million units as previously reported.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast housing starts would advance to a pace of 1.250 million units in August. Building permits increased 7.7% to a rate of 1.419 million units in August, the highest level since May 2007. Housing starts rose 6.6% on a year-on-year basis in August. 
The housing market, the most sensitive sector to interest rates, had until now shown few signs of benefiting from the Fed's monetary policy easing, which has pushed down mortgage rates from last year's multi-year highs. Builders had blamed the lackluster performance on land and labor shortages. 
A survey on Tuesday showed confidence among homebuilders rose in September, with builders reporting solid demand for homes. But builders said scarce building lots and labor remained a challenge and also noted that trade tensions, which have undercut manufacturing, were ""holding back home construction in some parts of the nation.""
The 30-year fixed mortgage rate has dropped more than 130 basis points to an average of 3.56%, according to data from mortgage finance agency Freddie Mac.
Firmer demand for housing was underscored by a separate report on Wednesday from the Mortgage Bankers Association showing applications for loans to purchase a home increased for a third straight week last week.
The dollar (DXY) dollar rose marginally against a basket of currencies as investors focused on the Fed's mixed signals on the future course of monetary policy. U.S. Treasury prices trimmed gains and stocks on Wall Street extended losses. 
Stock market sentiment was also hurt by package delivery company FedEx's (N:FDX) warning that full-year earnings would miss analysts' estimates because of the U.S.-China trade war and the fallout from its split with customer-turned-competitor Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN).
BROAD GAINS
August's robust homebuilding performance raised hopes that residential investment would rebound in the third quarter after contracting for six straight quarters, the longest such stretch since the 2007-2009 recession. 
The Atlanta Fed lifted its third-quarter gross domestic product estimate by one-tenth of a percentage point to a 1.9% annualized rate. The economy grew at a 2.0% rate in the April-June quarter, decelerating from the first quarter's 3.1% pace.
Single-family homebuilding, which accounts for the largest share of the housing market, increased 4.4% to a rate of 919,000 units in August, the highest level since January. Single-family housing starts increased in the West, Midwest and the populous South, but fell in the Northeast.
Permits to build single-family homes vaulted 4.5% to a rate of 866,000 units last month, the highest since July 2018. Permits, however, continued to lag housing starts, suggesting limited scope for a strong rise in single-family homebuilding in the coming months.
Starts for the volatile multi-family housing segment soared 32.8% to a rate of 445,000 units in August, reversing the prior two months' declines. Though rental inflation has slowed in recent months, economists do not expect the trend to continue as rental vacancy rates remain low.
Permits for the construction of multi-family homes increased 13.3% to a rate of 553,000 units last month.
Despite the surge in both starts and permits in August, housing shortages will likely persist and keep prices elevated.
Housing completions rose 2.4% to 1.294 million units last month. Realtors estimate that housing starts and completion rates need to be in a range of 1.5 million to 1.6 million units per month to close the inventory gap. The stock of housing under construction climbed 0.3% to 1.144 million units in August.

""The stock of new homes priced under $300,000, which is what half of new homebuyers need before they can afford a purchase, continues to be low,"" said Robert Frick, corporate economist at Navy Federal Credit Union in Vienna, Virginia. ""And the pace of home building remains significantly below historical averages.""

516,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 18, 2019 10:03AM ET</span>",Canadian inflation falls to 1.9% in August on lower gas prices,"By Kelsey Johnson
OTTAWA (Reuters) - Canada's annual inflation rate fell slightly to 1.9% in August on lower gasoline prices, Statistics Canada said on Wednesday in its first major data release since Canadian politicians formally hit the campaign trail.
Analysts in a Reuters poll had forecast an inflation rate of 2.0%. Canada's annual inflation rate in July was 2.0%. After the data release, the Canadian dollar held steady near C$1.3250, or 75.47 U.S. cents.
Canada is in the midst of a national election with polls showing the governing Liberals are in a tight bid for reelection against the opposition Conservatives, who have focused their campaign on issues related to the cost of living and affordability. Canadians vote on Oct. 21.
Consumer prices for gasoline, Statistics Canada said, fell 10.2% in the 12 months to August following a 6.9% decline in July. Global oil prices also declined slightly in August, due to higher production and softer international demand.
Meanwhile, the price of fresh vegetables dropped 6.5% in August from July - the largest month-over-month decline seen in five years - as temporary pressures because of inclement weather in agricultural regions eased. 
Fresh and frozen pork were also cheaper, dropping 2.7% from July due to trade restrictions on Canadian pork exports. Despite the weaker pork prices, Statscan said the overall year-over-year cost for meat rose 4.8% in August.
Earlier this month, the Bank of Canada held interest rates steady and made no mention of future cuts. The central bank, which has sat on the sidelines since last October, has said Canada's economy is showing a ""welcome degree of resilience"" to negative shocks.
""For the Bank of Canada, it means that unless the economy faces a significant shock, there's probably no imminent need to cut interest rates,"" said Sal Guatieri, a senior economist for BMO Capital Markets.
Canadian airfare soared 10.3% year-over-year in August after a 4.6% jump in July, because of the grounding of the Boeing (NYSE:BA) 737 Max aircraft, Statscan said. 
That sustained increase surprised TD Securities' Robert Both. ""We think when those (groundings) come off over the next couple of months that should take a little heat out of things,"" he said.
CPI common, which the central bank says is the best gauge of the economy's underperformance, fell to 1.8% from 1.9% in July. 

CPI median, which shows the median inflation rate across CPI components, and CPI trim, which excludes upside and downside outliers, were both at 2.1%.

The Washington-based group's seasonally adjusted measure on mortgage activity dipped 0.1% to 569.5 in the week ended Sept. 13, with loan requests for home purchases rising for a third straight week.
The average interest rate for 30-year fixed-rate mortgages, with conforming loan balances of $484,350 or less, increased to 4.01%, a seven-week high. In the prior week, it stood at 3.82%, which was the lowest since November 2016."
518,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 18, 2019 05:59AM ET</span>",UK inflation falls to lowest since 2016 in pre-Brexit boost to consumers,"By Andy Bruce and William Schomberg
LONDON (Reuters) - Consumer prices in Britain rose last month at the slowest rate since December 2016, a pre-Brexit boost to the spending power of households who are also seeing the fastest wage growth in 11 years.
Prices of goods and services paid by consumers rose at an annual rate of 1.7% in August after a 2.1% increase in July, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said on Wednesday. A Reuters poll of economists had pointed to a rate of 1.9%.
Separate ONS figures showed British house prices rose in July by just 0.7% in annual terms, the smallest rise since 2012, as weakness in the London market spread to other parts of England.
Overall, the fall in inflation should boost households whose spending has fueled the economy while businesses cut investment ahead of the Oct. 31 deadline for leaving the European Union.
The drop came despite a sharp fall in the value of sterling in August as the Brexit crisis escalated, although it took more than a year for inflation to peak after the pound's post-referendum depreciation of 2016. Sterling has rebounded this month.
""Improved consumer purchasing power is particularly welcome news for an economy currently struggling markedly amid major Brexit, domestic political and global economic uncertainties,"" said economist Howard Archer from the EY ITEM Club consultancy.
Sterling extended losses after the data and was last down 0.3% at $1.2454 . British government yields also fell.
The ONS said the fall in inflation was driven mainly by a decrease in computer game prices, as well as clothing prices falling by less than last year. 
It was the biggest drop in the annual rate of inflation from one month to another since late 2014.
Last month the Bank of England forecast that inflation would fall to a three-year low below 1.6% in the final quarter of this year, reflecting lower oil prices and government caps on household energy bills.
The BoE says underlying inflation pressures mean it is still likely to need to raise interest rates over the medium term, assuming Britain avoids major Brexit disruption and the global economy recovers from its slowdown.
Official data last week showed wage growth hit an 11-year high of 4.0% in the three months to July, a pace which would normally prompt the BoE to tighten rates.
But underlying inflation pressures are modest for now.
An ONS measure of core inflation, which excludes energy, fuel, alcohol and tobacco, dropped to 1.5% versus forecasts for it to fall to 1.8%. 
The ONS figures also suggested little short-term pressure in the pipeline for consumer prices.
Among manufacturers, the cost of raw materials - many of them imported - was 0.8% lower than in August 2018, compared with a 0.9% increase in July, pushed down by lower oil prices. This was the biggest drop since May 2016. Economists polled by Reuters had expected input prices to fall by 0.5%. 
The ONS said house prices in July rose by an annual 0.7% across the United Kingdom as a whole compared with 0.4% in June, marking the smallest rise since September 2012.

House prices are now falling in annual terms in four out of nine regions in England, the ONS said.

519,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 18, 2019 01:34AM ET</span>",Japan's exports fall for 9th straight month as global demand falters,"By Daniel Leussink
TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's exports slipped for a ninth straight month in August as international trade tensions ramped up risks for the world's third-largest economy, although the decline was slightly smaller than expected.
The negative reading adds some pressure on the Bank of Japan to expand stimulus at its policy meeting on Thursday to prop up business sentiment and manufacturing activity, which have been hit by global economic weakness.
Exports in August slumped 8.2% from a year earlier, Ministry of Finance data showed on Wednesday, dragged down by autos, car parts and semiconductor production equipment.
The fall was smaller than a 10.9% drop expected by economists but marked the longest run of declines in exports since a 14-month stretch from October 2015 to November 2016.
Fears of a global slump have persisted in recent weeks as uncertainty over the direction of U.S. trade policy cloud the outlook for growth in the United States and export-reliant economies such as Germany, Japan and China.
The nine-month slump in Japan's exports follows revised data that showed the economy grew at a slower-than-expected pace in April-June as business spending was downgraded from initial estimates.
The latest data comes a day before BOJ policymakers on Thursday decide whether to expand an already massive stimulus program to shield the economy from a possible downturn and protect its growth drivers.
Increasing signs of slowing global demand have made Japanese central bankers less confident about an early pickup in global growth and more open to debating policy easing.
By region, exports to China, Japan's biggest trading partner, shrank 12.1% year-on-year in August, down for the sixth month and driven by declines in shipments of semiconductor manufacturing equipments and car parts.
Shipments to Asia, which account for more than half of Japan's overall exports, dropped 10.9% in the year to August.
Japan's exports to the United States slipped 4.4% in the year to August, their first fall since September last year and driven by declines in exports of 3000cc cars and car parts.
However, imports from the United States dipped 9.2%, causing Japan's trade surplus with the world's biggest economy to rise 3.8% from a year earlier to 472.0 billion yen, the data showed."

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Foreigners bought U.S. Treasuries in July after selling them for two straight months, according to U.S. Treasury department data released on Tuesday, a precursor to the sector's steep rally in August.
The month of July culminated in the Federal Reserve cutting interest rates on July 31. The following month, trade tensions ramped up between the United States and China as they threatened to impose tariffs on one another, fueling a dramatic surge in U.S. Treasury prices.
Foreign flows into U.S. Treasuries showed an inflow of $10.95 billion in July, from outflows of $7.71 billion and $32.79 billion in June and May. Offshore private investors purchased Treasuries totaling $42.39 billion during the month, offsetting selling of $31.12 billion by foreign official accounts.
""This helps provide a strong backdrop to the August rally in Treasuries,"" said Jon Hill, senior rates strategist at BMO Capital Markets in New York.
""What we saw was that $31 billion outflows from foreign official accounts were overwhelmed by private demand. Some of the private demand going into the Fed cut figured that as the economy goes into the Fed's easing cycle, it might be a good idea to try to position for long duration,"" he added.
U.S. benchmark 10-year yields started July at 2.033% (US10YT=RR), collapsing by more than 50 basis points at the end of the month to 1.506%.
Data also showed that Japan topped China as the largest non-U.S. holder of Treasuries in July for a second straight month after boosting its holdings to a nearly three-year peak.
Japan's holdings of U.S. Treasuries rose to $1.130 trillion in July from $1.122 trillion in June. Its July holdings were the largest since October 2016.
China was the second largest owner of U.S. Treasuries with $1.110 trillion in July, compared with $1.112 trillion the previous month. China's holdings of Treasuries were the smallest since April 2017.
China has been reducing its Treasury securities portfolio for some time, but most analysts see an aggressive reduction of its holdings as a trade weapon, a remote possibility at best. There is no evidence Beijing is seriously looking to flood markets with its U.S. bonds, analysts said.
Data also showed that foreigners bought U.S. stocks for a second straight month in July, amounting to $24.26 billion, from inflows of $26.35 billion. Buying in June and July came after 13 straight months of selling."
521,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 17, 2019 01:10PM ET</span>","U.S. manufacturing production rebounds, outlook remains weak","By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. manufacturing output increased solidly in August, boosted by a surge in the production of machinery and other goods, but the outlook for factories remains weak amid rising headwinds from trade tensions and slowing global economies.
The fairly upbeat report from the Federal Reserve on Tuesday came as officials from the U.S. central bank gathered for a two-day policy meeting. Economists said it was too early to conclude that the trade-driven manufacturing recession was over.
Fears that the drag from the trade war could spill over to the broader economy are expected to compel the Fed to cut interest rates again on Wednesday to keep the longest expansion in history, now in its 11th year, on track. The Fed lowered borrowing costs in July for the first time since 2008. 
""We would want to see another solid gain in September before we would be prepared to say that there are signs that manufacturing is pulling out of its trade-related slump,"" said John Ryding, chief economist at RDQ Economics in New York.
Manufacturing production rose 0.5% last month after an unrevised 0.4% drop in July, the Fed said. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast manufacturing output rising 0.2% in August.
Production at factories fell 0.4% in August on a year-on-year basis. Manufacturing, which accounts for about 11% of the U.S. economy, is being hobbled by the U.S.-China trade dispute.
The year-long trade spat has eroded business confidence, leading to a slump in the sector, which ironically the Trump administration has sought to protect against what it has called unfair foreign competition. Despite last month's rebound in manufacturing output, factory surveys remain downbeat, suggesting the turnaround in production was likely temporary. 
A survey this month showed a measure of national manufacturing activity contracted in August for the first time since August 2016. Another survey from the New York Fed on Monday showed a measure of business activity in New York state slipped in September. 
Manufacturers in New York state were also less upbeat about business conditions over the next six months, with a measure of capital expenditures dropping to a three-year low.
""We expect manufacturing and capex spending to remain under pressure over the next few months as trade uncertainty still swirls, global growth remains meager and the strong dollar creates an added hurdle for U.S. exporters,"" said Sarah House, a senior economist at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) Securities in Charlotte, North Carolina. 
Manufacturing is also weakening as the boost from last year's $1.5 trillion tax package fades. Cuts in the production of Boeing's (N:BA) 737 MAX aircraft, which was grounded indefinitely in March following two deadly crashes, are also adding to manufacturing's malaise. 
Manufacturing and housing are main areas of weakness in the economy, which is being driven by robust consumer spending.
A separate report from the National Association of Homebuilders on Tuesday showed homebuilders' confidence edged up in September. Builders said while lower interest were supporting demand, land and labor shortages remained a constraint. 
The Atlanta Fed is forecasting gross domestic product rising at a 1.8% annualized rate in the third quarter. The economy grew at a 2.0% pace in the April-June quarter, stepping down from the first quarter's 3.1% rate.
The dollar slipped against a basket of currencies ahead of Wednesday's rate decision. U.S. Treasury prices rose, while stocks on Wall Street were little changed.
INVENTORY OVERHANG
Manufacturing has also been hurt by an inventory overhang, mostly in the automotive industry. Motor vehicles and parts production fell 1.0% last month after increasing 0.5% in July. 
A strike by about 48,000 General Motors (N:GM) workers could further dent motor vehicle production, but much would depend on the duration of the work stoppage, which started on Monday.
Excluding motor vehicles and parts, manufacturing output increased 0.6% in August after declining 0.5% in the prior month. Machinery output rebounded 1.6% after dropping 1.7% in July. Primary metals production increased 1.3%. There were also gains in furniture and computer and electronic products output.
The jump in manufacturing output in August, together with a 1.4% rebound in mining, lead to a 0.6% increase in industrial production last month. That was the largest rise in industrial output since August 2018 and followed a 0.1% dip July. Industrial production rose 0.4% on year-on-year basis in August. 
Mining production in July was depressed by Hurricane Barry, which disrupted oil extraction in the Gulf of Mexico.
Oil and gas well drilling fell 2.5% last month, decreasing for a second straight month. Energy firms have been cutting spending on new drilling to focus more on earnings growth instead of increased output. This has contributed to weakness in business investment, which contracted in the second quarter for the first time in three years.
Economists said it was unclear whether an attack on Saudi Arabia's oil facilities, which has boosted oil prices, would have an impact on drilling activity in the United States, adding much would depend on the size and sustainability of the price gains.
Utilities output increased 0.6% last month. 
Capacity utilization for the manufacturing sector, a measure of how fully firms are using their resources, increased to 75.7% in August from 75.4% in July. Overall capacity use for the industrial sector rose to 77.9% from 77.5% in July.

It is 1.9 percentage points below its 1972-2018 average. Officials at the Fed tend to look at capacity use measures for signals of how much ""slack"" remains in the economy — how far growth has room to run before it becomes inflationary.

New-home prices, excluding state-subsidized housing, rose 0.58% last month from July in 70 major cities, National Bureau of Statistics data showed Tuesday. That’s slightly slower than the 0.59% increase a month earlier.Key Insights
A report Monday showed home sales rose the fastest in 13 months, and the combination of robust sales and milder price growth is just what the government is after. Policymakers are trying to juggle the need to take the heat out of the housing market without hobbling a key plank of growth in a slowing economy.The challenge now will be maintaining that balance. Home sales will probably decline in the second half as the diminishing prospect of price growth deters buyers, according to Nomura Holdings Inc. property analyst Leif Chang.The slowdown was more noticeable in mid-size and smaller cities, while growth accelerated in larger cities including Shanghai and Shenzhen. The deepening slowdown is bad news for developers, already facing financing pressures, as they gear up for what is traditionally a strong sales season in September-October. Many have already shrunk their workforces in preparation for tough times ahead.Get More

BEIJING (Reuters) - The slowdown in China's economy deepened in August, with growth in industrial production at its weakest 17-1/2 years amid spreading pain from a trade war with the United States and softening domestic demand.
Retail sales and investment gauges worsened too, data released on Monday showed, reinforcing views that China is likely to cut some key interest rates this week for the first time in over three years to prevent a sharper slump in activity.
Despite a slew of growth-boosting measures since last year, the world's second-largest economy has yet to stabilize, and analysts say Beijing needs to roll out more stimulus to ward off a sharper slowdown.
Industrial output growth unexpectedly weakened to 4.4% in August from the same period a year earlier, the slowest pace since February 2002 and receding from 4.8% in July. Analysts polled by Reuters had forecast a pick-up to 5.2%. 
In particular, the value of delivered industrial exports fell 4.3% on-year, the first monthly decline since at least two years, Reuters records showed, reflecting the toll that the escalating Sino-U.S. trade war is taking on Chinese manufacturers.
The protracted trade war escalated dramatically last month, with President Donald Trump announcing new tariffs on Chinese goods from Sept. 1, and China letting its yuan currency sharply weaken days later.
After Beijing hit back with retaliatory tariffs, Trump said existing levies would also be raised in coming months, in October and December.
While the two sides are set to resume face-to-face negotiations in early October, most analysts do not expect a durable trade deal, or even a significant de-escalation, any time soon.
Premier Li Keqiang said in an interview published ahead of the data on Monday that it was ""very difficult"" for the economy to grow at 6% or more and that it faced ""downward pressure"".
Traders expect a cut in the central bank's medium-term loan facility rate (MLF) as early as Tuesday, which would open the way for a reduction in the new loan prime benchmark rate (LPR) later in the week.
Several analysts said in recent weeks that China's economic growth was already testing the lower end of Beijing's full-year target of around 6-6.5%, which is likely to spur more policy easing. Second-quarter growth cooled to 6.2%, the weakest in nearly 30 years.
""The key downside risk is the authorities not stepping up policy support sufficiently,"" said Louis Kuijs, Head of Asia Economics at Oxford Economics. 
Room for stimulus is believed to be limited by worries about rising debt risks, with policy easing by the People's Bank of China (PBOC) expected to be more restrained than the U.S. Federal Reserve or European Central Bank.
Ting Lu, Chief China Economist at Nomura wrote in a note after the data release that a cut in the MLF rate by around 10 basis points on Tuesday had become more likely.
OTHER DATA ALSO MISSES EXPECTATIONS
Nomura's Lu expected September's industrial output to be further hampered by an anti-pollution campaign ahead of and during a key anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China on Oct. 1. 
The gloomy August activity data added to signs of broad-based economic weakness, following soft trade and credit reports last week. 
Retail sales missed expectations, with growth easing to 7.5%, from 7.6% in July. Analysts had forecast a slight rebound to 7.9%.
Auto sales have slumped all year, prompting the statistics bureau to recently start reporting a new reading on consumption. Stripping out vehicles, retail sales rose 9.3% on-year.
Fixed-asset investment also disappointed. It rose 5.5% for the first eight months of the year from the same period in 2018, down from Jan-July's 5.7%. Analysts had expected 5.6%. 
Industrial investment appeared to be the main drag as investment growth in the mining and the manufacturing sectors eased off in the first eight months. But infrastructure investment - a key driver of growth - picked up to 4.2% in the first eight months this year, from 3.8% in January-July period.
The real estate sector also held up in August to remain one of the few bright spots, with property investment growing at its fastest pace in four months as sales accelerated to the highest in over a year. 
Analysts have been puzzled by slow construction growth earlier in the year, with some citing deteriorating local government finances. China's state planner last month announced it will ease capital requirements for infrastructure projects in the second half this year.
Data out last week showed producer prices falling at their fastest pace in three years.
That followed a factory survey that showed activity shrank for the fourth straight month as the trade war wore on.
Earlier this month, the PBOC cut the amount of cash banks are required to hold in reserve for the seventh time since early last year in order to increase funds available for lending.

""The PBOC's RRR cuts alone are insufficient to secure growth above 6.0% this year,"" said analysts at ANZ. ""In order to guide financing costs lower, the People's Bank of China will need to cut the open market operation (OMO) rate or medium term lending facility (MLF) rate in the fourth quarter, in our view.""

Industrial production rose 4.4% in August from a year earlier, less than the forecasted 5.2% and July’s 4.8%. Official data showed slumps in both manufacturing and mining activities. Manufacturing grew by 4.3% during the month, down from 4.4% in July. Mining output, meanwhile, grew by 3.7% last month, down from 6.6% in July. 
NBS also reported today that retail sales rose 7.5% year-on-year during the month, compared with the expected 7.9%. 
Growth of fixed asset investment, the level of spend on physical assets including real estate and infrastructure, came in at 5.5% in August, which was slightly slower than the 5.6% forecasted by analysts.
The data seemed to have little impact on Chinese stocks today. The Shanghai Composite slipped 0.1% while the Shenzhen Component inched up 0.2% in morning trade. "
531,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 13, 2019 01:05PM ET</span>",Solid U.S. retail sales calm some worries about economy,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. retail sales increased more than expected in August, pointing to solid consumer spending that should continue to support a moderate pace of economic growth.
The report from the Commerce Department on Friday could further allay financial market concerns of a recession, which have been fueled by a year-long trade war between the United States and China as well as slowing global growth.
Still, the Federal Reserve is expected to cut interest rates again next Wednesday to blunt some of the hit from the trade tensions on the longest economic expansion in history.
Fed Chair Jerome Powell said last week he was not forecasting or expecting a recession, but reiterated the U.S. central bank would continue to act ""as appropriate"" to keep the expansion, now in its 11th year, on track. The Fed lowered borrowing costs in July for the first time since 2008.
""The winds of recession aren't coming closer to shore if the consumer continues to buy their hearts out,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG. ""Fed officials are unlikely to cut rates too much deeper as they seek to get out in front of the risks the economy faces acting early instead of being too late.""
Retail sales rose 0.4% last month, lifted by spending on motor vehicles, building materials, healthcare and hobbies. Data for August was revised slightly up to show retail sales increasing 0.8% instead of 0.7% as previously reported.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast retail sales would gain 0.2% in August. Compared to August last year, retail sales advanced 4.1%. Retail sales have increased for six straight months, the longest such stretch since June 2017.
But with the Trump administration this month slapping a 15% tariff on Chinese consumer goods such as televisions, apparel, bed linens, smart watches and footwear, there are concerns retail sales could pull back. Economists and retail groups expect businesses will pass on the duties to consumers, thereby raising prices for the targeted goods.
""It is too early to assess the impact of the new tariffs that took effect at the beginning of this month, but they do present downside risks to household spending,"" said Jack Kleinhenz, chief economist for the National Retail Federation in Washington.
Households' worries about the new round of tariffs were also underscored by a small rise in consumer sentiment early this month. The University of Michigan said its survey of consumers found that concerns about the impact of tariffs on the economy rose in early September.
Excluding automobiles, gasoline, building materials and food services, retail sales climbed 0.3% last month after increasing by a slightly downwardly revised 0.9% in July. These so-called core retail sales correspond most closely with the consumer spending component of gross domestic product. They were previously reported to have jumped 1.0% in July.
Consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of the economy, increased at a 4.7% annualized rate in the second quarter, the most in 4-1/2 years.
Economists expect consumer spending will slow to just below a 4.0% rate in the third quarter, which would be more than enough to keep the economy growing at a steady pace, rather than tipping into recession as signaled by financial markets.
The dollar (DXY) was little changed against a basket of currencies, while U.S. Treasury prices fell. Major U.S. stock indexes were largely unchanged.
GROWTH LOCOMOTIVE
""The trend in consumer spending growth still looks very solid,"" said Michael Feroli, an economist at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) in New York. ""Consumers remain the locomotive of the economy.""
Strong consumer spending is encouraging retailers to boost inventory. A second report from the Commerce Department on Friday showed business inventories increased 0.4% in July after being unchanged in June. Stocks at retailers rebounded 0.8%, the most in six months, after falling 0.2% in June.
The inventory increase bodes well for GDP growth this quarter. The Atlanta Fed is forecasting the economy to grow at a 1.8% rate in the third quarter. The economy grew at a 2.0% rate in the April-June quarter, down from the first quarter's brisk 3.1% pace.
Financial markets have fully priced in a rate cut at the Fed's Sept. 17-18 policy meeting. Most economists expect additional monetary policy easing in October and December. While underlying consumer prices have accelerated in the past three months, inflation is likely to remain benign.
In a fourth report on Friday, the Labor Department said import prices dropped 0.5% last month amid declines in the cost of petroleum products and food. In the 12 months through August, import prices decreased 2.0% after dropping 1.9% in July.
Import prices have now declined for five straight months on an annual basis.
Low inflation, the lowest unemployment rate in nearly half a century and about $1.27 trillion in personal savings are underpinning consumer spending. Even as the economy has been slowing, layoffs have remained low.
Last month, auto sales accelerated 1.8% after edging up 0.1% in July. Sales at building material and gardening equipment stores jumped 1.4%, the most since January.
Online and mail-order retail sales increased 1.6% after shooting up 1.7% in July. Receipts at health and personal care stores rose 0.7%, mirroring a jump in healthcare inflation in August. Americans also spent more at hobby, musical instrument and book stores, boosting sales 0.9%.
Receipts at service stations fell 0.9%, reflecting cheaper gasoline. But there were pockets of weakness in sales. Receipts at clothing stores fell 0.9% last month and sales at electronics and appliance stores were unchanged.
Furniture sales dropped 0.5%, the largest decrease in eight months. Americans also cut back on spending at restaurants and bars, with sales declining 1.2%, the most since September 2018."
532,By Bloomberg,"<span>Sep 13, 2019 09:05AM ET</span>","U.S. Retail Sales Increase More Than Forecast on Autos, Web","(Bloomberg) -- U.S. retail sales advanced in August by more than forecast as Americans hit auto showrooms and kept shopping online, sending Treasury yields higher and signaling consumers will continue to buoy an economy beset by risks from trade and global weakness.
The value of overall sales rose 0.4% from the prior month after an upwardly revised 0.8% increase in July, Commerce Department figures showed Friday. The median estimate in a Bloomberg survey called for a 0.2% advance.
Sales in the closely watched “control group” subset -- which some analysts view as a more reliable gauge of underlying consumer demand -- increased 0.3%, matching projections. The measure excludes food services, car dealers, building-materials stores and gasoline stations.
Treasuries tumbled following the report, pushing the 10-year yield to the highest since early August.
Spurred by a resilient labor market and income gains, the consumer remains the chief source of firepower for economic growth that’s slowed amid fragile global demand, uncertainty surrounding trade policy and lackluster factory output. The report suggests another solid quarter of household consumption, which grew in the April-June period at the fastest pace since 2014.
In their effort to preserve the longest-running U.S. expansion, Federal Reserve policy makers reduced their benchmark interest rate by a quarter point in July. They’re projected to lower it again next week as a bulwark against the possibility that sluggish global demand and weaker trade spill over into the domestic economy more broadly.
Trade tensions showed some easing this week, with China saying earlier Friday that it’s encouraging companies to buy U.S. farm products including soybeans and pork. The two sides are set to resume face-to-face discussions in coming weeks. Improved chances of an agreement have helped return U.S. stocks to near a record high, even after President Donald Trump imposed levies on a wide range of Chinese goods as of Sept. 1.
Import Prices
Separate data released Friday underscored the implications on prices from the slowing in world trade markets and a strong dollar. The Labor Department’s index of import prices fell 2% in August from a year earlier, matching the biggest decline since 2016. Excluding petroleum, the cost of imports was down 1%.
While the retail sales report was solid overall, some of the details were more mixed: Seven of 13 major categories showed monthly declines, including restaurants, which posted the biggest drop in almost a year.
Food and beverage sellers, general-merchandise stores and clothing vendors also fell. The gain in the control group was the smallest in six months.
On the positive side, spending at automobile and parts dealers climbed 1.8% from the prior month, the most since March, after increasing 0.1% in July. Industry data from Wards Automotive Group previously showed August unit sales rose 0.9% after falling in July to a three-month low.
Non-store sales, which includes online shopping, jumped 1.6%. The category posted a 1.7% gain in July amid Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN).’s 48-hour Prime Day event, which the company said surpassed sales from the previous Black Friday and Cyber Monday combined. The promotion, now in its fifth year, likely drove comparison shoppers to rivals like Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc. and  Target  Corp. (NYSE:TGT)
Filling-station receipts decreased 0.9%, the report showed, after gasoline prices dropped 3.5% in Thursday’s consumer-price data. The retail figures aren’t adjusted for price changes, so sales could reflect changes in gasoline costs, sales, or both.
Excluding automobiles and gasoline, retail sales rose 0.1%, after a 0.9% gain the previous month."

534,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 13, 2019 08:01AM ET</span>",Irish economy in rude health ahead of possible Brexit hit,"By Padraic Halpin
DUBLIN (Reuters) - Ireland's gross domestic product rose by 0.7% quarter-on-quarter in the first three months of the year to stand 5.8% higher than a year ago and put the European Union's best-performing economy in a strong position ahead of a potential Brexit shock.
Irish GDP has outperformed everywhere else in the EU each year since 2014 and the economy has so far largely brushed off uncertainties arising from Britain's 2016 vote to leave the EU, which the government warns could lead to a sudden contraction if Ireland's nearest neighbor departs without a deal.
The growing risk prompted Finance Minister Paschal Donohoe to base next month's budget for 2020 on the assumption of a no-deal Brexit, setting aside funds for vulnerable sectors and allowing the state's finances to return to deficit.
""Overall growth in the economy continues to be broad-based, with positive contributions from the domestic and multinational sectors. Early indications suggest solid growth in the third quarter as well,"" Donohoe said in a statement on Friday.
""Against this, there is a continued softness in the international environment, particularly in the manufacturing sectors. The risk of a no-deal Brexit hangs over the economy, with business and consumer confidence softening as a result.""
The Central Statistics Office (CSO) said GDP was growing at a rate of 6.6% halfway through the year after quarterly growth for the first three months of the year was revised up a touch to 2.7% with the annual figure amended to 7.4% from 6.3%.
Donohoe's department forecast in April that GDP would grow by 3.9% this year and that the economy could either flatline next year with a ""no deal"" Brexit, or grow by 3.3% if there is an orderly withdrawal.
The relevance of using GDP diminished when 2015 growth was adjusted up to 26% after a massive revision to the stock of capital assets related to Ireland's large cluster of multinational companies.
Such distortions have also inflated growth in subsequent years, prompting the CSO to phase in new data that strip out some globalised activities and which Donohoe said showed growth in the domestic economy moderating to more sustainable levels
One such measure, modified total domestic demand rose by 1.9% on the quarter.
Many economists also prefer to use a labor market close to capacity with an unemployment rate of 5.2% to most accurately assess how Ireland's open economy is doing.
""As we look at the first half of the year, we can see that most engines of growth are still incredibly strong. But if we look forward, clearly we can see the clouds gathering and we can see slowing momentum as we look forward,"" said Irish Business and Employers Confederation policy chief Fergal O'Brien.
""The rearview mirror is still a Brexit-free zone, it's the windscreen I'm worried about."""

The European Union's surplus with the United States grew to 90.9 billion euros ($100.8 billion) in Jan-July 2019 from 80.0 billion euros in the same period of 2018, EU statistics office Eurostat reported on Friday.
With China, the EU's trade deficit expanded to 109.2 billion from 98.6 billion euros.
The United States has hit the European Union with tariffs and threatened more in complaint over the trade balance. Both Washington and Brussels have also complained that China wants free trade without playing fair.
Overall, the goods trade balance of the 28-nation bloc slipped to a deficit of 10.2 billion euros in Jan-July 2019 from 2.0 billion euros a year earlier.
Energy imports, notably from Russia and Norway, were the chief cause of the deficit.
For the narrower 19-country euro zone, exports grew by 6.2% year-on-year in July and imports by 2.3%, leading to a widening of its trade surplus to 24.8 billion euros in July from 16.9 billion a year earlier.

The Labor Department said on Thursday its consumer price index excluding the volatile food and energy components gained 0.3% for a third straight month. The so-called core CPI was boosted by a surge in healthcare costs and increases in prices for airline tickets, recreation and used cars and trucks.
In the 12 months through August, the core CPI increased 2.4%, the most since July 2018, after climbing 2.2% in July.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the core CPI rising 0.2% in August and up 2.3% on a year-on-year basis.
But a decline in energy prices held back the increase in the overall CPI to 0.1% last month. The CPI gained 0.3% in July. In the 12 months through August, the CPI increased 1.7% after advancing 1.8% in July.
The Fed, which has a 2% inflation target, tracks the core personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index for monetary policy. The core PCE price index rose 1.6% on a year-on-year basis in July and has fallen short of its target this year.
Economists expect inflation will accelerate in the coming months and breach its target in 2020 following the broadening this month of U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods to include a range of consumer goods. Still, the Fed is likely to continue cutting interest rates this year to offset the drag on the economy from the year-long U.S.-China trade war.
The trade stand-off, which has soured business confidence and tipped both U.S. and global manufacturing into recession, is threatening the longest economic expansion in history.
While Fed Chair Jerome Powell said last week he was not forecasting or expecting a recession, he reiterated the U.S. central bank would continue to act ""as appropriate"" to keep the expansion now in its 11th year on track.
Financial markets have fully priced in a rate cut at the Fed's Sept. 17-18 policy meeting. Most economists expect additional monetary policy easing in October and December.
The Fed cut rates in July for the first time since 2008.
In August, gasoline prices fell 3.5% after rebounding 2.5% in July. Food prices were unchanged for three straight months. Food consumed at home fell 0.2%.
Owners' equivalent rent of primary residence, which is what a homeowner would pay to rent or receive from renting a home, rose 0.2% in August for a second consecutive month.
Healthcare costs jumped 0.7% in August, the largest gain since August 2016, after jumping 0.5% in July. Apparel prices rose 0.2% after gaining 0.4% in the prior month. The government early this year introduced a new method and data to calculate the cost of apparel.

538,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 12, 2019 08:41AM ET</span>",U.S. weekly jobless claims drop to five-month low,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The number of Americans filing applications for unemployment benefits fell to a five-month low last week, suggesting the labor market remains strong despite slowing job growth.
Initial claims for state unemployment benefits declined 15,000 to a seasonally adjusted 204,000 for the week ended Sept. 7, the lowest level since April, the Labor Department said on Thursday. The drop in claims was the largest since May.
Data for the prior week was revised to show 2,000 more applications received than previously reported. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast claims slipping to 215,00 in the latest week.
The claims data covered the Labor Day holiday. Claims tend to be volatile around public holidays and the sharp drop last week could be exaggerating labor market strength. The Labor Department said no states were estimated last week.
The four-week moving average of initial claims, considered a better measure of labor market trends as it irons out week-to-week volatility, fell 4,250 to 212,500 last week.
Layoffs remain low despite a year-long trade war between the United States and China, which is hurting business investment and manufacturing and threatening to derail the longest economic expansion in history.
But job growth is slowing and economists worry that could take some edge off robust consumer spending, which is mainly driving the economy, now in its 11th year of expansion.
Nonfarm payrolls increased by 130,000 jobs in August, down from 159,000 in July, the government reported last Friday. Job growth has averaged 158,000 per month this year, still above the roughly 100,000 per month needed to keep up with growth in the working age population.
Thursday's claims report also showed the number of people receiving benefits after an initial week of aid decreased 4,000 to 1.67 million for the week ended Aug. 31. The four-week moving average of the so-called continuing claims dropped 14,500 to 1.68 million."
539,By Bloomberg,"<span>Sep 12, 2019 07:36AM ET</span>",Turkey Pulls Off Jumbo Rate Cut and Signals Slower Easing Ahead,"(Bloomberg) -- Turkey delivered another interest-rate cut that exceeded forecasts while signaling the central bank could now proceed with caution as it navigates the conflicting demands of the presidency and markets.
Governor Murat Uysal reduced the key rate to 16.5% from 19.75% on Thursday, exceeding the forecasts of most economists surveyed by Bloomberg. The Monetary Policy Committee said inflation is likely to end the year below its earlier forecasts but suggested less scope for deeper easing. The lira gained.
“At this point, the current monetary policy stance, to a large part, is considered to be consistent with the projected disinflation path,” it said in a statement.
Boxed in by President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Uysal is following up on his record monetary easing in July with his second bold move, bringing cuts under his watch to 7.5 percentage points while still leaving rates above inflation. As the economy is only starting to make up ground lost during recession and there’s little room for fiscal stimulus, the central bank is taking center stage for Erdogan, who believes that high rates cause rather than curb price growth.
‘Reasonable’ Return
The only adjustment in forward guidance from July’s decision suggests the central bank thinks it might be nearing the end of its easing cycle, according to Piotr Matys, a strategist at Rabobank in London.
“If the central bank is mindful of market expectations, the pace of easing is likely to slow down as the policy rate approaches a level which is tolerated by investors,’’ Matys said.
The governor, whose predecessor was fired for failing to act faster, has already signaled that more cuts were in the cards but also vowed to preserve “a reasonable rate of real return” for investors. Turkey’s price growth, currently at 15%, will end the year at 13.9%, according to the central bank’s latest forecast.
A steep deceleration in price growth that looms as early as this month probably clinched the argument for Uysal. Before the latest rate cut, Turkey’s benchmark was double the average for its emerging-market peers, providing room for 4 percentage points of easing relative to the central bank’s year-end forecast for inflation, according to Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC).
When Uysal slashed the benchmark by 425 basis points in July, against a market expectation of 250 basis points, it was the first reduction since 2016 and the biggest since a shift to inflation targeting in 2002.
A rare calm has settled over the market before the decision. After soaring to an eight-month high ahead of the central bank’s July meeting, volatility in Turkish stocks has come down before this week’s gathering. The lira appreciated for a second day, trading 1.1% stronger against the dollar as of 2:18 p.m. in Istanbul.
Just days ahead of this week’s meeting, Erdogan laid down a marker for the central bank, suggesting Turkey will lower borrowing costs to single digits soon and inflation will follow suit. Confronting more restless voters and other political challenges, the president will have little patience for a “more moderate” easing cycle, Wolfango Piccoli, co-president at Teneo Intelligence, said before the decision.
“In his fight for political survival, Erdogan will not hesitate to use whatever means he has available,” Piccoli said. “This week’s tool will be monetary policy.”"

Industrial production in the euro zone area fell by 0.4% in July from June and by 2.0% year-on-year. Economists had predicted less sharp drops in output of 0.1% month-on-month and 1.3% from a year earlier.
Eurostat did though revise up its June data, which now shows a 1.4% drop in production in the month instead of the 1.6% estimated earlier. The year-on-year figure for June was hiked to a negative 2.4% from the previous minus 2.6%.
The weakest component in the July figures was production of non-durable consumer goods, such as clothing and packaged food, which fell by 0.8%. Energy output was also down 0.7%.
The positive notes, however, a 1.2% rise in output of durable goods, such as televisions and cars, and a 1.8% increase in output of capital goods, such as machinery.
European Central Bank policymakers will later on Thursday unveil fresh stimulus measures to prop up an ailing euro zone economy that has been partly hit by slowing trade.

541,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 11, 2019 10:11PM ET</span>",Japan's machinery orders slip as trade gloom hits business spending,"By Daniel Leussink
TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's machinery orders slipped in July, albeit at a slower-than-expected pace, as slowing global demand and protracted trade tensions hit corporate investment in the world's third-largest economy.
Cabinet Office data on Thursday showed core orders, a highly volatile data series regarded as an indicator of capital spending in the coming six to nine months, fell 6.6% in July from the previous month.
The drop was smaller than a 9.9% fall expected by economists in a Reuters poll and followed a sharp 13.9% rise in June, the biggest month-on-month gain since comparable data became available in 2005.
Policymakers have been counting on resilience in corporate spending to offset the effects of slowing global demand and the bitter trade war between the United States and China, the world's two largest economies.
Japan revised down its second quarter gross domestic product growth on Monday, reflecting a downgrade in capital expenditure figures as the trade war hit corporate demand.
""There are some signs of weakness among manufacturers,"" said Yoshiki Shinke, chief economist at Dai-ichi Life Research Institute.
""It will be hard for manufacturers to increase business spending thanks to weakness in exports and production.""
Business confidence among Japanese manufacturers has soured to hit the weakest level in 6-1/2 years, the Reuters Tankan poll for September showed on Thursday, underscoring fears about the economic outlook.
Amid the risks to the outlook, speculation is growing that the Bank of Japan could ease policy at next week's board meeting to prevent a possible spike in the yen and dampen the impact from weaker external demand.
As the fallout from the U.S.-China trade war broadens, central bank policymakers are more open to discussing the possibility of expanding stimulus at their board meeting on Sept 18-19, sources familiar with its thinking said.
The BOJ also has to factor in signs of domestic weakness such as slower household spending that suggest consumers could tighten their purse strings even before a planned sales tax hike to 10% comes in next month.
Consumer confidence deteriorated in the wake of the previous tax hike to 8% from 5% in April 2014. That, in turn, caused an economic slump.
The decline in July orders partly reflected the base effect of strong demand from transportation equipment makers in the previous month. Those orders had lifted service-sector orders sharply in June.
""Overall, core orders advanced for a second month on a year-to-year basis so that's not all that bad. It's not a bad sign for the outlook,"" said Akiyoshi Takumori, chief economist at Sumitomo Mitsui DS Asset Management.
The Cabinet Office maintained its assessment on machinery orders to say they are showing a pick up.
By sector, core orders from manufacturers advanced 5.4% in July from the previous month, rising for the first time since April, while those from the service-sector fell 15.6%, the Cabinet Office data showed.
Compared with a year earlier, core orders, which exclude those of ships and electricity, advanced 0.3% in July and defying expectations for a 4.5% contraction."

TOKYO (Reuters) - Business confidence among Japanese manufacturers has soured to hit the weakest level in 6-1/2 years, the Reuters Tankan poll for September showed, underscoring fears that the U.S.-China trade war is undermining Japan's export-led economy.
The monthly poll, which tracks the Bank of Japan's (BOJ) key tankan quarterly survey, found the service-sector mood improving from August - a sign solid domestic demand might offset external pains - but the reading was lower than three months ago.
The Reuters Tankan sentiment index for manufacturers fell for a fourth straight month, reaching minus 7, the lowest point since March 2013.
The September results point to a deterioration in the quarterly BOJ tankan due at 2350 GMT on Sept. 30.
Manufacturers' mood is expected to swing to a zero reading over the next three months but non-manufacturers' sentiment is seen worsening.
Sliding business confidence among manufacturers could dampen capital expenditure - a rare bright spot in the world's third-largest economy - while the bleak outlook at non-manufacturers indicated worries about a hit from a sales tax hike to 10% from 8% scheduled to take effect on Oct. 1.
And there's a sign that capital expenditure may have already peaked out.
Government data out this week showed Japan's economy grew at a slower-than-estimated 1.3% annualized in the April-June quarter as the trade war prompted a downward revision of business spending.
In the Reuters poll of 504 large and mid-sized companies, managers of 260 responded on condition of anonymity.
""The U.S.-China confrontation has led to delays and cancellations in orders and sales,"" a manager of a chemicals firm wrote in the survey.
""The sales tax hike, anxiety about the future, and slowdown in private consumption"" are weighing on our business confidence, said a food processing company manager.
The minus 7 reading for manufacturers' sentiment was down three points from the previous month, weighed on by materials firms such as oil refinery, chemicals, steel/nonferrous metals, according to the survey conducted between Aug. 29 to Sept. 9.
The manufacturers' index has dropped 13 points compared with three months earlier. It is expected to recover to zero in December.
The service-sector index improved to 19 from 13 in August, led by wholesalers/retailers and transportation/utility firms.
Compared with three months earlier, the service-sector index was down three points in September. The index is seen worsening to 10 in the next three months.
The BOJ's last tankan out in July showed big manufacturers' business confidence fell to a nearly three-year low in the quarter to June.
The Reuters Tankan indexes are calculated by subtracting the percentage of pessimistic respondents from optimistic ones. A negative figure means pessimists outnumber optimists."

A measure of underlying U.S. producer prices that excludes food and fuel picked up in August after posting its smallest gain in two years, indicating inflation may be starting to stabilize.
So-called core producer prices increased 2.3% in August from a year earlier, topping the Bloomberg survey median forecast, following a 2.1% gain, a Labor Department report showed Wednesday. Including food and energy, the index rose 0.1% from July and 1.8% from August 2018.
Key Insights
The report, which measures wholesale and other business selling costs, is monitored by analysts to assess the potential of price pressures at the consumer level. Since the end of 2018, annual producer price gains have slowed as a sluggish global economy, exacerbated by the U.S.-China trade war, has limited demand for inputs. Tame inflation, at the producer and consumer levels, gives Federal Reserve policy makers leeway to reduce their benchmark interest rate for a second time this year when they meet next week.The report showed wholesale prices of goods other than food and energy were unchanged in August from a month earlier, while services for final demand climbed 0.3%, led by increases in gaming receipts, guestroom rentals and insurance.The data also showed the costs of arranging freight and cargo shipments surged 4.8% from July, a record in data back to 2009 and likely reflecting the impact on supply chains from tariffs. President Donald Trump escalated the U.S.-China trade war at the beginning of August, announcing tariffs on an additional batch of Chinese goods before escalating those duties before they took effect. Fed policy makers are expected to lower interest rates 25 basis points next week amid tepid inflation, ongoing trade tensions and slowing economic growth at home and abroad.Get More
Producer prices excluding food, energy, and trade services -- a measure preferred by economists because it strips out the most volatile components -- rose 0.4% from the prior month, the most since April. They climbed 1.9% from a year earlier after a 1.7% annual increase in July that was the smallest since January 2017.

The Labor Department said its producer price index for final demand edged up 0.1% last month as a jump in the cost of services offset the largest drop in the price of goods in seven months. That followed a 0.2% gain in July.
In the 12 months through August the PPI advanced 1.8% after increasing 1.7% in July. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the PPI would be unchanged in August and rise 1.7% on a year-on-year basis.
Excluding the volatile food, energy and trade services components, producer prices jumped 0.4% last month after dipping 0.1% in July, the first decline since October 2015.
The so-called core PPI climbed 1.9% in the 12 months through August after increasing 1.7% in July.
The Fed, which has a 2% annual inflation target, tracks the core personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index for monetary policy. The core PCE price index increased 1.6% on a year-on-year basis in July and has undershot its target this year.
Financial markets have fully priced in a rate cut at the U.S. central bank's Sept. 17-18 policy meeting against the backdrop of simmering trade tensions between the United States and China that have soured business confidence and tipped both U.S. and global manufacturing into recession.
U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods were this month broadened to include an array of consumer goods. There are fears the manufacturing downturn could spill over into the broader economy and derail the longest economic expansion in history, now in its 11th year. The economy is being supported by robust consumer spending via a strong labor market.
The Fed cut rates in July for the first time since 2008.
In August, wholesale energy prices fell 2.5% after rebounding 2.3% in the prior month. They were weighed down by a 6.6% drop in gasoline prices, which followed a 5.2% percent jump in July. Goods prices declined 0.5% last month, the most since January, after rising 0.4% in July.
Energy prices accounted for more than 80% of the drop in the cost of goods in August. Wholesale food prices fell 0.6% in August after gaining 0.2% in the prior month. Core goods prices were unchanged last month. They edged up 0.1% in July.
The cost of services increased 0.3% after decreasing 0.1% in July. Services were boosted by a 6.4% surge in the cost of guestroom accommodation, the largest gain since April 2009.
The cost of healthcare services rose 0.2% after edging up 0.1% in July. Those healthcare costs feed into the core PCE price index."

BEIJING/SHANGHAI (Reuters) - China's auto sales could experience negative to low growth over the next three years, an official with the country's top industry association said, after sales fell for a 14th consecutive month in August.
The number of new energy vehicles (NEVs) sold contracted for the second month in a row, data from the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers (CAAM) showed.
Total auto sales fell 6.9% from the same month a year earlier to 1.96 million, CAAM said on Wednesday. This followed declines of 4.3% in July and 9.6% in June.
""The sales in the second half of the year should become better, but we are not sure to what extent the sales would be,"" Shi Jianhua, senior official at CAAM said.
""Perhaps the next three years will be at a low or small negative growth. We're all looking forward to sales picking up, but it's normal if we don't get that,"" he said, adding the key reason for the poor outlook was low consumer confidence amid a economic slowdown and trade tensions with the United States.
As recently as three years ago automakers had enjoyed double digit annual growth in the world's largest auto market, before the brakes came on with the first annual contraction since the 1990s last year.
Sales of new energy vehicles fell 15.8% in August, CAAM said, following a 4.7% fall in July - their first decline since January 2017. NEV sales jumped almost 62% last year even as the broader auto market contracted.
NEVs include plug-in hybrids, battery-only electric vehicles and those powered by hydrogen fuel cells.
China has been a keen supporter of NEVs and has brought in sales quota requirements for automakers.
""Due to the impact of subsidies cut on new energy vehicles, sales for new energy vehicles continued to drop,"" Chen Shihua, assistant secretary general at CAAM, said.
STANDARDS, TARIFFS
CAAM said in July it expected auto sales to fall 5% year-on-year to 26.68 million vehicles in 2019.
It still expects sales of new energy vehicles to increase, but at a slower pace to 1.5 million, down from a previous forecast of 1.6 million.
China has been trying since January to boost consumption of a range of goods as the world's second-biggest economy slows further amid a trade spat with the United States characterized by tit-for-tat import tariffs.
""We expect these measures will promote the consumption of autos in China,"" Chen said.
The implementation of new vehicle emission standards earlier than the central government's 2020 deadline by 15 cities and provinces, which account for over 60% of car sales in China, spooked buyers too and hurt sales - particularly of traditional-fuel vehicles - according to CAAM, analysts, dealers and consumers.
The prolonged sales decline has made local carmakers such as Geely Automobile Holdings Ltd (HK:0175) and Great Wall Motor Co Ltd (SS:601633) cut expectations for sales and profit.
The decline has also prompted some global names including  Peugeot  SA (PA:PEUP) to close plants and adjust workforce.
China is also re-instituting an additional 25% tariff on U.S.-made vehicles and 5% tariffs on auto parts that had been suspended at the beginning of the year. Carmakers such as  Daimler  AG (DE:DAIGn) and Tesla Inc (O:TSLA) had adjusted their prices in China when the auto and auto parts tariffs were suspended."

China is the largest source of tourists to Australia. 
Monthly data from the Australia Bureau of Statistics (ABS) showed 122,300 mainland Chinese tourists made their way Down Under in July, higher than the 12-month average of 120,600.
However, the annual growth rate slowed to 1.1%, matching the level recorded in May, the weakest in nine years. The pace has slowed from around 13% in late 2017 and early 2018, suggesting the trade war is having an impact on tourism.
""The slowdown highlights some downside risks to Australia's services sector, including tertiary education, due to ongoing trade tensions with the U.S. and the weakest economic growth rate in almost three decades,"" CommSec senior economist Ryan Felsman said.
The deceleration was being offset by a record number of Canadian and American visitors, the data showed, largely helped by a weaker Australian dollar.
The Aussie dollar  is hovering near a decade low against the greenback. 
Over the past year, a record 497,700 Canadian tourists and 189,900 Americans visited Australia. The number of Indian visitors also surged to all-time highs in the year to July.
The monthly ABS series is an indicator of the health of Australia's tourism sector. The data underlines that steps taken by Tourism Australia to attract high-value travelers from other Asian countries, including India, are bearing fruit.
Tourism and education are Australia's third largest exports after iron ore and coal.
""Spending by international tourists is the lifeblood of many Aussie cities and towns,"" Felsman added. 

""The near-record inflow of long-term arrivals/permanent residents to Australia will continue to support broader economic activity and spending, especially the housing market with its recovery.""

549,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 11, 2019 12:21AM ET</span>","Australian consumer mood sours, bets rise on steeper rate cuts","By Swati Pandey
SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australian consumers turned gloomier in September as concerns about their personal finances eclipsed signs of a modest recovery in the housing market, underlining why markets are betting on more rate cuts to support a flagging economy.
Wednesday's survey by the Melbourne Institute and Westpac Bank (AX:WBC) showed its index of consumer sentiment slipped 1.7% in September, after gaining 3.6% in August, and at 98.2 indicated pessimists outnumbered optimists.
The dour figures come a day after a separate survey found momentum in the corporate sector was weakening with measures for business conditions and confidence both falling to below average levels.
That suggested further strains for the economy and prompted the National Australia Bank (AX:NAB) on Wednesday to revise its expectations for cuts to the official cash rate. It now sees at least two more policy easings to 0.5% by February from the previous prediction of one.
""We are increasingly worried about downside risks,"" economists at NAB said in a note.
NAB's outlook is now in-line with market pricing for two rate cuts by mid-2020.
The pessimism across the country will no doubt be a discouraging news for the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA), which cut interest rates in both June and July to a record low of 1% in part to support consumer demand.
The government has also offered tax rebates to millions of households to ease some pressure on their cashflows while regulators relaxed bank lending rules, making it easier for Australians to borrow more for mortgage.
While these measures have helped revive the housing sector, demand elsewhere is still feeble.
""Our internal data highlights the risk that tax refunds have done little to boost spending, while business investment remains weak and the dwelling cycle could well be deeper than previously forecast,"" NAB economists added.
""The international outlook also is not inspiring confidence.""
Australia's A$1.95 trillion economy has dodged a recession since the early 1990s but the outlook over the remainder of this year has turned increasingly dim as snail-paced wage hikes and record high household debt have hurt consumer spending.
Worryingly, businesses are not investing either and despite a surge in jobs growth recently the unemployment rate has remained above 5% for most of this year, much higher than the RBA's goal of 4.5%.
JOB LOSS FEARS
While house prices in the two biggest cities of Sydney and Melbourne have stabilized in the last couple of months, economists and markets aren't putting too much stock on a near-term revival in economic growth.
Demand at property auctions have surged while data out earlier this week showed mortgage approvals jumped in July.
The positive impetus in the housing sector contrasts with the more despondent consumer sentiment. Wednesday's Westpac survey showed consumers job loss fears remained elevated in September, indicating that more respondents expect unemployment to rise in the year ahead.
Westpac expects the RBA board to lower rates by 25 basis points at its next policy meeting on Oct.1 with a follow-on move to 0.5% likely in February.
The RBA has said it will cut rates again if needed and has also shown willingness to consider unconventional policy measures when the benchmark rate gets to ""very low"" levels.
On Wednesday, in written responses to lawmaker's questions, the RBA reiterated it may consider quantitative easing if warranted, but said such a policy option is unlikely at this juncture.
""While it is difficult to rule any specific measure in or out, the focus would likely be on reducing the risk-free interest rate,"" the RBA said on its website.
""This would involve reducing the cash rate to a very low level and possibly purchasing government securities to lower the risk-free rate further out along the term spectrum."""
550,By Bloomberg,"<span>Sep 10, 2019 11:42PM ET</span>",Australian Consumer Confidence Sinks Despite Cash Handouts,"(Bloomberg) -- Australian households were gloomier this month as worrying headlines from abroad and weakness at home left them pessimistic about their prospects, regardless of government cash handouts.
Consumer confidence dropped 1.7% to 98.2 in September, with a reading below 100 signaling pessimists outnumber optimists, Westpac Banking Corp.’s survey showed. The poll of 1,200 adults conducted during the first week of the month contained a special question on recent household tax rebates, and found over half planned to save part or all of the cash.
“Pressure on family finances and concerns about the near-term outlook weighed on sentiment,” Westpac chief economist Bill Evans said Wednesday. “Concerns about the state of the economy, the international backdrop and employment are seeing consumers become more cautious.”
The result comes a day after a survey of Australian firms found sentiment poor there as well despite back-to-back interest-rate cuts and the government tax rebates. Australia’s economy has slowed sharply as households start to buckle under record debt and weak wage growth, and opt against spending.
Evans said the case for the Reserve Bank of Australia to lower rates further from the current 1% is “quite clear” with both the U.S. Federal Reserve and European Central Bank likely to ease in the next week. Evans sees the RBA cutting next month and again in February."
551,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 10, 2019 12:22PM ET</span>",Declining U.S. vacancies point to slowing job growth,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. job openings fell for a second straight month in July amid decreases in wholesale trade and the federal government, bolstering economists' views that job growth has peaked.
Signs of moderating job growth were also corroborated by another report on Tuesday showing a drop in vacancies at small businesses in August. The reports came on the heels of data last week showing hiring slowed in August. The cool-off in job growth is in tandem with a slowing economy, which is being hampered by a yearlong trade war between the United States and China.
""Last week's jobs report sparked a debate over whether the slowdown in hiring is due to an economy hitting full employment, but today's JOLTS report indicates that this is actually a labor market that is losing momentum,"" said Nick Bunker, economist at Indeed Hiring Lab in Washington.
Job openings, a measure of labor demand, slipped by 31,000 to a seasonally adjusted 7.2 million in July, the Labor Department said in its monthly Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey, or JOLTS. Job openings have been little changed this year since scaling an all-time high of 7.6 million in late 2018. 
Vacancies in wholesale trade decreased by 55,000 in July. Federal government job openings fell by 11,000. There were small decreases in unfilled positions in financial activities, professional services and healthcare and social assistance.
But job openings increased by 42,000 in information. There were an additional 11,000 vacancies in mining and logging. The job openings rate fell to 4.5% in July from 4.6% in June.
MORE JOB QUITTERS
In a separate report on Tuesday, the NFIB independent business lobbying group said the share of small business owners reporting job openings they could not fill fell in August. Still, job openings remain at higher levels, which could ease fears that the longest economic expansion in history was in a danger of being derailed by a recession, signaled by an inversion of the U.S. Treasury yield curve.
""The U.S. has never entered into a recession with so many 'help wanted' signs out there across the country, meaning the labor force is already lean and mean with few surplus workers to cut,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG in New York.
The JOLTS report showed the hiring increased by 237,000 jobs to 6.0 million in July. That lifted the hiring rate to 3.9% from 3.8% in June. Overall hiring is, however, expected to continue slowing this year because of the end of the boost from last year's $1.5 trillion tax cut package, U.S-China trade tensions and softening global growth.
Nonfarm payrolls increased by 130,000 jobs in August, down from 159,000 in July, the government reported last Friday.
Job growth has averaged 158,000 per month this year, still above the roughly 100,000 per month needed to keep up with growth in the working age population.
""Net hiring is expected to weaken progressively and cease altogether in the second half of 2020,"" said Sophia Koropeckyj, a senior economist at Moody's Analytics in West Chester, Pennsylvania.
The number of workers voluntarily quitting their jobs increased 130,000 to an all-time high of 3.6 million in July. The quits rate increased to 2.4%, the highest level since April 2001, from 2.3% in June. The quits rate is viewed by policymakers and economists as a measure of job market confidence. 
""In the future, such an increase might be even less frequent if employer demand continues to stagnate,"" said Indeed Hiring Lab's Bunker. ""The labor market remains strong, but signs point to it slowing to where job seekers may lose out on some opportunities.""

Layoffs edged up in July, lifting the layoffs rate to 1.2% in July from 1.1% in June. Layoffs rose by 20,000 jobs in the information industry.

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's workers received their biggest pay rises in more than 11 years this summer as the unemployment rate fell back to its lowest since the mid-1970s, even as the country's political crisis over Brexit deepened.
But there were a couple of signs in Tuesday's official data that the approach of the latest deadline for leaving the European Union was making some employers nervous. 
Hiring was weaker than expected by most economists and vacancies fell to their lowest level since late 2017.
""At a testing time, the labor market is surpassing expectations, though there are early signs the jobs boom could be cooling down,"" said Tej Parikh, chief economist at the Institute of Directors, an employers group.
The Office for National Statistics said total earnings growth, including bonuses, rose by an annual 4.0% in the three months to July, up from 3.8% in the three months to June for its strongest increase since mid-2008.
Pay growth is watched closely by the Bank of England to gauge future inflation pressures, and the latest increase was stronger than all forecasts in a Reuters poll of economists.
""Once adjusted for inflation, they have now gone above 2% for the first time in nearly four years,"" ONS statistician David Freeman said.
Excluding bonuses, which smooth out some volatility, pay growth slipped back to 3.8%, in line with a Reuters poll forecast.
The unemployment rate fell to 3.8%, back to its joint lowest since the three months to January 1975.
JOB CREATION DOWN
But job creation was lower than anticipated at 31,000, weaker than the median forecast of 53,000 in the Reuters poll.
Vacancies fell too, touching their lowest level since the three months to November 2017 at 812,000, with small companies especially cautious about seeking new staff.
Britain's economy, which has been flirting with recession ahead of Brexit, has been heavily reliant on spending by consumers that has been boosted by the country's jobs boom and rising pay.
Many economists have attributed the strength of the labor market, at least in part, to employers hiring workers that they can later lay off rather than making longer-term commitments to investment.
There have been other signs that employers are turning more cautious about hiring before the Brexit deadline of Oct. 31, with Prime Minister Boris Johnson saying he will take Britain out of the EU without a transition deal if necessary.
A survey published last week showed the number of workers hired for permanent jobs via recruitment agencies fell at the fastest pace in more than three years in August. [nL5N25W25B]
Despite the rise in pay, the BOE is widely expected to wait for the outcome of Brexit - which it fears could damage Britain's economy if there is no deal with Brussels to ease the transition - before any decision to resume its gradual and limited series of interest rates hikes.
Ruth Gregory, an economist with consultancy Capital Economics, said the big picture of low unemployment and rising pay was likely to mean the BoE would stick to that plan when it announces its latest policy decision on Sept. 19.

""The labor market still looks set to provide solid support to the economy over the next few years and could prevent the Bank of England from becoming too dovish against the weakening global backdrop when it meets again next week,"" she said.

The decline of 1.6 points to 103.1 in the National Federation of Independent Business’s index resulted from weaker expectations for businesses and sales, according to a report Tuesday. The reading was below the median estimate of analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.
Economists are watching indicators of business and consumer sentiment for signs that the tariff war and manufacturing slowdown will affect growth more broadly. Such indicators have been mixed in recent weeks, with Conference Board and Bloomberg measures of consumer confidence holding up and a University of Michigan gauge faltering.
Even with the decline, the NFIB gauge remains elevated by historical standards, though it’s below the average level since Donald Trump was elected president in 2016.
Other measures in the survey showed improvement. Hiring grew to an average addition of 0.19 employee per firm from 0.12 in July, while the share reporting quarterly profit growth increased.
Job gains improved despite a record 57% of respondents saying there were few or no qualified applicants for openings, adding to signs of a tight labor market with unemployment at 3.7%.

""We still assess our industry's position as positive,"" Reinhard Quast, the head of Germany's ZDB construction industry group said in a statement, adding that the sector was currently the country's number one growth driver.
ZDB lifted its revenue growth forecast in nominal terms for 2019 to 8.7% from a previously forecast 6% and sees a 5% increase in 2020.
With its sales abroad hit by trade tensions, a global slowdown and an increasingly chaotic run-up to Brexit, the bulk of Germany's economy increasingly depends on its robust domestic spending driven by high employment and strong demand in the construction sector.
Earlier on Tuesday, Germany's HDE retail association upheld its 2% growth outlook for the full year. [nS8N25G00H] This compares to a total growth rate of 0.5% Germany's government projects for the economy in 2019, down from 1.5% in 2018.
Weaker exports sent Germany's economy down 0.1% in the second quarter and some weak economic data since then has fueled concerns that the economy could also shrink in the third, which would be a technical recession. [nL8N25A1D1]

BEIJING (Reuters) - China's factory-gate prices shrank at the sharpest pace in three years in August, falling deeper into deflationary territory and reinforcing the urgency for Beijing to step up economic stimulus as the trade war with the United States intensifies.
Analysts say flagging demand at home and abroad is forcing some Chinese businesses to slash prices to win new orders or cut output to contain costs, chipping away at already-lean profits and further dampening business confidence.
The fall was mainly driven by weakness in raw material prices, especially for energy and metals.
China's producer price index (PPI) dropped 0.8% from a year earlier in August, widening from a 0.3% decline seen in July and the worst year-on-year contraction since August 2016, National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) data showed on Tuesday.
(Graphic: China's factory-gate prices shrank at the fastest pace in three years, pork prices surge - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/ce/7/6349/6331/ChinaPPICPIPork.png)
Analysts polled by Reuters had expected the index to have shrunk by 0.9%, the second straight month of outright declines.
""With demand-side pressures on prices increasingly subdued, we think that further monetary easing is on the horizon,"" Capital Economics said in a note to clients, predicting producer deflation will get worse in coming months.
Share prices in Shanghai fell as the data pointed to growing profit pressure.
The central bank on Friday cut banks' reserve requirements for the seventh time since early 2018 to free up more money for lending, and analysts widely expect it to cut some of its key lending rates next week to reduce corporate borrowing costs.
China's central bank governor Yi Gang said in late July that interest rate levels were appropriate and that cutting rates would mainly deal with the danger of deflation. But he said at the time that price changes in China remained moderate.
Surging food prices and higher consumer inflation will not be a barrier to policy easing, analysts said.
The consumer price index (CPI) rose 2.8% from a year earlier, unchanged from July and beating analysts' expectations at 2.6%, but still below China's annual target of around 3%.
""Despite the higher CPI, we expect the People's Bank of China (PBOC) to cut interest rates in the fourth quarter this year,"" ANZ said.
""China's declining producer price index (PPI) carries more weight with policymakers in their monetary policy decisions, in our view.""
The food price index rose 10% on-year, from a 9.1% jump in July and the highest since January 2012. Pork prices soared 46.7%, after an increase of 27% in July, as African swine fever decimates the country's herds.
Most analysts expect pork prices to continue rising as supply plummets, spilling over into prices of other food items.
Core consumer inflation, which excludes food and fuel, remained mild, however. It picked up to 1.5% on-year after a 1.3% gain in the prior month.
""We do not think elevated inflation will lead PBOC to raise rates, given still-mild core inflation, although it could put some limit on rates declining too much,"" Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) said in a research note.
DEFLATIONARY PRESSURE
Weakness in producer prices has also been seen recently in other major economies including the United States, Canada and the euro zone, raising concerns over demand worldwide as the Sino-U.S. trade dispute upends global supply chains.
China's oil and gas extraction industries saw the greatest deflationary pressure in August, notching up price declines of 9.1% on year. The oil, coal and other fuel processing industries saw prices fall 5.9%.
Demand for major building materials faltered in August and manufacturing activity contracted more steeply than expected, while the central government remained reluctant to ease curbs on the property sector, a major growth driver, as it tries to keep home price rises in check.
Spot prices for steel reinforcing bars continued to hover below the level seen in the same period last year, worsened by a seasonal slackening in construction activities during summer.
Imports of unwrought copper, another cornerstone material in construction and a key gauge of demand, also sank in August.
Analysts expect more pain for Chinese exporters in upcoming months, with more U.S. tariff measures set to take effect on Oct. 1 and Dec. 15.
Both sides agreed on Thursday to hold high-level talks in early October, but analysts remain doubtful that a trade deal could be forged in the next few quarters.
Analysts say China's economic growth has likely cooled further this quarter from a near 30-year low of 6.2% in April-June, and could test the lower end of the government's 6-6.5% 2019 target. Data on Sunday showed August exports and imports both shrank.
With the trade war expected to grow longer and costlier, an increasingly number of analysts have been lowering their China outlooks in the last few weeks. Fitch Ratings was the latest on Monday, cutting its 2020 growth forecast to 5.7% from 6.0%.

Recent data and anecdotal evidence suggest gross domestic product will probably grow in the third quarter after shrinking in the previous three months, according to economists including Chua Hak Bin at Maybank Kim Eng Research Pte. and Barnabas Gan at United Overseas Bank Ltd.
That would mean the city state will narrowly avoid a technical recession, commonly defined as two consecutive quarters of contraction.
Even so, there’s little to cheer about. Economists have slashed their 2019 growth forecasts for the export-reliant economy as the U.S.-China trade war intensifies. Singapore’s government is projecting growth of zero to 1% for the year.
Irvin Seah, a senior economist at DBS Group Holdings Ltd., said he isn’t optimistic about the country’s prospects even if the economy avoids a technical recession. He predicts expansion of just 0.7% for the full year.
Maybank cites three main reasons for the mild improvement, which it says should help boost Singapore’s services output and offset the slump in manufacturing:
Front-Loading Orders
Businesses may be front-loading some orders before the U.S. slaps a 15% tariff on Chinese consumer goods, like mobile phones and laptops, in December. Also, there are signs that a slump in technology exports, which had been a drag on manufacturing, is starting to ease. Singapore’s July data reflected some of that rebound, with industrial production posting a far better performance than economists had predicted.
Loan Growth
Singapore’s financial center is benefiting as more businesses finance their regional projects via lenders based in the city state. Offshore loans rose 7% in July from a year ago, while domestic lending grew 2%. The strongest growth in offshore loans was in construction and manufacturing, surging 18% and 15% respectively.
Hong Kong Diversion
Protests and disruptions in Hong Kong have pushed leisure and business tourism to Singapore. Visitor arrivals grew 4% in July from a year ago, the fastest pace in 9 months, with hotel occupancy rising to 94%, the highest level ever for July, according to data from the Singapore Tourism Board. Despite a regional drop in Chinese tourists, Singapore-bound visitors from China rose 7.8% in July from a year ago, while tourists from the U.S. rose 17% and from Indonesia, 12%.
Singapore may benefit as more business events and conferences are diverted from Hong Kong, said Maybank, citing the Golden Wellness Summit planned for October, which was moved from Hong Kong to Singapore, and other events."

The producer price index (PPI) dropped 0.8% in August from a year earlier. Meanwhile, the consumer price index (CPI) rose 2.8% during the month year-on-year, unchanged in July.
Both figures were slightly better than analysts had expected – the PPI was expected to decline by 0.9% while the CPI was estimated to rise by 2.7%.
Chinese stocks traded lower and underperformed their regional peers following the release of the data. The Shanghai Composite and the Shenzhen Component were down 0.4% and 0.8% respectively by 11:27 PM ET (03:27 GMT)."
559,By Bloomberg,"<span>Sep 09, 2019 10:34PM ET</span>",Australian Business Gloom Deepens as Stimulus Fails to Fire,"(Bloomberg) -- Australian business sentiment tumbled in August, suggesting interest-rate cuts and tax relief are failing to rejuvenate the slowing economy.
A gauge of business confidence slid to 1 from 4, while the conditions index -- measuring hiring, sales and profits -- slumped to 1 from 3, National Australia Bank Ltd.’s survey showed Tuesday. It was conducted from Aug. 20-31, covering more than 570 firms.
“It looks like the tax cuts have had little impact on household consumption or have not been large enough to offset increasing weakness,” said Alan Oster, NAB’s chief economist. “The two rate cuts also may have had little impact, though this is expected with the longer and more variable lags of monetary policy.”
Reserve Bank chief Philip Lowe cut interest rates in June and July to a record-low 1% as he tries to revive household spending. He has urged the government to open the fiscal spigot to bolster the bank’s stimulus efforts, though Treasurer Josh Frydenberg has so far resisted, maintaining he’s already doing enough to support the economy via a tax rebate and existing infrastructure spending.
Tuesday’s survey follows GDP data last week that showed the economy expanded in the second quarter at the weakest annual pace in 10 years, with the private sector almost moribund. That trend seems to have persisted, with a weekly gauge of consumer confidence released earlier today also falling.
“This outcome suggests that momentum in the business sector continues to weaken, with both confidence and conditions well below the levels seen in 2018 -- and is in line with the weak outcome for the private sector in the second quarter national accounts,” Oster said.
Indeed, the only sign of impact from the rate cuts is an upswing in house prices in Sydney and Melbourne, which may in time generate a wealth effect that encourages households to spend more. Monthly consumer confidence for September is due out Wednesday.
Economists and money markets are betting Lowe will cut twice more to 0.5%, a level close to the lower bound of policy that could open the door to unconventional measures."

561,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 09, 2019 05:29AM ET</span>","UK economy shows unexpected strength in July, dampening recession fears","By Andy Bruce and Jonathan Cable
LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's economy picked up more than expected in July, data showed on Monday, dampening fears that it will succumb to its first recession since the financial crisis as the Brexit crisis escalates.
Economic output in July alone was 0.3% higher than in June, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said, marking the biggest rise since January and topping all forecasts in a Reuters poll of economists that had pointed to a 0.1% increase.
The pound inched higher against the dollar on the figures, which showed the expansion was driven by the dominant services sector -- although the ONS said the underlying picture showed its growth weakening through 2019.
""While the figures are far from stellar, after a contraction in the second quarter the chances that we see a negative GDP print in the third have now dropped significantly, meaning that a technical recession will likely be avoided,"" said David Cheetham, chief market analyst at online broker XTB.
The world's fifth-biggest economy shrank in the second quarter, a hangover from a stockpiling boom in advance of the original March Brexit deadline. 
While most economists think modest growth will return in the current quarter, a slew of downbeat surveys has shown business activity wilting during the Brexit crisis, especially in August. They point to a risk that the economy will contract again, which would officially herald a recession.
The ONS said gross domestic product in the three months to July was flat compared with the previous three-month period. A Reuters poll of economists had pointed to a 0.1% contraction.
TRADE TENSIONS
Last month, the Bank of England forecast that economic output would grow 0.3% in the third quarter, although its forecast for zero growth in the second quarter proved to be too optimistic.
Besides the political crisis at home, the outlook for the economy has dimmed further because of trade tensions between the United States and China.
Wednesday's data showed the services sector, which accounts for almost 80% of British economic output, expanded 0.3% in July after four months of stagnation, the biggest upturn since November 2018.
Manufacturing output increased unexpectedly last month, rising 0.3% in monthly terms, while the construction industry also fared better than expected, posting a 0.5% rise in output. 

Separate figures showed the goods trade deficit increased in July to 9.144 billion pounds from 8.920 billion pounds in June, although this was still a little less than the 9.55 billion pounds deficit economists had forecast.

The Sentix research group said its investor sentiment index for the euro zone edged up to -11.1 in September from -13.7 in August. That beat a Reuters poll of analysts who had predicted a decline to -14.0.
Investors' assessment of the current situation deteriorated for the fourth month in a row to reach its lowest level since January 2015 at -9.5.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's economy grew at a slower pace than initially estimated in the second quarter as the U.S.-China trade war prompted a downward revision of business spending, intensifying calls for the central bank to deepen stimulus this month.
Weakness in the global economy and worsening trade protectionism have emerged as risks to growth and added some pressure for the Bank of Japan (BOJ) to expand stimulus when it meets next week.
The economy grew an annualized 1.3% in April-June, revised Cabinet Office data showed Monday, weaker than the preliminary reading for 1.8% annualized growth and in line with economists' median forecast.
The annualized growth rate translates into a quarter-on-quarter expansion of 0.3% from January-March, compared with a preliminary reading for a 0.4% gain.
""There's a possibility growth will turn negative in the October-December quarter,"" said Izuru Kato, chief economist at Totan Research.
""If worries about such negative growth deepen (in the coming months), the Bank of Japan could consider lowering interest rates further into negative territory.""
Capital spending rose just 0.2% from the previous quarter, much lower than a preliminary 1.5% rise and the median forecast for a 0.7% increase.
The capex downgrade was due to government statisticians including a demand-side survey of capex in the revised GDP data, which was not in the preliminary figures and showed weakness in the sector.
Stefan Angrick, senior economists at Oxford Economics, said manufacturers cut spending in the quarter amid a re-escalation in U.S.-China trade frictions.
""While investment by non-manufacturers, particularly software-related, maintained robust growth, it was not enough to completely offset the contraction in spending by manufacturers,"" Angrick said in a note.
A private sector business survey published last week showed Japanese manufacturing activity declining for a fourth straight month in August while export orders remained in contraction for a ninth month in a row.
Private consumption, which accounts for some 60% of gross domestic product, advanced 0.6% from the previous three months, matching the preliminary reading.
Net exports - or exports minus imports - subtracted 0.3 percentage point from revised GDP growth, signaling the economy is feeling the pain from the global growth slowdown.
BOJ PRESSURE
The outlook for the world's third-largest economy remains clouded as risks from declining manufacturing overseas and at home hit exports.
Analysts have also warned of a possible drop in domestic consumption after Japan raises its sales tax to 10% next month, which could hit one of the economy's few growth drivers.
A separate Cabinet Office survey released on Monday pointed to a bleak outlook for consumption. The survey called the ""economy watchers"" sentiment index, which measures business confidence among workers such as taxi drivers, hotel workers and restaurant staff, was marginally higher than a more than three-year low hit in July.
The outlook index, indicating the level of confidence in future conditions, slipped to the lowest level since March 2014, the month before Japan's last sales tax hike in April 2014.
Amid the risks to growth, BOJ Governor Haruhiko Kuroda has kept the door ajar for cutting interest rates further into negative territory, saying last week such move is among the bank's policy options.
Speculation is growing that the BOJ could ease policy as early as this month to prevent the yen from spiking, an increasingly likely prospect if the U.S. Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank unveil new easing measures.
Growth is expected to hold up in the current quarter partly due to consumer front-loading their purchases ahead of next month's tax rise, said Totan Research's Kato.
""But it's unlikely the pent-up demand in the July-September quarter will be as strong as ahead of the previous consumption tax hike in April 2014,"" he said. 
The consumer sector has been one of the few bright spots for the economy, which has expanded for three straight quarters, although the pace of growth has slowed.
Household spending rose for an eighth straight month in July, marking the longest run of expansion since comparable data became available in 2000.
But that may not be enough to shield Japan's service sector from a slump in exports, sagging business sentiment and a contraction in manufacturing.

Japan's exports slipped for an eighth month in July, dragged down by China-bound shipments of car parts and semiconductor production equipment, while manufacturers' confidence turned negative for the first time since April 2013.

The Federal Statistics Office said seasonally adjusted exports rose 0.7% on the month while imports fell 1.5%. The trade surplus rose to 20.2 billion euros ($22.27 billion) after a downwardly revised 18.0 billion euros in the prior month.
A Reuters poll of economists had pointed to a 0.5% drop in exports and a 0.3% fall in imports. The trade surplus was expected to come in at 17.5 billion euros.
""This morning's trade data brings a very weak ray of sunshine. Nothing more but luckily also nothing less,"" said Carsten Brzeski, economist at ING.
The stronger-than-expected export figures cut against the grain of a recent run of weak data from Germany, which has fueled concerns that the economy could tip into recession in the July-September period.
Against that bleak backdrop, the European Central Bank is expected to deploy fresh stimulus at its policy meeting on Thursday.
Germany's gross domestic product contracted by 0.1% quarter-on-quarter in the second quarter on weaker exports, with the decrease in foreign sales mainly driven by Britain and below-average demand from China.
Economists generally define a technical recession as at least two consecutive quarters of contraction.
Monday's data showed that in the January-July period, German exports rose by 1.0%, with the strongest contribution coming from markets beyond the European Union, which registered growth of 2.9%.

German Chancellor Angela Merkel said on a visit to Beijing on Friday that the China-U.S. trade war affects the whole world and that she hopes it will be resolved soon.

HONG KONG (Reuters) - Hong Kong visitor arrivals plunged nearly 40% in August from a year earlier, deepening from July's 5% fall, the finance secretary said as sometimes violent anti-government protests take a rising toll on the city's tourism, retail and hotel businesses.
Hotels in some locations had seen occupancy rates drop to about half, while room rates plunged 40-70%, Paul Chan said, citing industry sources.
""The most worrying thing is that it does not seem that the road ahead is easily going to turn any better,"" Chan said in his blog on Sunday. (https:// July tourist arrivals fell 4.8% on the year, according to the Hong Kong Tourism Board, the first annual decline since January 2018 and the biggest percentage drop since August 2016.
Retail sales in July sank by the most since February 2016 amid the anti-government protests that have gripped the Chinese-ruled city for more than three months.
Chan said the social unrest had severely damaged the image of Hong Kong as a safe international city and a hub for trade, aviation and finance.
On Monday, hundreds of uniformed school students formed human chains in districts across Hong Kong in support of anti-government protesters after another weekend of clashes in the Chinese-ruled city. Metro stations that had closed on Sunday amid confrontations reopened.
Chan said that repeated violent conflicts, the blocking of roads, underground railways and the airport had obstructed people from going to work and school and led to the cancellation or rescheduling of ""many"" international conferences and exhibitions.
Total export fell 5.7% year on year in July, while re-export value to the United States from China via Hong Kong declined 15.2% from a year earlier, he said.
Global credit rating agency Fitch Ratings on Friday downgraded Hong Kong's long-term foreign currency issuer default rating to ""AA"" from ""AA+"", and said it expects public discontent will likely persist.
""Fitch's view is purely speculative, lacking justification,"" Chan said."

Home-loan approvals rose 4.2%, the biggest increase since June 2015 and almost triple economists’ forecasts, the statistics bureau said in Sydney Monday. The spike reflects a revival in house prices that last month jumped by the most in 2-1/2 years, as well as a surge in auction clearance rates.
A combination of Reserve Bank rate cuts in June and July to a record-low 1% together with government tax relief and incentives for first-home buyers is filtering through the property market. RBA chief Philip Lowe is easing policy to try to entice households -- laboring under record debt with weak wage growth -- to reopen their wallets.
Consumption accounts for three-fifths of Australia’s economy and wealth effects from rising property prices should also encourage spending.
The data showed that mortgages to first-time home buyers rose for a fourth straight month. The value of loans to investors jumped 4.7%, the most since 2016, and soared 5.3% for owner-occupiers in the biggest leap since 2015.
Economists and money markets reckon Lowe will cut twice more to 0.5%, which would be close to the lower bound for rates and open up the prospect of unconventional policy. Further reinforcing those expectations is that the RBA’s quarterly forecasts released last month were based on market pricing.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's surplus in spending by overseas travelers declined in July from a year earlier as the number of visitors from South Korea tumbled, a sign the souring bilateral relations are taking a toll on the world's third largest economy.
The travel account surplus - or the amount spent in Japan by foreign visitors minus that by Japanese traveling overseas - shrank 0.9% in July from a year earlier to 229.3 billion yen, current account data by the Ministry of Finance showed on Monday.
Japan's decision in July to tighten controls on exports of materials to South Korea, which are used to make semiconductors, has prompted a backlash in Korea, with consumers boycotting Japanese goods and cancelling tours to the neighboring country.
In July, the number of South Korea visitors dropped by 7.6% from a year earlier - and was the lowest in nearly a year, according to Japanese government data.
Such a drop is ""certainly a factor"" in the travel services account, a finance ministry official said. ""We are monitoring developments.""
The decline in the travel account surplus helped cause a 32% rise in Japan's service account deficit, the data showed.
As a result, Japan's overall current account surplus fell 1.4% in the year to July to 1.9999 trillion yen ($18.72 billion), largely in line with economists' median forecast for a surplus of 2.0832 trillion yen.
The drop in South Korean tourists is a blow to Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's plan to make inbound tourism a pillar of Japan's economic growth, and comes at a time the export-reliant recovery is hit by slowing global demand and the Sino-U.S. trade war.
Since Abe took office in late 2012, foreign visitors to Japan have more than tripled to 30 million people as of 2018, helped by a weaker yen and easing of visa requirements.
Abe's government set a target to increase the number of foreign visitors to 40 million by 2020 and 60 million by 2030.
South Koreans account for the second largest chunk of visitors to Japan at around 7.1 million in 2017, following Chinese at 7.4 million, according to government data.
In the balance of payment data since 1996, travel accounts are included in service accounts, which cover transactions for tourism and logistics with other countries.
The travel account surplus rose 3% to a record 1.3 trillion yen in January-June from the same period a year earlier, helping the service account balance swing to a surplus for the first time.
Japan's current account surplus mainly consists of income gains from foreign direct investments, and services including money spent by overseas travelers, while the trade balance tends to log deficits due to trade frictions and weak global demand."
568,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 08, 2019 04:14AM ET</span>",China's August exports unexpectedly shrink as U.S. shipments slump,"By Yawen Chen and Se Young Lee
BEIJING (Reuters) - China's exports unexpectedly fell in August as shipments to the United States slowed sharply, pointing to further weakness in the world's second-largest economy and underlining a pressing need for more stimulus as the Sino-U.S. trade war escalates.
Beijing is widely expected to announce more support measures in coming weeks to avert the risk of a sharper economic slowdown as the United States ratchets up trade pressure, including the first cuts in some key lending rates in four years.
On Friday, the central bank cut banks' reserve requirements for a seventh time since early 2018 to free up more funds for lending, days after a cabinet meeting signaled that more policy loosening may be imminent.
August exports fell 1% from a year earlier, the biggest fall since June, when it fell 1.3%, customs data showed on Sunday. Analysts had expected a 2.0% rise in a Reuters poll after July's 3.3% gain. 
That's despite analyst expectations that a falling yuan would offset some cost pressure and looming tariffs may have prompted some Chinese exporters to bring forward or ""front-load"" U.S.-bound shipments into August, a trend seen earlier in the trade dispute.
China let its currency slide past the key 7 per dollar level in August for the first time since the global financial crisis, and Washington labeled it a currency manipulator.
""Exports are still weak even in the face of substantial yuan currency depreciation, indicating that sluggish external demand is the most important factor affecting exports this year,"" said Zhang Yi, economist at Zhong Hai Sheng Rong Capital Management. 
Among its major trade partners, China's August exports to the United States fell 16% year-on-year, slowing sharply from a decline of 6.5% in July. Imports from America slumped 22.4%.
Many analysts expect export growth to slow further in coming months, as evidenced by worsening export orders in both official and private factory surveys. More U.S. tariff measures will take effect on Oct. 1 and Dec. 15.
""China-U.S. trade friction has led to a sharp decline in China's exports to the United States,"" said Steven Zhang, chief economist and head of research at  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) Huaxin Securities.
Exports to Europe, South Korea, Australia, and Southeast Asia (ASEAN) also worsened on an annual basis, compared with July, while shipments to Japan and Taiwan posted slightly better growth than the previous month.
Sunday's data also showed China's imports shrank for the fourth consecutive month since April. Imports dropped 5.6% on-year in August, slightly less than an expected 6.0% fall and unchanged from July's 5.6% decline. 
Sluggish domestic demand was likely the main factor in the decline, along with softening global commodity prices. China's domestic consumption and investment have remained weak despite more than a year of growth boosting measures.
China reported a trade surplus of $34.84 billion last month, compared with a $45.06 billion surplus in July. Analysts had forecast a surplus of $43 billion for August. 
TRADE PRESSURE
August saw dramatic escalations in the bitter year-long trade row, with Washington announcing 15% tariffs on a wide range of Chinese goods from Sept. 1. Beijing hit back with retaliatory levies, and let its yuan currency fall sharply to offset some of the tariff pressure.
China and the United States on Thursday agreed to hold high-level talks in early October in Washington, the first in-person discussions since a failed U.S.-China trade meeting at the end of July.
But there was no indication that any planned tariffs on Chinese goods would be halted, and markets expect a lasting peace between the two countries seems more elusive than ever.
White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow said on Friday the United States wants ""near term"" results from U.S.-China trade talks in September and October but cautioned that the trade conflict could take years to resolve.
China's trade surplus with the United States stood at $26.95 billion in August, narrowing from July's $27.97 billion.
It still reached $195.45 billion in the first eight months of 2019, highlighting continued imbalances which have been a core complaint of Trump's in his administration's negotiations with Beijing.

Investing.com – The U.S. economy created fewer jobs than expected last month, while wage inflation rose, leaving the markets with mixed signals as far as what that means for the Federal Reserve.

Nonfarm payrolls rose 130,000 in August, the Labor Department reported Friday. The market was expecting payrolls to have risen 160,000, according to economists’ forecasts compiled by Investing.com.
The unemployment rate remained steady at 3.7%, suggesting that the economy remains close to full employment.
Average hourly earnings rose 0.4% in the month and 3.2% from the year-ago period. That was a little stronger than expectations for a monthly increase of 0.3% and a 3.1% year-over-year rise.
In days past, such a report would leave the Fed with conflicting monetary policy indications.
Job growth was weaker than the consensus. And “more that 20% of job gains (were) due to temporary hiring for 2020 census, with downward revision to previous two months,” Grant Thornton Chief Economist Diane Swonk tweeted.
June payroll gains were revised down 15,000 from to 178,000 from 193,000 and July was revised down 5,000 to 159,000 from 164,000 – a total of 20,000.
In addition, average monthly job growth for the first eight months of 2019 is 158,00, down from 233,000 in full-year 2018 and the 225,000 in the year-ago period, Patrick Chovanec, chief strategist at Silvercrest Asset Management, tweeted.
That weakness could support some easing of rates.
Yet, with wage growth beating forecasts, inflation hawks would probably lean more to tightening.
But these aren’t normal times, as far as the Fed is concerned.
And if anyone needed a reminder, President Donald Trump tweeted before the release of the numbers, again demanding rate cuts and criticizing Fed Chairman Jerome Powell. (This came a day after Trump tweeted about “great” jobs numbers from ADP (NASDAQ:ADP) and might have tipped those watching that the headline number would arrive below expectations.)
The Fed “were WAY too early to raise, and Way too late to cut” he tweeted, and added “Where did I find this guy Jerome?”
The markets seem pretty sure that nothing has really changed from yesterday and that Trump will get his cut at the FOMC meeting later this month.
Fed fund futures are pricing in a 92% chance of a quarter-point cut, just a tad lower than when the jobs report came out, according to Investing.com’s Fed Rate Monitor Tool.

The S&P 500 was flat in early trading.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. job growth slowed more than expected in August, with retail hiring declining for a seventh straight month, but strong wage gains should support consumer spending and keep the economy expanding moderately amid rising threats from trade tensions.
The Labor Department's closely watched monthly employment report on Friday also showed a rebound in the workweek as manufacturers increased hours for workers after slashing them in July. The economy's waning fortunes, underscored by an inversion of the U.S. Treasury yield curve, have been largely blamed on the White House's year-long trade war with China. 
Washington and Beijing slapped fresh tariffs on each other on Sunday. While the two economic giants on Thursday agreed to hold high-level talks in early October in Washington, the uncertainty, which has eroded business confidence, lingers.
The economy is also facing headwinds from Britain's potentially disorderly exit from the European Union, and softening growth in China and the rest of the world. 
The Federal Reserve is expected to cut interest rates again this month to keep the longest economic expansion in history, now in its 11th year, on track. The U.S. central bank lowered borrowing costs in July for the first time since 2008.
""It is consistent with slowing U.S. growth,"" said Brian Coulton, Chief Economist at Fitch Ratings in New York. ""But it doesn't look anything like impending recession territory.""
Nonfarm payrolls increased by 130,000 jobs last month, the government said. The economy created 20,000 fewer jobs in June and July than previously reported. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast payrolls rising by 158,000 jobs in August.
A seasonal quirk could account for last month's less-than-expected increase in employment. Over the past several years, the initial August job count has tended to exhibit a weak bias, with revisions subsequently showing strength.
But slower job growth is also in line with sharp declines in both the Institute for Supply Management's manufacturing and services industries employment measures in August. In addition, global outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas reported a 37.7% rise in planned job cuts by U.S-based employers in August.
Job gains have averaged 156,000 over the last three months, still above the roughly 100,000 per month needed to keep up with growth in the working age population. The unemployment rate was unchanged at 3.7% for a third straight month in August as 571,000 people entered the labor force. 
The dollar pared losses against a basket of currencies after the report, while U.S. Treasury yields fell. U.S. stock futures trimmed gains. 
Job growth has been slowing since mid-2018. Economists say it is unclear whether the loss of momentum in hiring was due to ebbing demand for labor or a shortage of qualified workers.
The government last month estimated that the economy created 501,000 fewer jobs in the 12 months through March 2019 than previously reported, the biggest downward revision in the level of employment in a decade. That suggests job growth over that period averaged around 170,000 per month instead of 210,000. 
The revised payrolls data will be published next February. The government has also trimmed economic growth for the second quarter. But there was some good news in the employment report.
MANUFACTURING STRUGGLING
Average hourly earnings gained 0.4% last month, the largest increase since February, after rising 0.3% in July. But the annual increase in wages dipped to 3.2% from 3.3% in July as last year's surge dropped out of the calculation. 
Wage growth has held at or above 3.0% for 13 straight month, helping to drive consumer spending and the economy. 
The workweek rebounded after dropping to its lowest level in nearly two years in July. The average workweek rose to 34.4 hours in August from 34.3 hours in July. A measure of hours worked, which is a proxy for gross domestic product, increased 0.4% after falling 0.2% in July.
The labor force participation rate, or the proportion of working-age Americans who have a job or are looking for one, increased to 63.2% last month from 63.0% in July.
A broader measure of unemployment, which includes people who want to work but have given up searching and those working part-time because they cannot find full-time employment, rose to 7.2% from a more than 18-year low of 7.0% in July. 
The slowdown in hiring last month was across all sectors, with the exception of government, which was boosted by recruitment for the 2020 Census. 
Private payrolls rose by only 96,000 jobs in August. Leading the slowdown was manufacturing, where employment rose by a tepid 3,000 jobs last month after increasing 4,000 in July. The weakness was flagged by the report on Tuesday from the ISM showing its gauge of factory employment dropped in August to its lowest level since March 2016.
Manufacturing has ironically borne the brunt of the Trump administration's trade war, which the White House has argued is intended to boost the sector. 
Employment growth in manufacturing has averaged 6,000 jobs per month this year compared with 22,000 in 2018. The manufacturing workweek rose 0.2 hours to 40.6 hours in August, but factories continued to reduce overtime for workers. Factory overtime fell by 0.1 hour to 3.2 hours.
Construction payrolls increased by 14,000 jobs last month after slipping by 2,000 in July. Retail employment dropped by 11,100 jobs, extending a decline that started in February.

Government employment jumped by 34,000 jobs, boosted by the temporary hiring of 25,000 workers for the 2020 decennial census. Professional and business services employment increased by 37,000 jobs last month. There were also gains in healthcare, leisure and hospitality, financial activities and wholesale trade employment. But utilities payrolls fell.

571,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 06, 2019 10:26AM ET</span>","Russian central bank cuts key rate to 7%, says more cuts possible","By Andrey Ostroukh
MOSCOW (Reuters) - The Russian central bank cut its key interest rate to 7% on Friday, lowering the cost of borrowing for the third time this year, and said another rate cut was possible at one of the next three board meetings.
The rate cut comes amid slowing inflation - the central bank's key area of responsibility - and sluggish economic growth, which prompted the central bank to lower its gross domestic product forecasts.
A majority of 25 analysts and economists who took part in a Reuters poll had predicted the central bank would trim the rate by 25 basis points.
The move takes the key rate to the upper boundary of the 6%-7% range that the central bank sees as neutral from the point of view of its monetary policy, which is aimed at keeping annual consumer inflation near its 4% target.
Inflation has already slowed to 4.3% in August, prompting the central bank to lower its year-end inflation forecast to 4.0%-4.5% from 4.2%-4.7%.
Governor Elvira Nabiullina, presenting the rate decision, said the central bank will consider lowering the key rate again soon, declining to comment on whether that the bank may be ready to trim the rate both at its next board meeting in October and then in December.
""A lowering of the key rate is likely at one of the upcoming meetings,"" Nabiullina said.
Nabiullina cemented expectations of rate cuts earlier this year when she told Reuters the bank would like to complete the rate-cutting cycle by mid-2020, trimming the key rate in small steps.
The rouble firmed after the rate cut to 65.71 versus the dollar as of 1335 GMT from a level of around 66 versus the dollar seen before the rate cut .
The central bank on Friday also revised its forecasts, lowering its 2019 economic growth projection to 0.8%-1.3% from an earlier expected 1.0%-1.5%.
""An important external factor is a slowdown in growth of the global economy, which has proven more tangible than expected due to, among other things, the growing contradictions in international trade,"" Nabiullina said of risks to the Russian economy.
Analysts took the central bank's message as an indication that it will lower its main interest rate but not aggressively.
""We think the CBR is hinting that the pace of easing will slow – it won't cut at every upcoming meeting – rather than that it is bringing the easing cycle to an end,"" Capital Economics research firm said in a note.
""We expect the key rate to be lowered to 6.75% in December and to 6.5% by the end of the first quarter of 2020,"" said Alexander Isakov, economist at VTB Capital.
The next rate-setting meeting is scheduled for Oct. 25."

Prices measured by the benchmark IPCA index , rose 0.11% in August, government statistics agency IBGE said on Friday, in line with forecasts in a Reuters poll.
Inflation was 3.43% in the 12 months through August, up from 3.22% in the previous month but still well below the central bank's annual target of 4.25%.
Central bank chief Roberto Campos Neto said on Thursday that inflation is well-anchored over the short-, medium- and long-term horizons, giving room to reduce interest rates further.
In July, the central bank cut its benchmark rate to a record low of 6.00%, an aggressive first move in a widely expected easing cycle and leaving the door open for more.
The bank's monetary policy committee, known as Copom, is widely expected to make another cut at its next rate-setting meeting, which concludes on Sept. 18.

The benchmark rate was cut to 7% from 7.25%, according to a statement published on Friday. The move to the lowest level since March 2014 was forecast by 33 economists out of 35 in a Bloomberg survey, with one analyst forecasting a bigger cut and one expecting no change.
“If the situation develops in line with the baseline forecast, the Bank of Russia will consider the necessity of a further key rate reduction at one of the upcoming board of directors’ meetings,” the central bank said in a statement.
Bank of Russia Governor Elvira Nabiullina will hold a news conference at 3pm in Moscow.
The central bank renewed its easing cycle in June after a couple of rate hikes last year to stem risks to inflation from a tax rise. Some economists had suggested recent ruble weakness and proposals for an increase in spending may limit easing going forward.
Key Insights
Inflation is decelerating faster than expected this year, aided by an early harvest and weak consumer demand.Economy Minister Maxim (NASDAQ:MXIM) Oreshkin has called for more easing to stimulate growth, which slipped to 0.7% in the first half. He has warned inflation could drop as low as 3% at the beginning of 2020.The government plans to accelerate spending on infrastructure projects by the end of this year, which could spur inflation. An additional proposal to spend the liquid part of the country’s national wealth fund has drawn warnings from central bank.The ruble has dropped more than 4% since the last rate decision on July 26. Further weakness may stall easing before the end of the year.This rate cut was already priced in by bond investors and Russia’s still relatively high real interest rate means it won’t significantly diminish the appeal of ruble bonds."

The EU statistics agency Eurostat said the euro zone's gross domestic product expanded by 0.2% in the second quarter, after a 0.4% expansion in the first three months of the year.
The data matched Eurostat's earlier estimates and market expectations, confirming a gloomy outlook for the 19-nation currency bloc which is facing twin threats and uncertainty over Brexit and global trade wars.
Trade as a whole slowed during the quarter, as imports grew less than in the first quarter and exports were flat after a 0.9% growth in the previous quarter. Overall, trade contributed a negative 0.1 percentage point to the GDP figure.

BERLIN (Reuters) - German industrial output unexpectedly fell in July, adding to signs that struggling manufacturers could tip Europe's biggest economy into a recession in the third quarter and supporting the case for the European Central Bank to take action next week.
Industrial output fell by 0.6% on the month, figures released by the Statistics Office showed, bucking expectations for a rise of 0.3%. The drop was driven by a decline in the production of capital goods.
""A recession in the industrial sector will continue,"" Bankhaus Lampe economist Alexander Krueger said. ""That firms up the prospects of a technical recession.""
Economists generally define a technical recession as at least two consecutive quarters of contraction.
June's output reading was revised to a fall of 1.1% from a previously reported 1.5% fall.
Germany's export-reliant economy is suffering from slower global growth and business uncertainty caused by U.S. President Donald Trump's 'America First' trade policies and Britain's planned, but delayed, exit from the European Union.

But the weak output data reinforce the case for the ECB to take fresh action at its Sept. 12 policy meeting. The central bank has all but promised a stimulus package at the meeting and market expectations have been growing as Germany slows.
UNFOLDING NIGHTMARE
Official data published on Thursday showed weaker demand from abroad drove a bigger-than-expected drop in German industrial orders in July.
Germany's gross domestic product contracted by 0.1% quarter-on-quarter in the second quarter on weaker exports, with the decrease in foreign sales mainly driven by Britain and below-average demand from China.
A run of weak data since then has fueled concerns that the economy could tip into recession in the July-September period.
""The nightmare is now unfolding, and it can't be shaken off,"" Thomas Gitzel, economist at VP Bank Group, said after Friday's data.
Labour market data showed last week that seasonally adjusted unemployment rose in August, eroding a pillar of growth that has helped support Germany's traditionally export-driven economy.
With its sales abroad hit by a worsening trade climate, a global economic slowdown and the increasingly chaotic run-up to Brexit, the bulk of Germany's growth momentum is now being generated domestically -- a dependency that leaves it exposed to any weakening of the jobs market.
Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) Chief Financial Officer Stephen Scherr said on Thursday that the German economy is in the ""early days of a slowdown"".

The government expects economic growth to slow to 0.5% this year from 1.5% in the previous year. This would be the weakest expansion since 2013 when the euro zone struggled amid a sovereign debt crisis.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. services sector activity accelerated in August and private employers boosted hiring, suggesting the economy continued to grow at a moderate pace despite trade tensions which have stoked financial market fears of a recession.
The upbeat reports on Thursday took some of the sting from data this week that showed the manufacturing sector contracted for the first time in August as the year-old trade war between the United States and China intensified. 
But given the erosion of business confidence as a result of the trade impasse and the threat it poses to the longest economic expansion in history, the Federal Reserve is still expected to cut interest rates again this month. 
The U.S. central bank lowered borrowing costs in July, citing growing risks to the economy, now in its 11th year of expansion, from the trade fight and slowing global growth. China and the United States on Thursday agreed to hold high-level trade talks in early October in Washington, according to the Chinese commerce ministry. 
""It's tale of two cities in this economy faced with trade war uncertainty, and right now the bigger services economy is weathering the storm,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG in New York. ""Don't count the economy out yet.""
The Institute for Supply Management said its non-manufacturing activity index increased to a reading of 56.4 in August from 53.7 in July. A reading above 50 indicates expansion in the sector, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity. 
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the index would rise to 54.0 in August. The ISM said businesses ""remain concerned about tariffs and geopolitical uncertainty,"" but also noted ""they are mostly positive about business conditions."" 
The reports and news that Washington and Beijing had agreed to resume trade talks next month propelled U.S. stock indexes to more than a one-month high. U.S. Treasury prices fell and the dollar slipped against a basket of currencies.
STRONG LABOR MARKET
The Atlanta Fed is forecasting the economy will grow at a 1.5% annualized rate in the third quarter, slowing down from a 2.0% pace in the April-June period.
August's surge in services industry activity reflected increases in measures of production and new orders. Export orders, however, fell as did imports. The ISM said 16 service industries, including retail trade, utilities and public administration, reported growth last month. Wholesale trade was the only industry reporting a decrease in growth. 
But a gauge of services industry employment dropped to 53.1, the lowest level since March 2017, from 56.2 in July. 
That, together with a contraction in manufacturing employment, suggests nonfarm payrolls probably increased at a steady clip in August, even though the ADP (NASDAQ:ADP) National Employment Report on Thursday showed private payrolls surging by 195,000 jobs this month after rising by 142,000 in July.
The ADP report, which is jointly developed with Moody's Analytics, came ahead of the release of the government's more comprehensive employment report on Friday.
The ADP report, however, has a poor record forecasting the private payrolls component of the government's employment report because of differences in methodology. Given that August payrolls have a tendency to undershoot expectations, the ADP report did not change economists' forecasts for steady gains.
""While we don't think that the government data will be as strong as the ADP data, the strength in the ADP report eases some concerns about downside risks in the labor market associated with the recent drop in business sentiment,"" said Daniel Silver, an economist at JP Morgan in New York.
According to a Reuters survey of economists, nonfarm payrolls probably increased by 158,000 jobs last month after rising by 164,000 in July. Job growth has slowed from an average of 223,000 per month in 2018. 
But the pace of employment gains remains well above the roughly 100,000 jobs needed per month to keep up with growth in the working-age population. The unemployment rate is expected to have held at 3.7% in August for a third straight month.
Labor market resilience was also underscored by a third report from the Labor Department on Thursday which showed initial claims for state unemployment benefits increased 1,000 to a seasonally adjusted 217,000 for the week ended Aug. 31.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast claims would be unchanged at 215,000 in the latest week.

WASHINGTON, Sept 5 (Reuters) - U.S. worker productivity slowed in the second quarter, the government confirmed on Thursday, as productivity in the manufacturing sector declined by the most in nearly two years.
The Labor Department said nonfarm productivity, which measures hourly output per worker, increased at an unrevised 2.3% annualized rate in the last quarter.
Productivity also rose at an unrevised 3.5% rate in the first quarter. Economists polled by Reuters had expected second-quarter productivity would be revised down to a 2.2% rate.
Manufacturing productivity fell at a 2.2% rate in the second quarter, instead of the 1.6% pace estimated last month. That was the weakest since the third quarter of 2017 and followed a 1.2% pace of increase in the first three months of the year.
The moderate growth in overall productivity was flagged by a deceleration in gross domestic product growth in the April-June period. The economy grew at a 2.0% rate in the second quarter after expanding at a 3.1% pace in the first quarter.
Compared to the second quarter of 2018, productivity increased at a rate of 1.8% as reported last month.
Unit labor costs, the price of labor per single unit of output, rose at a 2.6% rate in the second quarter, rather than the previously estimated 2.4% pace. Unit labor costs surged at a 5.7% rate in the first quarter.
Compared to the second quarter of 2018, labor costs rose at a 2.6% rate, instead of the 2.5% pace reported last month, suggesting inflation could remain moderate.
Hourly compensation was revised slightly up to show it increasing at a 4.9% pace, rather than at a 4.8% pace. Hourly compensation increased at a 4.4% rate compared to the second quarter of 2018. It was previously estimated to have risen at a 4.3% pace.
Hours worked dropped at an unrevised 0.4% rate, the biggest decline since the third quarter of 2009. Hours worked rose at a 0.4% pace in the first quarter. They increased at a 0.9% rate compared to the second quarter of 2018."

Initial claims for state unemployment benefits increased 1,000 to a seasonally adjusted 217,000 for the week ended Aug. 31, the Labor Department said on Thursday. Data for the prior week was revised to show 1,000 more applications received than previously reported.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast claims would be unchanged at 215,000 in the latest week. The Labor Department said claims for California, Hawaii, Kansas, Puerto Rico and Virginia were estimated last week because of Monday's Labor Day holiday.
The four-week moving average of initial claims, considered a better measure of labor market trends as it irons out week-to-week volatility, rose 1,500 to 216,250 last week.
Layoffs have remained low despite the year-long trade war between the United States and China, which is weighing on business investment and manufacturing and threatening the longest economic expansion in history.
The claims data has no bearing on August's employment report, which is scheduled for release on Friday. According to a Reuters survey of economists, nonfarm payrolls likely increased by 159,000 jobs last month after rising by 164,000 in July.
Job growth has slowed from an average of 223,000 per month in 2018. But the pace of employment gains remains well above the roughly 100,000 jobs needed per month to keep up with growth in the working-age population. The unemployment rate is expected to have held at 3.7% in August for a third straight month.
Labor market strength is supporting the economy, now in its 11th year of expansion, through strong consumer spending.
Thursday's claims report also showed the number of people receiving benefits after an initial week of aid dropped 39,000 to 1.66 million for the week ended Aug. 24. The four-week moving average of the so-called continuing claims fell 6,250 to 1.69 million."

BERLIN (Reuters) - Weaker demand from abroad drove a bigger-than-expected drop in German industrial orders in July, suggesting that struggling manufacturers could tip Europe's biggest economy into a recession in the third quarter.
Germany's export-reliant economy is suffering from slower global growth and business uncertainty caused by U.S. President Donald Trump's 'America First' trade policies and Britain's planned, but delayed, exit from the European Union.
Contracts for 'Made in Germany' goods fell 2.7% from the previous month in July, data showed on Thursday, driven by a big drop in bookings from non-euro zone countries, the economy ministry said. That undershot a Reuters consensus forecast for a 1.5% drop.
""The misery in manufacturing continues. The decline in new orders significantly increases the risk of a recession for the German economy,"" VP Bank analyst Thomas Gitzel said.
Germany's gross domestic product contracted by 0.1% quarter-on-quarter in the second quarter on weaker exports, with the decrease in foreign sales mainly driven by Britain and below average demand from China.
""The danger is great that negative growth will also be recorded in the third quarter,"" Gitzel added.
The economy ministry said new orders in manufacturing had a weak start to the third quarter and that the outlook for the sector was also looking grim.
""In light of still unresolved international trade conflicts and muted business expectations in manufacturing, there are still no signs of a fundamental improvement in the industrial sector in the coming months,"" the ministry added.
Orders from non-euro zone countries plunged nearly 7% on the month while demand from other euro zone countries and domestic bookings rose slightly, the data showed.
Without the distorting effects of bulk orders, industrial orders rose 0.5% on the month in July, the ministry added.
The overall reading for June was revised up to an increase of 2.7 from a previously reported 2.5% increase.
LITTLE LIGHT 
The VDMA business association said engineering orders in July fell by 3% in real terms from the previous year, driven by weaker demand from both domestic and foreign clients.
""The business and export outlook is still gloomy for the second half of the year given the economic and political risks,"" VDMA chief economist Ralph Wiechers said.
Germany's DIHK business association said that companies around the globe were reluctant to invest due to slowing world trade and growing business uncertainty.
""So there is little light on the horizon for German industry which is characterized by its large share of capital goods producers,"" DIHK economist Kevin Heidenreich.
Carsten Brzeski from ING noted that the downward trend in manufacturing was not only driven by weaker foreign demand and trade conflicts.
""Since the start of the year, domestic orders have actually dropped more than foreign orders, suggesting that global woes have reached the domestic economy,"" Brzeski added.
Labor market data showed last week that seasonally adjusted unemployment rose in August, eroding a pillar of growth that has helped support Germany's traditionally export-driven economy.
With its sales abroad hit by a worsening trade climate, a global economic slowdown and the increasingly chaotic run-up to Brexit, the bulk of Germany's growth momentum is now being generated domestically - a dependency that leaves it exposed to any weakening of the jobs market.
Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) Chief Financial Officer Stephen Scherr said on Thursday that the German economy is in the ""early days of a slowdown"".

The government expects economic growth to slow to 0.5% this year from 1.5% in the previous year. This would be the weakest expansion since 2013 when the euro zone struggled amid a sovereign debt crisis.

FAO,"ROME (Reuters) - World food prices fell for a third month running in August, pushed down by a sharp drop in the prices of sugar, wheat and maize, the United Nations food agency said on Thursday.
The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) food price index, which measures monthly changes for a basket of cereals, oilseeds, dairy products, meat and sugar, averaged 169.8 points last month from an upwardly revised 171.7 points in July.
That figure was previously given as 170.9.
FAO also predicted that cereal supplies would be more abundant in the 2019/20 period than previously expected.
The FAO cereal price index plunged 6.4% in August month-on-month thanks to big drops in the prices of wheat and major course grains, especially maize. By contrast, rice prices rose.
Sugar prices also fell markedly in August, dropping 4% on the previous month ""largely on the back of a weakening Brazilian real, which tends to incentivize sugar exports,"" FAO said.
These drops failed to offset climbs in other indices, with the vegetable oil price index gaining 5.9% and both meat and dairy prices posting increases of 0.5%.
FAO said global cereal supplies in 2019/20 were expected to be higher than previously anticipated at 2.708 billion tonnes, up 23 million tonnes on the last estimate posted in July and some 55.4 million tonnes up on 2018 levels.
""Almost the entire monthly increase is on account of an upward revision made to the forecast for world maize production,"" FAO said.
""These more buoyant expectations mostly stem from improved yield prospects in the United States, despite excessive rainfall through much of the planting season.""
This expected increase outweighed an anticipated reduction in global wheat production in 2019, which FAO now sees at 767 million tonnes, 4 million tonnes lower than in the last forecast posted in July."

The Make UK/BDO report showed investment intentions turned negative for the first time in three years.
""Ominously, companies are cutting back on investment in transport equipment, factory machinery, and IT, just at the point in the economic cycle when spending would normally increase,"" the report said.

The Washington-based industry group's seasonally adjusted index on mortgage activity fell 3.1% to 558.5 in the week ended Aug. 30. It reached a three-year high in early August.
The average interest rate for 30-year fixed-rate mortgages, with conforming loan balances of $484,350 or less, decreased to 3.87%, which was the lowest since November 2016. It stood at 3.94% the week before.
Other mortgage rates MBA tracks were mixed.
""Consumers continue to act on these lower rates, but the volatility in the market is likely leading some borrowers to pause refinancing and buying decisions,” Joel Kan, MBA’s associate vice president of economic and industry forecasting, said in a statement.
The trade conflict between China and United States has shaken investor confidence, sparking a rush for U.S. Treasuries and other low-risk assets. This move pushed U.S. 30-year yields (US30YT=RR) to record lows a week ago.
MBA's seasonally adjusted index on home refinancing fell 7.0% to 2,367.2 last week. It was 152% higher than a year ago.

593,By Bloomberg,"<span>Sep 04, 2019 10:27AM ET</span>","Bank of Canada Holds Rates Steady, Even Amid Global Easing Trend","(Bloomberg) --
The Bank of Canada left interest rates unchanged for a seventh straight decision and held off from signaling explicitly any immediate need to cut them.
At a rate decision Wednesday, policy makers said the escalating trade war between China and the U.S. has undermined global economic momentum more than projected in July. At the same time, growth in Canada so far has been stronger than expected and inflation on target, suggesting current levels of stimulus are where they should be, they said.
“In sum, Canada's economy is operating close to potential and inflation is on target. However, escalating trade conflicts and related uncertainty are taking a toll on the global and Canadian economies,” the central bank said in its statement. “In this context, the current degree of monetary policy stimulus remains appropriate.”
The Bank of Canada’s reluctance to signal a greater willingness to cut rates may come as a surprise to some investors and analysts who had been expecting more dovish language.
Wednesday's narrative does emphasize trade risks and reiterates that Canadian growth is likely to slow in the second half of this year -- all of which suggests policy makers are far from confident about the economic outlook and could be keeping the door open for cuts if things worsen.
But the net effect of the statement is a continuation -- at least explicitly -- of the central bank's reluctance to show its hand on whether it plans to join other central banks like the Federal Reserve in easing policy, preferring instead to wait for more concrete signs of weakness before moving.
Risky Strategy
It’s a risky strategy that could backfire if policy makers are late to recognize spillover effects on businesses and households, particularly since the country’s outlier status on policy could fuel gains in the Canadian dollar.
Bank of Canada officials said they will pay close attention to “global developments and their impacts on the outlook for Canadian growth and inflation.”
The case for cheaper money isn’t as compelling in Canada as it is elsewhere. A strong run of economic data affords the Bank of Canada opportunity to resist -- as it has so far -- the dovish turn in global policy.
Interest rates also remain stimulative in real terms, and borrowing costs have already declined sharply in the country because of falling global bond yields -- a development the Bank of Canada cited in its statement. But escalating tensions between China and the U.S. are getting tougher to overlook. Trump’s tariffs on imports from China have already become a major reason behind global factory weakness.
The Bank of Canada characterized Canadian second quarter growth of 3.7% annualized as “strong” but noted some of the strength was probably temporary and pointed out that consumption spending was unexpectedly soft.

The nation’s merchandise trade gap hit C$1.12 billion ($840,000 million) in July, Statistics Canada said Wednesday from Ottawa. Economists surveyed by Bloomberg were expecting a deficit of C$350 million.Exports fell 0.9%, led lower by a 6.7% decline in energy shipments. Crude oil exports pulled back 7.7%. And stripping away price effects, exports edged down 0.1% on the month.While economic growth in Canada led the Group of Seven in the second quarter, the expansion was driven primarily by a rebound in oil exports after a half year of dismal growth. Rising global uncertainty amid the escalating trade war between the U.S. and China threatens the northern nation’s export prospects, a topic likely to be addressed by the Bank of Canada at its rate decision later Wednesday morning.
Canada’s trade surplus with the U.S., its largest trading partner, narrowed to C$4.6 billion in July, as exports declined 1.1%. Exports to China fell 15.5% amid a lingering diplomatic dispute stemming from Canada’s arrest of a top Huawei Technologies Co. Ltd. executive on an American extradition request.On the import side, puchases from abroad rose 1.2%, led by consumer goods. Volumes were up by 2.3% -- the largest increase since last March. While that underlying strength in imports has the potential to drag on gross domestic product in the third quarter, it could also be a sign of firming domestic demand.June’s trade balance was revised to a deficit C$55 million, after an initially reported surplus of C$136 million, the statistics agency said."

(Bloomberg) --
U.S. exports of goods to the Asian nation fell 2.7% from the prior month while imports declined 1.9%, narrowing the trade gap between the countries to a seasonally adjusted $29.6 billion, according to data Wednesday from the Commerce Department. The overall U.S. deficit in goods and services trade shrank by less than estimated to $54 billion, a three-month low.
China, the largest U.S. trading partner last year, has fallen behind both Mexico and Canada in 2019 amid the increasing tariffs and heightened uncertainty about when -- or if -- the trade war will be resolved. The conflict has muddled companies' supply chains and stymied plans for capital investment, with U.S. manufacturing in a recession in the first half and rising concern that a broader downturn is coming.
On top of that, a strong dollar and a weakening global outlook continue to damp demand for U.S. exports more broadly, though steady consumer spending is supporting imports.
While trade with China declined, U.S. merchandise imports and exports with Canada and Mexico were relatively little changed on the month.
The U.S.-China trade picture looked much different in July from now. Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping declared a tentative truce in late June, and U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin traveled to China for negotiations at the end of July.
Swift Escalation
But the trade war escalated swiftly afterward as Trump announced tariffs on an additional batch of Chinese goods, then increased those levies before they took effect. A 15% U.S. tariff on about $112 billion in Chinese products began Sept. 1, joining the existing 25% tax on about $250 billion in other goods. A separate set of about $160 billion in Chinese merchandise will be hit by a 15% levy on Dec. 15.
Chinese and U.S. officials had yet to agree on a date for a visit to Washington this month, and the two countries still have not agreed on basic terms of re-engagement, according to reporting by Bloomberg News earlier this week.
So far this year, the U.S. merchandise deficit with China -- which Trump sees as an indicator the Asian nation is taking advantage of America -- has narrowed to a seasonally adjusted $209.5 billion from $234.9 billion in the same seven months of 2018. Exports have dropped 17.3% while imports have tumbled 12.4%.
Overall U.S. exports of goods and services rose 0.6% in July from the prior month to $207.4 billion, with gains in consumer goods, capital goods and autos. Imports fell 0.1% to $261.4 billion, with shipments of capital goods at the lowest since October 2017 amid declines in computers and semiconductors.
On an unadjusted basis, the goods deficit with the European Union was a record $20.1 billion in July, driven by an all-time high in imports, according to the report. That may give Trump more fodder for his repeated statements that the dollar is too strong against the euro and the Federal Reserve needs to cut interest rates more aggressively.
Net exports subtracted 0.72 percentage points from the annualized pace of gross domestic product growth in the second quarter as the trade deficit widened.
Get More

The median estimate of economists surveyed by Bloomberg called for the overall trade deficit to narrow to $53.4 billion.
After adjusting for inflation, which renders the numbers used to calculate gross domestic product, the goods trade deficit narrowed to $85.5 billion from $86.2 billion in the prior month. 
The real petroleum gap increased to $9.3 billion from $5.8 billion as exports fell and imports rose. Excluding petroleum, the goods trade deficit shrank to $71.5 billion.
Exports and imports of goods account for about three- fourths of America’s total trade; the U.S. typically runs a deficit in merchandise trade and a surplus in services.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. trade deficit narrowed slightly in July, but the gap with China, a focus of the Trump administration's ""America First"" agenda, surged to a six-month high.
The report from the Commerce Department on Wednesday came against the backdrop of an escalation in the trade war between the United States and China. The two economic giants slapped fresh tariffs on each other on Sunday, fanning fears of a global recession. President Donald Trump on Tuesday warned he would be ""tougher"" on Beijing in a second term if trade talks dragged on.
The Commerce Department said the trade deficit dropped 2.7% to $54.0 billion as exports rebounded and imports fell. Data for June was revised down to show the trade gap shrinking to $55.5 billion instead of the previously reported $55.2 billion.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the trade gap narrowing to $53.5 billion in July. 
The politically sensitive goods trade deficit with China increased 9.4% to $32.8 billion, with imports jumping 6.4%. Exports to China fell 3.3% in July. The goods trade deficit with the European Union jumped to a record high, with the shortfall with Germany the largest since August 2015.
Washington imposed 15% tariffs on more than $125 billion in Chinese imports, including smart speakers, Bluetooth headphones and clothing. In retaliation, China slapped additional duties on some of the U.S. goods on a $75 billion target list, including a 5% tariff on crude oil. Additional tariffs are due in December.
The trade tensions have rattled financial markets and triggered a global manufacturing recession. 
U.S. financial markets were little moved by the trade data.
EXPORTS REBOUND 
In July, goods exports increased 0.9% to $138.2 billion. But with China imposing additional tariffs on U.S. soybeans, beef and pork, exports are likely to decline in the months ahead. China's commerce ministry said in early August that Chinese companies had stopped buying U.S. farm products.
A survey of manufacturers on Tuesday showed a measure of export orders received by factories plummeted in August to the lowest level since April 2009. 
In July, exports were boosted by consumer goods, which increased $1.5 billion. Capital goods exports rose $0.8 billion. There were also increases in exports of motor vehicles. Exports of industrial supplies and materials, however, decreased $1.7 billion, with shipments of crude oil falling $0.5 billion.
Goods imports dropped 0.2% to $211.8 billion. Economists believe imports rebounded in August as businesses probably stocked up on Chinese goods following the announcement of further tariffs. 
The U.S.-China trade tensions have caused wild swings in the trade deficit, with exporters and importers trying to stay ahead of the tariff fight between the two economic giants. 
The import bill was pulled down by a $1.5 billion decline in capital goods imports. The drop in capital goods imports suggests business investment could remain weak in the third quarter after contracting in the April-June period for the first time in three years.
But imports of industrial supplies and materials rose $0.9 billion, with petroleum products imports increasing $1.0 billion. Imports from the European Union were the highest on record in July.
When adjusted for inflation, the goods trade deficit fell $0.7 billion to $85.5 billion in July. The so-called real trade deficit is slightly above the second-quarter average, suggesting trade could again weigh on gross domestic product this quarter.
Trade subtracted 0.72 percentage point from GDP in the second quarter. The economy grew at a 2.0% annualized rate in the last quarter, slowing from the first quarter's brisk 3.1% rate. The Atlanta Federal Reserve is forecasting the economy growing at a 1.7% pace in the third quarter.

In July, the services surplus decreased $0.1 billion to $19.7 billion, the lowest level since February 2016, as imports of services hit a record high.

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's economy is in serious danger of entering its first recession since the financial crisis as business confidence wilts in the Brexit chaos, a closely watched business survey showed on Wednesday.
Growth in Britain's dominant services sector slowed to a crawl in August and business expectations were at their lowest in more than three years, according to the IHS Markit/CIPS UK Services Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI).
Its headline reading fell to 50.6 from 51.4 in July -- barely above the 50 barrier between growth and contraction. A Reuters poll of economists had pointed to a reading of 51.0. 
The survey added to questions over Britain's ability to bounce back from an economic contraction in the second quarter when a hangover from the stockpiling boom before the original Brexit deadline in March hit output.
PMI compiler IHS Markit said the overall economy looked on track to shrink again in the July-September period at a quarterly rate of 0.1% -- a result that would officially herald a recession.
Signs the economy is fading will raise the stakes in the political crisis gripping Britain. 
Prime Minister Boris Johnson will try to call a snap election on Wednesday after lawmakers seeking to prevent him taking Britain out of the European Union without a divorce deal dealt him a humbling parliamentary defeat.
""A lot will hinge on the events today in Westminster, but the bottom line is that risk of a 'no deal' Brexit on 31 October is unlikely to fade completely after this week. This will continue to keep the pressure on underlying growth,"" ING economist James Smith said.
(Graphic: UK economy stalling ahead of Brexit - PMI link: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/polling/1/609/605/services%20p.png)
August marked the eighth month running in which the British composite PMI, covering both the manufacturing and services sectors, has underperformed the euro zone equivalent. 
The British PMI's gauge of optimism in the services sector fell to its lowest level since July 2016, the month just after the Brexit vote, while growth in new orders slowed sharply.
Some economists say surveys like the PMIs tend to overstate the extent of upturns and downturns, but they are nonetheless closely watched by the Bank of England as early indicators of moves in the wider economy.
""The PMIs are excessively influenced by business sentiment and have given a misleadingly weak steer during the past 12 months of heightened political uncertainty,"" said Samuel Tombs, economist at consultancy Pantheon Economics.
BoE Governor Mark Carney and other members of the Monetary Policy Committee are due to answer questions from lawmakers at 1315 GMT.
JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) said the weakening data could prompt the BoE to consider whether it might need to cut interest rates in scenarios other than a no-deal Brexit, such as an extension of the Brexit deadline with no clarity on what happens next.

""We do not yet expect the BoE to signal a significant shift in tone while the question of the timing and outcome of a snap election is still up in the air. But the odds of a BoE cut this year -- even if no-deal is avoided -- are going up,"" said JPMorgan economist Allan Monks in a note to clients.

IHS Markit's Euro Zone Composite Final Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI), considered a good gauge of overall economic health, nudged up 51.9 in August from July's 51.5.
That pipped a preliminary reading of 51.8 but held dangerously close to the 50 mark separating growth from contraction.
""The euro zone remained mired in a fragile state of weak and unbalanced growth in August,"" said Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit.
Williamson said the PMI, barring any substantial change in September, pointed to economic growth of just 0.2% this quarter, matching the forecast in a Reuters poll. He noted official data suggested growth could be even weaker.
A sister survey released on Monday showed manufacturing activity contracted for a seventh month in August but Wednesday's release showed services growth accelerated. The PMI rose to 53.5 from July's 53.2, above the flash 53.4 reading.
""The big question is how long this divergence can persist before the weakness of the manufacturing sector spreads to services and households,"" Williamson said.
Forward-looking indicators for the services survey suggest not long. Hiring was curtailed, backlogs of work were run down and optimism was its weakest in nearly five years.
The services employment sub-index dipped to 53.2 from 53.5, the lowest since the start of the year, and an overall future output sub-index dropped to a more than six-year low of 55.4 from 58.8."

IHS Markit's final composite Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI), which tracks the manufacturing and services sectors, rose to 51.7 from 50.9 in July.
That was better than the preliminary reading and comfortably above the 50 mark that separates growth from contraction, showing that the robustness of the services sector still helped to offset the prolonged weakness in manufacturing.
""Job creation across the service sector remains a buoyancy aid for the economy, at least for now, while low and potentially easing inflation across the private sector is another supportive factor for domestic demand over the rest of the year,"" said Phil Smith, Principal Economist at IHS Markit.
The PMI for the services sector improved to 54.8 in August from 54.5 in the previous month, the survey showed.
Business morale across the service sector worsened to hit its lowest level in almost five years and the loss of confidence could slow down investment and job creation in coming months.
""The worry was that the weakness in the manufacturing sector would eventually infect the rest of the economy, and the service sector is certainly showing symptoms of the malaise having spread,"" said Phil Smith, Principal Economist at IHS Markit.
The survey showed that many service providers were relying on backlogs of work to sustain growth as new orders weakened to reach their slowest level in seven months, with new work from abroad being particularly sluggish.
Germany's export-reliant economy is suffering from weaker foreign demand and business uncertainty caused by trade disputes and Britain's planned but delayed exit from the European Union.
The government expects growth to slow to 0.5% this year from 1.5% in the previous year."

Data compiler IHS Markit said that its Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) for the service sector rose to 53.4, the highest since November 2018 and up from 52.6 in July.
The result was slightly better than a preliminary reading of 53.3 and also marked the fifth month running that the index was above the key 50-point threshold demarcating an expansion in activity from a contraction.
""The faster expansion at service providers was founded upon solid new order growth and a further increase in employment,"" IHS Markit Eliot Kerr said.
He added that it pointed to a quarterly growth rate of 0.3% in the July-September period, unchanged from the rates seen in the previous two quarters despite slowing activity in much of the euro zone.
Paired with already published data from the manufacturing sector, the improvement in services helped push overall private sector business activity also to the highest level since last November.
IHS Markit's composite PMI index comprising both sectors rose last month to 52.9 from 51.9 in July, which was slightly better than a preliminary reading of 52.7."

The IHS Markit Business Activity Index for services fell to 50.6 in August from 51.7 in July, slipping closer to the 50 threshold that separates growth from contraction.
A Reuters survey of 10 analysts had forecast a reading of 51.6.
The sub-index for new business in the services sector fell to 50.8 from 52.4 in July.
IHS Markit's sister survey for manufacturing, published on Monday, showed activity contracting for an 11th month running in August, but by slightly less than in July.
The composite Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) for services and manufacturing fell in August to 50.3 from 51.0 in July, pointing to marginal economic growth at best.
The Italian economy has been broadly stagnant for the last year. Gross domestic product was flat in the second quarter from the previous three months and was down 0.1% on a year-on-year basis.

Singapore's gross domestic product is expected to increase 0.6% this year, according to the median forecast of 23 economists surveyed by the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) - down from 2.1% in the last MAS survey in June.
Growth of 0.6% would be just inside the upper half of the government’s newly-downgraded forecast range. The Ministry of Trade and Industry cut its range last month to zero to 1%, from its previous 1.5%-2.5% projection.
Singapore has been hit hard by the Sino-U.S. trade war, which has disrupted world supply chains in a blow to business investment and corporate profits.
Final second quarter Singapore GDP data, reported on Aug. 13, showed a 3.3% on-quarter contraction on a seasonally-adjusted annualized basis.
That was a slight decline from the government's advance estimate but deeper than a 2.9% fall predicted in a Reuters poll and a sharp contrast to the robust 3.8% first quarter expansion.
In the new MAS survey, economists slashed forecasts for most key macroeconomic indicators but raised their expectations for the finance, insurance and private consumption sectors.
The survey predicted Singapore's economy would grow 0.3% in the third quarter on an annual basis, up from the 0.1% on-year expansion seen in the second quarter.
For 2020, full-year growth of 1.6% is expected, the survey showed.
Singapore's advance estimate for third quarter GDP growth and MAS semiannual monetary policy statement will be released on the same day in October. The date has not been announced, but will be no later than Oct. 14."

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia's much-vaunted economy grew at its slowest pace in a decade last quarter as cash-strapped consumers went on strike, an urgent argument for more monetary and fiscal stimulus as headwinds mount globally.
Gross domestic product (GDP) rose just 1.4% in the June quarter from a year earlier, data showed on Wednesday, matching the worst of the global financial crisis and well short of the 2.75% considered ""trend"".
The downbeat report poses a challenge for Prime Minster Scott Morrison who won election in May largely based on a pledge that growth would be stronger on his watch.
Yet responding to the data, Treasurer Josh Frydenberg remained committed to delivering a budget surplus and said any new fiscal steps, including on business investment, would not come until the budget in May next year.
The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) has called for fiscal action, as it cut interest rates in both June and July to reach an historic low of 1%.
The monetary easing has sparked a much-needed revival in house prices, but home construction remains in a deep hole and consumer spending has yet to show any recovery.
The central bank concluded its September policy meeting this week by saying it would ease further if needed, and highlighted new risks from the escalating Sino-U.S. trade dispute.
Investors already believe a quarter-point cut by November is a done deal , with another penciled in by March.
""There are powerful structural headwinds from weak wages growth and productivity, constraining consumer spending. The global economy is slowing and downside risks have intensified,"" warned Westpac senior economist Andrew Hanlan.
""The risk is that growth remains below trend over the remainder of 2019 and through 2020.""
Westpac is tipping a rate cut as early as October.
GROWTH NARROWLY BASED
If there was a bright spot in Wednesday's numbers it was that quarterly growth of 0.5% matched market forecasts, when there had been fears it would be even weaker. That was enough to see the local dollar firm slightly to $0.6780 .
Over the year to June, gross domestic product (GDP) amounted to A$1.95 trillion ($1.32 trillion) in current dollars, or about A$77,000 for each of Australia's 25 million citizens.
Yet almost all the growth came from government spending and exports, with domestic consumption hamstrung by miserly wage gains and a sharp downturn in home building.
In all, public spending added 1.3 percentage points to GDP growth in the year to June, with net exports another 1.2 percentage points.
Household consumption, usually a powerhouse of the economy, added a tepid 0.8 percentage points to growth for the entire year, while spending on autos actually sank 7%.
A reversal in a long building boom saw home construction shave half a percentage point from GDP, with other business investment another half a point.
That was a particularly dismal performance given Australia expanded its population by 1.6% for the year, twice the average pace of its developed world peers.
As a result, GDP per person actually shrank 0.2% in the year to June, something typically only associated with recessions.
While households were struggling, Australia's huge mining sector enjoyed a massive profit windfall from high commodity prices and strong Chinese demand.
That helped fatten measures of national income, while boosting nominal GDP growth to a speedy 5.4% annual pace. The latter has been a boon for tax receipts and a potential source of fiscal stimulus."

It is a fresh low for the indicator of manufacturing intentions in data going back to at least September 2016. Figures below 50 indicate contraction.

606,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 03, 2019 10:31PM ET</span>",China service sector activity rises to three-month high-Caixin PMI,"BEIJING (Reuters) - Activity in China’s services sector expanded at the fastest pace in three months in August as new orders rose, prompting the biggest increase in hiring in over a year, a private survey showed on Wednesday.
Stronger job creation by services firms will be welcome news for Beijing, which is struggling to reverse a prolonged slump in the manufacturing sector which has dragged economic growth to near 30-year lows.
The Caixin/Markit services purchasing managers’ index (PMI) picked up to 52.1 last month, the highest since May, compared with July’s 51.6. The index has stayed above the 50-point that separates growth from contraction on a monthly basis since late 2005.
New business accelerated slightly to a four-month high, with companies citing improving underlying demand and a boost from new projects.
But a sub-index for export orders pulled back from July's three-month high, possibly due to heightened U.S.-China trade tensions.
Washington began slapping 15% tariffs on a wide range of Chinese goods on Sunday - including footwear, smart watches and flat-panel televisions. Tariffs of 15% on cellphones, laptop computers, toys and clothing are to take effect on Dec. 15.
The private survey's findings largely dovetailed with an official gauge last week, which also showed improving service sector conditions.
“China’s economy showed clear signs of a recovery in August, especially in the employment sector,” said Zhong Zhengsheng, Director of Macroeconomic Analysis at CEBM Group, in a statement alongside the data.
There were signs that government growth boosting measures were gradually kicking in, Zhong said.
“However, the Sino-U.S. trade conflict remained a drag, and business confidence remained depressed,” Zhong added.
While business optimism for the year ahead improved, the reading was still below levels seen in late 2017 and early 2018 before the two countries began imposing tit-for-tat tariffs.
“Still, there’s no need to be too pessimistic about China’s economy, with the launch of a series of policies to promote high-quality growth,” Zhong said.
So far, Beijing has relied on a combination of fiscal stimulus and monetary easing to cushion the broader economic slowdown, including hundreds of billions of dollars in infrastructure spending and tax cuts for companies.
But those measures have been slow to trickle through the economy, and with U.S. trade pressure intensifying analysts believe a deeper downturn could be inevitable without further policy support.
China rolled out some consumption-boosting measures last month, including the possible removal of curbs on auto purchases, though details were sketchy.
The services sector accounts for over half of China's economy, providing an important buffer to mounting export pressures. But growth has been generally cooling over the past year as businesses and consumers grow more cautious on spending.
Caixin's composite manufacturing and services PMI, also released on Wednesday, ticked up to a four-month high of 51.6 in August from 50.9 in July, though factory orders remained weak."

NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. Treasury yields fell on Tuesday, with the benchmark 10-year yield hitting its lowest since July 2016, after U.S. manufacturing data showed the first contraction since 2016 on worries about a weakening global economy and U.S.-China trade tensions.
The Institute for Supply Management (ISM) said its index of national factory activity decreased in August to 49.1, the lowest since January 2016. A reading below 50 indicates contraction in manufacturing, which accounts for about 12% of the U.S. economy. Last month marked the first time since August 2016 that the index broke below the 50 threshold.
""Once we go below 50, it tells you manufacturing is starting to contract,"" said Don Ellenberger, head of multi-sector strategies at Federal Investors in Pittsburgh. 
Concerns about the economy, which is in its longest expansion ever, were also exacerbated by other data on Tuesday showing construction spending barely rising in July. The economy's waning fortunes have been blamed on the White House's year-long trade war with China.
President Donald Trump said on Tuesday trade talks with China were going well, but he warned that he would be ""tougher"" if the discussions dragged on past the 2020 U.S. election and he won a second term.
Across maturities, yields fell. The 10-year yield (US10YT=RR) fell as low as 1.4290% and was last down 3.7 basis points to 1.4691%. The two-year yield (US2YT=RR) was 4.2 basis points lower at 1.4640%. The fall was greater in shorter-dated maturities, enough to steepen the yield curve out of inversion. The spread between two- and 10-year yields  was last at 0.20 basis points. 
The ISM report was ""yet another piece of data showing a weaker manufacturing sector. That's the story,"" said Michael Pond, head of global inflation-linked research at  Barclays  (LON:BARC).
""To the extent that manufacturing remains weak, that increases the potential chance for a recession down the road. That means lower yields and lower inflation expectations.""
The 30-year Treasury yield (US30YT=RR) fell to 1.9612%, near the historic low of 1.9050% hit on Aug. 28. The 30-year interest swap rate fell to a record low of 1.4762% on Tuesday after closing at 1.54% on Friday.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. manufacturing activity contracted for the first time in three years in August, with new orders and hiring declining sharply as trade tensions weighed on business confidence, raising financial market fears of a recession.
Concerns about the economy, which is in its longest expansion ever, were also exacerbated by other data on Tuesday showing construction spending barely rising in July. The reports somewhat offset last week's upbeat data on consumer spending that had suggested that while the economy was slowing, it was not losing momentum as rapidly as financial markets were flagging.
The economy's waning fortunes have been blamed on the White House's year-long trade war with China. President Donald Trump said on Tuesday trade talks with China were going well, but he warned that he would be ""tougher"" in negotiations if the discussions dragged on past the 2020 U.S. election and he won a second term.
""The canary in the mine may be falling off its perch,"" said Joel Naroff, chief economist at Naroff Economic Advisors in Holland, Pennsylvania. ""With manufacturing now starting to contract, it is even more critical that the consumer keeps spending.""
The Institute for Supply Management (ISM) said its index of national factory activity dropped to a reading of 49.1 last month from 51.2 in July. A reading below 50 indicates contraction in the manufacturing sector, which accounts for about 12% of the U.S. economy. Last month marked the first time since August 2016 that the index broke below the 50 threshold. 
August's reading was also the lowest since January 2016 and was the fifth straight monthly decline in the index. The United States now joins the euro zone, Japan, the United Kingdom and China, which have long been experiencing a contraction in factory activity. 
Still, the ISM index remains above the 43 level, which economists associate with a recession. The U.S.-China trade tensions also coincide with diminishing stimulus from last year's $1.5 trillion tax cut package.
The ISM said there had been ""a notable decrease in business confidence,"" adding that ""trade remains the most significant issue, indicated by the strong contraction in new export orders."" Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the ISM index would slip to 51.0 in August. 
The U.S.-China trade fight is eroding business sentiment, with business investment contracting in the second quarter for the first time in more than three years. That, together with an inventory bloat, is undercutting manufacturing, with output declining for two straight quarters.
Consumers have largely shrugged off the trade dispute and continued to spend, propping up the economy. But that could change with the trade war spilling over to shopping malls. 
A new round of U.S. tariffs on imports of Chinese goods, mostly consumer products like clothing, footwear and televisions, took effect on Sept. 1. Additional U.S. tariffs are due to be imposed in December.
With trade tensions simmering in the background, the Federal Reserve is expected to cut interest rates again this month to keep the economic expansion, now in its 11th year, on track. 
The Fed lowered its short-term interest rate by 25 basis points in July for the first time since 2008, citing trade tensions and slowing global growth. Financial markets have fully priced in another quarter-percentage-point cut at the Fed's Sept. 17-18 policy meeting.
U.S. Treasury prices rose on the factory data, with the yield in the benchmark 10-year note dropping to its lowest since July 2016. The Treasury yield curve has inverted, signaling that a recession is looming. Stocks on Wall Street fell, while the dollar (DXY) was little changed against a basket of currencies.
ORDERS TUMBLE
The ISM's forward-looking new orders sub-index dropped to a reading of 47.2 last month, the lowest level since June 2012, from 50.8 in July. A measure of export orders plunged 4.8 points to the lowest level since April 2009.
The survey's factory employment tumbled to 47.4, the weakest reading since March 2016, from 51.7 in July. This raises the risk that factory payrolls contracted in August. Manufacturers cut hours in July, pushing the factory workweek to its lowest level since November 2011. Factories also cut overtime in July.
The government will publish August's employment report on Friday. 
""This (ISM) report is a warning that the tariff and trade uncertainty is continuing to weigh on manufacturing activity, and that this uncertainty is a growing risk to the expansion,"" said John Ryding, chief economist at RDQ Economics in New York. 
The ISM said nine industries, including furniture and related products, machinery and chemical products reported growth last month. Transportation equipment, primary metals and electrical equipment, appliances and components were among the seven industries reporting a contraction.
Machinery manufacturers said ""business is starting to show signs of a broad slowdown."" Electrical equipment, appliances and components makers complained that ""tariffs continue to be a strain on the supply chain and the economy overall."" 
That sentiment resonated across all industries. Manufacturers of furniture and related products said ""incoming sales seem to be slowing down, and this is usually our busiest season.""
""The story up until now has been global manufacturing recession, with the U.S. standing out as the strongest among the weakening players,"" said Chris Low, chief economist at FTN Financial in New York. ""The White House could help enormously by delaying further escalation of the trade conflict.""
In a separate report on Tuesday, the Commerce Department said construction spending edged up 0.1% in July. Data for June was revised up to show construction outlays decreasing 0.7 instead of falling 1.3% as previously reported.

Economists polled by Reuters had forecast construction spending would rise 0.3% in July. Construction spending fell 2.7% on a year-on-year basis in July.
Investment in public construction projects increased 0.4% after tumbling 3.1% in June. Spending on state and local government construction projects rebounded 0.6%. That followed a 3.7% plunge in June.
Outlays on federal government construction projects fell 2.4% in July after surging 4.3% in the prior month.
Spending on private construction projects dipped 0.1% in July, reversing June's 0.1% gain. Investment in private residential projects rose 0.6%, the most in eight months, after being unchanged in June.
Private residential investment was boosted by a 1.4% jump in single-family home building. There were also gains in home renovations.
Land and labor shortages have constrained homebuilding even as mortgage rates have dropped sharply from last year's levels. Spending on residential construction has contracted for six straight quarters, the longest such stretch since the Great Recession.
Spending on private nonresidential structures, which includes manufacturing and power plants, dropped 0.8% in July to a seven-month low. That followed a 0.2% rise in June.
Investment in nonresidential construction fell at its steepest pace in more than three years in the second quarter.

The Institute for Supply Management's purchasing managers index fell to 49.1 in August, weaker than all forecasts in a Bloomberg survey of economists, data released Tuesday showed. Figures below 50 signal the manufacturing economy is generally contracting.

Key Insights

The latest downturn underscores how slowing global growth and an escalating U.S. trade war with China are taking an even bigger toll on domestic producers. Although manufacturing only makes up about 11% of the economy, there are concerns that entrenched weakness -- and any layoffs that may result -- could filter through to the rest of the economy and endanger the record-long expansion. 
Manufacturing is technically already in a recession in the U.S. with a Federal Reserve measure of output declining in two consecutive quarters. The malaise is consistent with developments in the sector around the world. By one measure, global factory activity has declined 15 straight months and contracted in the last three. 
The ISM's measure of new orders, which are tracked by some as a leading indicator of a downturn, declined to 47.2. It was the first time since December 2015 that the gauge fell below 50. ISM's production gauge also sank below that mark, to 49.5 in August from 50.8. 
The slump in demand and output spilled over into the labor market as the ISM's gauge of factory employment fell to 47.4, the lowest level since March 2016. That suggests this Friday's employment report will show weakness in August manufacturing payrolls, which were surprisingly robust the previous two months. 
A measure of export orders, a proxy of overseas demand, sank to 43.3, the lowest reading since April 2009 during the depths of the last recession.

In an echo of disputes that have roiled global trade, sales to foreign customers posted a “weaker upturn” and new orders stagnated in the U.A.E. in August, according to IHS Markit. Its Purchasing Managers’ Index dropped to 51.6 from 55.1 in July, declining for a third month and edging close to the threshold of 50 that separates contraction from growth.
Fears of a global downturn are deepening as signs of a manufacturing slump have emerged from Europe to Asia. Domestic competitive pressures are compounding the outlook for the U.A.E., a federation of seven emirates that includes oil-rich Abu Dhabi and tourism and trade hub Dubai.
Heightened market competition continued to weigh on growth, forcing companies to cut prices by the most since April, according to panelists surveyed by IHS Markit in the monthly release. Activity in the non-oil economy increased “at a notably softer rate” compared to July, with weaker demand curbing the expansion, it said.
Even so, customer spending remained robust in the U.A.E. Domestic demand was also stronger in neighboring Saudi Arabia, where the IHS Markit PMI rose slightly in August.
Meanwhile hiring eased among U.A.E. firms, with employment numbers largely stagnant within the non-oil sector. But at least for now, next year’s World Expo in Dubai is helping support sentiment, according to IHS Markit.
“The dip in activity growth dampened business sentiment in August, although the underlying forecast was still strong,” IHS Markit economist David Owen said in the report. “With the Expo 2020 coming, many businesses were positive that the market will see strong levels of activity in the coming year.”"

The European Union's statistics office Eurostat said prices at factory gates in the 19 countries sharing the euro rose 0.2% in July, in line with market expectations.
The modest increase in July followed four consecutive monthly drops in industrial prices, including a 0.6% decline in June.
The July rise was driven by a surge of more volatile energy prices, which rose 1.0% after a 2.2% decrease in June. Excluding this component, producer prices fell 0.1% on the month in a new sign of persistently weak inflationary pressure.
Producer prices are an early indication of trends in consumer inflation, which the European Central Bank wants to keep below, but close to 2 percent over the medium term but has undershot since 2013.
Euro zone inflation remained low at 1.0% in August, according to Eurostat's latest reading.
Prices for durable and non-durable consumer goods were both unchanged in July and for capital goods, such as machinery, increased by just 0.1%. Prices of intermediate goods fell 0.3% on the month.
The year-on-year increase in producer prices was also 0.2%, also in line with expectations. It has steadily decelerated from the 3.0% peak of 2019 in February."

The IHS Markit/CIPS UK Construction Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) fell to 45.0 from 45.3 in July, confounding expectations for an improved reading of 45.9 in a Reuters poll of economists.
Overall, the survey is likely to add to questions over Britain's ability to bounce back from an economic contraction in the second quarter, a hangover from the stockpiling boom in advance of the original March Brexit deadline.
Another contraction in the current quarter would officially herald a recession.
The growing signs of a wilting economy -- similar to elsewhere in Europe -- raise the stakes for Prime Minister Boris Johnson in his standoff with Brussels.
The PMI's new orders index fell to its lowest level since March 2009, when Britain was deep in its last recession.
""Domestic political uncertainty continued to hold back the UK construction sector in August, with survey respondents indicating that delays to spending decisions had contributed to the sharpest fall in new work for over 10 years,"" IHS Markit economist Tim Moore said.Business expectations across the construction industry as a whole, which accounts for around 6% of economic output, fell to their lowest level since December 2008.
Brexit doubts hit the commercial construction sector hardest, IHS Markit said.
Investors will be watching Wednesday's PMI for the much larger services sector to see if the weak readings from the manufacturing and construction surveys are reflective of the whole economy.
British manufacturing contracted last month at the fastest rate in seven years, IHS Markit said on Monday."

The pieces are falling into place for Turkey’s central bank to follow its record interest-rate cut with more monetary easing as inflation heads for lows not seen since last year’s currency crash.
A more stable lira and the effect of a high base of comparison could push price growth into single digits as early as this month. Data on Tuesday showed it decelerated more than forecast in August to an annual 15%, the slowest in more than a year.
Turkey’s currency reversed losses after the data release and traded 0.3% stronger against the dollar as of 10:47 a.m. in Istanbul.
Prodded by President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and encouraged by the dovish swing among global policy makers, Turkish central bank Governor Murat Uysal could press ahead with easing as disinflation resumes following a blip in July. The deceleration is set to continue as the statistical effect of last year’s price spike fades.
“Unless the lira weakens markedly, the central bank will continue to cut rates to ease the burden on the economy,” said Piotr Matys, a London-based strategist at Rabobank. “It remains to be seen whether the fall in inflation leads to an improvement in expectations amongst households and corporates.”
Uysal had only been in office a few weeks when he slashed the benchmark by 425 basis points to 19.75%, the biggest rate cut in at least 17 years. His predecessor was fired for not cutting rates quickly enough.
The new governor signaled that more cuts were on the cards but also vowed to preserve “a reasonable rate of real return” for investors. Adjusted for prices, Turkey’s real rate is now at 4.7%, above peers such as South Africa, Russia and South Korea.
Most of the monthly inflation increase in August was a result of hikes in the cost of tobacco and natural gas, Okan Ertem, a senior economist at Turk Ekonomi Bankasi, said before the data release. Without those “regulatory interventions,” the consumer-price index rose only by around 0.3% from July, according to Ertem, who says the annual gauge may be below 10% in September and October.
“Inflation is heading lower and is likely to move quite quickly over the coming months,” said Nigel Rendell, a London-based senior analyst at Medley Global Advisors. What’s more, “Erdogan wants lower interest rates -- and what the president wants, he tends to get.”

616,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 03, 2019 02:46AM ET</span>","Australia central bank holds rates, repeats 'low for longer' view","By Swati Pandey
SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia's central bank kept its cash rate at an all-time low of 1% on Tuesday, expecting recent back-to-back policy easing to boost broader economic growth in coming quarters, though it left the door ajar for further cuts.
The Reserve Bank of Australia's (RBA) quarter-point reductions in June and July have struggled to gain traction amid tepid consumption at home and global uncertainty cast by the Sino-U.S. trade dispute.
Indeed, data out earlier showed Australia's household sector was battling miserly wage growth and subdued home prices with retail sales unexpectedly falling 0.1% in July. Annual growth braked to 2.4%, the slowest pace since the start of 2018.
RBA Governor Philip Lowe acknowledged domestic consumption was the main economic uncertainty, reiterating it was ""reasonable to expect"" lower for longer interest rates to help boost employment growth and inflation.
""The Board will continue to monitor developments, including in the labor market, and ease monetary policy further if needed,"" to support growth and inflation targets, Lowe said in a short post-meeting statement.
Financial futures are pricing in a third cut to 0.75% by October and a fourth to 0.5% by early next year.
Lowe held out hope for stronger consumer spending in coming months helped by a pick-up in household disposable income from recent tax cuts and a ""stabilization"" of the country's subdued housing market.
However, the near-term outlook was quite downbeat.
Data out on Wednesday is likely to show Australia's June quarter gross domestic product (GDP) growth paced below the RBA's recently downgraded estimates, with housing construction and private consumption the biggest drags.
A median of 20 economists' forecasts shows the A$1.9 trillion economy likely expanded 0.5% in the second quarter compared with RBA's expectations of 0.8%. Annual growth is seen slowing to a decade low of 1.5%.
""The RBA sounded a touch more optimistic when it left interest rates on hold today, but we still think that further rate cuts over the coming months are likely,"" said Ben Udy, Singapore-based economist at Capital Economics.
""We don’t think that the economy is out of the woods just yet...Jobs growth tends to lag economic activity and we still expect the unemployment rate to climb to 5.5% over the coming months.""
Australia has seen strong employment growth but the jobless rate has stayed above 5% since February this year, much higher than the RBA's goal of 4.5%.
EXPORTS SURGE
The external economy is in a far healthier shape, despite the Sino-U.S. trade war hurting exports and manufacturing activity elsewhere.
Separate data on Tuesday showed Australian exporters enjoyed bumper sales last quarter gifting the country its first current account surplus in over four decades.
The current account surplus came in at A$5.9 billion for the June quarter when analysts were looking for a A$1.4 billion windfall led by higher prices for its key resources - iron ore and coal.
This is the first surplus since June 1975 and the largest on record.
""A strong external sector is providing some offset to weak domestic demand and real activity,"" said RBC economists Su-Lin Ong. ""From a ratings perspective, this allows more scope for some fiscal loosening to support activity."""
617,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 02, 2019 11:41PM ET</span>","South Korean inflation hits record low, fans case for more rate cuts","By Choonsik Yoo and Joori Roh
SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea's consumer inflation faltered to its slowest on record in August while second quarter economic growth was revised down on weaker exports, firming up the case for central bank rate cuts as early as next month.
While policymakers were swift to talk down the risks of deflation, heightened expectations of more central bank easing pushed bond prices higher.
The consumer price index was unchanged in August from a year earlier, Statistics Korea data showed, missing the 0.2% rise tipped in a Reuters survey and marking the weakest pace since the country began releasing inflation data in 1965.
Weighing on inflation were weaker consumer demand and declining farm prices as improved weather helped boosted production.
Separately, the Bank of Korea (BOK) revised down economic growth for the June quarter to 1.0% on-quarter from a 1.1% gain reported earlier, citing weaker exports than estimated earlier.
The weak data dominated discussion at a rare joint meeting between the BOK and finance ministry.
""The BOK shares the same opinion with the finance ministry that we are not in a situation to worry about deflation,"" BOK Senior Deputy Governor Yoon Myun-shik said at the meeting, adding inflation would pick up soon.
Despite this assurance, treasury bond prices rose broadly with the benchmark 10-year yield (KR10YT=RR) shedding 1.5 basis points to 1.285% as of 0228 GMT, far below the central bank's policy rate of 1.50%.
""I don't think the inflation would sharply pick up in the short-run as the BOK predicts,"" Kim Yu-mi, economist at Kiwoom Securities said, adding deflation remains a real prospect.
Farm products prices plunged 11.4% year-on-year as weather improved while core inflation excluding volatile food and energy prices was 0.8%.
South Korea's inflation has been extremely weak by historical standards and a long way off the central bank's 2%target as consumers and companies tighten their spending.
Economists expect South Korea's economic growth to tumble to as low as 1.4% this year from 2.7% last year, marking one of the worst years in five decades.
Tuesday's figures follow grim trade data for August, which showed the exports tumbled for a ninth consecutive month.
Last week, the BOK held benchmark rates steady at 1.50% but kept the door open for what would be the second rate cut this year after July's surprise cut, the first in three years.
The government last week drafted the most aggressive budget plan since the global financial crisis to fend off growing domestic and external economic risks."
618,By Bloomberg,"<span>Sep 02, 2019 11:21PM ET</span>",Australia Posts Its First Current Account Surplus in 44 Years,"(Bloomberg) -- Australia recorded its first current-account surplus since 1975 in the three months through June, underpinned by a surge in iron ore prices that have since retraced much of their gain.
The windfall was A$5.9 billion ($4 billion) in the second quarter, compared with a revised A$1.1 billion shortfall three months earlier, the statistics bureau said in Sydney Tuesday. Economists had forecast a A$1.5 billion surplus.
The result is mainly a function of the extraordinary and unexpected spike in iron-ore prices, fueled by huge supply disruptions and record Chinese steel production. Though both of these have since unwound, with iron ore falling the most on record in August, suggesting the surplus may not last too long.
Reserve Bank Deputy Governor Guy Debelle last week noted the “significant transformation” from 33 years ago when then-Treasurer Paul Keating warned that Australia’s record current account deficit -- at almost 6% of GDP -- risked seeing the nation becoming a “banana republic.”
Yet for the RBA, which is expected to keep its cash rate unchanged at a record-low 1% today, and forecast to reduce it to 0.5% next year, a current-account surplus may not be what it needs in 2019. A surplus suggests the currency might be a bit stronger than it otherwise would be and investment somewhat softer."

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australian exporters enjoyed bumper sales last quarter gifting the country its first current account surplus in over four decades, however, wider economic conditions remained sluggish as households crimped spending.
Data out on Tuesday showed Australia swung to a larger-than-expected current account surplus of A$5.9 billion when analysts were looking for a A$1.4 billion windfall, led by higher prices for its key resources - iron ore and coal.
This is the first surplus since June 1975 and the largest on record.
That means net exports added a cool 0.6 percentage points to gross domestic product last quarter.
Data due Wednesday will likely show the A$1.9 trillion economy expanded 0.5% in the quarter-ended June 30 with annual growth seen slowing to a decade low of 1.5%.
In contrast to the blockbuster external economy, Australia's household sector is battling miserly wage growth and subdued home prices with other data showing retail sales fell 0.1% in July. A median of 19 economists had predicted a 0.2% rise.
The weak outcome, which was led by falls in clothing, footwear and personal accessory and department stores, briefly sent the local dollar to the day's low of $0.6696.
Sluggish household consumption has been a major source of worry for the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) as the sector accounts for 56% of the economy, and was a major reason policymakers cut the cash rate twice since June to a record low of 1%.
The RBA is likely to stand pat at its monthly board meeting on Tuesday - a decision is due at 0430 GMT - though financial markets are fully pricing in a third easing by November.
""There is certainly plenty to suggest softer economic activity, but monetary policy is not instantaneous,"" said Kerry Craig, Global Market Strategist, J.P. Morgan Asset Management.
""This means that the RBA is willing to wait to see whether the 50 bps of rate cuts this year will deliver a pick-up in growth in the second half before taking further action."""
620,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 02, 2019 07:46PM ET</span>","UK retail sales flat-line, consumers stockpile food for Brexit: surveys","LONDON (Reuters) - British retailers saw their sales flat-line in August as shoppers cut back on non-essentials and some households stockpiled food ahead of Brexit, surveys showed on Tuesday.
Annual total sales growth fell to zero from the weakest July rise on record of 0.3%, the British Retail Consortium, which groups major high-street chains and supermarkets, said.
That pushed down the average pace of sales growth over the past 12 months to 0.4%, the weakest since the BRC began its data collection in 1995.
""Greater economic and political uncertainty has driven down consumer demand,"" BRC Chief Executive Helen Dickinson said. ""While the summer weather gave a small boost to food sales, this was canceled out by a drop in non-food sales.""
Britain's consumers have propped up Britain's economy since the 2016 Brexit referendum, helping to offset cuts to investment spending by companies. But economists say recent signs of a weakening in spending by households raise the risk of a recession as the country prepares to leave the European Union.
Prime Minister Boris Johnson says he will take Britain out of the EU on Oct. 31 without a transition deal to smooth the economic shock, unless Brussels makes concessions which it has so far ruled out.
The BRC showed that in like-for-like terms, which strips out changes in retail space, sales were down 0.5% compared with August 2018, their fifth fall in the first eight months of 2019.
Barclaycard also said it saw signs of concern about Brexit among consumers.
The payments card firm reported monthly consumer spending growth of 1.3% - sharply slower than growth of 4.5% in August last year.
Spending at discount stores bucked the trend and rose by 8.0%, a sign of the cautious mood of many consumers.
A survey commissioned by Barclaycard showed almost one in five respondents was stockpiling everyday items in case of shortages in the future. Tinned foods, household supplies and dried goods topped the list of stockpiled products, it said.
However, a senior executive of a major British supermarket group, who asked not to be identified, told Reuters its most recent sales data had not shown any evidence of any consumer stockpiling.
""A weak pound and worries about rising prices are causing concern for many, with Brits looking to better balance their household budgets,"" Esme Harwood, a Barclaycard director, said.
""That said, spending at pubs and restaurants remains robust, suggesting Brits have been making the most of the longer days by relaxing and dining out."""

LONDON (Reuters) - British manufacturing contracted last month at the fastest rate in seven years, rocked by the deepening Brexit crisis and the global downturn, boding poorly for the chances of an economic rebound in the third quarter, a survey showed on Monday.
The IHS Markit/CIPS UK Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) fell to 47.4 from 48.0 in July, a full point lower than the median forecast in a Reuters poll of economists and well below the 50 dividing line for growth and contraction.
Only German manufacturing fared worse among the national PMIs produced for Europe by data company IHS Markit.
""The big picture is that manufacturing is on track to contract for a second consecutive quarter, and a meaningful recovery is unlikely given the ongoing struggles of global manufacturing,"" Andrew Wishart, UK economist at consultancy Capital Economics, said.
Britain's overall economy shrank in the second quarter too, a hangover from the stockpiling boom in advance of the original March Brexit deadline. Another contraction in the current quarter would officially herald a recession.
Surveys from Lloyds (LON:LLOY) Bank and the European Commission last week also suggested that Britain's economy is stalling, raising the stakes for Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who has promised to take Britain out of the EU with or without a deal.
Respondents to the PMI survey cited the global slowdown and Brexit as reasons for lower demand from domestic and foreign customers, some of whom are moving supply chains away from Britain before the Oct. 31 deadline for leaving the EU.
Survey compiler IHS Markit said its survey was consistent with a decline in the official measure of factory output of nearly 2% quarter-on-quarter. Manufacturing accounts for 10% of British economic output.
The survey's index of future output fell to its lowest level since records started in 2012.
Activity across manufacturing declined, with production in the consumer goods industry dropping at the fastest rate since February 2009, around the nadir of Britain's last recession, IHS Markit said."

LONDON/TOKYO (Reuters) - The bitter trade war between China and the United States kept global factory activity largely in decline in August, business surveys showed, strengthening the case for policymakers to unleash fresh stimulus to fend off recession risks.
In a fresh escalation of the trade spat, the United States began imposing 15% tariffs on a variety of Chinese goods on Sunday. China reciprocated with new duties on U.S. crude oil, increasing fears of a global economic slowdown.
An ongoing decline in the euro zone's export-reliant powerhouse of Germany meant factory activity in the bloc contracted for a seventh month in August, bolstering expectations the European Central Bank will ease monetary policy next week.
IHS Markit's August final manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) was 47.0, matching an earlier flash reading but well below the 50 level separating growth from contraction.
While an improvement on July, that month's reading was the euro zone's lowest since December 2012.
In one brighter spot, as it is less dependent on exports than other euro zone countries, France's economy has so far proved more impervious to a slowdown and factory activity returned to growth as manufacturers saw output and client demand pick up.
Manufacturing in Britain, rocked by the deepening Brexit crisis and global downturn, contracted last month at the fastest rate in seven years. 
""The big picture is that manufacturing is on track to contract for a second consecutive quarter, and a meaningful recovery is unlikely given the ongoing struggles of global manufacturing,"" said Andrew Wishart, an economist at Capital Economics. 
""And while the euro zone equivalent ticked up, it points to manufacturing output from the bloc continuing to contract.""
A similar survey due later from the United States is expected to show slowing manufacturing growth in the world's largest economy. (reuters://realtime/verb=Open/url=cpurl://apps.cp./Apps/econ-polls?RIC=USPMI%3DECI poll data)
But in a surprise development, China's factory activity expanded as output edged up, a private sector PMI showed, although orders remained weak and business confidence faltered.
Following Monday's data, market sentiment remained fragile and while European stocks rose cautiously, driven by a rally in miners, the euro was 0.05% lower at $1.0985 (EUR=), not far from a two-year low of $1.0963 hit in U.S. trade on Friday. 
ASIAN STRAIN
Export-reliant South Korea, Japan and Taiwan saw factory activity shrink, underscoring the growing pain from the tit-for-tat tariff war between the world's two-largest economies.
""The broader picture for Asian exports remains very weak because of the impact of the U.S.-China trade war, which is continuing to escalate,"" said Rajiv Biswas, Asia Pacific chief economist at IHS Markit.
In China, the Caixin/Markit Manufacturing PMI for August rose to a five-month high of 50.4 from 49.9 in July, beating a median market forecast.
The reading followed Beijing's official PMI that showed factory activity shrank in August for the fourth month in a row, pointing to a further slowdown in the world's second-largest economy.
India, an Asian economic powerhouse, saw the slowest expansion in its manufacturing sector in 15 months as demand and output grew at their weakest pace in a year.
Data on Friday showed India's economic growth hit a 6-year low in April-June, raising chances of the central bank cutting interest rates further at its next meeting.
Elsewhere, Japanese manufacturing activity fell for a fourth straight month, underlining a darkening outlook for the world's third-largest economy.
While Japan's exports slipped for an eighth month in July due to slumping China-bound sales, the economy has so far enjoyed steady growth thanks to robust domestic demand.
But there are signs the economy may start to lose the support from consumption and capital expenditure.
Manufacturers surveyed in the PMI data said the end of a construction spike ahead of the 2020 Tokyo Olympic Games and a scheduled sales tax hike in October are expected to hurt output volumes the coming months.
Any further sign of weakness in domestic demand could add pressure on the Bank of Japan to ramp up stimulus at its rate review on Sept. 18-19, which follows the ECB's latest policy decision and that of the U.S. Federal Reserve.
""The U.S.-China trade war is escalating and we're also seeing tensions heighten between Washington and Europe,"" which could cause the global economy to falter,"" said Yoshimasa Maruyama, chief market economist at SMBC Nikko Securities.
""Japan may slide into recession around the time the sales tax hike takes effect,"" he added.

South Korean's factory activity also shrank as manufacturers felt the pinch not just from the U.S.-China trade war but an escalating diplomatic dispute with Japan, strengthening the case for additional policy easing by the country's central bank, following a surprise interest rate cut in July.

At their July meeting policymakers at the ECB all but promised to ease policy further as the bloc's growth outlook worsens. An escalation in the U.S.-China trade war has increased fears for a global economic slowdown.
IHS Markit's August final manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) was 47.0, matching an earlier flash reading but well below the 50 level separating growth from contraction.
While an improvement on July's 46.5, that month's reading was the lowest since December 2012.
An index measuring output, which feeds into a composite PMI due on Wednesday and seen as a good gauge of economic health, rose to 47.9 from 46.9 but also spent its seventh month below the breakeven mark.
""Euro zone producers are suffering as the summer slump in factory production persisted into August. A marked deterioration in optimism about the year ahead suggests companies are expecting worse to come,"" noted Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit.
The future output index, which gauges optimism about the year ahead, sank to 50.6 from 52.6 - its lowest reading since November 2012. Adding to the downbeat picture, factories reduced headcount for a fourth month.

IHS Markit's Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) for manufacturing, which accounts for about a fifth of the economy, rose slightly to 43.5, remaining below the 50.0 mark separating growth from contraction for an eight month in a row.
The figure was below a flash reading of 43.6 and close to July's seven-year low reading.
Lower demand, especially for capital and intermediate goods, was behind the continued weakness in the sector. Manufacturers also cited reduced demand from the car industry, which is facing lower sales.
The survey also showed that sentiment about future output fell to a record low, pointing to pessimism among manufacturers.
As a result, manufacturers sped up job cuts, which reached the fastest rate since July 2012.
""The slump in Germany's manufacturing sector goes on and, with no light at the end of the tunnel just yet, the number of goods producers cutting staff continues to rise, boding ill for domestic demand,"" said Phil Smith, principle economist at IHS Markit.
""Manufacturing is now not only in recession, but the PMI data also point to deflationary forces building with regard to producer prices as supply outstrips demand.""
Data published last week showed a rise in unemployment in August, eroding a pillar of growth that has helped support an economy whose traditionally powerful export engine is weakening and that could well slip into recession in the current quarter.
With its sales abroad hit by a worsening trade climate, a global economic slowdown and an increasingly chaotic run-up to Brexit, the bulk of Germany's growth momentum is been generated domestically - a dependency that leaves it exposed to any weakening of the jobs market."

Turkey’s economy slowed in the second quarter but fared better than forecast, as the country’s recovery struggled to take hold at a time of political uncertainty.
Gross domestic product expanded a seasonally adjusted 1.2% from the previous three months, according to data released on Monday, down from a revised 1.6% in the first quarter. The median of six forecasts in a Bloomberg survey was for an increase of 0.4%. From a year earlier, GDP shrank 1.5%.
Turkey exited its first recession in a decade in the first quarter, but the economy has struggled to keep up momentum as President Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s ruling AK Party refused to concede defeat in the race for Istanbul mayor in March, denting consumer and business confidence. The prospect of punitive U.S. sanctions compounded the negative sentiment.
Foreign investors who balked at the risks pulled their money out and households started hoarding dollars. Meanwhile, the lira suffered the biggest drop in emerging markets in the second quarter, giving way to an outsized draw-down of the central bank’s limited reserves.
This all led to “a tightening of financial conditions” which “manifested in higher market interest rates and slower credit growth,” Inan Demir, an economist at Nomura International Plc in London, said on Friday. Demir had penciled in a 0.5% quarterly expansion.
Investment Slump
The slowdown in quarterly growth was driven by a slump in investments, which shrank 7.4% from the previous three-month period, according to a breakdown of GDP data by Turkstat.
On an annual basis, businesses’ spending on machinery fell 22.8%, the biggest drop since at least 2016. The annual contraction in the economy was driven by that and consumer spending, which shrank 1.1%.
Government spending, usually a big driver of GDP growth, rose 3.3% from year earlier while exports rose 8.1%.
The lira has since stabilized and policy makers have started easing access to liquidity -- central bank governor Murat Uysal slashed the benchmark rate by a record 425 basis points in July, undoing some of the monetary tightening designed to backstop the currency.
But continued growth now hinges on banks’ ability to extend credit.
On an annualized basis and adjusted for foreign-currency fluctuations, credit expansion is hovering below 5% after briefly touching 20% in April. This comes despite a more than 10 percentage point drop in lira loan rates and government measures designed to prop up lending.

Meanwhile, consumer confidence is hovering near a five-year low, and leading indicators such as industrial production point to further pain. While the economic headwinds are unlikely to tip the economy back into technical recession, growth will probably fall short of the government’s 2.3% target for 2019.
The median estimate in a Bloomberg survey of economists sees the economy shrinking 1.5% in 2019, the first annual contraction since 2009. Still, Treasury and Finance Minister Berat Albayrak in July said he expects Turkey to post a positive rate of growth for the year.

BENGALURU (Reuters) - Expansion in India's manufacturing sector hit its slowest in 15 months in August as demand and output grew at their weakest pace in a year and cost pressures increased, a private sector survey showed on Monday.
The survey comes after official figures showed India's economy grew at an annual rate of 5.0% last quarter, its slowest in more than six years and significantly weaker than 5.7% in a Reuters poll.
The Nikkei Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index , compiled by IHS Markit, declined to 51.4 in August from July's 52.5, its weakest since May 2018. However, it has remained above the 50-mark separating growth from contraction for more than two years.
""August saw an undesirable combination of slowing economic growth and greater cost inflationary pressures in the Indian manufacturing industry,"" Pollyanna De Lima, principal economist at IHS Markit, said in a release.
A sub-index tracking overall demand hit its weakest in more than a year and foreign orders increased at their slowest pace in 16 months.
Input costs rose at their quickest pace in nine months while the rate of increase in output prices was slower than in July, suggesting firms' profit margins were squeezed.
With inflation predicted to remain below the Reserve Bank of India's medium-term target of 4% for the rest of this year, the central bank is expected to ease further in October to boost a slowing economy. [RBI/INT]
""Another worrying sign was the first drop in input buying for 15 months, which reflected a mixture of intentional reductions in stocks and shortages of available finance,"" De Lima said.
""Until manufacturers are willing to loosen the purse strings, it's difficult to foresee a meaningful rebound in production growth on the horizon.""
Adding to the gloomy picture, tighter margins and demand growth easing meant firms barely increased headcount.
However, firms remained upbeat about the coming 12 months. Expectations of future output rose to their highest level in more a year, the survey showed."

The manufacturing purchasing managers’ index dropped to 49.5, according to data released by the National Bureau of Statistics on Saturday, with sub-gauges showing that domestic and new overseas orders contracted. On Sunday, higher U.S. tariffs on roughly $110 billion in Chinese imports took effect, as did Beijing’s retaliatory duties on U.S. goods coming the other way.
U.S President Donald Trump’s tariff war continues to heap pressure on China’s economy and policy makers at a time when economic output is already in a long-term deceleration. Until now, officials have stuck doggedly to a relatively limited roster of stimulus measures out of concern that more ambitious support would further swell indebtedness and over-inflate the frothy property market.
“While we find Beijing’s self-restraint admirable, we are unsure whether this well-intended master plan could be put into practice, as the risks to growth may have been underestimated,” analysts at Nomura International Ltd including Lu Ting wrote in a note. Toward the end of the year the government “may be compelled to increase credit growth and ease its tightening measures on property markets again.”
The government is not sounding the alarm just yet. Late Sunday, the State Council, China’s cabinet, released a statement saying that overall risks are “controllable” and the economy is stable. At the same time, counter-cyclical adjustments in economic policy will be increased, according to the statement.
Export Contraction
The sub-index gauging new export orders rose to 47.2, but was still in contraction, while new orders contracted further. The extra tariffs will now hit manufacturers harder.
A 15% additional U.S. duty hit consumer goods ranging from footwear and apparel to home textiles and certain technology products like the Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) Watch. A separate batch of about $160 billion in Chinese goods -- including laptops and cellphones -- will be hit with 15% tariffs on Dec. 15.
In turn, China targeted U.S. agricultural and manufacturing centers in the Midwest and South, with higher tariffs on soybeans and other farm goods plus the ramping up of charges on U.S. autos -- where duties can now total as much as 50%.
In the PMI report, the index showing prices at the factory door continue to decline, although the renewed contraction of input prices should relieve some of the pressure on company profits.
The economy slowed in July and a set of early data collated by Bloomberg showed the trend continuing in August, with poor sales managers’ sentiment and falling trade. However, an improvement in small business confidence is a sign that earlier pro-growth measures may be having an effect.
Small Business Glimmer
Economists continue to warn that the trade war risks dragging the global economy into recession, a development that would ultimately feed through into Chinese domestic demand. For now, officials may take some encouragement from the relative strength of the services and construction PMI index, which rose marginally in August and remains in expansion.
That partly reflects the long-term shift of the economy away from investment and exports and toward a consumption-led growth model.
There are signs that the rapid escalation in the trade war in recent weeks could be topping out. Last week China indicated that it wouldn’t immediately retaliate against the next round of higher U.S. duties. Trump indicated Friday that negotiations between the two nations slated for September are still going ahead.
However with each new downbeat data release, Chinese policy makers face greater pressure to abandon their restrained stimulus approach.
“In a macro environment with a weaker credit cycle and falling nominal growth, there is room and urgency for monetary policy to loosen, in order to prevent real interest rates from rising further,” economists at China International Capital Corp. led by Yuan Yue wrote."

Purchasing manager indexes for Japan, South Korea and Taiwan remained in negative territory. Japan’s Jibun Bank and IHS Markit PMI fell to 49.3 from 49.4 in July, the eighth consecutive month of contraction. The IHS Markit PMI for Taiwan fell to 47.9 from 48.1 in July.
While South Korea’s IHS Markit PMI rose to 49 from 47.3 in July, it is still showing a contraction. Readings below 50 signal a shrinking of factory activity.
The three manufacturing nations have been among the most exposed to trade tensions, a cooling technology boom and slowing demand in line with a weaker global economy.
China’s Caixin Media and IHS Markit PMI rose to 50.4 from 49.9 in July, indicating a renewed expansion and its highest level since March. Yet the nation’s official manufacturing PMI dropped to 49.5, according to data released Saturday by the National Bureau of Statistics, with sub-gauges showing that domestic and new overseas orders contracted.
It was a soft picture across Southeast Asia with Indonesia slipping further into contraction -- to its lowest since July 2017 -- and the Philippines, Thailand, and Myanmar all expanding more slowly. PMIs for Malaysia and Vietnam -- the weakest and strongest performers in the region -- are due Tuesday.
Developments in U.S.-China trade relations remain the dominant driver of sentiment. On Sunday, higher U.S. tariffs on roughly $110 billion in Chinese imports took effect, as did Beijing’s retaliatory duties on U.S. goods.
“High uncertainty over U.S. - China trade policies, Brexit and other political and geopolitical developments continues to weigh on the global outlook,” economists at  Barclays  (LON:BARC) wrote in a note. “The news flow leaves room for hope on potential U.S.-China or Brexit deals, but the development pattern so far makes us skeptical about any sudden solutions.”"

Investing.com – China’s economy remains under pressure but some mixed data out Monday morning offers a glimmer of hope.
The Caixin China General Manufacturing Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI), released Monday morning, recorded an increase to 50.4 in August (with a number over 50 signalling expansion) up from 49.9 in July. 
However, the official PMI released on Saturday by the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) suggested a gloomier outlook. The NBS said the official PMI for August came in at 49.5, down from 49.7 in July. 
Marking a more positive note, services seem to be doing better. The official non-manufacturing PMI rose for the first time in five months to 53.8 in August from 53.7 in July. 
“China’s economy showed signs of a short-term recovery, but downward pressure remains a long-term problem,” Zhong Zhengsheng, director of macroeconomic analysis with CEBM Group, told Caixin, a mainland China business publication. 
The Caixin index suggested the that manufacturing output expanded in August but the growth rate remains below historical averages.

630,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 01, 2019 09:21PM ET</span>","Japan second-quarter corporate capital spending rises, but profits tumble","By Tetsushi Kajimoto
TOKYO (Reuters) - Japanese companies raised spending on plant and equipment in April-June for the 11th straight quarter, underscoring the resilience of capital expenditure despite the Sino-U.S. trade war and slowing global growth.
Firms raised capital spending by 1.9% in the second quarter from the same period a year earlier, Ministry of Finance data showed on Monday.
On a seasonally-adjusted basis, capital expenditure grew 1.5 percent quarter-on-quarter in April-June.
The data will be used to calculate revised gross domestic product figures due on Sept. 9.
A preliminary reading out last month showed Japan's economy expanded by a much-faster-than-expected 1.8% in April-June as solid household and business spending offset the blow to exports from trade frictions and weak external demand.
A tit-for-tat tariff war between the United States and China now involves hundreds of billions of dollars of each country's goods and threatens global economic growth. Both sides imposed new tariffs on Sunday in the latest escalation, though Washington says face-to-face trade talks will resume sometime this month.
In Japan, a scheduled sales tax hike to 10% from the current 8% in October could undermine private consumption that constitutes about 60% of the world's third-largest economy, adding to uncertainty.
The previous tax hike from 5% in April 2014 dealt a blow to consumers and triggered a deep downturn in a broader economy.
Capital expenditure has been a bright spot, however.
Companies are refurbishing old equipment and boosting investment in automation and labor-saving technology to cope with labor shortages in an aging society.
Manufacturers' capex fell 6.9% on-year, but non-manufacturers' spending rose 7.0.
Monday's data also showed corporate recurring profits fell 12.0% in April-June from a year earlier, swinging from a 10.3% gain in the previous period.
Sales rose a meager 0.4%, up for a 11th straight quarter but slowing sharply from the previous period's 3.0% gain."

The headline Nikkei/Markit purchasing managers' index (PMI) rose to 49.0, from 47.3 in July, but remained below the 50-point level that separates contraction from growth for a fourth straight month. The majority of sub-indexes also continued to decline, but at a slow pace.
The sub-index for new export orders rose to 48.6 from 45.5 in July, the slowest decline seen since April, but the 13th straight month of contraction. Survey respondents reported cooling demand from Germany, China, Japan and parts of Southeast Asia.
Total new orders also shrank for a 10th successive month, due to reduced demand for goods both at home and abroad.
Though some firms in the electronics industry launched new products, those failed to offset the cut back from elsewhere, extending the contraction for a 10th month.
""While the pick-up in the headline index suggests that pressures on South Korean manufacturers have abated to an extent, underlying data still portray a deeply challenging environment,"" said Joe Hayes, economist at IHS Markit, which compiles the survey.
South Korea, Asia's fourth-largest economy, has been struggling with sluggish exports and weak inflation, while the U.S.-China tit-for-tat tariff dispute and a brewing trade row with Japan pose increasing growth risks.
Gross domestic product swung back to growth in the June quarter after a shock contraction in the previous period, but that was mostly due to increased government spending, not a pick up in demand.
The employment sub-indexes showed factories cutting staff at the fastest pace in six months to deal with reduced sales and price pressures driven by a weaker won , increased raw material and payroll costs.
South Korean manufacturers restored confidence marginally in August after July's future output index fell below the threshold for the first time since sentiment was tracked in 2012. But the bitter feud between the nation and Japan and faltering economy still weighed on the business sentiment.
On Friday, the Bank of Korea kept the benchmark interest rate unchanged at 1.50%, which followed a surprise rate cut in July, but is widely expected to ease at the next meeting in October."

The final Jibun Bank Japan Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) edged down to a seasonally adjusted 49.3 from 49.4 in July, and also off a preliminary 49.5.
The index stayed below the 50.0 threshold that separates contraction for a fourth month, marking the longest run of shrinkage since a six-month stretch from March to August 2016.
""Japanese goods producers continued to signal difficult conditions during August,"" said Joe Hayes, economist at IHS Markit, which compiles the survey.
""The sector was plagued by production cutbacks and flagging demand, which have been the trends so far in 2019. Softer growth across Asia, particularly in China, was reported to have dented export opportunities.""
Output and total new orders continued to decline.
While an index of new export orders rose to the highest since March, it remained in contraction for the ninth month, the longest such run since an 11-month spell from April 2012 to February 2013.
Manufacturers reported the end of a construction spike ahead of the 2020 Tokyo Olympic Games and a scheduled sales tax hike in October are expected to adversely impact output volumes the coming months.
Companies cut prices of their goods for a third straight month, citing client requests for discounts and weak market conditions.
More positive news came from Japan's factory output, with data on Friday showing production bounced more than expected in July, though it was expected to fall again next month, signaling further strains ahead.
In another bright spot, the final reading for backlogs of work rose to its highest since December last year, though it still showed a decline and some firms said operating capacity eased as a result of slower inflows of new business.
""With external and domestic headwinds aplenty, it is difficult to envisage any near-term improvements in Japan's manufacturing sector,"" IHS Markit's Hayes said."
633,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 31, 2019 11:07PM ET</span>",South Korea August exports tumble for ninth month as world economy cools,"By Choonsik Yoo and Joori Roh
SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea's exports tumbled in August for a ninth consecutive month, on sluggish demand from its biggest buyer, China, and depressed prices of computer chips globally, government data showed on Sunday.
The bleak data clouded the outlook for Asia's fourth-largest economy as a brewing trade dispute with Japan emerged as a new risk to the export-dependent economy on top of the prolonged conflicts between the United States and China.
Exports in August plunged 13.6% from a year earlier, the trade ministry data showed, exactly matching a median 13.6% fall forecast in a Reuters survey and marking the third month with a double-digit rate of drop in exports.
That further dented growth prospects for South Korea and strengthened the case for an additional policy easing by the central bank, soon after a surprise interest rate cut in July, for the first time in three years.
""There's no sign of the export momentum gaining strength as the U.S.-China trade dispute continued while Japan's export curbs and the political unrest in Hong Kong have shaken business sentiment,"" said Lee Sang-jae, an economist at Eugene Investment and Securities.
South Korea is the first major exporting economy to report foreign trade data each month and its companies include some of the world's top suppliers of chips, smartphones, cars and ships, so providing an early guide to the health of the global economy.
On Sunday, the finance minister also said South Korea was now likely to miss this year's growth target, just two months after the government downgraded the goal to 2.4-2.5% from 2.6-2.7% earlier.
The sluggish exports in August were led by a 30.7% drop in shipments of semiconductor chips that account for a fifth of the total, while a decline of 21.3% in sales to neighboring China also contributed, the ministry data showed.
The ministry said in a statement exports, excluding semiconductors, contracted 8.7% year-on-year.
Disputes with Japan were hardly a welcome development, although the effect has been negligible. Japan has tightened curbs on exports of high-tech materials to South Korea, and each has stripped the other of fast-track export status.
Imports in August fell 4.2% from a year earlier, largely in line with a prediction of a 4.0% drop in the Reuters survey. That brought this month's trade surplus to $1.72 billion, compared with a $2.40-billion surplus in July.
The data came days after the central bank held its policy interest rate unchanged at 1.50% on Friday after a 25 basis-point cut in July, while keeping the door open for another reduction. It next reviews its policy on Oct. 16.
South Korea's economy grew 1.9% during the first half in annual terms and private sector organizations predict full-year growth will fall to as low as 1.4% from 2.7% last year, one of the worst figures in decades.
On Thursday, the government proposed for next year the most aggressive budget spending plan since the 2008-2009 global financial crisis."

BEIJING (Reuters) - Factory activity in China shrank in August for the fourth month in a row as the United States ramped up trade pressure and domestic demand remained sluggish, pointing to a further slowdown in the world's second-largest economy.
Persistent weakness in China's vast manufacturing sector could fuel expectations that Beijing needs to roll out stimulus more quickly, and more aggressively, to weather the biggest downturn in decades.
The Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) fell to 49.5 in August, China's National Bureau of Statistics said on Saturday, versus 49.7 in July, below the 50-point mark that separates growth from contraction on a monthly basis.
A Reuters poll showed analysts expected the August PMI to stay unchanged from the previous month.
The official factory gauge showed growing trade frictions with the United States and cooling global demand continued to wreak havoc on China's exporters.
Export orders fell for the 15th straight month in August, although at a slower pace, with the sub-index picking up to 47.2 from July's 46.9. 
Total new orders - from home and abroad - also continued to fall, indicating domestic demand remains soft, despite a flurry of growth-boosting measures over the past year.
""Frontloading of exports to the U.S. ahead of higher tariffs supported trade and overall activity growth, but this effect will likely fade in the next few months,"" said analysts at Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) in a note. 
Manufacturers in consumption-oriented industries such as the auto sector have been especially vulnerable. Carmakers such as Geely (HK:0175) and Great Wall (SS:601633) have slashed expectations for sales and profits.
The data showed activity at medium- and small-sized firms contracted, even as large manufacturers, many backed by the government, managed to expand in August. 
Factories continued to shed jobs in August amid the uncertain business outlook. The employment sub-index dropped to 46.9, compared with 47.1 in July.
ESCALATIONS
August saw dramatic escalations in the bitter year-long Sino-U.S. trade row, with President Donald Trump announcing early in the month that he would impose new tariffs on Chinese goods from Sept. 1, and China letting its yuan currency sharply weaken days later.
After Beijing hit back with retaliatory tariffs, Trump said existing levies would also be raised in coming months. The combined moves now effectively cover all of China's exports to the United States.
Trump said late on Friday that trade teams from both sides continue to talk and will meet in September, but tariff increases on Chinese goods set to go into effect on Sunday will not be delayed.
The U.S. president had said earlier in the week that China wants to reach a deal ""very badly"", citing what he described as increasing economic pressure on Beijing and job losses. 
But most analysts are highly doubtful of an end to the dispute any time soon, and some have recently cut growth forecasts for China in coming quarters.
The sudden deterioration in trade ties has prompted speculation over whether China needs to roll out more forceful measures to keep growth from sliding below 6% this year, the bottom end of its target range of around 6.0-6.5%.
Analysts widely expect Beijing will cut some of its major lending rates in September for the first time in four years to help stabilize growth.
But sources had told Reuters before the latest trade escalations that big benchmark rate cuts were considered a last resort, as policymakers worry that could fuel a further build-up in debt and squeeze bank's profit margins, heightening financial sector risks.
So far, Beijing has relied on a combination of fiscal stimulus and monetary easing to deal with the economic slowdown, including hundreds of billions of dollars in infrastructure spending and tax cuts for companies.
But analysts note infrastructure investment growth has remained subdued despite the earlier pump-priming measures, underlining the need for additional support.
SERVICES GROWTH
Growth in China's services sector activity picked up for the first time in five months in August, with the official numbers from a separate business survey rising to 53.8 from 53.7 in August.
Beijing has been relying on a strong services sector to cushion some of the economic impact from trade uncertainties and sluggish manufacturing activities.
However, despite the higher overall figure, activity in the property industry contracted, the statistics bureau said in a statement.

The services sector has been propped up by Chinese consumers' rising wages and robust spending power in recent years. However, the sector softened late last year amid a broader slowdown.

635,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 30, 2019 01:21PM ET</span>",Some temporary weights on U.S. inflation ease in July,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Reserve's favored measure of inflation increased last month at the pace expected by Wall Street for the first time this year.
Consumer prices outside food and energy rose 1.6% in the year through July, and the details behind the increase could bolster Fed Chair Jerome Powell's argument that some of the weakness in inflation this year owes to temporary factors that will lift with time.
However, the Fed has been frustrated by underperforming prices during most months since it set a 2% inflation target in 2012.
Given the odd mix of factors conspiring to keep inflation below target, it may be too soon for the central bank to relax its guard against a slippage in inflation.
WEAK EXPECTATIONS
Wall Street experts have been regularly caught off guard by weak consumer prices this year, which has helped fuel expectations for Fed interest rate cuts.
The persistence of weak inflation despite a healthy job market would give the Fed more space to counter economic weakness created by the U.S.-China trade war and cooling global economy.
(Graphic: below_target link: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/12/5478/5428/BELOW_TARGET_INFLATION.png)
TEMPORARY FACTORS
Powell argued in a May news conference that some of the weakness in inflation in recent months had owed to temporary factors like a sharp drop in apparel costs and softness in the prices for portfolio management prices.
In July, those two factors helped create the more stable inflation reading, with portfolio management price gains accelerating and prices for apparel falling at a slower pace.
(Graphic: portfolio_apparel link: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/12/5480/5430/portfolio_apparel.png)
MARKET VOLATILITY
Prices for apparel fell sharply in year-over-year terms after the government changed its methodology for collecting the data in March, but recently the weakness has abated some.
Portfolio management costs weakened sharply in December and January following a plunge in the U.S. stock market. A subsequent recovery in equity prices has helped portfolio managers charge more for their services, although a recent stock market downturn might point to cooler price gains down the road.

636,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 30, 2019 12:55PM ET</span>",Strong consumer spending propping up U.S. economy,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. consumer spending increased solidly in July as households bought a range of goods and services, which could further allay financial market fears of a recession, but the strong pace of consumption is unlikely to be sustained amid tepid income gains.
The report from the Commerce Department on Friday added to July trade and inventory data in suggesting that while the economy was slowing, it was not losing altitude rapidly for now. But risks to the longest economic expansion in history are mounting, mostly from a year-long trade war between the United States and China. 
The trade fight between the two economic giants has spooked financial markets and caused an inversion of the U.S. yield curve, which has stoked fears that the economic expansion now in its 11th year is in danger of being derailed by a recession.
""Even with elevated policy uncertainty and financial market turbulence, the U.S. consumer continues to display great vitality, emboldened by a large savings buffer,"" said Lydia Boussour, senior U.S. economist at Oxford Economics in New York.
Consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, rose 0.6% last month after an unrevised 0.3% gain in June, the government said. 
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast consumer spending advancing 0.5% last month. Consumer spending is being driven by a strong labor market, which is marked by the lowest unemployment rate in nearly 50 years, and better job security.
But with Washington due to slap additional tariffs on Chinese goods on Sept. 1 and in December, there are concerns that consumer spending could take a hit.
A survey from the University of Michigan on Friday showed its consumer sentiment index in August dropping by the most since December 2012, amid nervousness about the trade tensions. 
Earlier this week, a survey from the Conference Board, which focuses heavily on the labor market, showed a mild drop in consumer sentiment in August. The stock market has a bigger weighting in the University of Michigan consumer sentiment survey.
""The link between sentiment and spending is not especially tight, but the recent decline in consumer sentiment could be a sign that the spending data will soften soon,"" said Daniel Silver, an economist at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) in New York.
The U.S.-China trade conflict has weighed heavily on manufacturing and business investment, which contracted in the second quarter. That, together with slowing global growth as well as persistently low domestic inflation, will likely see the Federal Reserve cutting interest rates again next month. 
Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said last week that the economy was in a ""favorable place,"" but reiterated that the U.S. central bank would ""act as appropriate"" to keep the economic expansion on track. The Fed lowered its short-term interest rate by 25 basis points last month for the first time since 2008, citing trade tensions and slowing global growth.
The dollar firmed against a basket of currencies, while U.S. Treasury prices fell. Stocks on Wall Street were trading higher.
LOW INFLATION
Consumer prices as measured by the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index rose 0.2% in July as a drop in the cost of food was offset by a surge in energy goods and services. The PCE price index edged up 0.1% in June.
In the 12 months through July, the PCE price index increased 1.4% after gaining 1.3% in June. 
Excluding the volatile food and energy components, the PCE price index rose 0.2% last month, matching June's increase. That kept the annual increase in the so-called core PCE price index at 1.6% in July. 
The core PCE index is the Fed's preferred inflation measure and has undershot the U.S. central bank's 2% target this year.
""While the shorter-term trend in core prices has picked up, the low yearly rate, along with the recent escalation in trade protectionism, can only spur the Fed to pull the easing trigger again on Sept. 18,"" said Sal Guatieri, a senior economist at BMO Capital Markets in Toronto.
When adjusted for inflation, consumer spending increased 0.4% in July. This so-called real consumer spending rose 0.2% in June. Last month's jump in core consumer spending suggested consumption remained strong early in the third quarter after it surged at its fastest pace in 4-1/2 years in the second quarter.
The economy grew at a 2.0% annualized rate in the second quarter, slowing from the January-March quarter's brisk 3.1% pace. Growth estimates for the third quarter range from a 1.5% rate to a 2.3% pace.
The economy is largely losing speed as the stimulus from the White House's $1.5 trillion tax-cut package and a government spending blitz fades. 
Last month, spending on goods surged 0.9%, driven by outlays on recreational goods and motor vehicles. Spending on services increased 0.5%. Consumer spending in July was supported by savings as personal income edged up 0.1%, the smallest rise since last September. That followed a 0.5% increase in June. 

Wages increased 0.2% and personal interest income fell 1.8%. Savings fell to $1.27 trillion, the lowest level since November 2018, from $1.32 trillion in June.

The University of Michigan's final sentiment index fell to 89.8 in August from a previously reported 92.1 and 98.4 in July, data showed Friday. The gauge of current conditions dropped to the lowest since October 2016, while the expectations index matched January as the weakest since that same period.
Key Insights
 


The increasingly downbeat mood suggests growing concern about trade policy uncertainty and a potential economic downturn are weighing on attitudes. Sentiment may face further headwinds as the trade war with China escalates, with additional tariffs set to go into effect Sept. 1.


 


The 8.6-point drop from July was the largest since December 2012, while the 89.8 reading for the sentiment index was the lowest since October 2016.


 


Buying attitudes toward appliances, home electronics and other household durables fell to a five-year low on tariff concerns. Attitudes toward buying vehicles declined to the lowest level since 2013, with references to high prices reaching the highest since 1997, according to the report.


 


The data follow somewhat mixed consumer sentiment readings. The Conference Board's confidence measure eased in August but posted the best assessment of current conditions since 2000. Bloomberg's weekly comfort gauge rose for a second week, but the monthly expectations gauge fell to a five- month low as more Americans said the economy is getting worse.


 
Official's View
“ The recent decline is due to negative references to tariffs, which were spontaneously mentioned by one in three consumers,” Richard Curtin, director of the University of Michigan consumer survey, said in a statement. “ Trump’s tariff policies have been subject to repeated reversals amid threats of higher future tariffs. Such tactics may have some merit in negotiations with China, but they act to increase uncertainty and diminish consumer spending at home.”

The economic outlook for the next 12 months fell to the lowest since January, while the five-year outlook also tumbled.
Views of expectations for personal finances plunged more than previously reported from a July level that was the highest since 2003. Attitudes on the current situation also fell.
Consumer expectations for inflation edged up, with price gains over the coming year rising to 2.7% from 2.6% in July. Five-year estimates were up to 2.6% after 2.5% the prior month. 
A measure of home buying attitudes remained near recent lows.
Economists had expected an upward revision to the sentiment measure to 92.4.
Interviews were conducted July 31 to Aug. 26.

BRASILIA (Reuters) - Brazil's unemployment rate fell to 11.8% in the three months through July, statistics agency IBGE said on Friday, below market expectations and the lowest this year in another sign that the economy may be slowly turning a corner for the better.
Brazil's unemployment rate has fallen almost a full percentage point since March, and the news comes a day after figures showed that the economy expanded twice as fast as economists had expected in the second quarter.
The unemployment rate in the three months to July fell from 12.0% in the three months to June, below the median forecast in a Reuters poll of 11.9% and the lowest since December.
In the preceding three-month period from February to April, the jobless rate was 12.5%, IBGE said.
The number of Brazilians out of work fell by 609,000 in the period, or by 4.6%, to 12.6 million. That is still a high number, however, which reflects a large amount of slack in the labor market and is little changed from a year ago.
The underemployment rate, which hit a record 25.0% earlier this year, fell 0.4 percentage points to 24.6%, also little changed from a year earlier, IBGE said.

HONG KONG (Reuters) - Hong Kong's July retail sales sank by the most since February 2016 amid anti-government protests that have gripped the Chinese-ruled city for months.
Retail sales in July fell 11.4% from a year earlier, government data showed on Friday, as social unrest hurt consumer sentiment and visitor arrivals started to fall.
Unrest in Hong Kong escalated in mid-June over a now-suspended extradition bill that would have allowed people to be sent to mainland China for trial in Communist Party-controlled courts.
The protests, which at times have turned violent, have evolved into broader calls for democracy for the former British colony which returned to Chinese rule in 1997.
Retail sales fell to HK$34.4 billion ($4.4 billion) in July, a sixth consecutive month of declines. June's decline was 6.7%. In volume terms, retail sales in July fell 13%, compared with a 7.6% fall in June.
For the first seven months of 2019, retail sales fell 3.8% in value from a year earlier and 4.4% in volume terms.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Euro zone inflation remained low at 1.0% in August, well below the European Central Bank's target, a first estimate showed on Friday, bolstering market expectations that the bank will further ease monetary policy next month.
The European Union's statistics office said on Friday that inflation in the 19 countries sharing the euro was unchanged from the July reading, in line with expectations in a Reuters poll.
The rates of price increases in July and August are the lowest since November 2016, well below the ECB's inflation target of below, but close to, 2% despite years of unprecedented monetary stimulus through rate cuts and trillions of euros of bond purchases.
Economists said the latest economic data strengthened the case for further loosening monetary policy.
""There is nothing in today's data releases to change the minds of ECB policymakers meeting the week after next: we still expect them to cut the deposit rate from -0.4% to -0.5% and to provide further strong hints that more QE is on the way,"" Capital Economics' Andrew Kenningham wrote in a note.
The ECB's Governing Council holds its next monetary policy meeting on Sept. 12 and has all but promised a stimulus package, with economic growth faltering amid a global trade war and Germany's manufacturing sector already in recession.
Market expectations are that it will carry out several interest rate cuts in the coming year, along with a fresh round of bond purchases, commonly known as quantitative easing.
The ECB's measures are also set to include a way to compensate commercial banks for the side effects of negative interest rates.
Core inflation, which strips out volatile unprocessed food and energy and which the ECB scrutinizes in policy decisions, was steady at 1.1% in August.
The even narrower measure excluding also alcohol and tobacco prices that many market economists look at was unchanged at 0.9%.
Eurostat's flash estimate for the month does not include a monthly calculation.
The low overall level of inflation strengthens the case for a package of ECB measures to support the economy and faster inflation.
The ECB's problem is that inflation has undershot its target since 2013 despite a lengthy economic boom, which saw the creation of over 10 million jobs.
Such an expansion should have fueled inflation already but hidden slack in the labor market, the growing share of services in the economy and the population's ageing, all kept a lid on price growth.
While the bank has argued that inflation would eventually come, it has already exhausted much of its firepower and now faces economic turbulence with a relatively depleted arsenal that could force it to once again to reinvent its policy toolkit.
The ECB is also facing the added difficulty that much of the current economic weakness is due to external factors, such as Brexit, a trade war and China's own slowdown, against which monetary policy is largely ineffective.
While the ECB is unlikely to admit that the current troubles are outside its control, economists say that the best it can hope for is to prop up confidence and preserve already favorable financing conditions.
Separately, the jobless rate in the euro zone was 7.5% in July, unchanged compared to a month earlier, Eurostat data showed."
641,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 30, 2019 05:15AM ET</span>",Euro-Area Inflation Stuck at 1% as ECB Counts Down to Stimulus,"(Bloomberg) -- Euro-area inflation remained stuck well below the European Central Bank’s goal this month, providing more reason for policy makers to unleash measures next month to jolt prices and growth.
The 1% rate, in line economists’ estimates, compares with the ECB goal of just under 2%. The core measure, which excludes more volatile elements such as energy, food and tobacco, was even lower, at 0.9%.
Inflation has been on a downward trajectory for months and is now about half the rate it was a year ago. That’s prompted a rethink among policy makers, who may respond with more monetary stimulus next month.
In his penultimate decision as ECB chief, Mario Draghi is expected to cut interest rates even deeper into negative territory and potentially also restart quantitative easing. However, not every member of the Governing Council may be on board with aggressive loosening. Dutch Governor Klaas Knot said the outlook isn’t yet weak enough to warrant the resumption of bond purchases, and Germany’s Jens Weidmann said speculation over a large stimulus package “doesn’t do justice” to the latest data.
By adding stimulus, the ECB would be joining other central banks around the world, who have responded to the global slowdown with their own interest-rate cuts. The ECB meets on Sept. 12 in Frankfurt.
While the falling inflation rate has been a source of concern for policy makers, the labor market in the euro zone has been a font of optimism.
The region’s unemployment rate has marched steadily downward during the past several years from a high of 12.2% in 2013. Data Friday showed it was at 7.5% in July, unchanged from June and staying at the lowest since 2008."

House prices rose 0.6% year-on-year after a 0.3% rise in July, Nationwide said. On the month, prices were flat.
British house price growth has sagged since the 2016 Brexit referendum - especially in London and neighboring areas - but at a national level the market appears to have stabilized, surveys suggest.
""With the economy struggling and the outlook currently highly uncertain, we suspect that house prices will remain soft despite the recent pick-up in housing market activity - which could well prove temporary,"" said Howard Archer, chief economist adviser to the EY ITEM Club consultancy.

GfK’s headline confidence measure dropped to minus 14, its joint lowest since July 2013, when the U.K. flirted with recession. The figure equaled consumer confidence at the start of 2019, when then-Prime Minister Theresa May’s Withdrawal Agreement was rejected for the first time.
A separate report by Lloyds (LON:LLOY) found that business optimism crashed in August to the lowest since 2011.All five components of the GfK measures fell this month, led by people’s view of their future personal finances, and the future of the British economy in general. The index for willingness to make major purchases fell to 1 from 4 in July.
“If there is a continuation of that dip in our feelings about our future wallets, we’d quickly see a headline score crash to a level that approaches the worrying figures seen in the worst days of the 2008/2009 financial crisis,” said Joe Staton, client strategy director at GfK.
The scores could indicate more pain for an already hurting British economy The U.K. posted its first quarterly contraction since 2012 in the second quarter, and on Wednesday Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s decision to suspend parliament next month battered the pound as no-deal Brexit anxiety heightened."

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's industrial output rebounded more than expected in July, offering a hopeful sign for the economy and its manufacturers pressured by slowing global demand and a protracted Sino-U.S. trade war.
However, retail sales fell at a faster pace, suggesting that domestic demand may be weaker than previously thought and signaling possible strains for private spending in coming months.
Industrial output rose 1.3% in July, government data showed, more than a median market forecast for a 0.3% gain. It followed a sharp 3.3% drop in the previous month.
Output was pushed up by increased production of cars and chemicals, offsetting a decline for oil products, the data showed.
Manufacturers surveyed by the trade ministry expect output to rise 1.3% in August, but fall again by 1.6% in September.
Friday's data set paints a mixed picture for Japan's economy, the world's third-largest, whose outlook has been clouded by global pressures and early signs of weakness in business sentiment.
""These (output) projections tend to be too optimistic and we think that output will be broadly flat in August,"" Marcel Thieliant, senior Japan economist at Capital Economics, said in a note to clients. 
""That means that even if it doesn't fall any further in September, it would shrink a little in the third quarter, consistent with weak GDP growth.""
So far, the export-reliant economy has avoided buckling under a slowdown in overseas demand and expanded an annualized 1.8% in the second-quarter, largely thanks to robust household consumption and capital expenditure.
Japanese exporters also hold hopes for a speedy resolution to bilateral trade negotiations between Washington and Tokyo after U.S. President Donald Trump and Prime Minister Shinzo Abe on Sunday announced an agreement on the core principles of a limited trade deal.
But business expectations have dimmed recently. Japanese manufacturers turned pessimistic about business prospects for the first time in more than six years in August as the specter of a global downturn looms large, the monthly Reuters Tankan survey showed last week.
Japan's exports slipped for an eighth month in July as China-bound sales slumped again in a fresh sign the Sino-U.S. trade war could hurt the economy.
Separate data on Friday showed domestic demand might slow in coming months as retail sales dropped 2.0% in July from a year earlier, reflecting recent weakness in household sentiment, above the median estimate for a 0.8% drop.
Tokyo's core consumer prices (CPI) index, which includes oil products but excludes fresh food prices, rose 0.7% in August from a year earlier. The figure matched the level seen in June last year and was the lowest since May 2018 when the index grew 0.5%.
The jobless rate fell to 2.2% in July, while the availability of jobs decreased, government data showed.
The jobs-to-applicants ratio declined to 1.59 in July, down from June and the median estimate of 1.61.

The Lloyds (LON:LLOY) Bank Business Barometer slid to 1% from 13% in July, its lowest level since December 2011, when Britain was struggling to recover from the global financial crisis.
Separately, a survey of consumer confidence from market research company GfK was its joint weakest since mid-2013, driven lower by deepening pessimism about the economy.
Overall, the reports added to signs that Britain's economy is likely to struggle to bounce back from its contraction in the second quarter, the first time it shrank since 2012. Britain would be in recession if growth contracts in the third quarter.
""We have seen a dip in overall business confidence this month, with firms appearing less positive about their own trading prospects and the broader economy,"" Hann-Ju Ho, senior economist at Lloyds Bank Commercial Banking, said.
Business confidence declined in every region of the United Kingdom, Lloyds said, although the fall was steepest in the manufacturing-heavy East Midlands region of England.
British manufacturers, who account for about 10% of the country's economy, are facing the possibility of a no-deal Brexit which is likely to hurt their supply chains, plus a slowdown in the global economy.
At -14, the GfK survey was the weakest since January, before which it had been lower only in mid-2013. All the survey's components, including the outlook for personal finances and the economy, declined in August.
""Until Brexit leaves the front pages – whenever that will be – consumers can be forgiven for feeling nervous not just about the wider economy but also about their financial situation,"" Joe Staton, client strategy director at GfK, said."

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. economic growth slowed in the second quarter, the government confirmed on Thursday, but the strongest consumer spending in 4-1/2 years amid a solid labor market threw cold water on financial market expectations of a recession.
Signs that the economy was growing at a moderate pace and not slowing rapidly were underscored by other data showing a narrowing in the goods trade deficit in July as exports rebounded. Businesses stepped up inventory accumulation last month, likely in anticipation that demand would remain strong.
Consumers have so far shown no signs of pulling back, with retail sales powering ahead in July. But there are fears the Trump administration's year-long trade war with China, which will see additional tariffs on Chinese goods coming into effect in September and December, could take the sails out of consumer spending. 
The deterioration in trade relations between the two economic giants has roiled global stock markets and triggered an inversion of the U.S. Treasury yield curve, fanning fears that the longest economic expansion in history was in danger of being interrupted by a recession.
Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said last week that the economy was in a ""favorable place,"" but reiterated that the U.S. central bank would ""act as appropriate"" to keep the economic expansion on track.
""The economy is still on cruise control and growing at a slow but steady pace that looks sustainable as the trade wind skies continue to darken,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG in New York.
Gross domestic product increased at a 2.0% annualized rate, the government said in its second reading of second-quarter GDP on Thursday. That was a downward revision from the 2.1% pace estimated last month. 
The small downgrade was in line with economists' expectations. The economy grew at a 3.1% rate in the January-March quarter. It expanded 2.6% in the first half of the year.
The dollar (DXY) rose against a basket of currencies, while U.S. Treasury prices fell. Stocks on Wall Street rose, boosted in part by a hopeful tone from China on a resolution of the trade dispute with Washington.
When measured from the income side, the U.S. economy grew at a 2.1% rate in the second quarter. Gross domestic income (GDI) increased at a 3.2% pace in the January-March quarter.
The average of GDP and GDI, also referred to as gross domestic output and considered a better measure of economic activity, rose at a 2.1% rate last quarter, slowing from a 3.2% pace of growth in the first three months of the year.
The income side of the growth ledger was supported by a rebound in profits after two straight quarterly declines. After-tax profits without inventory valuation and capital consumption adjustment, which correspond to S&P 500 profits, increased at a 4.8% rate after dropping 1.5% in the first quarter.
The economy is largely losing speed as the stimulus from the White House's $1.5 trillion tax-cut package and a government spending blitz fades. Economists are forecasting growth this year around 2.5%, below the Trump administration's 3% target.
GOODS TRADE DEFICIT NARROWS
The U.S.-China trade war has weighed heavily on manufacturing and business investment, which contracted in the second quarter.
That is expected to keep the Fed on track to cut interest rates by another quarter-percentage-point cut next month. The Fed lowered its short-term interest rate by 25 basis points last month for the first time since 2008, citing trade tensions and slowing global growth. 
But the economy appears to have maintained its moderate pace of growth early in the third quarter. In another report on Thursday, the Commerce Department said the goods trade deficit narrowed 2.5% to $72.3 billion in July as exports rebounded. 
Exports of goods rose 0.7% as an acceleration in shipments of motor vehicles, capital and consumer goods offset a plunge in industrial supplies and agricultural exports. The decline in agricultural shipments probably reflects a drop in soybean exports to China. 
Goods imports fell 0.4% last month, led by a sharp drop in capital goods. Weak capital goods imports suggests business investment could remain subdued after contracting in the second quarter for the first time since the first quarter of 2016. 
The department also reported retail inventories jumped 0.8% in July after falling 0.3% in the prior month. Retail inventories, excluding motor vehicles and parts, the component that goes into the calculation of GDP, rebounded 0.3% last month after dropping 0.2% in June.
""These data suggest any further (growth) slowdown in the third quarter will be modest,"" said Paul Ashworth, chief U.S. economist at Capital Economics in Toronto.
Growth in consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, surged at a 4.7% rate in the second quarter. That was the fastest since the fourth quarter of 2014 and was an upward revision from the 4.3% pace estimated last month.
Consumer spending is being driven by the lowest unemployment rate in nearly 50 years. A report from the Labor Department on Thursday showed the number of Americans filing for state unemployment benefits increased slightly last week.
The GDP report showed the trade deficit widened to $982.5 billion in the second quarter instead of $978.7 billion as reported last month. Trade cut 0.72 percentage point from GDP growth last quarter instead of 0.65 percentage point as previously reported.
Growth in inventories was revised down to a $69.0 billion rate in the second quarter from the previously estimated $71.7 billion pace. Inventories chopped 0.91 percentage point from GDP growth last quarter instead of 0.86 percentage point as reported in July. The slowdown in inventory accumulation reflects robust consumer spending.
Business investment declined at an unrevised 0.6% rate in the second quarter. It was pulled down by a 9.4% pace of decline in spending on structures, which reflected drops in commercial and healthcare, and mining exploration, shafts and wells. 
Government investment was trimmed as state and local government spending was not as strong as initially thought. Spending on homebuilding contracted for a sixth straight quarter, the longest such stretch since the Great Recession.

The NAR's pending home sales index dropped 2.5% last month to 105.6. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast pending home sales would be flat during the month.
Pending home contracts are seen as a forward-looking indicator of the health of the housing market because they become sales one to two months later.
The U.S. housing sector has been in a rut for most of the last year despite a sharp drop in mortgage interest rates. Pending home sales were down 0.3% in the 12 months through July.
With a U.S.-China trade war intensifying and the global economy slowing, the U.S. Federal Reserve signaled early this year that it no longer planned to raise rates in 2019 and in July the Fed cut rates for the first time since 2008. Mortgage rates have been falling throughout 2019.
While the U.S. jobless rate has remained historically low, investors are betting that worries about the economy and trade conflicts could lead the Fed to cut rates further.
""Super-low mortgage rates have not yet consistently pulled buyers back into the market,"" said Lawrence Yun, NAR chief economist. “Economic uncertainty is no doubt holding back some potential demand, but what is desperately needed is more supply of moderately priced homes.”"

The European Commission said on Thursday its Economic Sentiment Indicator (ESI) for Britain fell to 92.5 from 94.3 in July, its lowest level since September 2012.
The drop came despite an uptick in morale in the struggling manufacturing sector, toward which the ESI is heavily weighted.
British manufacturers, who account for about 10% of the country's economy, are facing the possibility of a no-deal Brexit which is likely to hurt their supply chains, plus a slowdown in the global economy.
Overall, the ESI added to signs that Britain's economy could struggle to rebound meaningfully from its contraction in the second quarter, the first time it shrank since 2012.
Until recently, consumers had largely taken Brexit in their stride, helped by wages that have been growing at the fastest pace in more than a decade and modest inflation.
That helped to support growth at a time when many companies were cutting back on investment because of uncertainty about Brexit. But it also left the economy reliant on consumer spending.
""August's ... survey of UK business and consumer confidence raises concern that the consumer sector may soon succumb to the malaise that has taken hold in the manufacturing sector,"" Gabriella Dickens, economist at consultancy Capital Economics, said.
(Graphic: UK economic sentiment link: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/polling/1/605/601/uk%20economic%20sentiment.png)
The European Commission said inflation expectations among British consumers hit their highest level since 1990, possibly reflecting the pound's fall to its lowest level in three years against other currencies in the first half of August.

BERLIN (Reuters) - German inflation slowed in August and unemployment rose, data showed on Thursday, adding to signs that Europe's largest economy is running out of steam and cementing expectations of a new European Central Bank stimulus package next month.
Consumer prices, harmonized with inflation data from other European Union countries (HICP), rose 1.0% year-on-year after an increase of 1.1% in July, the Federal Statistics Office said.
The August reading undershot a Reuters forecast for 1.2%, was the lowest level since November 2016, and marked a fourth month running well below the ECB's target of close to but below 2% for the euro zone as a whole.
Separate German Labour Office data showed seasonally adjusted unemployment rose 4,000 on the month in August, eroding a pillar of growth that has helped support an economy whose traditionally powerful export engine is sputtering and that could well slip into recession in the current quarter.
With its sales abroad hit by a worsening trade climate, a global economic slowdown and an increasingly chaotic run-up to Brexit, the bulk of Germany's growth momentum is been generated domestically - a dependency that leaves it exposed to any weakening of the jobs market.
""All of this only means that the protection shield against the industrial slowdown and external woes is getting thinner if not wearing out,"" ING economist Carsten Brzeski said of the rise in unemployment.
With its inflation target seemingly as distant as ever, the ECB has all but promised a stimulus package for its Sept. 12 policy meeting, and investors are already pricing in several rate cuts for the coming year and another round of bond purchases.
Thursday's German inflation data will have done nothing to water down those expectations.
On the month, EU-harmonized prices fell by 0.1% after an increase of 0.4% in July. The market had expected an unchanged reading. The national inflation figure (CPI) eased to 1.4% year-on-year from 1.7%, mainly due to a slower rise in energy prices.
Germany's preliminary consumer price data does not include a figure for core inflation, which excludes the more volatile energy and food prices. Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) economist Marco Wagner said that reading probably fell to 1.4% from 1.6%. 
He said underlying inflation should pick up in the longer term as, despite the ""current economic soft patch"" employment was enjoying a boom and wages, by German standards, were continuing to rise substantially.
So companies would struggle to avoid passing some of their rising costs on to consumers sooner or later, he added.

ECB Vice President Luis de Guindos said on Tuesday the bank must be critical of market expectations for its future policy moves, basing its decision on economic data rather than financial market prices.

Initial claims for state unemployment benefits increased 4,000 to a seasonally adjusted 215,000 for the week ended Aug. 24, the Labor Department said on Thursday. Data for the prior week was revised to show 2,000 more applications received than previously reported.
Last week's increase in claims was in line with economists' expectations. The Labor Department said only claims for the Virgin Islands were estimated last week.
The four-week moving average of initial claims, considered a better measure of labor market trends as it irons out week-to-week volatility, slipped 500 to 214,500 last week.
Layoffs have remained low despite a protracted trade war between the United States and China, which is crimping economic growth by undercutting business investment and manufacturing.
But the pace of job growth has been slowing since 2018. The government estimated last week that the economy created 501,000 fewer jobs in the 12 months through March 2019 than previously reported, the biggest downward revision in the level of employment in a decade.
According to economists at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM), this meant that job growth over that period averaged around 170,000 per month instead of 210,000. The government will publish the revised payrolls data next February.
Still, the pace of employment gains remains well above the roughly 100,000 jobs needed per month to keep up with growth in the working-age population. Sustained labor market strength is supporting the economy through strong consumer spending.
For now, that is helping to calm concerns of a recession, which were fanned by a sell-off on Wall Street and an inversion of the U.S. Treasury yield curve.
Thursday's claims report also showed the number of people receiving benefits after an initial week of aid increased 22,000 to 1.70 million for the week ended Aug. 17. The four-week moving average of the so-called continuing claims dipped 250 to 1.70 million.
The continuing claims data covered the week of the household survey from which August's unemployment rate will be calculated. The four-week average of continuing claims was little changed between the July and August survey periods, suggesting the jobless rate could hold steady at 3.7%."

The European Commission's monthly sentiment showed the overall index for the 19 countries sharing the euro at 103.1 points versus 102.7 in the previous month. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast 102.3.
The European Central Bank is expected to announce a stimulus package at its Sept. 12 policy meeting and market expectations have been growing, with investors already pricing in several rate cuts for the coming year and a fresh round of bond purchases, commonly known as quantitative easing.
The increase in the August sentiment index was due mainly to higher confidence in industry where the index improved to -5.9 from -7.3 a month earlier, as managers showed more optimism in production expectations, the current level of overall order books and the stocks of finished products.
The services index eased to 9.3 from 10.6 while consumer confidence fell to -7.1 from -6.6 amid worries about the general economic situation.
Separately, the business climate indicator, which points to the phase of the business cycle, improved to 0.11 points in August from -0.11 a month earlier."

The number of people out of work increased by 4,000 to 2.29 million in August, the fourth straight month that joblessness failed to drop after six years of almost continuous decline. The unemployment rate remained at 5%, near a record low.
A labor-market downturn could tip Europe’s largest economy into a recession. Manufacturing is already contracting, hit by a slump in exports amid global trade and political tensions. Higher unemployment threatens to hit the consumer spending that has so far kept the services sector robust.
The government, after years of running a budget surplus, has signaled it’s willing to step in with fiscal support if needed. Higher joblessness could give Chancellor Angela Merkel the justification to act.
The German economy shrank 0.1% in the second quarter and the Bundesbank is among institutions expecting another decline in the current three months. That would meet the typical definition of a recession.
Business confidence fell for a fifth month in August, and blue-chip companies including Henkel and Continental have cut their profit expectations for the year. Consumers are turning more pessimistic in surveys.
The European Central Bank has also called on Germany to use the leeway in its budget, as the nation’s woes threaten to exacerbate economic weakness in the euro zone as whole. German inflation due later Thursday is forecast to come in at 1.2% for August, a slight improvement on July but still feeble enough to drag on the ECB’s goal of just under 2% for the currency bloc.
ECB policy makers are widely expected to cut interest rates further below zero when they meet on Sept. 12."

The euro zone's second biggest economy grew 0.3% in the quarter, unchanged from the previous three months, the INSEE statistics agency said, revising the figure up from a provisional estimate of 0.2%
The relative resilience of the French economy contrasts sharply with the export-dependent German economy, which contracted 0.1% in the period as global trade tensions and the uncertainty over Britain's exit from the European Union took their toll.
In France, consumer spending growth - traditionally the motor of the broader economy - slowed to 0.2% from 0.3% in the first quarter.
Higher inflation ate into consumers' purchasing power, as households disposable income fell 0.2% after surging 0.8% in the first quarter due to a package of tax breaks and bonus schemes aimed at putting more money in the pockets of the poor.
The slower consumer spending was partially offset by a pick-up in business investment, which grew 0.9% after 0.6% in the first quarter as corporate profit margins increased to 33.1% - the highest since mid 2008 - from 32.6%.
Separately, INSEE said that consumer spending grew 0.4% in July from June, against economists' expectations for an increase of 0.3%."

NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. mortgage applications recorded their biggest weekly drop in over four months as home borrowing costs posted their first broad increase in six weeks, the Mortgage Bankers Association said on Wednesday.
Mortgage rates rose last week prompted by volatility in the Treasuries markets as investors fretted over the trade conflict between China and the United States and its impact on an already softening global economy.
This uncertain outlook will likely curb interest in home buying and potential borrowers from seeking a mortgage.
""Uncertainty over the near-term economic outlook and low supply continue to be the predominant headwinds for prospective homebuyers,” Joel Kan, MBA’s associate vice president of economic and industry forecasting, said in a statement.
The Washington-based industry group's seasonally adjusted index on loan requests to buy a home and to refinance one fell 6.2% to 576.2 in the week ended Aug. 23. This was the steepest decline since a 7.3% fall in the week of April 19.
The average interest rate for 30-year fixed-rate mortgages, with conforming loan balances of $484,350 or less, climbed to 3.94% from prior week's 3.90%, which was the lowest since November 2016.
The 30-year rate on conforming mortgages has fallen 44 basis points so far this year. 
Average interest rates on most fixed-rate home loans MBA tracks edged up 1 basis point from the prior week, while the average rate on five-year adjustable mortgages jumped to 3.42% from 3.35% the prior week.
As borrowing costs turned higher, refinancing activity fell 7.6% last week, while loan applications to buy a home declined by 4%.
The refinancing share of total applications shrank to 62.4% from 62.7% the week before.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australian construction spending slid to its lowest in almost three years last quarter as a deepening downturn in home building spread to other sectors and posed a downside risk to growth across the economy.
The weakness in housing is also unlikely to turn anytime soon as the industry wrestles with an overabundance of new apartment blocks begun when the market was red-hot.
Wednesday's figures from the Australian Bureau of Statistics showed inflation-adjusted construction spending fell 3.8% in the June quarter, from the previous quarter, to stand at A$48.8 billion ($32.96 billion). That was the lowest amount since late 2016 and off 11.1% from a year earlier.
The quarterly drop was far steeper than the 1% fall forecast by analysts and suggested gross domestic product (GDP) might also miss estimates, perhaps badly. The data is due on Sept. 4.
""With construction representing around 13% of the economy this result will dent GDP, potentially in the order of 0.4 percentage points,"" said Westpac senior economist Andrew Hanlan.
""The housing downturn still has further to go and will weigh on conditions throughout 2019 and into 2020.""
Analysts had thought the economy grew around 0.6% in the quarter, which would be a pick up from a poor first quarter. Yet annual growth would still slow to its lowest in a decade at 1.5%, dragged mainly by dismal consumer spending.
While the country's resource exporters have been buoyed by strong Chinese demand, consumers have labored with miserly growth in wages and incomes.
The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) has already reacted by cutting interest rates to a record low of 1%, and markets are wagering it will have to go all the way to 0.5%.
RBA Deputy Governor Guy Debelle this week confirmed unconventional policies such as buying bonds would be considered if yet further stimulus was then needed.
LESS WORK, LOWER PROFITS
The ongoing slump in home building suggested some sort of action might be necessary. Residential work sank 5.1% in the June quarter to the lowest since 2015, and it's playing havoc with firms in the sector.
Just this week, shares in Australia's largest building materials maker Boral Ltd (AX:BLD) suffered their sharpest one-day loss after issuing a stark warning on profits as a drop off in new homes swamped strength in infrastructure.
""Housing moves a lot faster than infrastructure does,"" was how chief executive Mike Kane explained the downturn.
Cement maker  Adelaide Brighton  (AX:ABC) on Wednesday, reported a 35% drop in half-year profit and saw no turnaround in residential construction until 2021.
One potential bright spot is that home prices looked to have turned a corner after two years of decline, helped by lower mortgage rates and an easing in lending rules.
Data from property consultant CoreLogic out on Monday showed home prices across the capital cities had risen 0.7% in August so far, the largest rise since 2017.
Crucially, values in the largest markets of Sydney and Melbourne were up 1% on the month so far in a major turnaround.
""The consumer is the major domestic source of downside risk in the economy, and the better tone in the housing market is helping,"" said CBA chief economist Michael Blythe.

""The drag on consumer spending from a negative 'wealth effect' should be receding as a result,"" he added. ""A turn in the price cycle should also be a positive for consumer confidence.""

659,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 27, 2019 12:56PM ET</span>",U.S. consumer confidence falls but only slightly despite trade fight,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. consumer confidence fell less than expected in August, with households still upbeat about the labor market despite an escalation in trade tensions, which has cast a shadow over the longest economic expansion in history.
While the survey from the Conference Board on Tuesday did not change expectations that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates again next month, it further reduced the chances of an aggressive easing to counter the effects of the U.S.-China trade war, including tighter financial conditions.
Fed Chair Jerome Powell told a conference of central bankers last week that the economy was in a ""favorable place,"" but reiterated that the U.S. central bank would ""act as appropriate"" to keep the economic expansion, now in its 11th year, on track. 
The Fed lowered its short-term interest rate by 25 basis points last month for the first time since 2008, citing trade tensions and slowing global growth. Financial markets have fully priced in another quarter-percentage-point cut at the Fed's Sept. 17-18 policy meeting.
""The consumer remains confident despite the ongoing trade war between the U.S. and China and this bodes well for the economic outlook in the second half of the year,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG in New York. ""Consumers may have even seen July's rate cut as good medicine for the economy which will help keep the economy on the sustainable growth path.""
The Conference Board said its consumer confidence index slipped to a reading of 135.1 this month from a slightly upwardly revised 135.8 in July. The index was previously reported at 135.7 in July. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast it dropping to 129.5 in August.
The survey's present situation measure rose to 177.2, the highest reading since November 2000, from 170.9 in July.
The Conference Board, however, cautioned that if the trade conflict persists, ""it could potentially dampen consumers' optimism regarding the short-term economic outlook."" Consumers' expectations, based on their short-term outlook for income, business and labor market conditions, slipped to a reading of 107.0 this month from 112.4 in July.
President Donald Trump on Friday announced a new round of tariffs on Chinese imports, hours after Beijing unveiled retaliatory tariffs on $75 billion worth of U.S. goods. On Monday, the two economic powerhouses sought to ease tensions, with Beijing calling for calm and Trump predicting a deal.
The Conference Board survey's findings are in stark contrast with a University of Michigan survey, which showed consumer sentiment dropping to a seven-month low in early August and a measure of current conditions hitting its lowest level since late 2016. According to the University of Michigan, monetary and trade policies had heightened consumers' uncertainty about their future financial prospects. 
The Conference Board survey places more emphasis on the labor market, while the stock market has a huge influence on the University of Michigan survey.
The dollar was little changed against a basket of currencies, while U.S. Treasury prices rose. Stocks on Wall Street were lower.
SOLID LABOR MARKET 
The Conference Board survey's so-called labor market differential, derived from data on respondents' views on whether jobs are plentiful or hard to get, jumped to 39.4 in August from 33.1 in July. That measure closely correlates to the unemployment rate in the Labor Department's employment report.
""This could signal a drop in the unemployment rate in August,"" said Sal Guatieri, a senior economist at BMO Capital Markets in Toronto. ""So, despite growing worries, businesses don't appear to be cutting staff or even slowing the pace of hiring all that much.""
The unemployment rate is at 3.7%. Other data on Tuesday showed house price inflation continuing to slow, which together with lower borrowing costs could provide a jolt to the housing market, which has been mired in weakness since last year.
The S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller house price index for 20 metro areas increased 2.1% from a year ago in June, the smallest gain since August 2012, after a 2.4% rise in May. 
The moderation in house price appreciation was also corroborated by another report from the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) showing its house price index increased a seasonally adjusted 4.8% in June from a year ago, the smallest rise since January 2015, after rising 5.2% in May. 
House prices increased 1.0% in the second quarter. The FHFA's index is calculated by using purchase prices of houses financed with mortgages sold to or guaranteed by mortgage finance companies Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. 

""The increase in housing demand coming from lower mortgage rates doesn’t seem to have been enough to prevent house price appreciation from slowing,"" said Daniel Silver, an economist at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) in New York.

BRASILIA (Reuters) - Brazil's economy likely expanded by 0.2% in the second quarter, according to a Reuters poll of economists, a sluggish pace of growth but enough to mean Latin America's largest economy avoided slipping back into recession.
That is the median estimate of 28 economists for the April-June period compared with the first three months of the year. Their estimates ranged from -0.3% to +0.5%.
The median estimate from 27 economists for year-on-year growth was 0.7%, with a range of between 0.1% and 1.2%. The data will be released on Thursday.
Both would indicate that the economy is gradually recovering from earlier this year and that the worst may be behind it, following the first contraction since 2016 in the January-March quarter and tepid annual expansion rate of just 0.5%.
""While we forecast that the country will avoid a recession, we acknowledge it is a close call,"" JP Morgan economists wrote in a client note published on Friday. ""Recent data seem to point to an economic recovery, though still below our expectation.""
If these estimates are accurate they will be further evidence that Brazil's economy is performing well below potential. Unemployment is stubbornly high around 12%, while business investment, the service sector and industrial production all remain weak.
Yet President Jair Bolsonaro's government will likely breathe a collective sigh of relief if recession is avoided - however narrowly - and argue that the economy has troughed and is poised for consistently stronger growth.
Uncertainty surrounding pension reform that hung over Brazil's economy and markets for the first half of the year has largely been lifted, now that the lower house of Congress has passed a landmark bill that should save the public purse almost 1 trillion reais ($241 billion) over the next decade.
There is a renewed sense of optimism among economists and Economy Ministry sources that Brazil's domestic political conditions are conducive to a more buoyant economy. In addition, the central bank cut interest rates to a record low 6.00% last month, and with growth and inflation so weak, is widely expected to ease again.
But the environment overseas - the U.S.-China trade war, U.S. recession fears, a strong dollar, falling stock markets - is deteriorating rapidly. Darkening global conditions are likely to influence Brazil's growth prospects more than brightening domestic conditions.
As the minutes of last month's central bank policy meeting showed, policymakers are fairly lukewarm on the economy. Recent activity suggests a ""possible"" resumption of the recovery, which should continue at only a ""gradual pace.""
That's a view shared by most observers: The central bank, government, International Monetary Fund and private sector economists all share a view that Brazil's economic growth this year will be 0.8%, down from 1.1% in 2017 and 2018."

BERLIN (Reuters) - Germany's economy contracted on weaker exports in the second quarter, detailed data showed on Tuesday, highlighting the Achilles heel of Europe's largest economy due to escalating trade disputes and waning foreign demand.
The Federal Statistics Office confirmed a preliminary gross domestic product contraction of 0.1% quarter-on-quarter from April to June after a 0.4% expansion in the first three months of the year.
The outlook for the German economy is uncertain as sentiment indicators point to a bumpy road ahead and most economists expect another quarter of contraction which would be a technical recession.
Exports fell more strongly than imports in the second quarter which meant that net trade deducted 0.5 percentage points from overall economic expansion.
Construction investment was also a drag, falling 1.0% on the quarter.
Household spending, state expenditure and private-sector investment in machinery and equipment all increased, but they were not strong enough to counter the massive drag of net trade.
""The details of the growth components show that the contraction was almost exclusively driven by weak exports,"" Carsten Brzeski from ING said, adding that the GDP figures showed that not everything was bad.
""Some relief from trade could easily lead to a rebound toward the end of the year. Fiscal stimulus could boost confidence and improve structural growth in the years ahead.""
Senior government officials have hinted that Berlin is mulling more fiscal stimulus linked to a comprehensive package of climate protection measures. Some suggested the government could even take on new debt to finance those steps.
Despite the mixed performance of the economy in the first six months of the year, the German state managed to record a whopping budget surplus of 45.3 billion euros ($50.5 billion) from January to June, the data showed.
That represents a surplus of 2.7% of economic output.
The federal government recorded a surplus of 17.7 billion euros, the 16 federal states 12.7 billion euros, municipalities 7.1 billion euros and social security system 7.7 billion euros.
The Ifo business sentiment survey showed on Monday that business morale deteriorated more than expected in August to hit its lowest in nearly seven years, in a further sign that escalating trade disputes are pushing the German economy toward recession.

The calendar-adjusted yearly growth rate eased to 0.4% in the second quarter from 0.9% in the first, Tuesday's data showed.

Chinese companies returned to profit in July, driven by a comparison with weak results a year ago, a jump in electrical machinery equipment sales and an improvement in the returns of manufacturers of cars, chemicals and processed oil.
Industrial profits rose 2.6% in July from a year earlier, after dropping in June. For the first seven months of the year, profits were down 1.7%. Infrastructure investment in railways pushed up profits of electrical machine production, according to Iris Pang, an economist at ING bank NV.
With the U.S.-China trade war and slowing global growth complicating the outlook for exporters, China’s economy is increasingly reliant on domestic spending and investment, but unless profits rebound more strongly there will be a limit to how much firms can invest. Factory prices dropped in July and that decline looks to be deepening in August, which will weigh on companies’ profits going forward.
“China industrial profits turned positive in July, mostly because of support from infrastructure projects and a technically low base last year,” with fiscal stimulus in the form of railway construction masking the effects of the trade war, Iris Pang said. “Both factors will continue to support industrial profits’ yearly growth, although risks for manufacturers haven’t gone away.”
What Bloomberg’s economist says
The unexpected rise is more a reflection of the comparison with weak results a year ago than an improvement in companies’ earning power.
“The slowdown in industrial production and sluggish domestic demand should continue to weigh on profits. The economy still needs policy support, and we expect the government to deliver.”

669,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 27, 2019 12:09AM ET</span>",China's July industrial profits swing to growth but outlook clouded,"By Roxanne Liu and Se Young Lee
BEIJING (Reuters) - Profits at China's industrial firms returned to growth in July, helped by public works spending and improved margins in the petrochemical and auto sectors, but an economic slowdown and the U.S. trade war are expected to weigh on the business outlook.
Industrial profits rose 2.6% in July year-on-year to 512.7 billion yuan ($72.28 billion), according to data released by the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) on Tuesday, swinging from a 3.1% decline in June.
Despite the turnaround in headline growth, worsening conditions for businesses exposed to global trade and smaller private sector firms are likely to add to case for more government support to shore up slowing economic growth.
""The downward pressure on the economy is relatively high, the market demand is slowing down, the prices of industrial products are falling,"" the statistics bureau's senior statistician, Zhu Hong, said in a statement accompanying the data.
""There will still likely be volatility and uncertainty in profits of industrial enterprises,"" Zhu said.
ING Greater China Economist Iris Pang said public infrastructure spending had supported firms' return to profit growth, particularly for electric products companies. However, persistent cash flow pressures felt by export firms and smaller businesses supported arguments for the government to do more.
""We believe that most private enterprises suffer from long account receivable cycles,"" Pang wrote in a note. ""They may be the low-end subcontractors of infrastructure projects. We worry that they may be the last to receive payments from their construction works.""
She expects more central bank support, such as added liquidity and cuts to banks' reserve requirements, which would free up the flow of credit to smaller firms.
For January-July, industrial firms earned profits of 3.50 trillion yuan, down 1.7% from a year earlier. That compared with a 2.4% fall in the first six months.
The uptick in July came mainly from petrochemical and auto sectors, the statistics bureau said in a separate statement on the data.
China's industrial profits have broadly slowed since the second half of 2018 as economic growth skidded to a near 30-year low while an escalating U.S.-China trade war slashed already lean earnings for businesses.
The July expansion in industrial profits contrasts with sluggish producer inflation and waning industrial output growth, which sank to record lows in July, indicating weakness in both the demand and supply sides.
As the trade dispute fuels global recession worries, investors and analysts have been expecting new stimulus measures from Beijing to boost domestic demand and lower funding costs for firms.
To offset the effects of the U.S. trade war, Chinese policymakers have rolled out various growth measures including reserve requirement ratio cuts, tax cuts and a push for banks to lend to smaller companies. But Beijing has also maintained it would not resort to a ""flood-like stimulus.""
Profitability in Beijing's oil refining sector has improved, with margins at refineries boosted by demand for diesel. But analysts warn this could be temporary as the industry still has to cope with overcapacity and ample supply of refined oil products.
The decline in the auto sector's net profit also narrowed in July, but overall car sales were down for a 13th consecutive month in July. The prolonged sales decline has made local carmakers like Geely (HK:0175) and Great Wall (SS:601633) cut earnings forecast.
China's exports unexpectedly returned to growth in July on improved global demand despite escalating U.S. trade pressure.
Profits at China's state-owned industrial firms dropped 8.1% on an annual basis for January-July, the statistics bureau data showed.
Liabilities of industrial firms were up 4.9% on-year at end-July, compared with a 5.6% increase as of end-June.
Private sector profits rose 7.0% in Jan-July, quickening from a 6.0% growth in the first six months."

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - New orders for key U.S.-made capital goods rose modestly in July while shipments fell by the most in nearly three years, pointing to continued weakness in business investment and a slowdown in economic growth early in the third quarter.
Coming against the backdrop of an escalation in U.S.-China trade tensions, the report from the Commerce Department on Monday could provide more ammunition for the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates again next month. 
Fed Chair Jerome Powell told a conference of central bankers last week that trade policy uncertainty seems to be playing ""a role in the global slowdown and in weak manufacturing and capital spending in the United States."" Though Powell described the economy as being in a ""favorable place,"" he reiterated that the U.S. central bank would ""act as appropriate"" to keep the longest economic expansion in history on track.

""The report reaffirms that industrial sector activity and business investment remain soft, in line with weakness globally as trade concerns weigh on activity,"" said Veronica Clark, an economist at  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) in New York. ""With remaining downside risks, we continue to expect that the Fed will again cut rates by 25 basis points at its meeting in September.""
Orders for non-defense capital goods excluding aircraft, a closely watched proxy for business spending plans, increased 0.4% last month, the government said, driven by strong demand for electrical equipment, appliances and components.
Data for June was revised down to show these so-called core capital goods orders advancing 0.9% instead of surging 1.5% as previously reported. 
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast core capital goods orders would fall 0.1% in July. Core capital goods orders increased 1.5% on a year-on-year basis.
Shipments of core capital goods fell 0.7% last month, the biggest drop since October 2016. Core capital goods shipments are used to calculate equipment spending in the government's gross domestic product measurement. Data for June was revised down to show core capital goods shipments were unchanged instead of rising 0.3% as previously reported. 
President Donald Trump on Friday announced a new round of tariffs on Chinese imports, hours after Beijing unveiled retaliatory tariffs on $75 billion worth of U.S. goods. On Monday, the two economic powerhouses sought to ease tensions, with Beijing calling for calm and Trump predicting a deal. 
The dollar (DXY) strengthened against a basket of currencies on the latest news in the trade war, while U.S. Treasury prices were largely trading higher. Stocks on Wall Street rebounded after tumbling on Friday.
SHIPMENTS FALL 
The drop in core capital goods shipments suggests business spending on equipment softened at the start of the third quarter, which could weigh on overall business investment and GDP growth. Business investment contracted in the second quarter for the first time since the first quarter of 2016. 
Expectations for slower economic growth were also reinforced by a separate report on Monday from the Chicago Fed showing its national activity index fell to a reading of -0.36 in July from 0.03 in June. According to the Chicago Fed, negative readings have been associated with below-average economic growth. 
The economy grew at a 2.1% annualized pace in the second quarter. Weak business investment is underscored by manufacturing, where output has contracted for two straight quarters. Manufacturing, which accounts for about 12% of the economy, is also being undercut by an inventory bloat and design problems at Boeing (N:BA).
In July, orders for electrical equipment, appliances and components jumped 1.1%. But orders for machinery fell 0.6%. There were also declines in orders for primary metals and fabricated metal products. 
Overall orders for durable goods, items ranging from toasters to aircraft that are meant to last three years or more, increased 2.1% in July, the most since August 2018, after rising 1.8% in the prior month.
Orders for transportation equipment jumped 7.0% after gaining 4.1% in June. Motor vehicles and parts orders rose 0.5% last month. Orders for non-defense aircraft and parts increased 47.8%. Boeing reported on its website that it had received orders for 31 aircraft in July, excluding its troubled 737 MAX plane, up from only nine in June.
The world's largest plane maker has cut production of the 737 MAX, which was grounded in March following two fatal crashes in Ethiopia and Indonesia. Deliveries of the plane have also been suspended, leading to a 16.2% drop in aircraft shipments in July.
Overall durable goods shipments dropped 1.1% last month. Unfilled orders for these goods edged up 0.1%, while inventories increased 0.4%, suggesting manufacturing would probably continue to struggle in the coming months. 
""The data confirm that business investment momentum continues to fade and is likely to provide limited support to GDP growth in the second half,"" said Lydia Boussour, a senior U.S. economist at Oxford Economics in New York. 
""The combination of tighter financial conditions, elevated trade uncertainty and deteriorating global growth will weigh on investment decisions in coming months, putting further downside risk to the already fragile business investment picture.""

BRASILIA (Reuters) - Brazil's balance of payments position with the rest of the world deteriorated sharply in July, central bank figures showed on Monday, as the current account deficit unexpectedly ballooned to $9 billion, the biggest July shortfall since 2014.
That pushed out the broadest measure of the Brazil's deficit with the rest of the world to 1.31% of gross domestic product, the widest deficit in two and a half years, the central bank said.
The deficit continues to be adequately funded, however, by strong capital inflows from abroad, the data showed.
The main driver behind the unexpectedly weak current account data was an 11.1% slump in goods exports, to $20 billion in July, which cut the trade surplus by more than half and will also likely act as a drag on overall growth in the third quarter.
The $9 billion gap between what Brazil sells to and buys from the rest of the world, including trade and financial flows, was more than double the $4.4 billion deficit posted in July last year and much wider than the $5.9 billion median forecast in a Reuters poll of economists.
July's data brings the accumulated current account deficit over the previous 12 months to $24.4 billion - the first time it has exceeded $20 billion since February 2017. The deficit as a share of GDP was the widest since the 1.32% deficit posted in January 2017.
Foreign direct investment totaled $7.66 billion in July, slightly more than a Reuters poll estimate of $7.00 billion, bringing the total so far this year to $45 billion. That is up sharply from $38.4 billion in the same period a year ago.
In the first seven months of this year, Brazil's current account deficit totaled $21.68 billion, much more than the $12.26 billion in the same period last year."

BERLIN (Reuters) - German business sentiment deteriorated more than expected in August to hit its lowest in nearly seven years, a survey showed on Monday, in a further sign that escalating trade disputes are pushing Europe's largest economy toward a recession.
The country's manufacturers - whose exports have been a bedrock of German economic strength - are now struggling with weaker foreign demand, tariff disputes sparked by U.S. President Donald Trump's 'America First' policies and business uncertainty linked to Britain's decision to leave the European Union.
""German companies have to buckle up in the coming quarters. As bitter as it sounds, the export dependence of the German economy is currently becoming a boomerang,"" said VP Bank analyst Thomas Gitzel.
The automobile sector, an important driver of overall growth, is also having trouble adjusting to stricter regulation following an emission cheating scandal and managing a broader shift away from combustion engines toward electric cars.
The Munich-based Ifo institute said its business climate index fell to 94.3 from an upwardly revised 95.8 in July. The August reading, the fifth monthly decline in a row, undershot a consensus forecast for 95.1.
""There are ever more indications of a recession in Germany,"" Ifo President Clemens Fuest said in a statement. Companies were much less satisfied with their current situation and their pessimism about the coming months also increased, he added.
""The last time that industrial companies demonstrated such pessimism was in the crisis year of 2009. Not a single ray of light was to be seen in any of Germany's key industries.""
Business morale deteriorated also in services, wholesaling and construction. This suggests that so far robust domestic demand is now also losing momentum and that the manufacturing recession is creeping into other sectors of the economy.
CONTRACTION
The Ifo survey followed Markit's survey of purchasing managers released on Thursday that showed Germany's private sector continued to struggle in August as the manufacturing recession dragged on and activity in the services sector eased slightly.
The German economy contracted 0.1% in the April-June period due to a plunge in exports and it could have continued to shrink over the summer, according to the Bundesbank, as industrial production is falling amid a lack of orders.
""There will be a stagnation in the third quarter at best,"" Ifo economist Klaus Wohlrabe told Reuters. ""We are facing a recession.""
Most economists describe a period of at least two consecutive quarters of economic contraction as a technical recession.
For 2019 as a whole, the government predicts meager growth of 0.5% this year. Berlin expects a consumption-driven rebound in economic expansion of 1.5% for 2020.
The unexpectedly weak Ifo figures are likely to increase calls for the government to inject more fiscal stimulus into the economy.
German Finance Minister Olaf Scholz said on Sunday the government needed to take ""decisive steps"" to tackle climate change and that new measures also could result in a stimulus to the economy.

His remarks came ahead of a series of high-level coalition meetings next month aimed at preparing a far-reaching package of climate protection measures that are expected to massively weigh on Germany's federal budget.

Exports declined in July to HK$338.6 billion ($43.2 billion), down 5.7% from year-ago figures, according to a government release. That compares with economists’ estimate of an 8.2% decline. The measure had retreated 9% in June, its biggest decrease since February 2016, the data show.
Imports tumbled a worse-than-expected 8.7% to HK$370.8 billion, led by decreases from suppliers including Malaysia, Korea and Singapore, for a trade deficit of HK$32.2 billion. The value of imports from the Chinese mainland decreased 4%.
“Exports growth turned out not as weak as expected in July but we do expect this to weaken again in upcoming months given the recent escalation of the U.S.-China trade tensions,” said Tommy Wu, a senior economist with Oxford Economics. “Imports growth would be really weak because of both slowing re-export activities, plus gloomy domestic outlook as retail sales and inbound tourism are going to be dragged by the ongoing political turmoil.”
Softening global economic growth and U.S.-China trade tensions were the primary contributors to the export weakness, a government spokesman said.
“Looking forward, in the face of the difficult external environment and the further escalation of U.S.-mainland trade tensions in September, Hong Kong’s near-term export performance should remain sluggish or may even weaken further,” he said in a statement.

Companies signed up for $9.4 billion in new loans, leases and lines of credit last month, up from $8.2 billion a year earlier. Borrowings fell 5% from the previous month.
ELFA Chief Executive Officer Ralph Petta said that despite ""early warning signs"" of an economic downturn, loan origination activity has been strong mid-summer.
""While credit quality in these portfolios is something to monitor carefully, business owners continue to invest in productive assets,"" Petta said.
Washington-based ELFA, which reports economic activity for the $1 trillion equipment finance sector, said credit approvals totaled 75.7%, down from 77.0% in June.
ELFA's leasing and finance index measures the volume of commercial equipment financed in the United States. It is designed to complement the U.S. Commerce Department's durable goods orders report, which it typically precedes by a few days.

The regional central bank's composite manufacturing index fell to -6 in August, the most negative level since March 2016. It was -1 in July.
“Regional factory activity had its largest monthly drop in over three years, and over 55 percent of firms expect negative impacts from the latest round of U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods,” Kansas City Fed economist Chad Wilkerson said in a statement.
The data showed broad activity declines in durable and nondurable plants, in particular among primary metal, electrical equipment, appliances, paper, printing, and chemical manufacturing.
On Aug. 1, U.S. President Donald Trump vowed he would impose an additional 10% tariff on $300 billion worth of Chinese imports beginning Sept. 1 in a bid to pressure Beijing to reach a trade deal.
“However, even though many firms expect trade tensions to persist, expectations for future shipments and exports expanded slightly,” Wilkerson said.

Last week, the yields on 10-year Treasury notes briefly dipped below those on two-year notes  for first time in a dozen years. The ""curve inversion"" among these two debt maturities has often preceded prior U.S. recessions.
This market phenomenon touched off a fresh wave of buying in U.S. Treasuries, sending 30-year yields (US30YT=RR) to record lows.
The decline in mortgage rates is expected to help home sales and to stoke refinancing, putting more cash into consumers' pockets, analysts said.
“The benefit of lower mortgage rates is not only shoring up home sales, but also providing support to homeowner balance sheets via higher monthly cash flow and steadily rising home equity,” Freddie Mac's Chief Economist Sam Khater said in a statement. 
The interest rates on 30-year mortgages averaged 3.55% in the week ended Aug. 22, down from 3.60% a week earlier and 4.51% a year ago, the mortgage finance agency said.
The average 15-year mortgage rate decreased to 3.03% in the latest week, down from 3.05% the week before. It was 3.98% a year ago.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The number of Americans filing applications for unemployment benefits fell sharply last week, suggesting the labor market was holding firm despite a manufacturing slowdown and concerns the economy is on a path toward recession.
Initial claims for state unemployment benefits dropped 12,000 to a seasonally adjusted 209,000 for the week ended Aug. 17, the Labor Department said on Thursday. 
The decline was sharper than expected. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast claims would drop to 216,000 in the latest week. 
U.S. stock index futures held onto gains following the data's publication.
The four-week moving average of initial claims, considered a better measure of labor market trends as it irons out week-to-week volatility, edged up 500 to 214,500 last week.
Last week's claims data falls during the same week the Labor Department conducts surveys used to estimate national employment during the month of August. 
The four-week average for new unemployment benefits claims was lower than the corresponding week in July, a positive signal for employment during the month. 
There are few signs a bitter trade war between the United States and China was spilling over to the national labor market, although growth in manufacturing jobs has slowed this year. 
While hiring has cooled, the pace of job gains remains well above the roughly 100,000 needed per month to keep up with growth in the working-age population.
The trade war has fueled concerns among investors that a recession looms over the U.S. economy. Some yields on shorter-term Treasury debt have risen above longer-term yields, a development viewed as a classic recession signal. 
Concerns over the impact of the trade tensions between Washington and Beijing on the U.S. economic expansion, the longest on record, prompted the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates last month for the first time since 2008. 
At the same time, minutes for last month's Fed policy meeting released on Wednesday suggested policymakers were divided over the cut and did not want to give the appearance that they were planning further rate reductions.

Thursday's claims report also showed the number of people receiving benefits after an initial week of aid fell 54,000 to 1.67 million for the week ended Aug. 10. The four-week moving average of the so-called continuing claims fell 750 to 1.70 million.

IHS Markit said its ""flash"" or preliminary measure on domestic factory activity fell to 49.9 in August, its lowest level since September 2009. This compared with a final reading of 50.4 the month before.

The Confederation of British Industry's gauge of retailers - or the difference between those reporting rising and falling sales volumes - slumped to -49 in August from -16 in July, the second weakest reading since records began in 1983.
That was worse than all forecasts in a Reuters poll of economists that pointed to an improvement to -11.
Until recently, consumers had largely taken Brexit in their stride, helped by wages growing at the fastest pace in more than a decade and modest inflation.
That helped to support growth at a time when many companies have been cutting back on investment because of uncertainty about Brexit, but left the economy reliant on consumer spending.
""The very weak August CBI survey raises the possibility that consumers are becoming more concerned and cautious as the UK's Oct. 31 departure date from the EU looms and expectations of a 'no deal' Brexit rise,"" said Howard Archer, chief economic adviser to the EY ITEM Club consultancy.
Britain's economy contracted in the second quarter of the year and would enter a recession if it shrinks again in the July-September period. 
Official retail sales data have painted a more upbeat picture than most other private sector surveys including the CBI's, although some gauges of consumer morale are starting to weaken.
Data firm IHS Markit said on Monday that British working-age households were growing more cautious about making major purchases amid concerns about Brexit and a possible recession.
The CBI survey showed retailers cut orders with suppliers at a near-record pace and built up stocks. 
""Sentiment is crumbling among retailers, and unexpectedly weak sales have led to a large overhang of stocks,"" CBI deputy chief economist Anna Leach said.

""With investment intentions for the year ahead and employment down, retailers expect a chilly few months ahead.""

European Central Bank officials expressed concern at their latest policy meeting that some observers doubted their ability to restore price stability, prompting the Governing Council to plan for potential fresh monetary stimulus.
Council members broadly agreed that a downward trend in inflation expectations was a cause for concern, and that the euro area’s economic slowdown was likely to be more protracted than expected. While external factors such as trade tensions were driving a contraction in manufacturing, that could be a leading indicator for the services sector, according to the account of the July 24-25 session. Prospects for global trade “remained poor.”
“Communication needed to strike a careful balance between, on the one hand, giving unduly negative signals about the economy and, on the other hand, effectively counteracting the concern among some observers that the Governing Council lacked the necessary instruments to secure the convergence of inflation to its inflation aim over the medium term.”
ECB President Mario Draghi and his colleagues set the stage at the meeting for another round of monetary stimulus to confront the euro area’s weakness. Investors are betting on at least an interest-rate cut on Sept. 12, and some economists predict that large-scale asset purchases will be restarted.
Officials exchanged ideas in July on a list of policy options and how their response should be designed. That included an introduction of mitigating measures, such as tiering system to exempt banks from some of the pain of negative rates. Some policy makers expressed concern that tiering could have “unintended consequences” or not be able to fully offset the impact on sub-zero rates on banks.
At least one member pushed for package of measures such as a combination of rate cuts and asset purchases, saying experience had shown that to be more effective than a sequence of actions. Finnish central banker Olli Rehn has previously called for a significant package of measures that would overshoot market expectations.
The policy discussion underscores the growing sense of urgency among ECB officials that they need to act to help lift the 19-nation bloc out of its doldrums. Germany, the largest economy, is on the edge of recession after a second-quarter contraction, with a report earlier on Thursday showing orders dropping at the fastest pace in six years and factory activity shrinking for an eighth month.
Further risks lie ahead, including the prospect of a disorderly Brexit on Oct. 31 and the possibility that U.S. President Donald Trump will take his trade war directly to Europe.
Fresh ECB easing would come amid a worldwide push to stimulate growth as the global expansion falters under trade tensions. U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell is expected to use his speech at the central bank symposium in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, on Friday to signal readiness to cut rates again.
Jackson Hole
The minutes from the Fed’s July meeting published on Wednesday showed officials viewed their cut last month as insurance against too-weak inflation and the risk of a deeper slump in business investment.
ECB officials at the meeting again called for governments that have room to spend to use it. They also stressed that the “contingency of significant further deterioration in euro-area economic activity would call for fiscal policy to assume a more prominent role in sustaining demand.”
Germany is considering boosting budget spending if the slump worsens. Finance Minister Olaf Scholz has said he could raise 50 billion euros ($55 billion) if needed -- the same amount as Germany’s package during the global financial crisis.
Limited Headroom
The ECB’s options for adding more monetary stimulus depend on how far it’s willing to burden banks and stretch its own rules. The deposit rate is at minus 0.4% and Draghi has signaled that further reductions would need to come with measures to soften the impact of the policy on banks, who can’t easily pass the charge onto retail depositors.
Reviving the bond-buying program may require some tweaks to self-imposed limits on how much debt from governments it can buy, rules aimed at avoiding distorting the market and breaching laws banning the financing of governments.
The Governing Council will next meet to set policy on Sept. 12 and update their economic projections. That will the penultimate meeting of Draghi’s term, meaning he’ll leave without ever raising interest rates as president.
He’ll step down on Oct. 31, the same day Britain is scheduled to exit from the European Union, leaving former International Monetary Fund chief Christine Lagarde to take over for the next eight years."

BENGALURU (Reuters) - Euro zone business growth picked up a touch in August, helped by brisk services activity and as manufacturing contracted at a slower pace, but trade war fears knocked future expectations to their weakest in over six years, a survey showed.
Despite increasing worries about a global slowdown, the U.S. and China have shown no sign of backing down in their trade war.
That has pushed businesses to be less hopeful of a significant acceleration in economic activity anytime soon, which will in turn underscore policymakers' pledges for more accommodative policy.
IHS Markit's Euro Zone Composite Flash Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI), seen as a good guide to economic health, climbed in August to 51.8 from 51.5 in July and above 51.2 predicted in a Reuters poll. Anything above 50 indicates growth.
The composite future output index measuring overall business optimism sank to 55.5, its lowest since May 2013, from 58.8 in July.
""The dynamics of the euro zone economy were little changed in August, with solid growth in services continuing to hold the wider economy's head above water despite ongoing manufacturing decline,"" noted Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit.
""While the rate of overall expansion ticked up, we're still looking at GDP only rising by between 0.1% and 0.2%, based on the PMI data for the third quarter so far.""
There was a modest revival among firms operating in the bloc's dominant services industry. The flash services PMI rose to 53.4 from July's 53.2, above the 53.0 expected in a Reuters poll.
Still, in another sign of scant optimism in boardrooms, a business expectations sub-index fell to a near five-year low of 57.3 from 61.2 in the previous month.
Factory activity contracted for the seventh month in a row, although at a slower rate than the previous month, with the related index rising to 47.0 from 46.5 in July, beating the 46.2 forecast in a Reuters poll.
An index measuring output, which feeds into the composite PMI, came in at 47.8, marking a slower pace of contraction than the 46.9 logged in July.
However, the future output index which measures optimism among factories fell to 51.0, its lowest since November 2012.
""The lack of a quick rebound from the recent economic slowdown has impacted firms' confidence... It appears that companies are braced for a sustained period of weakness, and as a result are showing greater reluctance to take on additional staff,"" added Williamson."

Markit's flash composite Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI), which tracks the manufacturing and services sectors that together account for more than two-thirds of the economy, edged up to 51.4 from 50.9 the previous month.
This beat the consensus forecast of analysts surveyed by Reuters, who had expected a weakening to 50.5.
Still, Phil Smith from IHS Markit said the data was not strong enough to dispel the threat of another minor contraction in gross domestic product in the third quarter.
The German economy contracted 0.1% in the April-June period due to a plunge in exports, and sentiment indicators are suggesting hardly any improvement for the three months from July to September.
""Germany remains a two-speed economy, with ongoing growth of services just about compensating for the sustained weakness in manufacturing,"" Smith said.
The survey showed that overall job creation in the private sector slipped to a five-year low while business expectations about future output turned negative for the first time since late 2014.

But services sector activity expanded at the fastest pace in nearly two years, suggesting resilient domestic demand is continuing to offset some of the strong external pressures on the economy.
The Jibun Bank Flash Japan Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) rose to a seasonally adjusted 49.5 from a final 49.4 in the previous month, but stayed below the 50.0 threshold that separates contraction from expansion for a fourth month.
Factory output and total new orders contracted again, though at a slightly more moderate pace than in July.
Other key activity gauges in the PMI report offered a mixed picture. Employment expanded, while the backlog of work index rose to an eight-month high, though it remained in contraction.
A separate survey showed Japanese service activity expanded. That, in turn, helped lift a composite PMI index that includes both manufacturing and services.
The Jibun Bank Flash Japan Services PMI climbed to 53.4 in August, from a final 51.8 in July on a seasonally adjusted basis, and the highest level since October 2017.
""Solid growth seen in GDP so far this year could stretch into the third quarter, providing a timely boost before the fourth quarter, which is likely to be adversely impacted by the consequences of a sales tax hike,"" said Joe Hayes, economist at IHS Markit, which compiles the survey.
The growth seen in the services sector was in line with GDP figures released this month that showed the world's third-largest economy grew an annualized 1.8% in the second quarter largely thanks to robust household consumption and business investment.
If sustained, solid growth in services could help offset external pressure on the export-reliant economy, which has been hit by weak global demand and the U.S.-China trade war.
Japan's exports slipped for an eight month in July, dragged down by China-bound shipments of car parts and semiconductor production equipment,

XpertHR noted signs of caution among employers with less than a quarter of awards higher than the same group of employees received at their previous pay review while 43% were lower.
XpertHR analyst Sheila Attwood said it was too soon to declare the start of a sustained increase in pay awards.
The Bank of England has said the tight labor market means it is likely to raise interest rates gradually, assuming Britain can avoid the economic shock of a no-deal Brexit."

Export-oriented manufacturers in Europe's largest economy are suffering from weaker foreign demand, growing trade tensions and uncertainty over Brexit.
""External risks have increased significantly and are fuelling business uncertainty,"" the finance ministry said in its monthly report, adding that early indicators pointed to a sustained slowdown in the industrial sector.
Record-high employment, inflation-busting pay hikes and low borrowing costs have supported Germany's domestic economy so far, with household spending and construction providing a certain buffer against external shocks.
""The labor market situation is still favorable, but employment growth is slowing,"" the ministry cautioned. Forward-looking indicators were pointing to a further slowdown in employment growth, especially in manufacturing.
The economy contracted by 0.1% quarter-on-quarter from April to June. The Bundesbank warned on Monday that overall economic output could have continued to shrink over the summer, raising the specter of a technical recession.
The finance ministry said tax revenues of the federal government and the 16 regional states rose 2.3% year-on-year from January to July. That was slightly below the projected rise of 2.4% for the whole year.
The sluggish tax take could complicate Finance Minister Olaf Scholz's efforts to keep the federal government's budget balanced, increasing the pressure to ditch the self-imposed policy goal of not taking on new debt."

""Most participants viewed a proposed quarter-point policy easing at this meeting as part of a recalibration of the stance of policy, or mid-cycle adjustment, in response to the evolution of the economic outlook over recent months,"" the Fed minutes showed.
The Fed suggested that the best course of action would be to remain ""flexible"" and monitor incoming economic data amid uncertainty over when risks weighing on the economy, including the U.S.-China trade war would be resolved. 
""In their discussion of the outlook for monetary policy beyond this meeting, participants generally favored an approach in which policy would be guided by incoming information and its implications for the economic outlook and that avoided any appearance of following a preset course,"" according to the release of the minutes.
The Federal Reserve cut its benchmark rate by 25 basis points to a range of 2.0% to 2.25% from 2.25% to 2.5% on July 31.
 
At its July meeting, the Federal Reserve cited “the implications of global developments for the economic outlook as well as muted inflation pressures” as reasons for cutting rates for the first time since the 2008. 
But the decision to lower rates was not unanimous, the minutes showed. Esther George and Eric Rosengren dissented largely because economic indicators suggested the economy remained somewhat robust. 
The minutes drew a muted reaction in markets, with many looking to Fed Chairman Jerome Powell's speech at Jackson Hole, Wyo. on Friday for further clues on monetary policy. Some also claimed the minutes were largely a non-event as the July meeting took place before President Donald Trump proposed to slap new tariffs on China. The tariffs, however, have been pushed back to Dec. 15 from from Sept. 1. 
“If (Powell) believes that risks may warrant a ‘somewhat’ lower path for policy, then a 25bp cut will be confirmed and market pricing, which currently rests above that level, will need to adjust,” Morgan Stanley said in a note.
Powell has faced relentless pressure from Trump to deliver a big rate cut.
Trump claimed earlier this week that Powell had a “horrendous lack of vision"" and called on the central bank to slash rates by 100 basis points and renew “some” quantitative easing. Today he likened Powell to a golfer that can’t putt with “no touch.”
The Fed, in its July statement, pledged to end its balance sheet shrinking program at the end of the month, two months earlier than initially anticipated."

(Reuters) - Mortgage rates are at a three-year low and housing price appreciation has cooled, but many Americans seeking to buy their first home are facing tough times.
Why? There just aren't enough homes for sale.
Developers have struggled to build enough new homes, especially at entry-level prices, because of land and labor shortages and rising material costs.
The supply tightness has been compounded by retirees ""aging in place"" and Baby Boomers content to make additions to their current homes, rather than moving, analysts said.
""The problem for first-time buyers is still supply,"" said Doug Duncan, chief economist at Fannie Mae in Washington.
There were 1.89 million previously owned homes on the market in July, down from 1.92 million in June and 1.6% from July 2018, the National Association of Realtors said on Wednesday.
On the other hand, starts on new single-family homes edged up 1.3% in July to an annualized rate of 876,000 units in July, the fastest pace in six months, the Commerce Department said last week.
First-time buyers bought 559,000 single-family homes in the second quarter, down 4% from a year ago, a report from Genworth Mortgage Insurance released on Wednesday showed.
Weaker first-time home sales came at a time while the broader market has recovered a bit from the downdraft in late 2018. 
""This represents a shift in housing market dynamic dating back to 2012,"" Genworth chief economist Tian Liu said in the report. ""For the first time, the year-over-year growth rate in home sales to first-time homebuyers underperformed the overall single-family housing market, which was down 2 percent year-over-year.""
GRAPHIC: U.S. home prices vs 30-year mortgage rate - https://tmsnrt.rs/2KTHG7M
IMPROVED HOME AFFORDABILITY
The decline in home borrowing costs and weaker home price growth should buffer first-time homebuyers as housing stocks remain tight, analysts said.
The mild pickup in wage growth, now at a 3% annual pace, should also help.
""It's a plus for first-time buyers,"" Fannie Mae's Duncan said.
The interest rates on conventional 30-year mortgages, or those with loan balances of $484,350 or less, averaged 3.90% in the week ended Aug. 16. This was the lowest reading since November 2016 and down from 4.81% a year earlier.
Mortgage rates have fallen in recent weeks in step with bond yields as investors have piled into low-risk government bonds to shield their money because of fears about a recession and trade tensions between China and the United States.
While borrowing costs fell in the second quarter, first-time homebuyers paid about half a percentage point more than other buyers, Genworth's Liu said.
Even as the costs to acquire a home have fallen somewhat, the lack of homes for sale will persist as a major impediment for first-time buyers to achieve their ""American Dream.""

""In a lot of places, homes for sale are still limited,"" Duncan said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. home sales rose more than expected in July, boosted by lower mortgage rates and a strong labor market, signs the Federal Reserve's shift toward lower interest rates was supporting the economy.
A separate report released by the Labor Department on Wednesday suggested the level of employment in the country was slightly lower than previously estimated, taking a bit of the shine off the labor market.
Despite headwinds from a global economic slowdown, the U.S. housing market appears to be strengthening.
The National Association of Realtors said existing home sales rose 2.5% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.42 million units last month. June's sales pace was revised slightly higher to 5.29 million units from the previously reported 5.27 million units.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast existing home sales would rise to a rate of 5.39 million units in July. 
The housing sector data appeared to have little impact on stock prices, which rose following upbeat earnings from retailers Lowe's Cos Inc (N:LOW) and  Target  Corp (N:TGT) that reinforced confidence in consumer demand.
RATE CUT
Last month's increase left existing home sales, which make up about 90 percent of U.S. home sales, higher than they were a year earlier for the first time in 17 months. The U.S. home market slipped into a rut last year as the U.S. central bank continued a rate-hiking campaign.
After raising rates in December, the Fed later signaled it was done with the tightening, and by July the central bank switched gears completely, cutting rates for the first time since 2008 in a bid to keep a global downturn from causing a U.S. recession.
The rate cut came despite the U.S. unemployment rate being at its lowest level in nearly 50 years. The Labor Department reported on Wednesday that the overall level of employment was 0.3% lower in March, or 501,000 fewer jobs, than previously estimated. 
This preliminary estimate will be refined and incorporated early next year into the Labor Department's estimates for job gains through 2019, which have been robust although on average slower than in 2018.
Last month, existing home sales rose across the country except for the Northeast, the NAR said.
The 30-year fixed mortgage rate dropped to an average of 3.77% in July from more than a seven-year peak of 4.94% in November, according to data from mortgage finance agency Freddie Mac. The average rate fell to 3.6% in the Aug. 15 week and rates could decline further as the Fed is expected to cut rates in September due to concerns about economic weakening.
There were 1.89 million previously owned homes on the market in July, down from 1.92 million in June and a 1.6% decrease from July 2018. The median existing house price increased 4.3% from a year ago to $280,800 in July.
Against the backdrop of tight inventories and a persistently faster rise in prices of homes versus consumer goods, the recent sales boost likely ""is not the start of a sustained upward trend,"" said Matthew Pointon, an economist at Capital Economics. 

At July's sales pace, it would take 4.2 months to exhaust the current inventory, down from 4.4 months in June. A six-to-seven-month supply is viewed as a healthy balance between supply and demand.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. homeowners filed the most applications to refinance their current mortgages in over three years as 30-year borrowing costs slipped to their lowest levels since late 2016, the Mortgage Bankers Association said on Wednesday.
Overall mortgage activity, however, declined because of a pullback in loan requests for home purchases, the Washington-based industry group said.
MBA's seasonally adjusted index on mortgage refinancing activity edged up 0.4% to 2,754.7 in the week ended Aug. 16, which was its highest since July 2016.
The refinancing share of total applications grew to 62.7%, the biggest since September 2016, from 61.4% a week earlier.
Interest rates on 30-year, fixed-rate mortgages averaged 3.90%, down 3 basis points from the prior week. This was the lowest reading since the week of Nov. 4, 2016.
Mortgage rates have fallen in recent weeks in step with bond yields as investors have piled into low-risk government bonds to shield their money because of fears about a recession and trade tensions between China and the United States.
Benchmark 10-year Treasury yields (US10YT=RR) fell nearly 20 basis points last week, while the mortgage rates MBA tracks were mixed. This may be due to a 37% surge in refinancing applications the week before.
“The small moves in rates and refinancing are potentially signs that lenders may be approaching capacity constraints as they continue to deal with the largest wave of refinance activity in three years,"" Joe Kan, MBA’s associate vice president of economic and industry forecasting, said in a statement. 
As falling mortgage rates touched off a refinancing surge, they have yet to elicit a similar response among potential homebuyers.
“Lower mortgage rates have yet to lead to a notable rise in homebuyer demand,"" Kan said.
MBA's seasonally adjusted measure on loan activity for home purchases fell 3.5% to 243.8 last week, but it was 5% higher than a year earlier.
The group's gauge on overall mortgage activity dipped 0.9% to 614.6, retreating from a three-year peak reached the prior week.

Annual consumer price inflation was 2% in July, matching June’s pace, Statistics Canada said Wednesday from Ottawa. Economists had expected inflation to slow to 1.7%. Core inflation, a better gauge of underlying pressure, unexpectedly ticked up slightly to 2.03%.

This suggests a largely benign environment for inflation.Stronger inflation dynamics in Canada are one reason why economists and markets are anticipating fewer cuts, and a slower pace of reductions, by the Bank of Canada than the Federal Reserve. Markets are pricing in just one rate cut this year in Canada, even though some analysts have begun to speculate a cut could take place as early as the next rate decision in September due to growing global trade tensions.The expectation had been price gains would ease over the summer months, with the Bank of Canada projecting annual inflation to temporarily fall to 1.6% in the third quarter before returning to 2%.

691,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 21, 2019 04:48AM ET</span>",UK posts small budget surplus as government spending rises before Brexit,"LONDON, Reuters) - Britain posted a smaller-than-expected budget surplus in July as government expenditure rose, underlining budget constraints on new Prime Minister Boris Johnson as he promises to boost spending ahead of Brexit.
The surplus, excluding state-owned banks, stood at 1.319 billion pounds, compared with 3.562 billion pounds in July 2018, official data showed on Wednesday.
This was well below the median forecast of 2.7 billion pounds in a Reuters poll of economists.
July is traditionally a surplus month for the public finances, driven by income tax payments from individuals.
While most tax receipts were up a little compared with a year ago, government spending was 2.6 billion pounds higher, a 4.2% annual increase. Purchases of goods and services and staff costs drove most of the rise.
For the first four months of the financial year starting in April, Britain has borrowed 16.0 billion pounds, up 60% compared with a year ago although the deficit as a share of the economy remains small compared with a decade ago.
In the longer-term, the outlook for the public finances is clouded by Brexit and uncertainty around government spending.
Prime Minister Johnson has made billions of pounds of new spending commitments in his first few weeks in office, even before the potential costs of a disruptive, no-deal Brexit are taken into account.
Ratings agency Moody's said on Aug. 1 that some of the announcements raised ""further questions about the government's commitment to addressing the legacy of debt bequeathed by the financial crisis.""
Finance minister Sajid Javid will give more details of the plans soon, before a full annual budget later in the year - assuming that a no-confidence vote in the government and an election do not intervene before then.
The Office for National Statistics said sales and income tax receipts were up slightly compared with a year ago, but corporation tax revenue for the first four months of the 2018/19 fell 0.1% -- the first drop for any comparable April-July period since 2013/14.
Johnson declined during his leadership campaign to back the government's existing fiscal rules, which aim to keep the deficit below 2% of GDP during normal economic times, and ensure debt falls as a share of GDP.
Javid has said he will respect this rule but the government has said the longer-term future of the fiscal rules is ""under review""."
692,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 20, 2019 09:26PM ET</span>",House prices would flounder in six months after no-deal Brexit: Reuters poll,"By Ross Finley
LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's drifting property market would probably take a hit from a disorderly Brexit, with average prices slipping about 3% nationally in the ensuing six months and as much as 10% in London, a Reuters poll of housing experts found.
Roughly 85% of respondents said both UK and London house prices would fall in the six months subsequent to leaving the European Union without an agreement.
But if Britain departs the EU with a transition deal - the scheduled leave date is Oct. 31 - house prices are due a mild 1.5% lift over the following two quarters. They would rise 1.4% in the capital.
Results from the Aug. 13-20 survey show an otherwise tepid outlook for national price rises in coming years, at rates not far off an already-mild consumer price inflation rate and despite the recent sharp fall in sterling.
Indeed, the results suggest that foreign demand for property will be weaker than in previous years where declines in the pound have spurred buying, particularly in London, as it makes housing cheaper for those holding stronger currencies.
The survey also indicates in the near-term at least that housing, the bedrock of British household wealth, is not likely to give a lift to the economy, which contracted for the first time in 6-1/2 years in the second quarter.
Indeed, an overwhelming majority of respondents who answered an additional question in the first Reuters UK housing market survey since Boris Johnson took over as prime minister said risks to the housing market were skewed to the downside.
""Despite the new PM and team in government there are big icebergs ahead, not least the apparent willingness to leave the EU without a deal,"" said property market consultant Henry Pryor. ""This is likely to spook the markets before it reassures them.""
At the same time, there are fundamentals cushioning the market from falls. Hansen Lu, analyst at consultancy Capital Economics, notes the ongoing shortage of homes, which nearly always underpins British house prices.
Mortgage rates are also very low and not set to rise any time soon despite hawkish rhetoric in past months from Bank of England policymakers, and recent wage gains have lifted household spending power somewhat.
""Both factors are helping to prevent the current slump in house price growth from developing into an outright fall in prices. Yet on the other hand, Brexit uncertainty, as well as the high level of house prices relative to incomes, continues to weigh on buyer demand,"" said Lu.
Others, like Tony Williams (NYSE:WMB) of Building Value, are more sanguine about the overall housing market's prospects following Britain's impending departure from the EU, no matter how rough.
""With no-deal, there will be a knee jerk action in which demand will fall followed by prices over the first six months of the UK's new status,"" notes Williams. ""That said, life after a no-deal Brexit will revert to type.""
Average UK house prices are forecast to rise 1.0% this year, 1.8% next and 2.7% in 2021, little changed from 1.2%, 2.0% and 2.5% in a survey taken in May.
London house prices, already down 5% from their recent peak, are due to fall 2.0%. They are not due to rise at all next year, followed by a 2.0% lift in 2021, a slightly weaker view than what was predicted a few months ago.
Capital Economics' Lu notes that with these recent falls and some recent wage gains outstripping inflation, London's average house-price-to-earnings ratio has slipped to 12 times from a recent peak of 13.4.
""That adjustment, while welcome, is still small relative to past house price gains. With Brexit uncertainty set to bite further and mortgage interest rates at their floor, we think London's fall in house prices has further to run.""

Euro-area inflation was weaker than initially reported in July, raising pressure on European Central Bank policy makers to consider more stimulus in September.
Eurostat revised its July estimate for consumer price growth to 1%, down from a reading of 1.1% reported on July 31. It’s the second consecutive revision to inflation data.
The report adds to negative data over the past weeks that may convince officials that bold steps are needed to revive momentum in the euro area. Concerns about a global downturn are deepening, as Germany’s economy shrank in the second quarter while growth in the 19-nation region came in at just 0.2%.
The ECB is already expected to announce fresh measures to jump-start the euro-zone economy when policy makers meet on Sept. 12, with most economists predicting at least a cut in the deposit rate from the current minus 0.4%. President Mario Draghi signaled last month that all options are on the table, including a potential restart of quantitative easing.

The IHS Markit Household Finance Index dropped to a three-month low of 43.7 in August from 44.3 in July, and households' appetite to make major purchases fell at the second-fastest rate since September 2017.
""The Brexit haze, uncertainty over the political environment and the increased possibility of the UK entering recession appear to have dented expectations,"" IHS Markit economist Joe Hayes said.
Prime Minister Boris Johnson has promised to take Britain out of the European Union by Oct. 31, even if that means leaving without a transition deal - something most economists think would put the country at high risk of recession.
Trade conflict between the United States and China, and a surprise contraction in British economic output in the three months to June, have already raised concerns in financial markets about the outlook for growth.
However British consumers have largely shrugged off Brexit worries so far, due to a solid job market and wages that are rising at their fastest rate in 11 years.
Most households still expect the BoE's next move to be to raise interest rates, IHS Markit said, but the proportion expecting a cut increased to its highest since October 2016 at 23% this month, up from 16% in July.
Worries about job security were also the greatest since March, when Britain was originally due to leave the EU. The British government decided to delay Brexit after parliament rejected its exit plan.
The majority of households expecting higher rates may please the BoE, which said this month it still expects to raise interest rates if Brexit goes reasonably smoothly and the world economy picks up.
But that stance is at odds with expectations in financial markets, which - due primarily to the risk of a no-deal Brexit - have largely priced in a 25 basis point rate cut by the time Governor Mark Carney steps down at the end of January.
IHS Markit based its data on a survey of 1,500 Britons aged 18-64 carried out by polling company Ipsos MORI between Aug. 8 and Aug. 13."

Gross domestic product rose 2.3% from a year ago, down from 2.8% in the second quarter, the National Economic and Social Development Council said Monday. That’s the slowest pace since the third quarter of 2014. The expansion was in line with the median estimate of 2.3% in a Bloomberg survey of economists.
A slowdown both domestically and abroad affected the quarter’s growth, Thosaporn Sirisumphand, secretary general of the council, said at a briefing in Bangkok. The U.S.-China trade war, global jitters and drought remain risks going forward, although a government stimulus package announced last week, as well as potential investment from companies relocating from China amid the trade war, could help offset the damage, he said.
Further stimulus is possible, including steps that focus on boosting private investment and tourism, Thosaporn told reporters. The government also will likely boost investment through public spending and disbursements by state enterprises, he said.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's exports slipped for an eighth month in July, while manufacturers' confidence turned negative for the first time in over six years as China-bound sales slumped again in a fresh sign the Sino-U.S. trade war could tip the economy into recession.
The gloomy data underscored the challenge for Japanese policymakers worried that prolonged weakness in external demand will drive a sharp economic downturn at home.
Exports in July fell 1.6% from a year earlier, Ministry of Finance data showed on Monday, dragged down by China-bound shipments of car parts and semiconductor production equipment. That compared with a 2.2% decrease expected by economists.
It marked the longest run of declines in exports since a 14-month stretch from October 2015 to November 2016. Yet there was some glimmer of hope for shippers, as export volume rose 1.5% in July year-on-year - the first positive reading in nine months.
Separately, the Reuters Tankan survey showed Japanese manufacturers' business confidence turned negative for the first time since April 2013 in August.
""My impression is that the year-on-year rise in the export volume was slightly stronger than expected. That's a positive as falling exports is the biggest issue faced by the Japanese economy,"" said Taro Saito, executive research fellow at NLI Research Institute.
""But it'll be hard for exports to recover going forward, since there's no solution in sight for the U.S.-China trade war, and the global economy and manufacturing remain weak.""
Indeed, the negative reading underlined the darkening outlook for the Japanese economy even as the most recent quarter showed a welcome improvement. Gross domestic product grew faster than expected in April-June to mark the third straight quarter of expansion, as robust domestic consumption and business investment offset the negative contribution from external demand.
Though service-sector activity remains firm in Japan, simmering international trade tensions have caused manufacturers' sentiment to worsen.
Analysts at Capital Economics said they expect imports will continue to outpace exports as consumers are seen bringing forward demand ahead of a planned sales tax hike in October.
""The upshot is that net trade may remain a drag on growth in the third quarter,"" the analysts wrote in a note to clients.
RECESSION FEAR
Anxiety about a global slump rose to fever pitch recently after an inversion in the U.S. Treasury yield curve implied a growing risk of a recession there, and data showed Germany's economy was in contraction and China's was worsening.
Exports to China, Japan's biggest trading partner, shrank 9.3% year-on-year in July, down for a fifth month. The contraction was led by sizable declines of 31.5% in semiconductor production equipment, 35% in car parts and 19% in electronics parts, the data showed.
Manufacturers' exports to China of semiconductors and electronics parts slumped as a rush of demand ahead of a U.S. ban on federal purchases of telecommunication equipment from Huawei Technologies Co Ltd [HWT.UL] wound down, analysts said.
Shipments to Asia, which account for more than half of Japan's overall exports, declined 8.3% in the year to July.
Export-reliant economies such as Japan have been hit hard by the Sino-U.S. tariff row, which has already upended supply chains and undermined global trade, investment and corporate earnings.
Japan has also been embroiled in an intensifying trade row with South Korea, further threatening to hurt the outlook for its manufacturers.
Japan's exports to the United States rose 8.4% in the year to July, driven by a jump in semiconductor production equipment, construction and mining machinery and airplanes.
It marked the tenth straight month of exports growth to the United States, following a 4.9% increase in June, which could raise the ire of U.S. President Donald Trump who has criticized Japan and other trading partners for running what he sees as unfair trade imbalances with his country.
The two countries are set to hold ministerial-level trade talks in Washington this week, with eyes on an early trade deal including U.S. beef exports and Japan's auto exports.
Imports from the United States climbed 3.5% in July, sending Japan's trade surplus with the world's biggest economy up 15.6% from a year earlier to 579.4 billion yen ($5.45 billion), the data showed."
700,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 18, 2019 07:11PM ET</span>",UK house sales stronger than normal in August: Rightmove,"LONDON (Reuters) - August, normally a quiet month for Britain's property market, has seen a surge in sales, possibly due to buyers seeking to conclude transactions before the country leaves the European Union on Oct. 31, property website Rightmove said on Monday.
Rightmove said sales in the August period, which cover the four weeks to Aug. 10, were 6.1% higher than a year earlier and their strongest for the month since 2015, bucking a generally sluggish trend since June 2016's referendum on leaving the European Union.
""While the end of October Brexit outcome remains uncertain, more buyers are now going for the certainty of doing a deal, with some having perhaps hesitated earlier in the year,"" Rightmove director Miles Shipside said.
New Prime Minister Boris Johnson has promised to take Britain out of the EU by Oct. 31, even if that means leaving without a transition deal - something most economists think will cause major disruption to businesses and overseas trade.
But British consumers have largely shrugged off Brexit worries so far, bolstered by a strong labor market and the fastest increases in wages in 11 years, in contrast to businesses, which have held back from making major investments.
House price inflation has slowed since June 2016, according to official figures. But this has largely been driven by price falls in London and surrounding areas, which have been most affected by higher property taxes on expensive housing and fears of post-Brexit job losses in the financial services sector.
Rightmove said asking prices on its website were down 1.0% on the previous month - a smaller fall than normal for August, when many buyers are away on holiday - while prices were 1.2% higher than a year earlier.
Sales rose fastest in northeast and eastern England, and the biggest fall in asking prices was in southeast England excluding London.
Rightmove based its data on more than 130,000 prices collected between July 7 and Aug. 10 from its website, which it says advertises 90% of residential property on sale in Britain."
701,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 18, 2019 07:11PM ET</span>",Japan manufacturers turn pessimistic for first time since 2013: Reuters Tankan,"By Tetsushi Kajimoto
TOKYO (Reuters) - Japanese manufacturers turned pessimistic about business prospects for the first time in more than six years in August as the specter of a global downturn looms large amid the escalating Sino-U.S. trade war, the monthly Reuters Tankan survey showed on Monday.
Concerns about weakening global demand intensified last week after a closely watched bond market indicator pointed to the growing risk of a U.S. recession, and data showed Germany's economy was in contraction and China's was worsening.[MKTS/GLOB]
The news further soured the outlook for export-reliant economies such as Japan's.
The monthly poll, which tracks the Bank of Japan's (BOJ) closely-watched tankan quarterly survey, found manufacturers' mood slid for a third straight month to minus 4 in August from the prior month's plus 3.
It was the weakest sentiment reading since April 2013, when it was minus 4, dragged down by electric machinery, metals, food processors and transport equipment.
Confidence in the service sector also plunged, to plus 13 from plus 25 in July, due to big drops at wholesalers and retailers. That will raise questions over how much longer domestic demand can remain resilient enough to offset rising external pressures, with a rise in the domestic sales tax set for October.
Private consumption constitutes about 60% of the economy.
While the Reuters Tankan's manufacturers' sentiment index is seen swinging back to plus 3 over the next three months, the service-sector index is expected to remain unchanged at plus 13 in November.
""The U.S.-China trade war, Japan's export curbs to South Korea and the recent yen rises have formed a bottleneck for sales,"" a manager of an electric machinery maker wrote in the July 31-Aug. 14 survey.
""The selling price remains in a downtrend due to expansion of e-commerce markets, while a scheduled sales tax hike keep shoppers on guard against price increases,"" a retailer manager wrote in the Reuters poll of 504 large- and mid-sized companies. A total of 258 firms responded on condition of anonymity.
The BOJ's last tankan out earlier last month showed big manufacturers' business confidence fell to a nearly three-year low in the quarter to June.
The Reuters Tankan indexes are calculated by subtracting the percentage of pessimistic respondents from optimistic ones. A negative figure means pessimists outnumber optimists."
702,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 16, 2019 01:24PM ET</span>",U.S. housing market mired in weakness; consumer sentiment ebbs,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. homebuilding fell for a third straight month in July amid a steep decline in the construction of multi-family housing units, but a jump in permits to a seven-month high offered hope for the struggling housing market.
Declining mortgage rates have done little to stimulate the housing market as land and labor shortages constrain builders' ability to construct sought-after lower-priced homes. Housing and manufacturing are the weakest spots in the economy, which this week has seen a heightened risk of recession.
""After almost a year, lower mortgage rates have done nothing to boost residential housing construction,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG in New York. ""Housing construction remains the weak link for new investment in the economy and will keep GDP growth slower than it would have been.""
Housing starts dropped 4.0% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.191 million units last month, the Commerce Department said on Friday. Data for June was revised down to show starts falling to a pace of 1.241 million units, instead of dropping to a rate of 1.253 million units as previously reported.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast housing starts would edge up to a pace of 1.257 million units in July.
The 30-year fixed mortgage rate has dropped to 3.60% from a peak of 4.94% in November, according to data from mortgage finance agency Freddie Mac.
Homebuilders say lower borrowing costs have not boosted the housing market because mortgage rates have declined due to economic uncertainty. The Federal Reserve cut interest rates last month for the first time since 2008, citing growing risks to the economy from the Trump administration's bitter trade war with China, as well as slowing global growth.
Financial markets expect the U.S. central bank will lower its short-term interest rate by another 25 basis points because of the ongoing trade impasse, which this week contributed to an inversion of the U.S. Treasury yield curve and unleashed a sharp sell-off on global stock markets.
The U.S. 2-year Treasury note yield rose above the 10-year note yield on Wednesday for the first time since June 2007, signaling a recession was looming. 
Worries tied to the trade tensions and Fed rate cut weighed on consumer sentiment in early August, another report showed on Friday. The University of Michigan said its consumer sentiment index fell to 92.1 early this month, the lowest reading since January, from 98.4 in July. The survey's current conditions measure dropped to its lowest level since late 2016. 
According to the University of Michigan, monetary and trade policies have heightened consumer uncertainty about their future financial prospects. Noting that declining borrowing costs have long been associated with the start of an economic downturn, it said the impact of last month's rate cut on consumers was ""to increase apprehensions about a possible recession.""
Against the backdrop of growing recession risks, consumer sentiment data will be closely watched in the coming months. Consumer spending is the economy's main pillar. Retail sales surged in July.
""The big decline in the University of Michigan consumer confidence index is the first indication that the U.S. consumer might not save the world economy after all,"" said Paul Ashworth, chief economist at Capital Economics in Toronto. ""Even though consumption has been unusually strong in recent months, there is no guarantee that trend will continue.""
U.S. Treasury prices were trading lower, lifting the yield on the benchmark 10-year note from three-year lows. That led to a broad rise in stocks on Wall Street. The dollar (DXY) was little changed against a basket of currencies.
LAND, LABOR SHORTAGES 
Single-family homebuilding, which accounts for the largest share of the housing market, increased 1.3% to a rate of 876,000 units in July, the highest level in six months. 
Single-family housing starts rose in the Northeast, West and Midwest. But homebuilding dropped 3.9% in the populous South, likely disrupted by Tropical Storm Barry, which drenched Louisiana in the middle of July. 
Building permits surged 8.4%, the largest gain since June 2017, to a rate of 1.336 million units in July. Last month's surge is a positive development for permits, which have been weak this year. Much of the decline in permits has been concentrated in the single-family housing segment.
A survey on Thursday showed confidence among homebuilders nudged up in August. Builders reported firm demand for single-family homes but said they ""continue to struggle with rising construction costs stemming from excessive regulations, a chronic shortage of workers and a lack of buildable lots.""
Residential investment has contracted for six straight quarters, the longest such stretch since the 2007-2009 Great Recession. Growth estimates for the third quarter range from a 1.5% annualized pace to a 2.1% rate. The economy grew at a 2.1% rate in the second quarter, decelerating from the first quarter's 3.1% pace. 
""A dearth of cheap lots and persistent labor shortages are constraining builders, especially for homes costing less than $300,000, which have the greatest demand,"" said Robert Frick, corporate economist with Navy Federal Credit Union in Vienna, Virginia. 
Permits to build single-family homes increased 1.8% to a rate of 838,000 units in July, the highest level in eight months. Still, permits continue to lag housing starts, which suggests single-family homebuilding could remain tepid.
Starts for the volatile multi-family housing segment dropped 16.2% to a rate of 315,000 units in July. Permits for the construction of multi-family homes surged 21.8% to a rate of 498,000 units last month.

Housing completions increased 7.2% to 1.250 million units last month. Realtors estimate that housing starts and completion rates need to be in a range of 1.5 million to 1.6 million units per month to plug the inventory gap. The stock of housing under construction fell 0.5% to 1.134 million units in July.

Residential starts dropped 4% to a 1.19 million annualized rate after a downwardly revised 1.24 million pace in the prior month, according to government figures released Friday. The median forecast in a Bloomberg survey of economists called for a 1.26 million pace.
Multifamily home construction slumped for a second month, while starts of single-family housing increased to the highest level since January.
Key Insights
 


The data on single-family homebuilding, bolstered by the highest level of permits in that category since November, suggest homebuilding remains stable in the face of lot and labor shortages. Some builders are trying to alleviate a nationwide deficit of affordable housing as solid wages and low mortgage rates support demand.


 


Total building permits, a proxy for future construction, rose 8.4% to a 1.34 million rate, exceeding estimates. The monthly increase was the largest in more than two years.


 


Data out Thursday showed sentiment among U.S. homebuilders rose in August to match this year’s high, but a weaker outlook suggests upward momentum in the months ahead may prove fleeting.


 


Single-family starts climbed 1.3% to 876,000 annualized rate, and permits rose for a third month.


 


Data out next week are forecast to show existing-home sales, which make up the majority of the U.S. housing market, increased in July while the pace of new home sales eased.

Gross domestic product expanded 4.9% in the second quarter from a year ago, up from 4.5% in the previous quarter. That beat the median estimate of 4.7% in a Bloomberg survey of 22 economists and was the strongest expansion since early last year.
Bank Negara Malaysia Governor Nor Shamsiah Mohd Yunus said the central bank expects full-year GDP growth of 4.3%-4.8%, affirming the previous estimate.
Malaysia’s strong showing bucks the trend across the region, where the U.S.-China trade war has taken a toll on economies that rely on trade for their momentum. Earlier this week neighboring Singapore cut its full-year growth forecast almost to zero, and Thailand is expected to roll out a stimulus package later Friday.  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS). analysts on Thursday downgraded their forecasts for Asia’s four ""Tiger"" economies, given the trade tensions.

707,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 15, 2019 01:21PM ET</span>",Strong U.S. retail sales ease gloom over economy,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. retail sales surged in July as consumers bought a range of goods even as they cut back on motor vehicle purchases, helping to assuage financial market fears that the economy was heading into recession.
The upbeat report from the Commerce Department on Thursday, however, will likely not change expectations that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates again next month as news from the manufacturing sector remains dour, underscoring the darkening outlook for the economy against the backdrop of trade tensions and slowing growth overseas.
President Donald Trump cheered the strong retail sales data, which came a day after a key part of the U.S. Treasury yield curve inverted for the first time since June 2007 and triggered a stock market sell-off. An inverted Treasury yield curve is historically a reliable predictor of looming recessions. 
Trump's ""America First"" policies, which have led the United States into a bitter trade war with China, have been blamed for threatening to derail the longest U.S. economic expansion in history and unleash a global recession.
""The United States is now, by far, the Biggest, Strongest and Most Powerful Economy in the World, it is not even close!"" Trump wrote on Twitter. ""As others falter, we will only get stronger. Consumers are in the best shape ever, plenty of cash.""
Financial markets have fully priced in a 25-basis-point rate cut at the U.S. central bank's Sept. 17-18 policy meeting. The Fed lowered its short-term interest rate by a quarter of a percentage point last month, citing the acrimonious U.S.-China trade fight and slowing global economies.
But the data could push markets to dial back expectations of a 50-basis-point rate cut next month.
""So yes, consumers are lifting economic growth and easing pressure on the Federal Reserve to cut more aggressively, but the trade war itself, and the rhetoric that accompanies it will push for more rate cuts,"" said Jennifer Lee, a senior economist at BMO Capital Markets in Toronto.
Retail sales increased 0.7% last month after gaining 0.3% in June, the government said. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast retail sales would rise 0.3% in July. Compared to July last year, retail sales increased 3.4%.
Excluding automobiles, gasoline, building materials and food services, retail sales jumped 1.0% last month after advancing by 0.7% in June. These so-called core retail sales correspond most closely with the consumer spending component of gross domestic product.
Solid retail sales were reinforced by strong second-quarter results from Walmart Inc (N:WMT). The world's largest retailer posted a 20-quarter, or five-year, streak of U.S. growth, unmatched by any other retail chain, and raised its earnings forecasts for the year.
U.S. stocks were trading largely higher after Wednesday's sharp losses. The dollar (DXY) edged up against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices rose, with the yield curve steepening a little after Wednesday's inversion.
STRONG LABOR MARKET
July's gain in core retail sales suggested strong consumer spending early in the third quarter, though the pace will likely slow from the April-June quarter's robust 4.3% annualized rate. Consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of the economy, is being underpinned by the lowest unemployment rate in nearly half a century.
While a separate report from the Labor Department on Thursday showed an increase in the number of Americans filing applications for unemployment benefits last week, the trend in claims continued to point to a strong labor market.
Solid consumer spending is blunting some of the hit on the economy from the downturn in manufacturing, which is underscored by weak business investment. There are, however, red flags for the labor market coming from manufacturing.
The sector's struggles were highlighted by a third report from the Fed on Thursday showing factory production dropped 0.4% in July. Output at factories has declined more than 1.5% since December 2018. Manufacturing, which makes up about 12% of the economy, is also being weighed down by an inventory overhang, especially in the automotive sector.
The troubles appear to have continued into the third quarter. Though a report from the Philadelphia Fed on Thursday showed factory activity in the mid-Atlantic region slowed moderately in August amid an increase in new orders, manufacturers reported hiring fewer workers and slashing hours. 
A measure of factory employment dropped to its lowest level since November 2016. The weakness in factory employment in the region that covers eastern Pennsylvania, southern New Jersey and Delaware was mirrored by another survey from the New York Fed. Activity in New York state was little changed this month, with employment measures deteriorating further.
""The health of factories is still an important driver of growth and the soft patch for production remains a factor that is keeping economic growth in the slow lane,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG in New York.
Manufacturing productivity tumbled at its fastest pace in nearly two years in the second quarter, with factories cutting hours for workers, another report from the Labor Department showed.
The economy grew at a 2.1% rate in the second quarter, decelerating from the first quarter's 3.1% pace. Growth estimates for the third quarter range from a 1.5% pace to a 2.1% rate.
In July, auto sales fell 0.6% after rising 0.3% in June. Receipts at service stations rebounded 1.8%, reflecting higher gasoline prices. Online and mail-order retail sales jumped 2.8%, the most in six months, after rising 1.9% in June. They were likely boosted by Amazon.com Inc's (O:AMZN) Prime Day event.
There were increases in sales at clothing, furniture and building material stores. Sales at restaurants and bars accelerated 1.1%. But spending at hobby, musical instrument and book stores dropped 1.1% last month.

""The consumer is incredibly resilient,"" said Lindsey Piegza, chief economist at Stifel in Chicago. ""But without growth from housing investment and manufacturing, the consumer will be hard-pressed to continue to alone support the U.S. economy.""

The Commerce Department said the unchanged reading in business inventories followed a 0.3% increase in May.
Inventories are a key component of gross domestic product. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast inventories would rise 0.1% in June.
Retail inventories fell 0.3% in June instead of dipping 0.1% as estimated in an advance report published last month. Motor vehicle inventories declined 0.5% in June, rather than falling 0.3% as previously reported.
Retail inventories excluding autos, which go into the calculation of GDP, slipped 0.1% as reported last month.
The government in its advance GDP report last month said inventories subtracted 0.86 percentage point from economic growth in the second quarter. That resulted in the economy growing at an 2.1% annualized rate, a slowdown from the first quarter's brisk 3.1% pace.
But economists expect the government will trim its second-quarter GDP growth estimate after data on June construction spending and wholesale inventories came in lower than what the government had assumed in the advance GDP report.
Wholesale inventories were unchanged in June. Stocks at manufacturers rose 0.2%. Inventory accumulation is slowing following a surge in consumer spending in the second quarter. Businesses are also carefully managing stock levels because of the darkening economic outlook, triggered by trade tensions between the United States and China.
Business sales edged up 0.1% in June after dipping 0.1% in the prior month. At June's sales pace, it would take 1.39 months for businesses to clear shelves, down from 1.40 in May."

711,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 15, 2019 08:53AM ET</span>",U.S. Retail Sales Top Estimates With Biggest Gain Since March,"(Bloomberg) -- U.S. retail sales rose by the most in four months and exceeded projections in July on a surge in online purchases, signaling consumer spending continues to prop up the expansion.
The value of overall sales climbed 0.7% after a downwardly revised 0.3% increase in the prior month, according to Commerce Department figures released Thursday. The reading topped all estimates in a Bloomberg survey of economists that had called for a 0.3% gain.
Sales in the “control group” subset, which some analysts view as a more reliable gauge of underlying consumer demand, rose 1% and also topped the most optimistic projection after a 0.7% rise in June. The measure excludes food services, car dealers, building-materials stores and gasoline stations.
The fifth-straight increase in retail sales shows Americans, buoyed by plentiful jobs and wage gains, remain comfortable spending -- a welcome sign as President Donald Trump's trade war with China weighs on the global outlook with threats of new levies on consumer goods. Personal consumption, the biggest part of the economy, was the largest driver of the expansion in the second quarter.
Ten of 13 major retail categories increased, led by a 2.8% jump for non-store sellers, which include online shopping. Retail sales in July may have been propped up by Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN).'s 48-hour Prime Day event, which the company said surpassed sales from the previous Black Friday and Cyber Monday combined. The promotion also likely drove shoppers to rivals Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc. and  Target  Corp. (NYSE:TGT)
Sales at department stores climbed 1.2% for the best gain since October.
Among the main categories, spending declined at automobile dealers, while readings for both health and personal care stores and sports and hobby retailers dropped the most this year.
Rate Cut
Federal Reserve officials cut interest rates last month for the first time in a decade while saying the labor market remains strong and citing robust consumption despite growing headwinds. Still, Trump’s feud with Beijing adds to global growth risks as signs of fragility spread from Germany to China and Singapore.
Stocks slumped this week and yields on two-year U.S. Treasuries rose above 10-year notes for the first time since the financial crisis, an inversion widely viewed as a sign of coming recession.
Motor vehicle dealers saw spending drop 0.6% after increasing 0.3% in the previous month. Industry data from Wards Automotive Group previously showed July unit sales slipped to a three-month low.
Excluding automobiles and gasoline, retail sales rose 0.9%, after a 0.6% gain the previous month.
Filling-station receipts increased 1.8%, the report showed, as gasoline prices were largely unchanged in the month according to separate data. The figures aren't adjusted for price changes, so sales could reflect changes in gasoline costs, sales, or both.
Labor Market
Separate data showed labor market strength eased somewhat, though conditions remain tight overall.
Jobless claims rose to a six-week high of 220,000 in the week ended Aug. 10, and a measure of continuing claims -- the number of unemployed Americans who qualify for benefits under the unemployment program -- jumped to 1.726 million in the prior week for the biggest gain since February. Economists had projected initial claims would rise to 212,000.
Meanwhile, a measure of nonfarm productivity grew at a 2.3% pace in the second quarter, exceeding projections, after an upwardly revised 3.5% rate in the first quarter. Unit labor costs increased at a 2.4% pace after a 5.5% gain that was revised up from a drop.

712,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 15, 2019 08:51AM ET</span>",U.S. productivity slows in second quarter; labor costs revised up in first quarter,"WASHINGTON, (Reuters) - U.S. worker productivity slowed in the second quarter amid a sharp drop in productivity in the manufacturing sector, while labor costs were far stronger than previously estimated in the first quarter.
The Labor Department said on Thursday nonfarm productivity, which measures hourly output per worker, increased at a 2.3% annualized rate in the last quarter. Data for the first quarter was revised slightly up to show productivity rising at a pace of 3.5% instead of the previously reported 3.4% rate.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast second-quarter productivity would rise at a 1.5% rate. Manufacturing productivity fell at a 1.6% rate in the second quarter, the worst performance since the third quarter of 2017, after rising at a 1.1% pace in the first three months of the year.
The slowdown in overall productivity was flagged by a deceleration in gross domestic product growth in the April-June period. The economy grew at a 2.1% rate in the second quarter after expanding at a 3.1% pace in the first three months of the year. Compared to the second quarter of 2018, productivity increased at a rate of 1.8%.
The government also published revisions to prior productivity data, which showed unit labor costs surging in the first quarter instead of declining as previously reported.
Unit labor costs, the price of labor per single unit of output, rose at a 2.4% rate in the second quarter after surging at a 5.5% rate in the prior quarter.
Unit labor costs were previously reported to have slumped at a 1.6% pace in the first quarter. Compared to the second quarter of 2018, labor costs rose at a 2.5% rate, suggesting inflation could remain moderate.
In the second quarter, hourly compensation increased at a 4.8% rate, slowing from the first quarter's upwardly revised 9.2% pace. Hourly compensation increased at a 4.3% rate compared to the second quarter of 2018."
713,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 15, 2019 08:41AM ET</span>",U.S. weekly jobless claims rise more than expected,"WASHINGTON, (Reuters) - The number of Americans filing applications for unemployment benefits increased more than expected last week, but the trend continued to point to a strong labor market.
Initial claims for state unemployment benefits increased 9,000 to a seasonally adjusted 220,000 for the week ended Aug. 10, the Labor Department said on Thursday. Data for the prior week was revised to show 2,000 more applications received than previously reported.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast claims would rise 214,000 in the latest week. The Labor Department said there were no states estimated last week.
The four-week moving average of initial claims, considered a better measure of labor market trends as it irons out week-to-week volatility, edged up 1,000 to 213,750 last week.
There are still no signs that a bitter trade war between the United States and China, which has contributed to an inversion of the U.S. Treasury yield curve, was spilling over to the labor market. The U.S. 2-year Treasury note yield rose above the 10-year bond yield on Wednesday for the first time since June 2007.
An inverted U.S. yield curve is widely viewed as a classic recession signal. Concerns over the impact of the trade tensions between Washington and Beijing on the U.S. economic expansion, the longest on record, prompted the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates last month for the first time since 2008.
Financial markets have fully priced in another rate cut at the U.S. central bank's Sept. 17-18 policy meeting.
While hiring has slowed, the pace of job gains remains well above the roughly 100,000 needed per month to keep up with growth in the working-age population.
Thursday's claims report also showed the number of people receiving benefits after an initial week of aid increased 39,000 to 1.73 million for the week ended Aug. 3. The four-week moving average of the so-called continuing claims rose 9,250 to 1.70 million."
714,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 15, 2019 08:41AM ET</span>",U.S. retail sales surge in July in boost to economy,"WASHINGTON, (Reuters) - U.S. retail sales surged in July as consumers bought a range of goods even as they cut back on motor vehicle purchases, which could help to assuage financial markets' concerns that the economy was heading into recession.
The Commerce Department said on Thursday retail sales rose 0.7% last month. Data for June was revised slightly down to show retail sales gaining 0.3% instead of increasing 0.4% as previously reported.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast retail sales would rise 0.3% in July. Compared to July last year, retail sales increased 3.4%.
Excluding automobiles, gasoline, building materials and food services, retail sales jumped 1.0% last month after advancing by an unrevised 0.7% in June. These so-called core retail sales correspond most closely with the consumer spending component of gross domestic product.
July's gain in core retail sales suggested strong consumer spending early in the third quarter, though the pace will likely slow from the April-June quarter's robust 4.3% annualized rate. Consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of the economy, is being underpinned by the lowest unemployment rate in nearly half a century.
That is blunting some of the hit on the economy from a downturn in manufacturing, which is underscored by weak business investment. The economy grew at a 2.1% rate in the second quarter, decelerating from the first quarter's 3.1% pace. Growth estimates for the third quarter are below a 2.0% rate.
The data will likely not change expectations that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates again next month as the outlook for the economy continues to darken against the backdrop of trade tensions and slowing growth overseas.
A key part of the U.S. Treasury yield curve inverted on Wednesday for the first time since June 2007, triggering a stock market sell-off. An inverted Treasury yield curve is historically a reliable predictor of looming recessions.
Financial markets have fully priced in a 25-basis-point rate cut at the U.S. central bank's Sept. 17-18 policy meeting. The Fed lowered its short-term interest rate by a quarter point last month, citing the acrimonious U.S.-China trade war and slowing global economies.
Auto sales fell 0.6% in July after rising 0.3% in June. Receipts at service stations rebounded 1.8%, reflecting higher gasoline prices. Sales at building material stores gained 0.2%.
Receipts at clothing stores increased 0.8%. Online and mail-order retail sales jumped 2.8%, the most in six months, after rising 1.9% in June. They were likely boosted by Amazon.com Inc's (O:AMZN) Prime Day. Receipts at furniture stores rose 0.3%.
Sales at restaurants and bars accelerated 1.1%. But spending at hobby, musical instrument and book stores dropped 1.1% last month."

LONDON (Reuters) - British retail sales unexpectedly edged up in July, helped by the strongest growth in online spending in three years, as consumers continued to support the economy before the Oct. 31 Brexit deadline. 
Monthly retail sales volumes rose 0.2% after a 0.9% surge in June, the Office for National Statistics said on Thursday, beating the average forecast for a 0.2% decline from a Reuters poll of economists.
Compared with July 2018, sales were up 3.3%, slowing from 3.8% in June but at the top end of forecasts.
Britain's economy contracted in the second quarter, a hangover from stockpiling before the original March 29 Brexit deadline, despite solid growth in household spending.
Thursday's data suggested consumers continued to take Brexit in their stride, helped by modest inflation and wages growing at their fastest rate in 11 years.
That has aided the world's fifth-biggest economy at a time when many companies have cut investment because of growing uncertainty about Brexit.
Sterling showed little reaction to Thursday's data, which contrasted with a British Retail Consortium survey that showed spending fell in the year to July at the fastest pace on record for that month.
""Retailers won't be getting carried away by these (ONS) figures,"" Karen Johnson, head of retail at  Barclays  (LON:BARC) Corporate Banking, said.
""They will continue to be mindful of the looming Brexit threat and potential impact on their international supply chains, with possible cost increases and price rises on the horizon.""
In the three months to July, the ONS said, retail sales grew 0.5%, the smallest increase this year, reflecting a drop in sales volumes in May.
""Although still declining across the quarter, there was an increase in sales for department stores in July for the first time this year,"" ONS statistician Rhian Murphy said. ""Strong online sales growth on the month was driven by promotions.""
Online sales jumped 6.9% on the month, their biggest rise in volume since May 2016. Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) held its annual ""Prime Day"" sales promotion last month, a major driver of sales for the company.
However, household-goods stores reported their biggest monthly drop in sales in two years, down 5.4%. Anecdotal evidence suggested warm weather had kept shoppers out of furniture and lighting stores.
Stable inflation, the strongest rise in wages since 2008 and some of the lowest unemployment rates since the mid-1970s have continued to boost household incomes, although after inflation wages are still below their peak before the financial crisis.
But there have been signs that consumers could turn more cautious as Britain's political crisis drags on. Household savings relative to income is not far off record low levels.
News from retailers has been mixed. Fashion chain Next shrugged off Britain's retail gloom on Wednesday and has reported a surprising rise in full-price sales. 

But baby products retailer Mothercare blamed an uncertain and volatile home market coupled with fragile consumer confidence as reasons it would not report a rise in annual profit.

716,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 15, 2019 05:51AM ET</span>",Modest gains in China's new home prices give authorities breathing room,"By Yawen Chen and Kevin Yao
BEIJING (Reuters) - China's new home prices rose in July as the property sector held up as one of the few bright spots in the slowing economy, although easing momentum in some markets took immediate pressure off regulators to unleash major new curbs to deter speculation.
Average new home prices in China's 70 major cities rose 0.6% in July from the previous month, unchanged from growth reported in June and marking the 51st straight month of gains, Reuters calculated based on National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) data on Thursday.
On a year-on-year basis, home prices rose at their weakest pace this year in July by 9.7%, slowing from a 10.3% gain in June.
Analysts said the moderate gains were a positive sign the market was not overheating. That helped the CSI300 real estate index <.CSI000952> recoup some of its earlier heavy losses following a major slide in global stock markets.
""Today's data is actually pretty good, reflecting that tougher stance and not alarming at all,"" said David Ji, Head of Research & Consultancy, Greater China at Knight Frank, referring to central policymakers' July decision to not use the property market as a form of short-term stimulus.
""If I were a provincial official who has a 'key performance indicator' to hit, I would feel happy because it is clearly telling you the property market is off the peak.""
The politburo's pledge in July not to overly stimulate the property sector, made at a high-profile work meeting, was interpreted by analysts as a warning to the investors against heavy bets on the market.
The Chinese government has clamped down on speculative investment in the housing market since 2016 to prevent a sharp correction as prices soared. There have also been growing concerns that high house prices are pushing up the cost of business and restricting consumer spending.
But efforts by some regional governments to attract talent through home purchase incentives, along with easing credit conditions have kept prices surprisingly resilient this year.
The majority of the 70 cities surveyed by the NBS still reported a monthly price increase for new homes, although the number of cities fell to 60 in July from 63 cities in June.
In a sign the market's resilience may be waning in parts, property investment slowed to its weakest this year, data showed on Wednesday.
CONCERNS LINGER
Chinese authorities have sought in recent years to contain risks in the often volatile property market while not undermining growth in the broader economy.
The property sector directly impacts over 40 industries in China and a fast deterioration would risk adding to pressure the economy, which is slowing due to weak domestic demand and an escalating trade war with the United States.
While tightening measures have been rolled out across hundreds of Chinese cities, price trends have been uneven across the country.
Prices are holding up better than expected particularly in top tier cities, said Rosealea Yao, China investment analyst with Gavekal Dragonomics. Average prices in the four tier-1 cities - Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou and Shenzhen rose - 0.3% from a month earlier, quickening from a 0.2% gain in June, NBS data showed. 
Pingdingshan, a city of 4.9 million in central Henan province, was the top price performer in July, with a robust monthly gain of 1.6%.
But economists also caution that the negative impact on the sector from the central government's increasingly hawkish stance will only start to become more pronounced in two to three months.
China's banks extended surprisingly fewer new yuan loans in July, reflecting subdued demand. New household loans, mostly mortgages, fell to 511.2 billion yuan in July from 671.7 billion yuan in June.
In a meeting on Thursday, the Shenzhen branch of China's central bank said it will control second half growth of the city's new real estate loans in a ""reasonable"" manner, according to state-owned Shanghai Securities News. It did not give details.
Home prices in tier-2 cities, which include most of the larger provincial capitals, increased 0.7% in July versus a 0.8% rise in the previous month. And Tier-3 cities rose 0.7% on a monthly basis, in line with June's pace.

""I expect housing policies to tighten in China, especially for local governments that has infrastructure projects to support local GDP growth,"" said Iris Pang, Greater China economist at ING.

718,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 15, 2019 12:25AM ET</span>",Australia's Jobs Market Keeps Defying Gravity as Hiring Soars,"(Bloomberg) -- Australia’s labor market surged in July, adding almost three times the forecast number of jobs, while unemployment remained stuck at 5.2% as the workforce swelled to a fresh record.
The economy added 41,100 roles from the previous month, with more than three-quarters of them full-time, the statistics bureau said in Sydney Thursday. Economists had forecast a gain of just 14,000. The participation rate, which wasn’t expected to move, slightly rose to a new high of 66.1%.
“The rebound in employment growth likely reflects the rebound in hiring intentions after the federal election, which temporarily disrupted firms’ hiring plans,” said Sarah Hunter, head of macroeconomics at BIS Oxford Economics in Sydney. “It also highlights that the amount of spare capacity in the market is much larger than previously thought.”
Australia’s center-right government was re-elected in a surprise result in May and last month was probably the earliest the labor market could reflect the outcome. It put an end to opposition plans to scrap housing tax breaks and lift the burden on high income earners. Similarly, the Reserve Bank had cut rates in June and did so again in July, which might also have lifted confidence.
The Aussie dollar rose to 67.84 U.S. cents at 12:55 p.m. in Sydney from 67.58 prior to the report’s release.
Lowe’s Dilemma
For RBA chief Philip Lowe, the jobs result prolongs his conundrum. The strength of hiring and swelling participation speak to a healthy labor market, yet the constant increase in job seekers pushes his goal of lowering unemployment ever further away. He estimates the jobless rate needs to come down to near 4.5% to reignite inflation.
“Normally the employment growth we have experienced over the past two years would have led to a sizable decline in the unemployment rate,” said Callam Pickering, an economist at global jobs website Indeed, who previously worked at the central bank. “These are not normal times. High population growth and rising participation has instead put upward pressure on measures of unemployment.”
That’s underscored by the underemployment and underutilization rates both increasing 0.2 percentage point to 8.4% and 13.6% respectively, suggesting stronger wage growth remains a fair way off.
Australia’s job gains were led by Queensland, New South Wales and Victoria, the east coast states that have benefited most from the RBA’s record-low cash rate that helped drive a wave of apartment construction in recent years.
The nation’s labor market has held up surprisingly well even as the economy slowed sharply since mid-2018. One explanation is that much of the hiring is government-related and impervious to prevailing economic conditions.
The RBA’s lowering of the full-employment estimate follows in the footsteps of other developed-world counterparts, who’ve had to wait for their jobless rates to fall to exceptionally low levels to spur wage growth. Markets are predicting the RBA will have to ease further from the current 1% cash rate to keep pushing down unemployment and keep up with a wave of global easing."
719,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 14, 2019 12:51PM ET</span>","U.S. import prices rebound, but trend still subdued","By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. import prices unexpectedly rose in July, but the underlying trend continued to be weak, pointing to subdued imported inflation pressures.
The report from the Labor Department on Wednesday suggested inflation could remain moderate despite a broad increase in consumer prices in July, which could allow the Federal Reserve to cut interest rate further to limit the economic damage from the U.S.-China trade war.
President Donald Trump on Tuesday said a 10% tariff due to be imposed on thousands of Chinese imports, including technology products, clothing and footwear, on Sept. 1 would be delayed until Dec. 15.
But analysts said the move did nothing to ease concerns about the economy, which were amplified on Wednesday by the inversion of a key part of the U.S. Treasury yield curve, historically a reliable indicator of a coming recession.
The Fed lowered its short-term interest rate by 25 basis points last month for the first time since 2008, citing trade tensions and slowing global growth. Financial markets have fully priced in another quarter-point cut at the U.S. central bank's Sept. 17-18 policy meeting.
""The U.S. inflation data have come in a little hot in July, but this won't deter the Fed from cutting interest rates in September,"" said Ryan Sweet, a senior economist at Moody's Analytics in West Chester, Pennsylvania. ""We don't view the decision (to delay tariffs) as a de-escalation in the trade tensions between the U.S. and China.""
Import prices increased 0.2% last month as a rebound in the cost of petroleum products offset declines in prices for capital goods and motor vehicles, the government said. Import prices dropped 1.1% in June.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast import prices would be unchanged in July. In the 12 months through July, import prices dropped 1.8% after decreasing 2.0% in June. 
U.S. Treasury prices rallied, with the yield on the U.S. 10-year Treasury (US10YT=RR) note tipping 2.1 basis points below 2-year Treasury yields (US2YT=RR), the first time this spread has been negative since 2007, according to Refinitiv data. 
Major U.S. stock indexes were down more than 2.2% while the dollar (DXY) rose against a basket of currencies.
A report from the Mortgage Bankers Association on Wednesday showed the 30-year fixed mortgage rate dropped eight basis points to 3.93 percent last week, the lowest level since November 2016. 
So far the lower borrowing costs are boosting refinancing activity, which surged to a three-year high last week. The housing market is one of the weakest spots in the economy, with residential investment contracting for six straight quarters, the longest such stretch since the Great Recession.
EXPORT PRICES REBOUND In July, prices for imported fuels and lubricants rebounded 1.8% after falling 7.3% in the prior month. Petroleum prices increased 1.9% after plunging 7.0% in June. Imported food prices fell 0.5%, the third straight monthly drop.
Excluding fuels and food, import prices were unchanged last month after dropping 0.2% in June. The core import prices fell 1.5% in the 12 months through July.
The cost of imported capital goods decreased 0.1% last month after falling 0.2% in June. The price of imported motor vehicles and parts declined 0.3% last month. Prices for imported consumer goods excluding automobiles rose 0.2% after being flat in June.
The cost of goods imported from China dipped 0.1% last month after falling 0.2% in June. Prices fell 1.6% in the 12 months through July, matching June's decline. Import prices exclude tariffs as the duties are paid by U.S. businesses and consumers.
""There is no sign in these data that China is absorbing the impact of higher tariffs through lower prices since the decline in import prices from China is in line with overall import price movements even though tariffs have fallen disproportionately on China,"" said John Ryding, chief economist at RDQ Economics in New York. 
This undercuts the White House's argument that China is paying for the tariffs.
The Labor Department report also showed export prices rose 0.2% in July, boosted by gains in prices for agricultural and nonagricultural products, after declining for two straight months. Export prices fell 0.9% on a year-on-year basis in July after decreasing 1.6% in June.
Prices for exported agricultural products rose 0.4%, lifted by a surge in prices for soybeans, other animal feeds, nuts and vegetables. Prices for agricultural products jumped 3.7% in the 12 months to July, the largest advance since June 2017.

Prices for exported nonagricultural goods rose 0.2% in July after tumbling 1.0% in June. In the 12 months through July, prices dropped 1.5%.

720,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 14, 2019 08:44AM ET</span>",Shrinking German economy 'on edge of recession' as exports stutter,"By Michael Nienaber
BERLIN (Reuters) - Slumping exports sent Germany's economy into reverse in the second quarter, with prospects of an early recovery slim as its manufacturers struggle at the sharp end of a global slowdown amplified by tariff conflicts and fallout from Brexit.
Overall output fell 0.1% quarter-on-quarter, data showed on Wednesday. With pressure growing on a thus far reluctant government to provide more fiscal stimulus, the economy minister said action was needed to prevent a second consecutive quarter of contraction that would tip the country into recession.
The global slowdown, reinforced by Chinese industrial output expanding at its lowest rates in 17 years in July, has broadly impacted the euro zone, where corresponding data showed second quarter growth halved to 0.2%.
But Germany's traditionally export-reliant economy - Europe's largest - has been particularly vulnerable, amid signs that the boost it has received from a sustained period of surging domestic demand is waning.
""Today's GDP report definitely marks the end of a golden decade for the German economy,"" said ING analyst Carsten Brzeski.
""Trade conflicts, global uncertainty and the struggling automotive sector have finally brought (it)... down on its knee.""
On a calendar-adjusted basis, annual growth slowed to 0.4% from 0.9% in the first quarter, the Federal Statistics Office data showed, and for 2019 overall Berlin expects growth to drop to just 0.5% from last year's 1.5%.
(GRAPHIC - German, euro zone growth slowdown: https://tmsnrt.rs/2N3setK)
The economy ministry called the outlook subdued, noting that Britain's scheduled exit from the EU on Oct. 31 looked likely to be a disorderly one, while Economy Minister Peter Altmaier said Wednesday's data was a wake-up call.
""We are in a phase of economic weakness but not yet in recession. We can avoid that if we take the right measures,"" Altmaier told mass-market daily Bild.
His ministry said impetus was unlikely to come from the industrial sector, whose BDI association - in an unusual move -joined a growing chorus of voices urging the government to kick-start growth by ditching its balanced budget rule and finance more public investments through new debt.
A government spokeswoman said Berlin did not currently see ""any need for further measures to stabilize the economy,"" which was still expected to grow slightly this year.
Despite Wednesday's headline quarterly figure matching expectations, markets also took fright, with the yield on Germany's benchmark 10-year government bond hitting a record low of -0.624%.
""The bottom line is that the German economy is teetering on the edge of recession,"" Andrew Kenningham from Capital Economics said, noting that exporters were facing an even bigger potential hit if a no-deal Brexit materialized.
DOMESTIC SAFETY NET?
The statistics office said that net trade slowed second quarter economic activity as exports recorded a stronger quarter-on-quarter decrease than imports.
Construction was also a drag, after the sector pushed up overall growth in the first three months due to an unusually mild winter.
In a conclusion echoed by the economy ministry and Bundesbank President Jens Weidmann, the office said domestic demand remained robust.
That has become an important growth driver for Germany in recent years as consumers benefit from record-high employment, inflation-busting pay hikes and low borrowing costs.
But UniCredit analyst Andreas Rees suggested the positive impact of those factors was limited.
""For a year now, the German economy has been only crawling forward,"" Rees said, with the many uncertainties facing exporters presaging more pain over the rest of the year.
ING's Brzeski said a national debate about easing fiscal policy to provide stimulus - a focus for international criticism of the government's economic management since the peak of the financial crisis - would get more heated.
In a guest article in Wednesday's edition of business daily Handelsblatt, BDI association managing director Joachim Lang said the balanced budget that the government has stuck to rigidly since 2014 ""should be called into question in an economically fragile situation"".
A government official told Reuters last week that Berlin was considering issuing new debt to finance a costly climate protection package.
On Tuesday, Chancellor Angela Merkel poured cold water on the calls for more fiscal stimulus, and on Wednesday the government spokeswoman said this position had not changed.
""The fiscal policy of the German government is already expansive,"" the spokeswoman added.
Merkel had noted the already agreed removal of the Soli income tax surcharge for most employees from 2021, a relief worth some 11 billion euros per year that is likely to support domestic demand and with it overall growth.

European Union statistics office Eurostat said gross domestic product (GDP) growth in the 19-country euro zone was 0.2% in the second quarter versus the previous quarter, a slowdown from 0.4% percent in the first three months of 2019.
The GDP flash estimates numbers, including year-on-year growth of 1.1% from the second quarter of 2019, were in line with economists' forecasts.
German GDP fell 0.1% quarter-on-quarter, Germany's Federal Statistics Office said earlier on Wednesday. The annual growth rate in Europe's largest economy slowed to 0.4% in the second quarter from 0.9% in the first.
A global slowdown has affected growth across western Europe, but Germany's traditionally export-reliant economy has been particularly vulnerable.
Industrial production in the euro zone area fell by 1.6% in June compared with the previous month, and by 2.6% from the same month in 2018. Economists had predicted less sharp drops in output of 1.4% month-on-month and 1.2% year-on-year.
Employment growth in the euro zone area slowed to 0.2% quarter-on-quarter from 0.4% in first quarter, and 1.1% year-on-year from 1.3% in first three months of 2019.
Although employment growth is on a downtrend across the euro zone area, unemployment in Germany is just above its record low of 4.9% and data on Wednesday showed France's jobless rate fell to 8.5% in the second quarter, its lowest since the end of 2008.
However, economists say the employment outlook for the euro zone's two largest economies is uncertain given their broader economic slowdowns and exposure to the impact of global trade disputes."
722,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 14, 2019 05:28AM ET</span>",UK inflation unexpectedly overshoots BoE target in July,"By David Milliken and Andy Bruce
LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's inflation rate unexpectedly overshot the Bank of England's 2% target on Wednesday, raising the cost of living even before sterling's slide has had much chance to feed into consumer prices.
Annual consumer price inflation rose to a three-month high of 2.1% in July from 2.0% in June, the Office for National Statistics said, bucking the average expectation in a Reuters poll of economists for a fall to 1.9%.
The older measure of retail price inflation - which this month will determine increases in many rail fares for 2020 - edged down to 2.8% from 2.9%, in line with forecasts.
Earlier this month the BoE predicted consumer price inflation would fall to a three-year low below 1.6% in the final quarter of this year, reflecting lower oil prices and government caps on household energy bills.
This is despite a sharp fall in the value of sterling, which has gathered pace since Boris Johnson became prime minister last month with the promise to take Britain out of the European Union on Oct. 31, even if that means leaving without a divorce deal.
Sterling weakened by 2.4% against a basket of major currencies in July, and this month the pound sank to its lowest since October 2016 .
Businesses fear a no-deal Brexit will create major disruption at ports, further pushing up the cost of imports.
There was little immediate market reaction to the data, with analysts more focused on the government's Brexit policy.
""Inflation remains near target, but continued depreciation of the pound could push it higher,"" Nancy Curtin, chief investment officer at Close Brothers Asset Management, said.
Inflation surged after sterling fell more than 10% in the wake of June 2016's referendum decision to leave the European Union, peaking at a five-year high of 3.1% in November 2017.
The ONS said it was too soon to be able to identify weaker sterling as the main factor behind July's rise in prices. Instead, higher costs for hotel rooms, video games and consoles, as well as less discounting of clothes in summer sales, increased the annual rate of inflation, it said.
RISING PRICE PRESSURE?
A Citi/YouGov survey of public inflation expectations on Monday showed the most elevated long-run expectations in six years, and the highest number of households unsure about the short-term direction for inflation since June 2016.
The BoE says underlying inflation pressures mean it is still likely to need to raise interest rates over the medium term, assuming Britain avoids major disruption on Oct. 31 and the global economy recovers.
Official data on Tuesday showed wage inflation hit an 11-year high of 3.7% in the second quarter, a pace which would normally prompt the BoE to tighten rates.
And Wednesday's figures showed a measure of core inflation, which excludes relatively the volatile prices of energy, fuel, alcohol and tobacco, rose to a six-month high of 1.9% versus forecasts for it to hold steady at 1.8%. 
However, financial markets price in the BoE's next move as being a cut, given the risk of a no-deal Brexit which they believe would compel the BoE to offer economic stimulus. 
The ONS figures also pointed to inflation pressures in the pipeline from rising costs for manufacturers.
Among manufacturers, the cost of raw materials - many of them imported - was 1.3% higher than in July 2018, beating all economists' forecasts in a Reuters poll and up from a rate of 0.3% in June.
Two thirds of these materials are imported, and increase in cost when sterling weakens, though the ONS said it could not identify a specific effect from a single month's data.
Manufacturers increased the prices they charged by 1.8% last month compared with 1.6% in June, again stronger than forecast.
Wednesday's data also showed that house prices rose by an annual 0.9% across the United Kingdom in June, unchanged from May and the joint-weakest increase since November 2012.

The year-on-year decline in house prices in London - which has been hardest hit by concerns about a disorderly Brexit - leveled off slightly to show a fall of 2.7% after a 3.1% drop in June which was the largest since September 2009.

723,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 14, 2019 04:25AM ET</span>","China's economy worsens in July, industrial growth at 17-year low as trade war escalates","By Kevin Yao and Huizhong Wu
BEIJING (Reuters) - China's economy stumbled more sharply than expected in July, with industrial output growth cooling to a more than 17-year low, as the intensifying U.S. trade war took a heavier toll on businesses and consumers.
Activity in China has continued to cool despite a flurry of growth steps over the past year, raising questions over whether more rapid and forceful stimulus may be needed, even if it risks racking up more debt.
After a flicker of improvement in June, analysts said the latest data was evidence that demand faltered across the board last month, from industrial output and investment to retail sales.
That followed weaker-than-expected bank lending and gloomy factory surveys in recent days, along with the return of producer price deflation, reinforcing expectations more policy support is needed soon. 
""China's economy needs more stimulus because the headwinds are pretty strong and today's data is much weaker than consensus,"" said Larry Hu, head of Greater China economics at Macquarie Group in Hong Kong.
""The economy is going to continue to slow down. At a certain point, policymakers will have to step up stimulus to support infrastructure and property. I think it could happen by the end of this year."" 
Industrial output growth slowed markedly to 4.8% in July from a year earlier, data from the National Bureau of Statistics showed, lower than the most bearish forecast in a Reuters poll and the weakest pace since February 2002.
Analysts had forecast it would slow to 5.8%, from June's 6.3%. Washington had sharply raised some tariffs in May.
Infrastructure investment, which Beijing has been counting on to stabilize the economy, also dropped back, as did property investment, which has been a rare bright spot despite worries of potential housing bubbles.
Crude steel output fell for a second straight month, while production of motor vehicles continued to fall by double digits. Hi-tech manufacturing output rose by a slower 6.6%, and the country's power output edged up just 0.6%.
The industry ministry said last month that China would need ""arduous efforts"" to achieve its 2019 industrial growth target of 5.5% to 6.0%.
INVESTMENT, RETAIL SALES GROWTH COOLS
China's economic growth cooled to a near 30-year low of 6.2% in the second quarter, and business confidence has remained shaky, weighing on investment.
While officials have cautioned it would take time for higher infrastructure spending to kick in, construction growth has been more subdued than expected.
Fixed-asset investment rose 5.7% in January-July from the same period last year, lagging expectations of a 5.8% gain and dipping from the previous reading.
But readings by sector showed a more marked loss of momentum in critical areas at the start of the third quarter. 
Infrastructure investment rose 3.8% in the first seven months from a year earlier, slowing from 4.1% in the first half despite massive local government bond issuance, mainly to fund road and rail projects and other civic works. 
Data from Japanese construction equipment maker  Komatsu Ltd.  (T:6301) showed activity remained weak, with operating hours for its machines in China falling for a fourth straight month. 
In a sign the housing market's resilience may be waning as Beijing cracks down on speculation, property investment slowed to its weakest this year. It rose 8.5% in July on-year, from June's 10.1%. Though home sales inched back to growth, new construction starts cooled.
Retail sales are also pointing to growing consumer caution, most evident in slumping auto sales but also in property-related spending on items such as home appliances and furniture.
Retail sales rose 7.6% in July, well off consensus of 8.6% and weaker than the most pessimistic forecast. Sales had jumped 9.8% in June, which many analysts had predicted would be temporary.
Job security worries may also be a factor. Nationwide survey-based unemployment edged up to 5.3% from 5.1% in June, though market watchers believe it could be much higher.
""We maintain our view that (economic) growth has yet to bottom out and expect Beijing to maintain its easing policy stance,"" economists at Nomura said.
Nomura expects growth will slow to 6.0% in the third and fourth quarters, the bottom end of the government's target range. 
Authorities have already announced hundreds of billions of dollars in infrastructure spending and corporate tax cuts over the last year, and repeatedly cut bank's reserve requirements (RRR) to free up more funds for lending and reduce borrowing costs.
But credit demand has been tepid, with companies in no mood to borrow or invest given the uncertain business outlook and banks wary of rising bad loans. 
Sources told Reuters recently that more aggressive action such as interest rate cuts are a last resort, as it could fuel a rapid build-up in debt and financial risks.
Highlighting those concerns, the Politburo, a top decision-making body of the Communist Party, took the unusual step last month of announcing it would not use the property market as a form of short-term stimulus. 
ESCALATING TRADE WAR
Recent months have been marked by a sudden escalation in the year-long U.S.-China trade war that has raised risks for both economies and sparked fears of a global recession.
A brief ceasefire was shattered earlier this month after U.S President Donald Trump vowed to impose a 10% tariff on more Chinese goods from Sept. 1.
China let its yuan currency slide to an 11-year low days later, prompting the U.S. Treasury Department to label Beijing a currency manipulator.
Some relief came on Tuesday, however, after Trump said he would delay duties on some Chinese imports including cellphones and other consumer goods, in an apparent effort to blunt tariffs' impact on U.S. holiday sales.

Still, new tariffs will go into effect next month on about half of Washington's $300 billion target list of Chinese goods, and analysts say the chance of any durable trade deal after the recent escalations has sharply receded.

724,By Investing.com,"<span>Aug 14, 2019 03:12AM ET</span>",German Economy Contracted in 2Q Under Trade War Pressure,"Investing.com - Germany’s economy shrunk by 0.1% in the three months to June, caught in the cross-fire of the trade war between U.S. and China.
Preliminary figures released on Wednesday by the state statistics office Destatis also showed that the annual rate of growth in Europe's largest economy slowed to zero, the worst performance since 2013, when the euro zone was still struggling with the hangover from its sovereign debt and banking crisis.
Gross domestic product still rose 0.4% on the year when adjusted for the lower number of working days this year.
The numbers were in line with consensus forecasts, and follow months of disappointments from the industrial sector. Even so, the yield on the benchmark 10-year German government bond fell to a new record low of -0.62%, although the euro itself showed little reaction to the data.
""I don’t expect a recession, but to get interest rates back on a sustained rising path, a fiscal stimulus package from the federal government would be necessary, “ said   Deutsche Bank   (DE:DBKGn) strategist Ulrich Stephan in a morning note. Chancellor Angela Merkel had said before the numbers were released that she still doesn't think a stimulus package is needed.
The hardships of the manufacturing sector have slowly started to filter through to other sectors, with service sector activity slowing in both of the last two months and domestic orders to manufacturers also starting to weaken. 
As such, the growth engine that pulled the euro zone through its existential crisis earlier in the decade is now lagging the rest of the currency area. Eurozone GDP expanded by 0.2% in the second quarter, according to figures released by Eurostat.
""I don’t expect a recession, but to get interest rates back on a sustained rising path, a fiscal stimulus package from the federal government would be necessary, “ said Deutsche Bank strategist Ulrich Stephan in a morning note.
""Today’s GDP report definitely marks the end of a golden decade for the German economy,"" ING economist Carsten Brzeski said in a note. ""Trade conflicts, global uncertainty and the struggling automotive sector have finally brought the German economy down on its knee.""
Brzeski argued, however, that it was the uncertainty created by trade conflicts, rather than their direct effects, that was principally to blame. In addition the U.S.-China trade conflict, Germany has also been affected by the U.K.'s endless Brexit drama, which has caused investment to collapse in one of Germany's biggest export markets over the last three years.
The picture looks likely to get worse before it gets better. The ZEW think-tank's forward-looking sentiment index fell to its lowest since December 2011 years this month, with an index reading of -44.1. The Ifo survey, which takes in responses from a broader cross-section of businesses, has also hit a series of multi-year lows this year. A raft of companies such as Daimler, Thyssenkrupp (DE:TKAG) and BASF have issued profit warnings in recent weeks, while the labor market has also started to weaken as firms put increasing numbers of staff on shortened working hours."

Economists surveyed by Reuters had forecast for the index to climb 1.5% year-on-year in July, matching the pace in June.
June's annual inflation rate was the fastest in more than a year, as the effects of tax policy changes introduced last year faded.
Inflation has been mild since an unpopular consumption tax was scrapped in June 2018, while transport costs have fallen amid a government effort to cap domestic fuel prices.
Inflation in July saw increases in 10 of the 12 groups tracked in the index, particularly household furnishings and equipment, food, tobacco, communication and recreational services, data from the Statistics Department showed.

The weak economic performance adds pressure on Chinese leaders to boost stimulus amid the ups and downs in the trade war with the U.S. The U.S. threatened more tariffs on China, only to announce a delay on some of them this week, increasing uncertainty on how the trade war will progress. The People’s Bank of China last week called for a “rational” view on current headwinds. This shows the central bank had until now intended to take a targeted approach to shore up output, while holding back from rolling out big monetary stimulus. ‘July’s activity data was woeful,’’ said Katrina Ell, an economist with Moody’s Analytics in Sydney. “It is a product of softness on both the demand and supply side.

730,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 13, 2019 10:51PM ET</span>","Australia wage growth stays tepid, bolster low for longer rate view","By Swati Pandey
SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australian wages growth stayed stubbornly weak last quarter in a disappointing outcome for household consumption and provided further evidence of ample spare capacity in the country's labor market despite a strong run of jobs lately.
The wage price index rose 0.6% in the three months ended June, ticking up from a benign 0.5% in the March quarter, led largely by increases in the public sector, Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) data showed on Wednesday.
Annual wage growth at 2.3% has remained steady since the quarter-ended September 2018 and way below policymakers desire of ""3 point something"".
The miserly pace of wage growth has weighed on domestic consumption and was a major reason the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) cut interest rates in June and July to a record low of 1%.
The RBA has shown willingness to move again if needed. Senior officials have also publicly discussed the possibility of unconventional monetary policies in Australia, including negative interest rates and quantitative easing.
""The data largely confirms the RBA’s view that spare capacity is limiting upward pressure on wages, and the economy needs to generate more jobs to absorb the extra workers,"" said Sarah Hunter, chief economist at BIX Oxford Economics.
""Given this, we still expect the Board to cut the cash rate again this year, to 0.75%, and possibly one more time in early 2020.""
Financial markets imply the RBA's cash rate at 0.5% by early next year.
With Wednesday's data barely moving the chance of future rate cuts, the Australian dollar was unchanged at $0.6796 but within spitting distance of a recent decade low of $0.66775.
The data showed annual private sector wage growth slowed further to 2.3% from a four-year high of 2.5% in March while government services did the heavy lifting. Annual public sector wage growth was a solid 2.6%.
Electricity, gas, water and waste services and health care and social assistance enjoyed the highest quarterly pay rises of 0.7% while in the information media and telecommunications the wage increase was a piddly 0.1%.
Wage weakness is a global phenomenon linked to everything from the rise of China, the fall of union membership, technological change, job casualization and the increasing concentration of market power in the hands of a few giant corporations.
RBA policymakers are still holding out hope for an eventual recovery in wage power.
Further progress requires the labor market to keep tightening and a survey of business from NAB this week had some potentially troubling news on that front.
The survey's main measure of employment fell sharply to below average levels, implying a slowing in job growth from here.
""We expect the unemployment rate to rise further over the coming months which should keep a lid on wage pressures,"" said Capital Economics economist Marcel Thieliant.
""The upshot is that wage growth may fall back to 2% in 2020."""
731,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 13, 2019 10:41PM ET</span>","China's July steel output eases on environmental curbs, shrinking margins","BEIJING (Reuters) - China's monthly crude steel output fell for a second straight month in July, official data showed on Wednesday, as steel mills trimmed output amid heightened environmental measures and record raw material prices.
The world's top steelmaker produced 85.22 million tonnes of crude steel last month, data from the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) showed, down from 87.53 million tonnes in June but still well above 81.24 million tonnes a year earlier.
Average daily output of the industrial metal was 2.75 million tonnes, down about 6% from 2.92 million tonnes in June, according to Reuters calculations.
The decline came as local governments in northern China, including the top steelmaking province Hebei, stepped up production restrictions to improve air quality.
Hebei is set to impose tougher emission requirements on industrial firms after warning three cities for their failures in controlling air pollution over the first half of this year.
At the same time, the price of iron ore, a key steelmaking raw ingredient, surged to a peak of $126.5 a tonne in early July, data tracked by SteelHome showed, squeezing profit margins at steel mills. [SH-CCN-IRNOR62]
Weekly utilization rates at steel mills across the country fell to around 66.44% in July from 70.41% a month earlier, data compiled by Mysteel consultancy showed. However, an easing of production restrictions at some cities, such as Handan, led utilization rates to rise to 69.48% in the week to Aug. 8.
Steel stocks held by Chinese traders have been increasing for nine straight weeks since early June, indicating weak demand over summer as construction activities slow down due to hot weather and frequents rains.
In the first seven months, China churned out 577.06 million tonnes of steel, up 9% from the same period last year, the NBS data showed."

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australian consumer confidence rebounded from a two-year low in August as people became more upbeat on the economy and the housing market, according to one measure, offering a scrap of hope for the hard-pressed retail sector.
Wednesday's survey showed the Melbourne Institute and Westpac Bank (AX:WBC) index of consumer sentiment rose 3.6% in August, reversing a surprise 4.1% drop in July.
The index was down 3.5% from a year earlier, and at 100.00 indicated there were now as many optimists as pessimists.
The survey of 1,200 people will be a relief for the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA), which cut interest rates in both June and July in part to support consumer demand.
""Indeed, part of the gain is consistent with firming expectations for additional interest rate cuts,"" said Westpac chief economist Bill Evans. ""The media and economic forecasters now expect a further lowering in the official cash rate in coming months.""
The survey's index of economic conditions for the next 12 months jumped 9.6%, while expectations for the next 5 years rose 4.5%.
Respondents were less upbeat on their own circumstances. A measure of the state of family finances compared with a year ago edged up 0.9%, while the outlook for the next 12 months rose 0.7%.
In a promising sign for retail sales, a measure of whether it was a good time to buy a major household item climbed 2.8%, the highest in over a year.
The ""time to buy a dwelling"" index also firmed 3.0% to its highest since early 2014, with Sydney and Melbourne leading the recovery after two years of weakness.
House prices in the two cities have stabilized in the last couple of months with demand at auctions improving markedly.
The survey's index of expectations for house prices gained 5.1% in August, to be up 40% since May."

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. consumer prices increased broadly in July, but the signs of an acceleration in inflation will likely do little to change market expectations that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates again next month amid worsening trade tensions.
The report from the Labor Department on Tuesday, however, lowered the chances that the U.S. central bank would cut rates by half a percentage point at its Sept. 17-18 policy meeting.Financial markets have fully priced in a 25-basis-point reduction following a recent escalation in the bruising trade war between the United States and China, which sparked a stock market sell-off and caused an inversion of the U.S. Treasury yield curve, heightening the risk of a recession.
President Donald Trump announced last month an additional 10% tariff on $300 billion worth of Chinese imports starting Sept. 1. China let its currency, the yuan, slide past the key 7-per-dollar level to its lowest point since the 2008 global financial crisis before trying to stem the decline.
On Tuesday, the Trump administration delayed the imposition of the additional tariff on certain Chinese imports, including technology products and clothing, until mid-December.
Economists said the move still left a cloud over the U.S. economy. Fears about the impact of the trade fight on the economic expansion, the longest in history, prompted the Fed to cut its short-term lending rate by 25 basis points last month for the first time since 2008. 
""The recent pickup in inflation won't deter the Federal Reserve from cutting interest rates in September as the downside risks to the outlook from trade have become more threatening,"" said Ryan Sweet, a senior economist at Moody's Analytics in West Chester, Pennsylvania. 
The consumer price index increased 0.3% last month, lifted by gains in the cost of energy products and a range of other goods, the government said. The CPI had edged up 0.1% for two straight months. In the 12 months through July, the CPI increased 1.8% after advancing 1.6% in June.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the CPI would accelerate 0.3% in July and rise 1.7% on a year-on-year basis.
Excluding the volatile food and energy components, the CPI gained 0.3% after rising by the same margin in June. It was the first time since early 2001 that the so-called core CPI increased 0.3% for two consecutive months.
The core CPI was boosted by increases in prices for apparel, airline tickets, healthcare and household furnishings. In the 12 months through July, the core CPI climbed 2.2%, the biggest gain in six months, after rising 2.1% in June. 
The three-month core inflation rate jumped 2.8%, the most in eight years, supporting the view that weak inflation readings earlier in the year were caused by transitory factors.
The Fed, which has a 2% inflation target, tracks the core personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index for monetary policy. The core PCE price index rose 1.6 percent on a year-on-year basis in June and has undershot its target this year.
""Weak transitory components that were weighing on inflation are rebounding as expected,"" Veronica Clark, an economist at  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) in New York. 
Stocks on Wall Street rallied on the U.S. pullback from a hardline trade stance toward China. The dollar (DXY) strengthened against a basket of currencies, also boosted by the inflation data. U.S. Treasury prices fell. 
BROAD INCREASES
Inflation has remained moderate despite the White House's tariffs on Chinese imports as the duties have been largely on capital goods. Economists expect the new tariffs, which would affect mostly consumer goods, will boost inflation, regardless of the delays of duties on laptops, cell phones, video game consoles, certain toys, computer monitors, and certain footwear and clothing items.
Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) estimates that tariffs have boosted year-on-year core PCE inflation by 10-15 basis points so far and that the new duties will add another 20 basis points. 
""There were some hints in the report that the May round of tariffs may have had some flow-through to today's number,"" said Michael Feroli, an economist at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) in New York. ""Core goods prices were up a firm 0.25%, with large increases in import-dependent categories like information technology commodities and household furnishings and supplies.""
In July, gasoline prices rebounded 2.5% after dropping 3.6% in June. Electricity rose 0.6%. Food prices were unchanged for a second straight month. Food consumed at home slipped 0.1%.
Owners' equivalent rent of primary residence, which is what a homeowner would pay to rent or receive from renting a home, rose 0.2% in July, the smallest gain since December 2018. Rents had risen by 0.3% for six straight months.
Healthcare costs jumped 0.5%, the most since August 2016, after advancing 0.3% in June. There were increases in prices for hospital services, doctor visits and prescription medication.
Apparel prices rose 0.4% after surging 1.1% in June. Used motor vehicle and truck prices increased 0.9% in July after rebounding 1.6% in the prior month.
Prices for new motor vehicles fell 0.2%. The cost of household furnishings and operations increased 0.4%, rising for a third straight month, reflecting the import duties.
Airline tickets rebounded 2.3%, the largest advance in a year. There were also increases in the costs of motor vehicle insurance, personal care products, tobacco and alcohol.

BERLIN (Reuters) - The mood among German investors plummeted in August to its most pessimistic since the peak of the euro zone debt crisis, a leading survey showed on Tuesday, heightening concerns that Europe's biggest economy is heading for recession.
The sharp drop in the monthly ZEW survey, blamed on trade conflict and uncertainty over Brexit, sent German blue-chip shares (GDAXI) to an intraday low as it prompted investors to switch into safer assets like government bonds. [nL8N2592CN]
Economic sentiment among investors fell to -44.1 from -24.5 in July, its lowest since Dec. 2011 and way short of expectations for a dip to -28.5.
""The ZEW survey gives a further clear warning signal of recession for the German economy,"" said Uwe Burkert, chief economist at LBBW Research. 
Traditionally driven by strong sales of its products abroad, Germany's economy has this year increasingly relied on domestic demand to spur growth as exports, led by manufactured goods, have been hit by a broad-based downturn and tariff disputes that have acted as a brake on global trade.
Data on Wednesday is expected to show German gross domestic product shrank marginally quarter on quarter between April and June, and economists are scaling back their already modest forecasts for the third quarter.
ZEW President Achim Wambach said the survey pointed to a significant deterioration in the economic outlook, and its gauge measuring investors' assessment of current conditions fell to -13.5 from -1.1 in July. Analysts had predicted -7.0.
""The most recent escalation in the trade dispute between the U.S. and China, the risk of competitive devaluations and the increased likelihood of a no-deal Brexit place additional pressure on the already weak economic growth,"" Wambach said in a statement. 
""This will most likely put a further strain on the development of German exports and industrial production.""
While domestic developments have cushioned the economic blow thanks to record-high employment, inflation-busting wage rises and low borrowing costs, the heightened tensions between Washington and Beijing have raised fears in financial markets that the trade row will not end anytime soon.
Data on Friday showed that momentum in German exports slowed in the first half of the year and reversed in June, and figures earlier last week revealed a 1.5% fall in industrial output in May.

A Reuters poll of analysts predicts figures released on Wednesday will show a 0.1% second quarter economic contraction. The government expects the economy to grow just 0.5% this year.

Average weekly earnings rose by an annual 3.7% in the three months to June - the highest rate since June 2008 and up from 3.5% in May. Excluding volatile bonuses, annual pay growth reached 3.9% - also an 11-year high and beating economists' average forecast in a Reuters poll.
The jobs market has been a silver lining for the economy since the Brexit vote in June 2016, something many economists have attributed to employers preferring to hire workers they can later lay off rather than making longer-term commitments to investment.
Britain created a net 115,000 jobs in the second quarter, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said, almost twice the gain forecast and taking the level of employment to a record 32.811 million.
""The jobs market remains a source of strength for the UK economy, though it may now be reaching its peak,"" said Tej Parikh, chief economist at the Institute of Directors.
Sterling showed little reaction to the data, which tend to lag broader trends in economic growth and also appeared healthy more than a decade ago when Britain was beginning to slide into recession during the financial crisis.
Finance minister Sajid Javid said the data showed the fundamental strength of Britain's economy before it is due to leave the European Union on Oct. 31, with or without a deal to smooth the transition.
But some details in the labor market data pointed to tougher times ahead, after data last week showed the economy unexpectedly shrank by 0.2% in the three months to June, the first decline since 2012.
Part-time jobs and workers aged over 50 accounted for the entirety of the net increase in employment during the second quarter, while the jobless rate rose to 3.9%, against expectations for it to hold steady at 3.8%.
Older workers have driven the vast majority of jobs growth in recent years, reflecting in part the rising age at which people can claim state pensions.
PRODUCTIVITY STILL POOR
Output per hour, the headline measure of productivity, fell 0.6% in annual terms - the fourth quarter of decline in a row and the longest such run since mid-2013.
Poor productivity is one of Britain's biggest economic challenges and, until recently, had contributed to a decade of weak pay growth.
""If the UK leaves the EU without a deal on Oct. 31, business investment is likely to suffer, with worrying implications for productivity,"" said Howard Archer, chief economic adviser to the EY ITEM Club consultancy.
The number of job vacancies, an indicator of the potential for future employment growth, inched down to 820,000 in the three months to July from 824,000 in the period to June, the lowest level in more than a year.
Recent private-sector surveys of companies have also suggested employers are turning more cautious about hiring as the risk of a disruptive no-deal Brexit rises.

The Bank of England said this month it saw signs of a softening in labor market indicators.

737,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 13, 2019 05:54AM ET</span>",Germany Is Flirting With Recession After Investor Confidence Falls,"(Bloomberg) -- Investor confidence in Germany’s economic outlook worsened for a fourth month in July after a string of disappointing figures raised recession risks.
The ZEW index measuring expectations for the next six months plunged to minus 44.1, the lowest level since 2011. A gauge measuring current conditions also declined.
Europe’s largest economy probably contracted in the second quarter as slower global growth and uncertainty from a U.S.-China trade war weighed on demand. Since then, business expectations have slipped further to the lowest level in a decade, and surveys point to a deepening slump in manufacturing.
“The most recent escalation in the trade dispute between the U.S. and China, the risk of competitive devaluations, and the increased likelihood of a no-deal Brexit place additional pressure on the already weak economic growth,” ZEW President Achim Wambach said in a statement. “This will most likely put a further strain on the development of German exports and industrial production.”
What Bloomberg’s Economists Say
“Today’s below-consensus ZEW expectations figures, which have a lead on actual GDP, suggest a material further deterioration in growth momentum may be coming later this year.”

Major companies including Continental, Lufthansa and Daimler have all slashed their outlooks in a warning that momentum might slip further. Deteriorating growth prospects -- Germany is forecast to expand a mere 0.6% this year -- have fueled calls for more fiscal stimulus.
So far the government has been reluctant though. Chancellor Angela Merkel “has never left any room for doubt” that she stands by the goal of a balanced budget, her chief spokesman, Steffen Seibert, said on Monday, when asked whether the administration was considering issuing new debt to fund environmental projects.
At the European Central Bank, policy makers have indicated they’re prepared to provide more monetary support to prop up the euro-area economy. Interest-rate cuts and asset purchases could be announced as soon as September."

National Australia Bank's (AX:NAB) index of business conditions fell 2 points to +2 in July, reversing a rise in June. The survey's measure of business confidence edged up to +4, but still remained below the long-run average.
""The decline in business conditions since early 2018 has been broad-based and has continued to track at below average levels in recent months,"" said NAB group chief economist Alan Oster.
""This is concerning, because while conditions remain positive, it points to a significant loss in momentum in the business sector.""
The economy expanded at its slowest pace in a decade in the first quarter of the year as consumers kept a tight rein on spending amid sluggish wages and falling home prices.
The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) responded by cutting interest rates by a quarter point in both June and July, taking them to a record low of 1%.
""The survey points to the need to for further stimulus in the economy,"" said Oster.
""Indeed, we expect a further easing in interest rates from the RBA and think that some greater fiscal support will be needed from the government to kickstart growth."""

While Ireland is considered the EU country with most to lose from Brexit, its economy is in very strong shape ahead of the potential disruption after growing faster than any other in the bloc every year since 2014 amid record employment.
However, confidence has been far more muted since Britain's 2016 referendum to leave and the KBC Bank consumer sentiment index sank to 85.5 in July from 90.9 in June.
That was its lowest level since November 2014 when Ireland had just emerged from an international bailout.
It was in contrast to an unexpected rise in confidence in Britain last month as Johnson took over, even as subsequent data showed the British economy shrank unexpectedly for the first time since 2012 in the second quarter.
Irish gross domestic product grew 2.4% in the first quarter of 2019, data showed last month.
""While the July confidence reading for the UK hints at a 'Boris bounce', it appears Irish consumer sentiment suffered a 'Boris bump',"" KBC Bank Ireland chief economist Austin Hughes said on Tuesday.
""Our sense is that the combination of a tougher line and no specific solutions espoused by Boris Johnson in the race to become Prime Minister was the key driver of the drop in Irish consumer sentiment in July.""
Hughes has previously noted that Irish consumers appear far more sensitive to the emerging downside risks around Brexit than their British counterparts, in part, he said, because Brexit is not of Irish consumers' making while some pro-Brexit UK consumers may feel any adverse economic effects are worth it.
The consequence for the currently open border between EU-member Ireland and British-run Northern Ireland in a no-deal Brexit ""do not resonate to anything like the same degree (in Britain) that they do in Ireland,"" he added.
Irish consumers are also scarred by the painful experience of the financial crisis a decade ago, when Ireland's three-year bailout brought sharp tax rises and spending cuts.
However, Hughes said the strong performance in the economy suggests consumer spending should continue to increase even if Brexit-related nervousness is likely to significantly restrain the scale of that increase."
741,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 12, 2019 02:08PM ET</span>","U.S. budget deficit widens; spending up on health, military","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. government's deficit widened to $120 billion in July, fueled by increases in spending on health care and the military, according to data released on Monday by the Treasury Department.
The size of the deficit was in line with expectations in a Reuters poll of analysts.
The Treasury Department said federal spending in July was $371 billion, up 23% from the same month in 2018, while receipts were $251 billion, up 12% compared with July 2018.
The fiscal-year-to-date deficit was $867 billion, compared with $684 billion in the comparable year-earlier period.
The U.S. government's fiscal position has deteriorated since 2016, hit by an aging of the population that has led to more people drawing on Medicare, a federal health insurance program for the elderly.
Increased spending on the military has also fueled the deficit under President Donald Trump, who took office in January 2017 promising to strengthen the military.
Earlier this month, the U.S. Congress passed a two-year budget deal backed by Trump that would increase federal spending on defense and other domestic programs, which could significantly add to the government's growing debt.
In July, Washington spent $53 billion on defense programs, up from $43 billion in the same month of 2018. Spending on Medicare rose to $66 billion from $34 billion, though some of that increase was because of calendar adjustments, a Treasury official said.
When adjusted for calendar effects, the U.S. government's deficit last month was $129 billion compared with an adjusted deficit of $122 billion in July 2018, the Treasury official said.

Even accounting for the calendar adjustments, spending on Medicare rose 11 percent in July compared to the same month a year earlier.

BRASILIA (Reuters) - Economic activity in Brazil fell slightly in the three months to June, a central bank indicator showed on Monday, suggesting Latin America's largest economy may have slipped into recession.
The central bank's IBC-Br economic activity index, a leading indicator of gross domestic product (GDP), fell 0.13% in the second quarter, after a 0.68% drop in the three months to March.
A recession is typically defined as two consecutive quarters of negative economic growth. If the IBC-Br index is backed up by official GDP data this month, Brazil will have fallen into recession for the first time since a punishing 2015-16 downturn.
Brazil's economy has been blighted this year by high unemployment, weak industrial production, economic troubles in neighboring Argentina and a darkening outlook for global growth.
Brazil's GDP shrank by 0.2% in the first quarter and is only expected to expand by 0.8% this year, according to central bank, government, International Monetary Fund and consensus market forecasts. Second quarter figures will be released on Aug. 29.
""For now we keep our full 2019 estimate at 0.5%, with a slight upward bias,"" said Mauricio Oreng, senior strategist at Rabobank in Sao Paulo. ""We are looking for a slight pickup in the second half of the year ... but what we can say for sure is that the economy remains anemic and sluggish.""
Brazil's currency, the real (BRBY) fell nearly 1.5% in early Monday trading and the Bovespa stock index (BVSP) opened lower.
The central bank cut its benchmark interest rate by 50 basis points to a record low of 6.00% at the end of July. A weekly central bank survey of financial institutions on Monday showed that economists expect that to be slashed to 5.00% by the end of this year.
The central bank's IBC-Br economic activity index actually rose 0.30% in June from May, more than the 0.10% expected in a Reuters poll of economists but not enough to prevent the quarterly decline.
It was the first time this year that the index has risen two months in a row, suggesting the worst might be over. The central bank had estimated in the minutes of its last policy meeting that economic growth was most likely flat or slightly positive in the second quarter.

743,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 12, 2019 07:40AM ET</span>","China's July new loans dip more than expected, further policy easing seen","By Judy Hua and Kevin Yao
BEIJING (Reuters) - China's banks extended surprisingly fewer new yuan loans in July, while growth of money supply and total social financing also slowed, raising pressure on the central bank to ease policy further to support the slowing economy.
The drop in new loans was likely exacerbated by seasonal factors.
Chinese regulators have been trying to boost bank lending and lower financing costs for over a year, especially for smaller and private companies which generate a sizeable share of the country's economic growth and jobs.
But some analysts say credit demand has not picked up as much as expected, possibly due to weak domestic orders and the deepening U.S.-China trade war, reinforcing views that more growth boosting measures will be needed to spur investment and stabilize activity.
""Total social financing and bank loans are significantly lower than expected, dragged by off-balance sheet businesses and short-term corporate loans,"" said Li Qilin, an economist at Lianxun Securities.
Chinese banks extended 1.06 trillion yuan ($150.06 billion) in new yuan loans in July, down from June and falling short of analysts' expectations, according to data released by the People's Bank of China on Monday.
Analysts polled by Reuters had predicted new yuan loans would fall to 1.25 trillion yuan in July, from 1.66 trillion yuan in the previous month.
Chinese banks usually make fewer loans in July after ramping up lending in June, but the data was lower than the tally in July 2018, when banks doled out 1.45 trillion yuan in new loans.
Household loans, mostly mortgages, fell to 511.2 billion yuan in July from 671.7 billion yuan in June, while corporate loans tumbled to 297.4 billion yuan from 910.5 billion yuan.
Broad M2 money supply in July grew 8.1% from a year earlier, central bank data showed, below estimates of 8.4% seen in the Reuters poll. It rose 8.5% in June.
Outstanding yuan loan grew 12.6% from a year earlier. Analysts had expected 12.8% growth, slower than June's 13.0%.
Some analysts say the annual comparison is a better way to assess trends in China's credit growth, rather than more volatile monthly readings.
MORE POLICY EASING EXPECTED
Growth of outstanding total social financing (TSF), a broad measure of credit and liquidity in the economy, slowed to 10.7% in July from a year earlier and from 10.9% in June.
TSF includes off-balance sheet forms of financing that exist outside the conventional bank lending system, such as initial public offerings, loans from trust companies and bond sales.
In July, TSF fell to 1.01 trillion yuan from 2.26 trillion yuan in June. Analysts polled by Reuters had expected 1.5 trillion yuan.
To free up more funds for lending and accommodate local government project financing, most analysts still expect the central bank will cut banks' reserve requirement ratios (RRR) further in coming months, on top of six reductions since early 2018.
The central bank has pledged to improve its policy transmission mechanism to support small and private firms.
""The People's Bank (of China) will need to push down interest rates more aggressively if it is to generate the kind of pick-up in lending that successfully put a floor beneath growth during previous loosening cycles,"" Julian Evans-Pritchard, senior China economist at Capital Economics, said in a report.
The weighted average lending rate for companies and home buyers fell 3 basis points in the second quarter to 5.66%, after a rise of 5 basis points in the first quarter, the central bank said in a policy report on Friday.
Sources told Reuters recently that more aggressive action such as interest rate cuts are a last resort, as it could fuel a sharper build-up in debt.
Highlighting debt concerns, the Politburo, a top decision-making body of the Communist Party, took the unusual step last month of announcing it would not use the property market as a form of short-term stimulus. And regulators said last week they had launched nationwide bank inspections to determine if loans have been used illegally to fund property investment.
TRADE WAR
But analysts say continued policy support is needed, especially after a month-long trade truce with the United States was shattered earlier this month, when President Donald Trump vowed to impose a 10% tariff on $300 billion of Chinese imports from Sept. 1. The move would extend levies to effectively all of the goods China exports to the United States.
Despite prodding from Beijing, several bankers have told Reuters they have little appetite to lend to smaller companies due to the uncertain economic outlook, the trade war and a years-long drive to purge risks from the financial system. Some firms also say banks are sharply reducing credit lines.
China' economic growth slowed to a near 30-year low of 6.2% in the second quarter. Many analysts had expected a steadying in the second half as earlier stimulus measures started to kick in, but Trump's latest tariff threat is likely to weigh further on exporters and their domestic supply chains."

Germany's Ifo economic institute said its quarterly survey among nearly 1,200 experts in more than 110 countries showed that its measures for current conditions and economic expectations have both worsened in the third quarter.
""The experts expect significantly weaker growth in world trade,"" Ifo President Clemens Fuest said, adding that trade expectations hit the lowest since the beginning of the tariff conflict last year.
""Respondents also expect weaker private consumption, lower investment activity, and declining short- and long-term interest rates,"" Fuest said.
U.S. President Donald Trump said on Friday he was not ready to make a trade deal with China and even called a September round of talks into question, raising fresh doubts in financial markets that the dispute is unlikely to end anytime soon.
The United States and China are important export destinations for German manufacturers, so the tit-for-tat tariff dispute between the world's two largest economies is having a large impact on German goods producers.
The German economy, Europe's largest, is widely expected to have contracted in the second quarter, and sentiment indicators suggest hardly any improvement in the third.
""We're in the twilight zone of a marked economic slowdown and a recession,"" said Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) economist Joerg Kraemer.

Germany's Federal Statistics Office will release preliminary gross domestic product figures for the April-June period on Wednesday. A Reuters Poll of analyst predicts a 0.1% contraction quarter-on-quarter.

The survey from researcher Springboard found the national town center vacancy rate was 10.3% in July, up from 10.2% in the previous quarter and the highest since January 2015.
Shopper footfall also fell by 1.9%, the worst decline for July since 2012. It was down 2.7% on UK high streets and down 3.1% at shopping centers but up 1.2% at retail parks.
""The ongoing challenges faced by bricks and mortar destinations is reflected in the rising vacancy rate, which has increased in every quarter since January 2018,"" said Diane Wehrle, Springboard's marketing and insights director.
Helen Dickinson, chief executive of lobby group, the British Retail Consortium (BRC), reiterated her call for help from the government, including a freeze on business rates.
""If the government wishes to avoid seeing more empty shops in our town centers then they must act to relieve some of the pressure bearing down on the high street,"" she said.
She noted that the retail sector accounts for 5% of the economy, yet pays 10% of all business costs and 25% of all business taxes.
Another survey from the BRC published earlier this month showed British retailers reported the weakest July sales growth since records began.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. producer prices increased moderately in July, lifted by a rebound in the cost of energy products, while underlying producer inflation retreated, which could allow the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates again next month.
The benign inflation report from the Labor Department on Friday could boost expectations for a half-percentage-point cut at the Fed's Sept. 17-18 policy meeting. President Donald Trump on Friday urged the U.S. central bank to lower rates by a full percentage point, saying there was ""no inflation in our country.""
Financial markets have fully priced in a 25-basis-point rate cut following a recent escalation in the bitter trade war between the United States and China, which led to an inversion of the U.S. Treasury yield curve and raised the risk of a recession. Fears about the trade war's impact on the economic expansion, the longest on record, prompted the Fed to lower its short-term rate last week for the first time since 2008.
""Weak producer prices are a reflection of a dramatic slowdown in manufacturing due to the global trade war,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG in New York. ""We expect a second rate cut by the Federal Reserve in September as the manufacturing sector and world economies continue to slow.""
The producer price index for final demand rose 0.2% last month after nudging up 0.1% in June, the government said. In the 12 months through July the PPI increased 1.7% after advancing by the same margin in June. Last month's increase in the PPI was in line with economists' expectations.
Excluding the volatile food, energy and trade services components, producer prices edged down 0.1% last month. That was the first decline since October 2015 and followed an unchanged reading in June. The so-called core PPI increased 1.7% in the 12 months through July, the smallest gain since January 2017, after rising 2.1% in June.
The Fed, which has a 2% inflation target, tracks the core personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index for monetary policy. The core PCE price index increased 1.6% on a year-on-year basis in June and has undershot its target this year.
Data next week is likely to show moderate gains in consumer prices in July, according to a Reuters survey of economists.
The dollar (DXY) slipped against a basket of currencies, while U.S. Treasury prices rose slightly. U.S. stocks fell as investors grappled with fresh trade-related tensions.
WEAK SERVICES COSTS
U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods so far have had a marginal impact on inflation as they have mostly been on capital goods.
That could change after Trump announced last week an additional 10% tariff on $300 billion worth of Chinese imports starting Sept. 1. The new tariffs would affect mostly consumer goods. Trump said on Friday talks continued between the two countries, but added, ""I am not ready to make a deal.""
""The next round of tariffs on Chinese imports could have a more notable impact on finished goods prices, given that they will cover a much greater share of finished consumer goods with few alternatives,"" said Andrew Hunter, a senior U.S. economist at Capital Economics in London. ""But it all depends on how aggressively the Chinese allow their currency to depreciate.""
China let its currency, the yuan, slide past the key 7-per-dollar level on Monday for the first time since 2008.
In July, U.S. wholesale energy prices rebounded 2.3% after falling 3.1% in the prior month. They were boosted by a 5.2% percent jump in gasoline prices. Goods prices increased 0.4% last month, reversing June's 0.4% decline.
Energy prices accounted for more than 80% of the rebound in the cost of goods last month. Wholesale food prices rose 0.2% in July after advancing 0.6% in June. Core goods prices edged up 0.1% after being unchanged for three straight months.
The cost of services fell 0.1% in July, the first decrease since January, after rising 0.4% in June. Services were pulled down by a 4.3% drop in the cost of hotel and motel rooms.
The cost of healthcare services edged up 0.1% last month after rising 0.2% in June. The cost of doctor visits dropped 0.5% last month, the most since January 2016, after being unchanged in June. Hospital outpatient care prices surged 0.7%, the largest increase since January 2018. But the cost of hospital inpatient care fell 0.2%.
Portfolio management fees rebounded 0.8% after falling 1.8% in June. Those fees and healthcare costs feed into the core PCE price index, leading economists to expect not much of a change in the inflation measure in July.
""The PPI signals that the medical care PCE price index will be soft in July, likely coming out basically unchanged relative to June,"" said Daniel Silver, an economist at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) in New York."

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's economy shrank for the first time since 2012 in the second quarter, a severe hangover from a pre-Brexit stockpiling boost and one that bodes poorly as Prime Minister Boris Johnson gears up to leave the EU in October.
Sterling slid to a new 31-month low against the dollar after data showed output in the world's fifth-largest economy fell by 0.2% in the three months to June compared with the previous quarter, below all forecasts in a Reuters poll of economists that had pointed to a flat reading.
With Johnson's government committed to leaving the European Union on Oct. 31, regardless of whether he can secure a transition deal to avoid trade disruption, the outlook for the remainder of 2019 is uncertain.
The world economy has also slowed due to the trade conflict between the United States and China.
Year-on-year economic growth slid to 1.2% from 1.8% in the first quarter, Britain's Office for National Statistics said, its weakest since the start of 2018.
""There is ... little doubt that the economy is stalling, regardless of the volatility in the data,"" PwC senior economist Mike Jakeman said.
(GRAPHIC - British economic output declines for 1st time since 2012: https://tmsnrt.rs/2YzMP00) 
He said the Brexit crisis and the uncertain global outlook left Britain's economy on a ""knife-edge"" for the third quarter.
Finance minister Sajid Javid told the BBC he was not expecting a recession ""at all"". He added that the figures - which none of the 51 economists polled by Reuters predicted - ""were not a surprise in any way"".
Annual growth in June alone was the weakest since August 2013 at 1.0%.
DOVISH DATA
The Bank of England last week predicted that growth will pick up to a quarterly rate of 0.3% during the current quarter, and that growth for the year as a whole will drop to 1.3%.
But it also warned of a 1-in-3 chance that output in annual terms will contract in the coming quarters, even if Britain leaves the European Union on reasonable terms.
""The Bank of England has retained its tightening bias but any continued economic weakness will mean policymakers are likely to take an increasingly dovish stance,"" Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit, said.
Previous data had shown a collapse in factory output in April as car manufacturers brought forward their annual summer shutdowns to follow the original March 29 Brexit deadline that was postponed to Oct. 31.
But June manufacturing data was also unexpectedly poor and factory output for the quarter contracted at the fastest rate since early 2009, when Britain was mired in recession.
Private-sector business surveys have shown the manufacturing and construction sectors both suffered falling activity in July, while the larger services sector eked out only modest growth.
Nonetheless, most economists expect some improvement in the third quarter - which would avoid Britain meeting the technical definition of a recession, which is two consecutive quarters of negative growth.
""Consumers have cash in their pockets - wage growth is at an 11-year high (and) surveys point to further increases in employment,"" Pantheon Macroeconomics's Samuel Tombs said. 
""In addition, growth in government spending should retain its current momentum, given the new government's zeal for fiscal loosening,"" he added.
Javid said late on Thursday that he would set out spending plans for next year in September.
Britain's economy has slowed since June 2016's vote to leave the EU, with annual growth rates dropping from more than 2% before the referendum to expand by 1.4% last year. 
Friday's data showed business investment contracted 0.5% in the second quarter of the year versus economists' expectations of a 0.3% fall.
Household spending, which has been much more resilient than business investment, due to falling unemployment and rising wages, rose 0.5% on the quarter.

Trade figures and its contribution to GDP were distorted erratic flows of non-monetary gold and also showed the effect of businesses building up fewer stocks than in the first quarter of the year when they were readying for Brexit.

Statistics Canada said the unemployment rate edged up to 5.7% from 5.5% in June as more people looked for work after hitting record lows earlier this year. Analysts in a Reuters poll had predicted a gain of 12,500 jobs and an unemployment rate of 5.5%. 
""Clearly it's on the disappointing side of expectations,"" said BMO Chief Economist Doug Porter. ""Of course, you can never read too much into any one month but this is the third setback in employment in the past five months."" 
The Canadian dollar weakened to $1.3268, or 75.37 cents U.S., following the decline in jobs. 
July saw the loss of 11,600 full-time jobs and 12,600 part-time positions. Employment declined for youth aged 15 to 24 and for women in the core working ages of 25 to 54 but increased for core working age men. 
Wages for permanent employees - a figure watched closely by the Bank of Canada - rose by 4.5% year-over-year, the largest gain seen since January 2009.
""At the moment it looks like the Canadian labor market has reached a limit where the unemployment limit can't break that 5.5% - 5.4% level without wages going up,"" said Simon Harvey, a FX market analyst for Monex Europe and Canada.
The number of private-sector employees, Statscan said, dropped by 69,000 in July - driven largely by declines in the wholesale and retail trade sector, which shed 20,600 jobs. Self-employment was up by 28,000 positions while the number of public-sector employees was little changed.
Canada's construction sector saw the biggest employment boost in July, adding 25,000 jobs. Gains were also seen in the public administration industry, which posted an increase of 9,200 positions. 
Canada's central bank has remained firmly on the sidelines since October and is not expected to move for the remainder of the year - despite a recent rate cut by the U.S. Federal Reserve.
""The Bank of Canada needs to tread carefully,"" Derek Holt, vice president of capital markets economics at Scotiabank, cautioned on Friday, noting Canada's domestic data could start ""to weaken in the third quarter.""
""I do think at the margin this lands pretty heavily on the side of suggesting the bank will consider trimming interest rates at some point,"" BMO's Porter told Reuters. 
""Of course, we have to wait and see what actually happens on the trade front in the next few weeks, but this certainly is supportive of the doves' view,"" he said.
In a separate release, Statscan said the value of Canadian building permits declined by an unexpected 3.7% in June to C$8.01 billion ($6.06 billion) as multifamily and institutional permit values dropped.

751,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 09, 2019 09:07AM ET</span>",Core U.S. Producer-Price Index Posts First Drop in Two Years,"(Bloomberg) -- A measure of underlying U.S. producer prices unexpectedly fell in July, with the first drop since early 2017 adding to signs of muted inflation that may reinforce the case for further Federal Reserve easing.
Excluding food and energy, producer prices dropped 0.1% from the prior month, compared with projections for a 0.1% gain, a Labor Department report showed Friday. The 2.1% annual increase was the slowest in two years. The overall producer-price index rose 0.2% from June, matching projections.
Key Insights
The report, which measures wholesale and other business selling prices, showed costs declined for guestroom rentals, loan services, physician care and truck transportation of freight. The strong dollar may also be a factor, and the data suggest businesses have had difficulty raising prices despite increasing tariffs and labor costs.China said earlier Friday that its own producer-price index fell 0.3% from a year earlier, the first drop in almost three years, a sign of muted inflation for factories globally.The U.S.-China trade war intensified in the first week of August, likely weighing on global growth in the months to come, with tariffs set to rise on a host of consumer goods from China.President Donald Trump has repeatedly cited low inflation and the strong dollar in his attacks on the Fed to cut interest rates more deeply. While Fed Chairman Jerome Powell signaled that last week’s quarter-point interest-rate cut marked the start of only a short round of easing, investors are betting the central bank will reduce borrowing costs several more times this year.Get More

Producer prices excluding food, energy, and trade services -- a measure preferred by some economists because it strips out the most volatile components -- also fell 0.1% from the prior month, the first drop since 2015. It rose 1.7% from a year earlier after climbing 2.1%.
The cost of goods rose 0.4% after falling 0.4% the previous month. Services prices decreased 0.1% after a 0.4% gain in June.
Energy prices jumped 2.3% from the prior month, boosting the overall gauge, and food costs rose 0.2%.
Data on consumer prices for July, due Tuesday, will give a better sense of U.S. inflation.

752,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 09, 2019 05:33AM ET</span>",Export malaise hits Germany as EU economic heavyweights struggle,"By Michael Nienaber
BERLIN (Reuters) - Momentum in German exports slowed in the first half of 2019 and abruptly reversed in June, data showed on Friday, adding to signs of broad-based weakness in an economy increasingly relying on domestic demand to eke out even meager growth.
A global growth slowdown accompanied by tariff disputes and uncertainty over Brexit has impacted growth across western Europe, but Germany's traditionally export-reliant economy - the continent's largest - has been particularly vulnerable.
Those headwinds have been offset by stimulus at home, where record-high employment, inflation-busting wage hikes and low borrowing costs have driven a consumer and construction boom.
However, that may not prevent German GDP - for which preliminary data is due on Wednesday - from joining the continent's second largest economy Britain in having contracted in the three months to June.
Reflecting the foreign/domestic split, Germany's trade surplus narrowed to 109.9 billion euros from 122.4 billion in the half year to June as imports rose 3.0% and export growth slowed to 0.5% from the previous six months, Federal Statistics Office data showed on Friday.
In June, exports fell 0.1% from May while year on year they plunged 8% to mark their steepest rate of annual decline in nearly three years - and the DIHK business association said it expected exports to nearly stagnate in 2019 as a whole.
""Rising protectionism and a noticeably weakening global economy are burdening Germany's export-reliant economy,"" DIHK economist Volker Treier said.
""The U.S. trade dispute with China and the tenacious struggle for Brexit are unsettling investors worldwide and clouding the prospects for German producers of capital goods in particular.""
TRIPLE WHAMMY
June also marked a potential watershed for industrial output in both Germany and in Europe's third largest economy, France.
German output fell 1.5% from May, data showed on Wednesday, while corresponding figures from France on Friday showed a drop of 2.3%. Both readings were weaker than expected .
Both countries' export sectors - including their high-profile car industries - have been hit by flagging demand from China, the world's number two economy, as its trade dispute with the United States has deepened.
""We no longer expect the Chinese government to significantly boost its stimulus package,"" Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) economist Joerg Kraemer said. ""Instead, it accepts the growth loss that comes with the trade war.""
Citing weaker demand from emerging markets and from China in particular, the bank's economic research team cut its 2020 growth forecast for the German economy to 0.8% from 1.3% previously.
Carsten Brzeski, from ING-Diba, said the weak export figures had made a small second quarter economic contraction more likely.
That would put in on an equal footing with Britain, whose economy unexpectedly shrank for the first time since 2012 in the second quarter, in a severe hangover from a pre-Brexit stockpiling boost in early 2019 that bodes ill as the country prepares to leave the EU on Oct. 31.
DEBT STIMULUS?
For Germany, another form of domestic stimulus under consideration is an increase in sovereign debt issuance.
In a sign that Berlin is willing to do more and reduce its trade and current account surpluses, a senior government official told Reuters on Thursday that it is considering ditching its long-standing balanced budget policy to help finance a costly climate protection program with new bonds.
The International Monetary Fund and the European Commission have long urged Germany to do more to lift domestic demand as a way to boost imports, stimulate growth elsewhere and reduce global economic imbalances.
The half-year current account surplus, which measures the flow of goods, services and investments, fell to 126.4 billion euros from 130.6 billion, Friday's data showed.
But that still left it above the European Commission's indicative threshold of 6 percent of gross domestic product, where it has stood since 2011."
753,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 09, 2019 03:42AM ET</span>",German Exports Slump Most in Three Years on Trade Conflicts,"(Bloomberg) -- Terms of Trade is a daily newsletter that untangles a world embroiled in trade wars. Sign up here. 
German exports registered their steepest annual decline in three years in June, underscoring the plight of the manufacturing sector as global trade tensions escalate.
Shipments abroad were down 8% from the previous year, the most since July 2016. Imports, a gauge for the strength of the domestic economy, fell an annual 4.4%. Strains are also showing in France, where industrial production plunged in June.
The data add to evidence that export-reliant businesses are hurting badly, threatening to bring Europe’s largest economy to a halt. Once a growth driver in the region, Germany is forecast to expand a mere 0.5% this year, with only Italy seen faring worse.
There are few -- if any -- signs of imminent improvement. The U.S. and China, two of Germany’s key trading partners, remain locked in a war over import tariffs. The former recently announced its biggest hike in levies yet, prompting the latter to respond by allowing its currency to tumble to its lowest value in more than a decade.
Germany is caught in the middle. Big-name companies including Continental, Daimler, BASF and Lufthansa have slashed their outlooks in recent weeks amid global geopolitical uncertainty.
Economists at Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) predict China is on the cusp of a more fundamental shift in how it’s running its economy, with repercussions also for Germany and the euro area.
“There is much to suggest that China is taking the ‘Austrian’ path, accepting a protectionism-induced reduction in economic growth, and refraining from massively increasing the economic stimulus package which so far has had little effect,” Joerg Kraemer, Commerzbank’s chief economist, wrote in a note. The bank lowered its forecasts for economic growth in Germany and the euro area for 2020 to 0.8% and 0.7%, respectively.
Industrial production is already suffering across the region. In France, output dropped 2.3% in June from the previous month, the most since early 2018. In Germany, production registered its biggest annual decline in nearly a decade, and receding confidence indicators are feeding speculation that the economy may be headed for a recession.
Second-quarter data GDP data are due on Aug. 14, with economists surveyed by Bloomberg forecasting stagnation.
So far, the German government has been reluctant to react, arguing additional fiscal stimulus isn’t needed. This stance means the country’s current-account surplus, which has drawn criticism from U.S. President Donald Trump as well as the International Monetary Fund, will remain significant. It widened to 20.6 billion euros ($23 billion) in June.
European Central Bank President Mario Draghi said last month it’s “unquestionable” that governments will need to pitch in if conditions keep deteriorating. Policy makers have signaled that they could provide more monetary stimulus as soon as September.

754,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 09, 2019 01:26AM ET</span>","China producer prices fall for first time in three years, deflation worries resurface","BEIJING (Reuters) - China's factory gate prices shrank for the first time in three years in July, stoking deflation worries and adding pressure on Beijing to deliver more stimulus as the economy sputters amid an intensifying trade war with the United States.
With demand slowing at home and abroad, Chinese manufacturers are having to cut prices to keep market share, depressing profit margins and discouraging the fresh investment needed to get the economy back on its feet.
Falling prices for crude oil, iron ore and other raw materials are also playing a part.
China's producer price index (PPI) fell 0.3% from year earlier in July, the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) said on Friday.
That compared with zero growth seen in June and a 0.1% drop expected by analysts in a Reuters poll.
It was the first contraction on an annual basis since August 2016, though the index have now dropped sequentially for the last two months. PPI is one gauge of corporate profitability.
""Weak demand has started to impact expectations on the production side,"" analyst Zou Qiang at Everbright Pramerica Fund Management said in a note.
Zou expects the price contraction to worsen in the coming months due to stricter curbs on the property sector, as regulators try to rein in debt risks and tame rising home prices.
Producer inflation in other major economies such as the United States and Germany has also been tepid lately, raising questions about the durability of global demand as the year-long U.S.-China trade war looks set to get longer and costlier.
The Chinese industries which saw the steepest factory price declines included oil and gas extraction, and paper and paper product manufacturing, with falls of 8.3% and 7.1% from a year earlier, respectively.
Energy processing firms such as oil refiners and chemical producers also saw extended price declines.
Prices for some major building materials such as steel reinforcing bars were weak in July as high temperatures and rain stalled construction projects.
POLICY OPTIONS
While trade data on Thursday showed China's exports unexpectedly returned to growth in July, analysts warn the rebound could be short-lived as Washington prepares to slap even more tariffs on Chinese goods. Indeed, China factory activity suggested no let-up in pressure, with export orders dwindling due to weak global demand.
The Sino-U.S. trade row deepened abruptly last week after U.S. President Donald Trump said he would impose 10% tariffs on the remaining $300 billion in Chinese imports from next month.
China's manufacturing investment growth has already slowed to 3% in the first half of 2019 from 9.5% in all of 2018, according to estimates from Nomura, and additional tariffs are likely to depress such spending further.
Weakening producer prices could add to worries about debt problems and default risks for Chinese companies as economic growth cools to near 30-year lows.
The central bank is expected to further cut banks' reserve requirements (RRR) in coming months to free up more funds to lend, on top of six reductions since early 2018. The government has also tried to ease pressure on corporate balance sheets by cutting taxes and fees.
But policy sources say more aggressive action like interest rate cuts are a last resort, given worries about high levels of debt leftover from massive stimulus sprees in the past.
China’s central bank governor Yi Gang said last month that the current interest rate level is appropriate, and said cutting them would depend on economic conditions.
“Cutting interest rate will mainly deal with the danger of deflation, but price changes in China remain moderate,” he said in an interview with financial magazine Caixin.
Recent depreciation in the yuan could help relieve some of the downward pressure on headline producer inflation by raising import costs, ANZ analysts wrote in a note.
On Monday, China let its yuan currency weaken past the key 7-per-dollar level to its lowest in over a decade, a surprising move that rattled global markets and prompting Washington to label Beijing a currency manipulator.
China's yuan has now weakened just over 2.5% against the U.S. dollar since the start of the year. ANZ estimates that has contributed 1.0 percentage point to the PPI in the first half of 2019, and said a boost of similar magnitude can be expected if the exchange rate against the dollar stays at 7.1.
""China now has another lever to combat deflationary risks because the exchange rate is allowed to be more market-determined,"" ANZ said.
CONSUMER INFLATION PICKING UP
Friday's data also showed China's consumer inflation picked up to a 17-month high in July, mainly driven by a jump in prices of pork and other proteins due to a prolonged outbreak of African swine fever, and dry weather in fruit-growing regions.
The consumer price index (CPI) rose 2.8% from a year earlier, a touch higher than expectations and June.
Food inflation accelerated at the fastest pace since January 2012. The food price index rose 9.1% on year, picking up from a 8.3% uptick in June. Fruit prices surged 39.1% and pork prices jumped 18.2%.
On a month-on-month basis, CPI grew 0.4% in July after dipping 0.1% in June.
Core consumer inflation -- excluding food and fuel -- remained modest, however, easing marginally to 1.3% on-year.
""The upshot is that China faces the worse of both worlds,"" said Capital Economics in a note.
""Accelerating consumer prices will weigh on household confidence and real income growth, but at the same time, the return of factory-gate deflation that will put further downward pressure on manufacturing profits."""

The CPI rose 2.8% from a year ago in July, compared with the 2.7% increase markets had previously expected. It was the highest reading since February 2018.
Dong Yaxiu, director at the NBS, said increasing prices of pork and fresh fruit contributed to the high CPI in July.
Pork prices rose by 27% year-on-year, while fresh fruits jumped 39.1% during the month.
Pork is the single-largest element in the basket of consumer goods used to calculate CPI.

756,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 09, 2019 12:40AM ET</span>",Japan's Surprise Growth Spurt Fails to Lift Clouds on Horizon,"(Bloomberg) -- Another quarter of stronger-than-expected growth did little to ease concerns that trade tensions and a tax hike are set to slow Japan’s export-driven economy.
Gross domestic product defied expectations again, growing an annualized 1.8% in the second quarter from the previous three months, as a surge in consumer spending and better-than-expected capital investment offset an export slump.
That follows revised growth of 2.8% in the first quarter, adding up to Japan’s two best quarters since the first half of 2017.
Yet resilient domestic demand won’t stop the U.S.-China trade war from escalating and roiling global markets, and it remains to be seen whether it survives a domestic sales-tax hike set to take effect in just two months.
""The second quarter was good, but I see far more uncertain factors than optimistic ones when I look beyond this summer,"" said Yuichi Kodama, chief economist at Meiji Yasuda Life Insurance Co. in Tokyo. “The results made the economy look better than it is in reality.""
Consumption Boost
Take consumer spending. It rose the most in two years and was the biggest growth driver during the second quarter. Yet it got a big lift from a 10-day public holiday and shoppers making purchases of durable goods such as air conditioners ahead of the October tax increase.
Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s government has prepared a series of measures to soften the blow for consumers, after a bigger hike in 2014 sent consumption into a tailspin. But spending isn’t likely to continue at the pace seen in the second quarter, especially after the tax hike takes effect, and particularly if accompanied by a trade-war fueled global downturn.
Capital spending has held up so far despite the export slump, thanks partly to the need for labor-saving technology and ongoing demand for redevelopment ahead of the 2020 Olympics. Capital investment rose 1.5% from the previous quarter, nearly twice as much as economists forecast.
Exports Fall
Still, the trade war and recent market turmoil are weighing on sentiment. Japanese exports, a key driver of the economy, have already fallen for seven straight months. A stronger yen poses risks to the profits of Japanese exporters, which may hit capital investment at home.
Exports fell 0.1% in the second quarter from the first, and net exports actually cut 1.2 percentage points from annualized GDP figure, though that was partly due to a rise in imports, particularly oil and energy.
What Bloomberg’s Economists Say
“Looking ahead, fiscal stimulus and last-minute purchases ahead of the October sales-tax increase are likely to support growth in 3Q. The recent solid consumption means last-minute buying may be weaker than was the case before the last sales-tax hike in 2014.”-- Yuki Masujima, senior economistClick here to read the report
Another factor driving the unexpected second-quarter growth was public spending, which topped estimates. Economists pointed to the delayed impact of a supplementary budget in the fiscal year ended in March.
Growth is expected to continue in the third quarter, particularly if consumers keep spending ahead of the tax increase, before a sharp contraction in the fourth. Still, if the U.S.-China trade war continues, or worsens, all bets are off.
""We shouldn’t be optimistic about the outlook for the economy because of today’s data,"" said Yoshiki Shinke, chief economist at Dai-Ichi Life Research Institute. ""Trade tensions are escalating and we have a sales-tax hike coming up."""
757,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 09, 2019 12:23AM ET</span>","Japan's GDP thumps forecasts on robust consumer, business sectors","By Daniel Leussink and Leika Kihara
TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's economy grew much faster than expected in April-June to mark the third straight quarter of expansion, as robust household consumption and business investment offset the hit to exports from cooling global demand.
The data offers some relief for the Bank of Japan, which is under pressure to follow other central banks and ramp up stimulus to head off heightening global risks.
Gross domestic product (GDP) grew an annualized 1.8% in the second quarter, the Cabinet Office's preliminary data showed on Friday, far exceeding a median market forecast for a 0.4% increase. It followed a revised 2.8% gain in January-March.
""There are no signs that the uncertainty from the trade war has prompted firms to rein in investment spending,"" said Marcel Thieliant, senior Japan economist at Capital Economics.
""Today's data will assuage some of the concerns among Bank of Japan Board members about the impact of the global slowdown on Japan's economy.""
Private consumption, which accounts for about 60% of the economy, rose 0.6% from January-March to mark the third straight quarter of growth, thanks to brisk demand for cars and air conditioners, a government official told reporters.
Capital expenditure also rose 1.5%, nearly double the pace of increase projected by analysts and accelerating from a 0.4% rise in January-March.
A steady stream of inbound tourists and an expected surge in demand ahead of the 2020 Tokyo Olympic Games drove up construction of hotels and leisure facilities, analysts said.
Office construction and public works also boosted capital expenditure, analysts said, a sign the economy's resilience was underpinned by those sectors less affected by slowing global trade.
Domestic demand added 0.7 percentage point to GDP growth, more than offsetting the 0.3 point negative contribution from external demand, the data showed.
DARK CLOUDS LOOM
Despite the signs of strength at home, darkening trade clouds globally continue to hang over the economy with exports falling 0.1% in April-June, failing to bounce back from a 2.0% slump in the previous quarter.
While Japan's Economy Minister Toshimitsu Motegi said the data supports the view the economy would maintain a moderate recovery, analysts warn it may lose support from domestic demand after a scheduled sales tax hike in October. Unless global demand picks up by then, the economy would be without a driver of growth, they say.
""The GDP data looks too good to be true, and may be inflated by one-off factors like a surge in government expenditure and leisure spending during the long holidays in May,"" said Yoshiki Shinke, chief economist at Dai-ichi Life Research Institute.
""The timing of a pick-up in global demand is crucial. If this is delayed, that would spell trouble for the economy.""
There are already some signs of trouble in domestic demand.
Consumer confidence slipped in July for the third month to hit the lowest since April 2016, data on Thursday showed, suggesting that households could tighten their purse strings even before the sales tax hike rolls in.
Motegi told reporters the government wouldn't hesitate to take additional fiscal measures to counter risks to the economy.
Some analysts say the BOJ could time its monetary easing to coincide with government plans to ramp up fiscal stimulus.
""The BOJ could ease policy as part of a policy mix, though they aren't likely to do it soon,"" said Toru Suehiro, senior market economist at Mizuho Securities.
""It'll need to see how (the economy) will be impacted by the sales tax hike."""

CHICAGO (Reuters) - U.S. farm incomes in the Midwest and Mid-Southern states declined yet again in the second quarter of 2019, as record floods devastated a wide swath of the Farm Belt, according to banker surveys released on Thursday by the Federal Reserve Banks of St. Louis and Kansas City.
Nearly two-thirds of the bankers surveyed by the St. Louis Fed said a majority of their farm customers were either significantly or modestly impacted by the flooding and other adverse weather earlier this year.
But in parts of the Midwest, federal trade-related aid to farmers and corn prices rising this spring due to the wet planting conditions slowed the pace of that income drop, according to bankers surveyed by the Kansas City Fed.
""These developments may have led to less pessimistic expectations about farm income in coming months,"" the Kansas City Fed wrote in its survey.
The floods added more pain on farmers who have also been hurt by low crop prices and the trade war between Washington and Beijing, which has slashed shipments of U.S. agricultural products to China. The floods also battered earnings for global grain traders Cargill Inc and Archer Daniels Midland Co (N:ADM), as heavy rains halted barge traffic on the Mississippi River, disrupted cattle shipments and caused some plants to be shuttered.
The St. Louis Fed said the second quarter marked the 22nd consecutive quarter for farm incomes dropping in the Eighth Federal Reserve District, which includes all or parts of seven Midwest and Mid-South states: Arkansas, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Mississippi, Missouri and Tennessee.
The weaker income trend is expected to continue in the third quarter, dragged down by the ongoing trade fight between the United States and China, problems with crop production and depressed commodity prices, bankers in the Eighth District said.
The flooding and extreme weather also impacted local economies in western Missouri, Kansas, Nebraska and Oklahoma, according to the Kansas City Fed's survey. The bank's Tenth District also includes Colorado, Wyoming and portions of northern New Mexico.
Farm household spending and farm capital expenditures also were lower for the quarter for the Eighth District, compared with a year earlier, raising concerns about potential ripple effects overall on rural communities.

But bankers there said they did expect such belt-tightening to ease in the third quarter, as farmers prepare for the fall harvest season.

Fears about a global downturn, stoked by trade tensions between China and the United States, had set off a rush out of stocks and into low-risk U.S. government bonds since last week before that move subsided on Thursday.
""Business sentiment is declining on negative trade and manufacturing headlines, but consumer sentiment remains buoyed by a strong labor market and low rates that will continue to drive home sales into the fall,” Freddie Mac's chief economist Sam Khater said in a statement.

760,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 08, 2019 12:28PM ET</span>",U.S. weekly jobless claims unexpectedly fall,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The number of Americans filing applications for unemployment benefits unexpectedly fell last week, suggesting the labor market remains strong even as the economy is slowing.
The jobless claims report from the Labor Department on Thursday, however, does not fully account for the impact of the recent escalation in the bitter trade war between the United States and China, which has led to an inversion of the U.S. Treasury yield curve and raised the risk of a recession. 
Worries about the trade war's effect on the economic expansion, the longest on record, prompted the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates last week for the first time since 2008.
Financial markets have fully priced in another rate cut next month. Expectations for a 50-basis-point cut at the Fed's Sept. 17-18 policy meeting have also risen.
""Initial claims have been sending a reasonably upbeat message about conditions in the labor market,"" said Daniel Silver, an economist at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) in New York. ""Today's report likely doesn't contain much information about the period since the recent escalations in trade tensions.""
Initial claims for state unemployment benefits fell 8,000 to a seasonally adjusted 209,000 for the week ended Aug. 3, the government said. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast claims would be unchanged at 215,000 in the latest week. 
""Though equity market volatility and low bond yields are driving pessimism about the economic outlook ... we would have to see initial claims sustain a rise to the 250,000 level to become concerned about recession,"" said John Ryding, chief economist at RDQ Economics in New York. 
U.S. stocks were trading higher partly due to unexpectedly better Chinese data and a steadying of the yuan, which provided some relief to investors alarmed by the rise in U.S.-China trade tensions. The dollar (DXY) was little changed against a basket of currencies, while U.S. Treasury prices fell.
INVENTORY ACCUMULATION SLOWING Last week's drop in claims pushed them to the lower end of their 193,000-244,000 range for this year. The four-week moving average of initial claims, considered a better measure of labor market trends as it irons out week-to-week volatility, edged up 250 to 212,250 last week.
Though hiring has slowed, the pace of job gains remains well above the roughly 100,000 needed per month to keep up with growth in the working-age population. 
Nonfarm payrolls increased by 164,000 jobs in July, down from 193,000 in June. Job growth over the last three months averaged 140,000 per month, the lowest in nearly two years, compared to 223,000 in 2018. The moderation in employment growth partly reflects a shortage of workers. 
""While net employment growth depends on gross hiring as well as the pace of layoffs, and the trend in payrolls gains may have moderated a bit, major weakening in employment growth is invariably associated with an uptrend in claims,"" said Jim O'Sullivan, chief U.S. economist at High Frequency Economics in White Plains, New York.
The economy grew at a 2.1% annualized rate in the second quarter, slowing from the first quarter's brisk 3.1% pace. Growth is seen below a 2.0% rate in the July-September quarter.
But economists expect the government will lower its second-quarter GDP growth estimate to around a 1.8% rate later this month after a separate report from the Commerce Department on Thursday showed wholesale inventories were unchanged in June instead of rising 0.2% as reported last month. 
The component of wholesale inventories that goes into the calculation of gross domestic product edged up 0.1% in June. 
That suggested the pace of inventory accumulation was much slower than the government had assumed when it compiled its advance GDP report last month. The government is scheduled to publish its second GDP estimate for the April-June period on Aug. 29.
According to JPMorgan's Silver, the June wholesale data implied inventories increased at a $66 billion rate in the second quarter, instead of the $71.7 billion pace estimated in the advance GDP report. 
That means inventories chopped 1.0 percentage point from GDP, rather than the estimated 0.86 percentage point.

Some of the slowdown in inventory accumulation reflects a surge in consumer spending in the second quarter. Businesses are also carefully managing stock levels because of the darkening economic outlook.

Consumer prices rose 33.8% in July, up from 24.8% in June. Rampant inflation has led to a severe decline in purchasing power in Venezuela, where the monthly minimum wage amounts to just over $3 per month. More than 4 million Venezuelans have emigrated due to the inability to buy food and medicine.
""We are still in hyperinflation,"" opposition lawmaker Alfonso Marquina told reporters. ""You can find food, but the prices are inaccessible.
Annual inflation in July was 264,872%, down from 445,482% in June and well below levels OF over 1 million percent earlier this year. President Nicolas Maduro's socialist government has managed to bring down hyperinflation by imposing strict reserve requirements on banks, reducing credit available to businesses.
Economists say that has contributed to a severe decline in economic activity. The International Monetary Fund expects the OPEC nation's economy to shrink 35 percent in 2019.
The central bank in May broke a nearly four-year silence on official economic data by publishing statistics showing an inflation rate of 33.8 percent in April.

763,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 08, 2019 02:25AM ET</span>","China surprises with best export growth since March, but imports remain weak","BEIJING (Reuters) - China's exports unexpectedly returned to growth in July on improved global demand despite escalating U.S. trade pressure, but the rebound may be short-lived as Washington prepares to slap even more tariffs on Chinese goods.
Analysts say a sharp drop in the yuan currency this week may offer only limited help for Chinese exporters, who are facing additional U.S. levies next month, shrinking profit margins, and sputtering demand worldwide.
July exports rose 3.3% from a year earlier, the fastest since March and more than the most optimistic estimate in a Reuters poll, customs data showed on Thursday. Analysts had expected a 2.0% drop after June's 1.3% fall.
But imports remained weak, declining 5.6% and highlighting sluggish domestic demand as China's economy struggles to get back on firmer footing. Still, the drop was less than an expected 8.3% and June's 7.3%.
The better-than-expected trade readings helped buoy Asian stock markets, which suffered a heavy selloff earlier in the week as the Sino-U.S. trade war intensified and the yuan skidded to 11-year lows.
While China's exports to the U.S. continued to shrink in July in the face of stiffer tariffs, shipments picked up to Europe, South Korea, Taiwan and, most noticeably, Southeast Asia (ASEAN).
""It could suggest that some exporters are trying to diversify their export regions, it could also be due to manufacturers' relocations to ASEAN (from China),"" said Betty Wang, a senior China economist at ANZ.
""This hopefully can offset some of the downside risks from the U.S. China bilateral trade."" 
Washington is clearly watching shifts in China's trade patterns as the trade dispute wears on. The United States recently warned Hanoi that some export goods labeled ""Made in Vietnam"" were of Chinese origin. 
An official Chinese think tank attributed the rise in exports partly to Beijing's Belt and Road initiative, a program that aims to boost business and trade ties with dozens of countries across the world.
""This year, China did not only increase its market share in major economies like the European Union, what's more outstanding is the growth rate in emerging markets is very clear, especially the countries who we work with on Belt and Road,"" said Yan Min, the director of the forecasting department at the State Information Center, according to state media.

NO QUICK TURNAROUND IN SIGHT
China's exporters and their U.S. customers have been whipsawed in recent months by trade uncertainties, with the fallout rippling through global suppliers from Germany to Singapore.
The United States raised tariffs on a large number of Chinese goods in May, after trade negotiations broke down, and Beijing retaliated.
A brief ceasefire agreed in late June has proved short-lived, after Trump vowed last week to impose a 10% tariff on $300 billion of Chinese imports from Sept. 1, which would extend levies to effectively all of the goods China sells to the United States.
In response, China said it would stop purchasing U.S. agricultural products.
China's trade surplus with the United States stood at $27.97 billion in July, narrowing from June's $29.92 billion.
But it reached $168.5 billion in the first seven months of 2019, highlighting continued imbalances which have been a core complaint of Trump's in his administration's negotiations with Beijing. 
China's July exports to the United States fell 6.5% year-on-year, while imports from America slumped 19.1%.
DISPUTE WIDENING TO OTHER AREAS, CURRENCIES 
The dispute between the world's largest economies is spreading beyond tariffs on goods to other areas such technology and in recent days currency policy. 
On Monday, China allowed the yuan to depreciate past the 7 yuan-per-dollar level for the first time in more than a decade, triggering worries of a global currency war. Hours later, Washington branded Beijing a ""currency manipulator"".
While China has stepped in to stabilize the yuan in recent sessions, markets remain on edge in case of further weakness.
""Looking ahead, exports still look set to remain subdued in the coming quarters as any prop from a weaker renminbi should be overshadowed by further US tariffs and broader external weakness,"" said Julian Evans-Pritchard, senior China Economist at Capital Economics, in a note on Thursday.
Pressured by weak demand at home and abroad, China's economic growth cooled to a near 30-year low of 6.2% in the second quarter. Other major data over the coming week is expected to show a loss of momentum in July, reinforcing views that Beijing will need to roll out more support measures.

764,By Investing.com,"<span>Aug 07, 2019 11:45PM ET</span>",China’s July Exports Unexpectedly Grow; Imports Falls Less Than Expected,"Investing.com - China reported on Thursday in Asia that its exports in July unexpectedly rose.
U.S. dollar-denominated exports gained 3.3% from a year ago, custom data showed. That compares with an expected fall of 2.0%.
Imports during the month fell 5.6%, compared with a forecasted 8.3% decline.
The country’s trade surplus last month was $45.06 billion. 
The data were closely watched as some traders believed China’s economic growth would be negatively impacted by the ongoing trade war with the U.S. 
Tensions between the two sides intensified after U.S. president Donald Trump imposed additional tariffs on more Chinese goods last week, while the Treasury Department labelled Beijing a currency manipulator on Monday after the yuan broke through the psychologically important level of 7 yuan to the dollar.
The currency’s slump was “due to the effects of unilateralist and trade-protectionist measures and the expectations for tariffs against China,” the People’s Bank of China said in a statement.
“Softer external demand and punitive tariffs will continue to dampen export growth. Meanwhile, falling commodity prices, a high base last year, and falling intermediary demand may have dragged down import growth in July,” analysts from Citi Research wrote in a note last week that was cited by CNBC.

766,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 07, 2019 10:27PM ET</span>",Australia’s Housing Market Is Suddenly Heating Up Again,"(Bloomberg) -- After a two-year slide, Australian house prices look to have bottomed out, sending buyers flocking back to the market.
Case in point: An auction for a four-bedroom house in the Sydney suburb of Ryde on Saturday attracted about 100 people. Spirited bidding pushed offers A$226,000 above the reserve price, before it finally sold for almost A$1.5 million ($1 million) -- a buzz last seen during the boom years.
“A lot more people now are getting concerned that things are going to go up in the next six to 12 months so they’re trying to buy now,” said real estate agent Phil Allison, who handled the sale. As recently as six months ago, it was difficult to elicit a single bid at an auction for a house just around the corner, he said.
The sudden turnaround in sentiment can be traced to three factors: the central bank’s back-to-back interest rate cuts which have pushed mortgage rates to record lows; the regulator’s loosening of mortgage stress tests; and the surprise re-election of Scott Morrison’s government in May, which killed off the opposition Labor party’s plans to wind back tax breaks for property investors.
The nascent rebound is a rare bright spot in an otherwise sluggish economy, which has been beset by stagnant wages and a sharp slowdown in growth. Rising home prices may help underpin consumer spending by making homeowners feel wealthier.
Dwelling values in Sydney, the nation’s largest property market, have risen in each of the past two months, according to CoreLogic Inc. That ended a near two-year slide that saw prices tumble 15% from their July 2017 peak, and foreshortened a slump economists had forecast to extend into next year.
Prices also rose in Melbourne, Brisbane, Hobart and Darwin last month.
“We think house prices will rise at single-digit rates in coming quarters and it’s that combination of lower interest rates and looser prudential settings that are the key driver,” said Paul Bloxham,  HSBC Holdings  (LON:HSBA) Plc’s Australian chief economist.
Commonwealth Bank of Australia, the nation’s largest home lender, also says the housing market has turned the corner.
“We feel like the housing market is starting to stabilize and may slightly improve from here,” Chief Executive Officer Matt Comyn said Wednesday, as the bank announced its earnings. “We see modest price increases and a modest increase in credit growth overall.”
Still Expensive
The upswing in prices has also revived a fear of missing out among home buyers, last seen during a frenzied boom that pushed Sydney prices up 75% between 2012 and mid-2017. Clearance rates at auctions -- the most common way of selling a house in Australia -- climbed to 75% in the city in the first week of August, compared to 52% a year ago, according to CoreLogic.
Still, the rebound isn’t good news for everyone. Despite the two-year slump, Sydney is still home to one of the world’s most expensive property markets, with a median house price of A$864,993, according to CoreLogic. Even now, home values are only back to where they were in early 2015.
Getting a foothold in the market is still out of reach for Christie Anderson, 39, her husband Aaron, 40, and their four children.
“We decided to have a family and buy later,” Christie said. “Now we’re out of the market.”
And not everyone is convinced the property market has bottomed. More houses may soon hit the market as the peak Spring selling season starts, and Sydney and Melbourne are set to be swamped by a glut of apartments, potentially making it a buyers’ market again.
80,000 Reasons Why Australian Housing Will Struggle
“When Spring comes and there’s more stock on the market, that will be the true test,” said Allison, the real estate agent, adding that he isn’t getting “too carried away” just yet.

767,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 07, 2019 07:16PM ET</span>",UK housing market slows after June bounce - RICS,"LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's housing market softened in July after a small bounce the month before, a survey showed on Thursday, adding to signs that Brexit worries are again making households cautious about shopping for a new home.
The Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors said its headline price indicator fell back to -9 from a 10-month high of -1 in June, a steeper decline than any economist had predicted in a Reuters poll.
The news follows figures from mortgage lender Halifax on Wednesday which showed house prices fell in July for a second consecutive month.
""The latest RICS results will provide little comfort for the market with all the key indicators pretty much flatlining"", RICS chief economist, Simon Rubinsohn, said.
""The forward-looking metrics on prices and sales also seem to be losing momentum as concerns ... about Brexit and political uncertainty heighten,"" he added.
Surveyors' average forecast for house prices over the next 12 months dropped to -0.1% from +0.6% in June, its first time below zero this year, while the average annual price increase expected over the next five years dropped to 2.1%.
Britain's new prime minister, Boris Johnson, has said he is determined to exit the European Union on Oct. 31, even if it means leaving without a deal - something many businesses think would lead to major economic disruption.
The housing market has already slowed since June 2016's Brexit vote, though the effect has been concentrated in London and neighboring areas, where prices were already high.
July's RICS data did show an improvement in the number of inquiries from potential buyers for a second consecutive month, but the number of sales fell.
RICS said more than two thirds of homes priced at over 1 million pounds failed to sell for their asking price, in contrast to homes priced under 500,000 pounds, most of which sold for at least what they were advertised for.
Demand from tenants to rent homes also strengthened to its highest since late 2016, and surveyors predicted rents would rise at their fastest in three years as fewer small landlords wanted to enter the market due to less favorable tax treatment."

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India's auto industry demanded tax cuts and easier access to finance for dealers and buyers at a meeting with Indian government officials on Wednesday to discuss the sector's woes, sources said, in an effort to revive sales that have slumped.
Executives from across the sector also asked the government to provide incentives to scrap old vehicles, which they said would help boost sales, and urged officials to reconsider a proposal to hike registration fees for automobiles as it would hurt demand, the two sources said.
Arvind Sawant, minister for heavy industries, who attended the meeting, told reporters that the government had heard the industry's concerns but needed more meetings before making any decisions. 
""We have not given any immediate solution. We have listened to them,"" he said, adding that officials would come up with a solution soon.
The meeting, chaired by India's Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, was attended by senior executives from automakers including Maruti Suzuki (NS:MRTI),  Hyundai Motor  (KS:005380), Toyota Motor (T:7203), Skoda [VOWGK.UL], Mahindra & Mahindra (NS:MAHM), Tata Motors (NS:TAMO) and  Hero MotoCorp  (NS:HROM) and auto parts makers Minda Industries (NS:MNDA) and India Pistons.
Representatives from the auto, auto components and dealers trade bodies as well as officials from the ministries of finance, heavy industries and road transport were also present.
""HUGE DANGER""
The auto sector, which contributes more than 7% of India's GDP, is facing one of its worst downturns. Passenger vehicle sales have dropped for nine straight months through July, with some automakers suffering year-on-year declines of more than 30% in recent months.
""Currently we are going through one of the biggest slowdowns that we have seen in recent times,"" Pawan Goenka, managing director at automaker Mahindra said earlier on Wednesday after the company reported a quarterly profit.
Goenka, who said this is the worst Indian autos market since 2001, warned of a ""huge danger"" of job losses and sought government intervention. 
Motorbike maker Yamaha Motor (T:7272) and auto components makers including France's  Valeo  (PA:VLOF) and Subros (NS:SUBR) have laid off about 1,700 temporary workers in India, Reuters reported on Tuesday.
The auto executives urged the government to cut taxes on cars and auto components to 18% from 28% and sought help to prod banks to lower lending rates and make the loan terms more lenient, one of the sources said.
While several factors have contributed to the slump, a deepening liquidity crunch among India's shadow banks that lend to the companies, dealers and car buyers has been the biggest single factor hurting sales.
On Wednesday, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) lowered its benchmark interest rate for a fourth straight time, slicing 35 basis points off the repo rate to bring it down to 5.40%.
For the auto industry, though, the concern is that the banks and shadow lenders will not cut their lending rates by as much as the RBI because the lenders are overburdened by bad debts or finding it difficult to borrow.

The executives also asked the government to go slow on its electric vehicles plan. They said that while the industry would like to switch to clean fuel technology the aggressive push was delaying purchases by buyers who fear gasoline vehicles could be banned, the sources said.

770,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 07, 2019 07:35AM ET</span>",India central bank cuts rates again to try to speed up growth,"By Swati Bhat and Abhirup Roy
MUMBAI (Reuters) - The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) lowered its benchmark interest rates for a fourth straight meeting on Wednesday with a slightly bigger than expected cut, underscoring its worries about India's near-five year low economic growth pace.
The six-member monetary policy committee (MPC) cut the repo rate  by an unconventional 35 basis points (bps) to 5.40%, just above a 25 bps cut predicted by 80% of the 66 analysts polled by Reuters last month. 
The RBI's move came hours after the New Zealand central bank's decision to cut its rates by a steep 50 bps, and just before the Bank of Thailand surprised the market by cutting its benchmark. 
""With inflation projected to remain within target, addressing growth concerns by boosting aggregate demand, especially private investment, assumes the highest priority at this juncture,"" Governor Shaktikanta Das told a news conference.
Asia's third largest economy grew at a significantly slower-than-expected 5.8% annual pace in the January-March quarter. And most analysts expect data due later this month to show that growth in April-June faltered even further.
SIGNAL OF CONCERN
The 35 bps rate cut is ""a signal that the Reserve Bank of India's MPC is quite concerned with the growth outlook,"" said Suvodeep Rakshit, a senior economist with Kotak Institutional Equities in Mumbai.
Indeed, the RBI lowered its economic growth forecast to 6.9% from 7% for the current fiscal year, and said it sees inflation remaining inside its target range over a 12-month horizon.
Indian Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, in a newspaper interview last week, expressed that she would like to see a ""significant"" reduction in RBI policy rates, in order to bolster a weak economy.
Asked about the unconventional rate cut size at a press briefing, RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das defended the move, saying the MPC viewed a standard 25 bps cut as being ""inadequate in view of the evolving global and domestic macro-economic"" conditions, while a 50 bps cut was seen as potentially ""excessive"", given past RBI actions.
Analysts said they still see scope for rate cuts as inflation is likely to remain muted.
""With softness in incoming data, we retain our call for another 25 bp cut, likely in the next quarter,"" said Radhika Rao, DBS economist in Singapore.
Earlier this week, Sitharaman said the government plans to take steps to improve the state of the economy ""fairly quickly"" after getting inputs from business leaders.
Das said the recent rate cuts in tandem with anticipated government moves should lift sluggish economic growth. 
Markets were little changed as the RBI decision was largely in-line with expectations. The 10-year benchmark bond yield  rose to 6.37% from 6.33% before the announcement, while the rupee  was barely moved at 70.84 per dollar.
Losses for India's benchmark NSE Index (NSEI) increased after the rate announcement, with it closing down 0.85%.
GETTING BANKS TO CUT RATES
Four MPC members voted for the 35 bps cut, while two voted for a 25 bps cut, the RBI said. All members voted to keep the policy stance at ""accommodative"".
The MPC also cut the reverse repo rate  to 5.15%.
With Wednesday's move, the RBI has cut the repo rate by 110 bps this year. Analysts say the real challenge remains getting India's banks to pass rate cuts to borrowers.
""The real issues are improving monetary policy transmission and reviving the non-banking finance companies sector; the policy does not provide any new measures or even perspectives on these areas,"" said Sujan Hajra, chief economist at Anand Rathi Securities in Mumbai.
 State Bank of India  (NS:SBI), the country's biggest lender by assets, cut its benchmark lending rate by 15 bps across all tenors shortly after the policy announcement. Since the start of the year SBI has cut rates by just 30 bps in response to RBI's 110 bps cuts.
""Unless the transmission is swift and full, we may not see a change in the consumption and investment trajectory,"" Sandip Somany, president of industry body FICCI said.

""It is equally important that the government front-loads its capital expenditure program for the current year and continues to push ahead with the reforms program"".

771,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 07, 2019 05:07AM ET</span>",'Scary' German output figures add to recession fears,"By Michael Nienaber
BERLIN (Reuters) - German industrial output fell more than expected in June driven by weaker production of intermediate and capital goods, in a further sign that Europe's biggest economy contracted in the second quarter as exporters get caught in trade disputes.
Industrial output dropped by 1.5% on the month - a far steeper decline than the 0.4% fall forecast in a Reuters Poll of analysts, figures released by the Statistics Office showed on Wednesday.
""The continued plunge in production is scary,"" Bankhaus Lampe economist Alexander Krueger said, adding that a recession in the manufacturing sector was likely to continue due to the escalating trade dispute between China and the United States.
Both countries are important export destinations for German manufacturers, which means that the tit-for-tat tariff dispute between the world's two largest economies is having a disproportionately large impact on German goods producers.
""The longer this continues, the more likely it is that other sectors of the economy will be dragged into this. Growth forecasts for Germany are likely to be trimmed further,"" Krueger said.
In the second quarter as a whole, industrial output fell by 1.8% on the quarter, driven by steep drops in metal production, machinery and automobile manufacturing, the economy ministry said.
""Industry remains in an economic downturn,"" the ministry said. Production in construction fell 1.1% in the second quarter while energy output dropped 5.9% in the same period.
PRELUDE TO RECESSION
The figures came after German industrial orders on Tuesday exceeded expectations in June, but the economy ministry cautioned that the sector had not yet reached a turning point as a slowing world economy, international trade disputes and Brexit uncertainty are taking their toll.
Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) economist Ralph Solveen said the industrial figures supported expectations that the German economy shrank slightly in the second quarter and that manufacturing output was likely to decline also in the coming months.
""A look at the individual sectors shows that the crisis in the automotive sector is continuing unabated,"" Solveen said, adding that car production had not recovered from the slump caused by problems associated with last year's switch to a new emissions measurement standard.
""However, the main reason for this weakness is now likely to be significantly weaker foreign demand,"" Solveen said.
The German government expects the economy to grow by a meager 0.5% this year and rebound with a 1.5% expansion in 2020.
Andreas Scheuerle from DekaBank said the industrial data suggested the economy contracted by 0.2% in the second quarter after expanding by 0.4% in the first three months of the year.
""We assume that this is the prelude to a technical recession,"" Scheuerle added. A technical recession is normally defined as at least two quarters of contraction in a row.

The Federal Statistics Office will release preliminary gross domestic product figures for the April-June period next Wednesday.

The surprise move by the Reserve Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ) sent the kiwi dollar tumbling to 10-month lows, and comes days after the Trump administration labeled China a currency manipulator in a dramatic escalation of the Sino-U.S. trade war.
""The Monetary Policy Committee agreed that a lower OCR is necessary to continue to meet its employment and inflation objectives,"" RBNZ's monetary policy committee said in a statement accompanying its rates decision.
""GDP growth has slowed over the past year and growth headwinds are rising. In the absence of additional monetary stimulus, employment and inflation would likely ease relative to our targets,"" the statement said.
The central bank lowered its cash rate by 25 basis points (bps) in May as international trade frictions clouded the growth outlook, and economists polled by Reuters had predicted policymakers would cut rates again this week by a quarter of a percentage point.
The New Zealand dollar tumbled 1% to $0.6443, a 10-month low, and bond yields slumped after the rates decision as markets priced in further easing, possibly as early as next month.
RBNZ's forecasts released with the statement show another cut is possible by the end of the year which would take the OCR below 1%.
New Zealand's move follows rate cuts by global policymakers who have been forced to inject more stimulus as fears grow over the broadening fallout of the U.S.-China trade dispute on the global economy.
And events this week rang more alarm bells for policymakers, as the trade war took a dramatic turn for the worse on Monday after the U.S government labeled China a currency manipulator for the first time since 1994.
The morphing of the Sino-U.S. trade conflict into a currency war leaves open economies like New Zealand heavily exposed and vulnerable to global pressure.
Last week, the U.S. Federal Reserve cut rates for the first time in a decade, and the Reserve Bank of Australia eased policy in both June and July.
Surprisingly strong New Zealand employment figures this week tempered some of the pessimism though leading indicators suggest growth will remain under pressure as businesses face tough times.
New Zealand's business outlook hit a 11-month low in July and consumer confidence sank. And while GDP growth picked up slightly in the first quarter, a largely weak set of global factory activity, trade and company earnings reports point to a softening outlook."

Others, however, advised against immediate stimulus due to the strain prolonged easing was inflicting on financial institutions, highlighting the rift in the nine-member board between those who favor more action and those against it.

""We must also consider in advance what steps we can take if we were to ease,"" the member added.
Several other opinions showed support for pre-emptive monetary easing to forestall risks. One said the BOJ must use both its interest rate targets and forward guidance to ease policy further, without elaborating, according to the summary.
""We need to assess the benefits and demerits of various monetary easing steps,"" one member said, a sign that the central bank has a range of easing options it could consider.
At the July meeting, the BOJ kept monetary policy steady but said it would ease without hesitation to pre-empt risks that could hurt the chance of achieving its 2% price goal.
The escalating U.S.-China trade war has jolted markets and triggered an unwelcome yen spike, piling pressure the BOJ to ramp up stimulus to support an export-reliant economic recovery.
But with interest rates hovering around zero, the BOJ is left with little ammunition to fight the next recession. Prolonged ultra-low rates have also heightened the cost of additional easing by hurting financial institutions' margin.
One board member said the BOJ must be cautious about topping up stimulus, and ensure its measures do not destabilize Japan's banking system, the summary showed.
""If overseas economies worsen further and hurt Japan's economy and prices, we must act swiftly with a mix of fiscal and monetary policies,"" another member said.
""But it's important to maintain the current stimulus policy for the time being with an eye on the side-effects to Japan's financial system.""
Under a policy dubbed yield curve control (YCC), the BOJ guides short-term rates at -0.1% and 10-year government bond yields around 0%.
It also has in place forward guidance, or a pledge on future monetary policy moves, that promises to keep rates at current ultra-low levels at least until around the spring of next year."

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. job openings and hiring fell in June, suggesting that demand for labor was cooling in tandem with a slowing economy, which could provide another reason for the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates again next month.
The report from the Labor Department on Tuesday came against the backdrop of an escalation in the trade war between the United States and China, which caused a sharp sell-off on Wall Street on Monday and sent U.S. Treasury 10-year yields tumbling to the lowest since October 2016.
Concerns about the impact of the U.S.-China trade tensions on the 10-year economic expansion, the longest in U.S. history, prompted the Fed to cut rates last week for the first time since 2008. Financial markets have fully priced in further monetary policy easing at the U.S. central bank's Sept. 17-18 meeting.
""Companies may be having difficulty filling positions or may be reticent to hire given the growing uncertainty in the economy,"" said Sophia Koropeckyj, a senior economist at Moody's Analytics in West Chester, Pennsylvania. ""Business confidence has taken a beating this year.""
Job openings, a measure of labor demand, slipped by 36,000 to a seasonally adjusted 7.3 million in June, the government said in its monthly Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey, or JOLTS. Since hitting an all-time high of 7.6 million in late 2018, job openings have been flat this year, suggesting some easing in labor market conditions.
The job openings rate dipped to 4.6% from 4.7% in May. There were declines in vacancies in the leisure and hospitality sector, and construction. But job openings increased in the real estate and rental and leasing industry, and state and local government education.
Hiring decreased by 58,000 jobs to 5.7 million in June. The hiring rate was unchanged at 3.8%. Hiring fell in the manufacturing and professional and business services industries. It increased by 76,000 jobs in the accommodation and food services industry.
DEMAND SLOWING
""Employer demand is slowing down, and the labor market isn't improving at the rate that it was before, but things aren't getting worse,"" said Nick Bunker, an economist at Indeed Hiring Lab. ""The slowdown is happening across the entire economy.""
The moderation in hiring in June suggests a big rebound in job growth in the months ahead is unlikely. Nonfarm payrolls increased by 164,000 jobs in July, down from 193,000 in June, the government reported last Friday.
Economists attribute some of the slowdown in hiring to the fading stimulus from last year's $1.5 trillion tax cut package.
The economy grew at a 2.1% annualized rate in the second quarter, decelerating from the January-March quarter's brisk 3.1% pace.
""Job openings have eased in such sectors as information, finance, and professional and business services, a possible harbinger of weaker employment gains in coming quarters,"" Moody's Analytics' Koropeckyj said.
The number of workers voluntarily quitting their jobs dipped to 3.4 million in June from 3.5 million in May. The quits rate was unchanged at 2.3% for the 13th straight month.
The quits rate is viewed by policymakers and economists as a measure of job market confidence.
The decline in the number of workers quitting their jobs was concentrated in transportation, warehousing, and utilities, and state and local government, excluding education. There was, however, an increase in the number of workers quitting their jobs in the construction sector.
Layoffs edged down in June, pushing the layoffs rate to 1.1% from 1.2% in May. Layoffs fell in professional and business services as well as the arts, entertainment, and recreation sector, but rose in the accommodation and food services sector."
776,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 06, 2019 11:31AM ET</span>",Mexico gross fixed investment falls in May for a fourth month,"MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexican gross fixed investment fell for a fourth straight month in May as the construction sector continued to decline, the national statistics agency said on Tuesday.
Gross fixed investment, a measure of spending on machinery, equipment and new construction, dropped 7.4% from the same month a year earlier in unadjusted terms. That was the biggest drop since April 2017, and the fourth consecutive month of contraction.
In seasonally adjusted terms, the figure was down 6.9% in May versus a year ago, marking its largest decline since September 2013.
""Binding fiscal constraints on public sector investment, high real interest rates and more exigent domestic financing conditions, as well as an overall lackluster outlook for final domestic demand, should all remain headwinds for investment spending,"" said Goldman Sachs' head of Latin American research Alberto Ramos.
Concerns about economic policy under President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, who took office in December, and uncertainty surrounding U.S. tariff threats and a regional trade deal meant to replace the North American Free Trade Agreement are ""likely to continue to have a negative impact on activity by rendering domestic and foreign investors more defensive,"" Ramos added.
Additionally, gross fixed investment fell 2.7% in May from the previous month in seasonally adjusted terms. It was the fourth month-on-month contraction since Lopez Obrador took office."

Brazil's auto industry is recovering from a crushing depression that cost the country its place as one of the world's five biggest auto markets, even as automakers are still struggling with low margins.
Auto exports to depressed Argentina, Brazil's largest foreign destination for its cars, are down 38.4% so far in 2019 compared to a year ago, Anfavea said.
Trade rules in Brazil are changing under a right-wing government that has promised to open up one of the world's largest but most closed economies. Automakers are figuring out what to do following an initial trade deal with the European Union, as well as changes in trade rules with Mexico, both of which could usher a flood of foreign vehicles into the country.
Anfavea president Luiz Carlos Moraes told reporters on Tuesday that 87.9% of Brazil's auto market is fulfilled with domestically-made cars.
He said Brazil already has a lot of competition, but said that automakers struggle with high and complex taxes that Anfavea is pushing to change.
Automakers in Brazil produced some 266,400 new cars and trucks last month, while new vehicle sales totaled 243,600 vehicles, according to Anfavea data.
Compared to a year ago, auto output rose 8.4% percent and sales climbed 12%."
778,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 06, 2019 04:35AM ET</span>",Key Gauge of Japan’s Economy Falls to Lowest Since Early 2010,"(Bloomberg) -- A key measure of Japan’s economy fell to a level not seen since the wake of the financial crisis, adding to concerns about the economy ahead of an October sales-tax hike.
The leading coincident index dropped to 93.3 in June, the lowest since February 2010, the Cabinet Office said Tuesday.
The index is one of Japan’s broadest indicators of current economic activity, drawing on nine measures including industrial output and shipments of consumer durable goods. The Cabinet Office uses it to help determine whether the economy is officially in expansion or recession.
Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has compiled counter-measures to help offset the planned increase in sales tax from 8% to 10%. A similar hike in 2014, from 5% to 8%, sent consumption into a tailspin, driving a 7.1% contraction in GDP for one quarter. Still, Abe has said the planned increase will go ahead unless Japan faces a challenge of similar magnitude to the global financial crisis.
Gross domestic product data, due Friday, is expected to show that Japan’s economy grew again in the second quarter, though at a slower rate than the previous three months. Yet an escalation of the U.S.-China trade war is a threat to global growth, weighing on sentiment in Japan and elsewhere.
Japanese households already are spending the smallest share of their incomes in nearly two decades, according to one gauge. The percentage of income that households spend dropped to 64% in June, the lowest on record in data going back to 2000, the ministry of internal affairs said Tuesday.
Separate data Tuesday showed household spending rose for a seventh month in July compared to a year earlier, but fell 2.8% on a seasonally adjusted basis from a month earlier, its third decline in six months this year.
The reluctance to spend is also reflected in a deteriorating mood. Japan’s consumer confidence fell in July to the lowest level in more than five years, extending the longest downward slide since the financial crisis."
779,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 06, 2019 03:07AM ET</span>",German industrial orders beat expectations in June,"BERLIN (Reuters) - German industrial orders exceeded expectations in June but that was mainly due to a jump in bookings for big-ticket items and the economy ministry said this sector of Europe's biggest economy has not yet reached a turning point. 
The export-oriented German economy, facing headwinds from trade disputes, a cooling global economy and Brexit uncertainty is widely expected to have contracted in the second quarter.
It is being dragged down by the manufacturing sector, which accounts for about a fifth of the economy. 
Contracts for 'Made in Germany' goods rose 2.5% from the previous month, the biggest increase since August 2017, the ministry said, driven by an 8.6% increase in demand from non-euro zone countries. That was supported by bookings for big-ticket items.
That beat a Reuters consensus forecast for a 0.5% increase but the ministry said domestic orders fell by 1.0%. Adjusted for big ticket items, orders overall would have fallen by 0.4%.
It also said while the downward trend in industrial orders had slowed noticeably in the second quarter, sentiment indicators pointed to no economic turning point for industry just yet.
""The decent increase in June is good news, but is no cause for immediate celebration. In view of the trade conflicts, humility is required,"" said Thomas Gitzel, economist at VP Bank.

He added that the decline in domestic orders rather pointed to a recession in Germany.

780,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 06, 2019 02:40AM ET</span>","Australia's central bank holds rates, sees low for longer","By Swati Pandey and Wayne Cole
SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia's central bank held rates at an all-time low of 1% on Tuesday as it weighed the impact of past easing, though markets are wagering the tide of policy stimulus sweeping the world will compel it to cut again before year-end.
The Reserve Bank of Australia's (RBA) quarter-point cuts in June and July have, in reality, struggled to gain traction in the face of hard-pressed consumers at home and global uncertainty cast by the Sino-U.S. trade dispute.
RBA Governor Philip Lowe acknowledged there might be more to do after its monthly board meeting, adding it was ""reasonable"" to expect lower for longer interest rates to help boost employment growth and inflation.
Futures are pricing in a cut to 0.75% by October <0#YIB:>, and 0.5% by early next year.
""You do get the sense that if they are concerned about the unemployment rate going in an upward trajectory they will move again,"" said JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM) economist Ben Jarman.
JPMorgan expects the RBA will pause this year before resuming easing in early 2020. 
The RBA will issue updated economic forecasts this Friday and Lowe offered a taster on the outlook, noting that consumer prices would stay subdued for a long time to come. 
Inflation is not seen reaching the floor of the RBA's 2% to 3% target band over 2020. The jobless rate is also not seen hitting the RBA's aspirational 4.5% target over the next two years.
Governor Lowe will appear before a parliamentary economics committee on Friday where he will field questions from lawmakers on the economy and the future course of monetary policy. 
Lowe has already taken what is seen as a step toward forward guidance by saying it was ""reasonable to expect that an extended period of low interest rates will be required in Australia.""
This tactic has been used by many central banks to put downward pressure on both long-term borrowing costs and their currencies.
The ploy has had some success with Australia's 10-year bond yield (AU10YT=RR) diving 21 basis points in just the past month to hit an historic trough of 0.993%.
The local currency  has shed 1.2% in the same period to touch seven-month lows at $0.6748, a huge boost to export earnings from resources which are priced in U.S. dollars.
TRADE BOOM AMID THE GLOOM
Data out Tuesday showed the country's trade surplus ballooned to a record A$8 billion ($5.43 billion) in June capping easily the best quarter on record for exports.
Australia may have even enjoyed its first quarterly current account surplus since 1975, lessening its reliance on foreign funding at a time when global markets are stressed and providing scope for some fiscal stimulus.
""We do think...there will be capacity for fiscal policy at some point,"" JPMorgan's Jarman noted. ""That will certainly take some pressure off the RBA but we don't think that's coming anytime soon."" 
Economists are unsure whether Australia can maintain its strong trade position in the face of a sudden flare-up in Sino-U.S. trade tensions, which is prompting a new round of global policy easing.
New Zealand's central bank is considered certain to cut its rates on Wednesday while markets are now pricing in 115 basis points of easing from the Federal Reserve out to the end of next year. 
There was no mention in the RBA's statement of the most recent tariff war escalation. But Lowe will likely be asked about the impact from trade war at his Friday testimony while Deputy Governor Guy Debelle speaks on ""Risks To Outlook"" next week.
""Given Governor Lowe’s previous concerns about adverse trade developments, Australia’s stronger external position and resilience in key exports to key export destinations is a marginal argument in favor of stable monetary policy right now,"" Citi economist Josh Williamson said.
""However, we aren't expecting further gains in the trade surplus and instead expect some moderation in the second half of the year,"" he added.
""Regardless, domestic labor market developments are likely to be the key behind ongoing RBA policy discussions going forward outside of the risk of negative global shocks.""

781,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 06, 2019 01:43AM ET</span>",Australia's trade surplus swells to record in rare bright spot,"By Wayne Cole
SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia's trade surplus swelled to historic highs in June and likely gifted the country its first current account surplus since the 1970s, a timely buffer as the world descends ever closer to an all-out trade war.
Continued strength in resource exports also looked to have made a critical contribution to economic activity in the June quarter, helping offset weakness in household spending.
""Given the recent weakness in the domestic economy, net trade was probably the main driver of GDP growth in the second quarter,"" said Ben Udy, an economist at Capital Economics. ""It provided a glimmer of hope amidst the bleak domestic outlook.""
That gave a lift to the embattled local dollar, which bounced to $0.6780 from a seven-month trough of $0.6748. It was also likely welcome news for the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) as it meets to decide whether to ease again.
Investors assume the central bank will stay at 1% after cuts in both June and July, but are also wagering that further easing is inevitable given the risks to global growth from the escalating Sino-U.S. trade dispute.
Futures are now almost fully priced for a move to 0.75% in October and to 0.5% early next year, and Tuesday's stellar data had scant impact on that outlook.
The Australian Bureau of Statistics reported the trade surplus had jumped 30% to A$8 billion ($5.43 billion) in June, far above forecasts of A$6 billion.
Exports rose 1% on high prices for iron ore - the country's single biggest earner - and a revival in coal shipments.
Prices for iron ore have surged this year as supply disruptions hit shipments from Brazil and policy stimulus by Beijing supported demand for steel.
If there was a downside it was that a 4% fall in imports suggested softness in domestic consumption and investment.
For the whole second quarter, the surplus ballooned by over A$5 billion to stand at a record A$19.8 billion.
""This opens up the possibility of a current account surplus for the June quarter,"" said Westpac economist Andrew Hanlan. ""If so, that would be the first since the June quarter of 1975.""
Such an outcome essentially means Australia is relying less on foreign savings and funding more of its own consumption and investment, a useful buffer at times of market stress.

782,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 06, 2019 01:43AM ET</span>",Japan's June household spending firm but real wages cloud outlook,"By Kaori Kaneko and Daniel Leussink
TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's household spending rose for a seventh straight month in June, amid signs resilient consumer activity could help counter the effects of weak global demand, although the consumption outlook was clouded by softer wages.
The Bank of Japan is hopeful that a pick-up in private consumption will help it achieve its 2% inflation target even as an intensifying U.S.-China trade war hurts exports and business sentiment.
Household spending rose 2.7% in June from a year earlier, nearly double the median forecast for a 1.4% gain, government data showed on Tuesday.
In May, spending rose at the fastest pace in four years, in a sign improving domestic demand would offer some support for an economy facing growing external pressure.
From the previous month, household spending declined 2.8% in June, which compared with a median estimate for a 3.0% drop.
""Consumer spending improved in the second quarter, especially in the service sector, from the previous quarter. The employment situation is recovering, so private spending is firm,"" said Hiroaki Mutou, chief economist at Tokai Tokyo Research Institute.
""But wage recovery is subdued, so consumer spending is not strong enough to boost the growth.""
The government maintained its view that ""consumer spending is picking up"".
Spending on service items, such as domestic package tours, accommodation and air and rail travel, contributed to the growth in the household spending, the data showed.
There were some areas of concern about the outlook. Separate data showed real wages in Japan adjusted for inflation slipped for a sixth straight month in June, which could undermine domestic consumption ahead of a planned sales tax hike in October.
Japan plans to increase the sales tax to 10% this October, unless there is an economic shock on the scale of the collapse of Lehman Brothers, officials say.
Some policymakers worry the tax hike would further damage consumer sentiment and hurt an economy already under pressure from the U.S.-China trade war and slowing global demand.
The BOJ last week held off expanding stimulus but committed to doing so ""without hesitation"" if a global slowdown jeopardizes the country's economic recovery.
Recent yen appreciation and falls in share prices could fuel speculation for further central bank monetary easing.
U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said on Monday the government had determined that China was manipulating its currency, which knocked the dollar and Wall Street share prices sharply lower.
The dollar stood around 106.20 yen after slipping to as far as around 105.50 yen on Tuesday while Tokyo share prices also (N225) tumbled.
Japan's economic growth likely slowed in April-June as cooling global demand and trade tensions weighed on exports, but brisk domestic demand offset some of the external pressure, a Reuters poll showed.
The government will announce the growth data on Friday."
783,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 06, 2019 12:05AM ET</span>",Australia's Trade Surplus Swells to Fresh Record as Imports Drop,"(Bloomberg) -- Australia’s trade surplus rocketed to a fresh record in June as iron ore receipts pushed even higher and a falling international oil price lopped a chunk off imports.
The windfall swelled to A$8 billion ($5.4 billion), a third higher than May’s upwardly revised A$6.2 billion, data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics showed Tuesday. Iron ore sales climbed to A$9.5 billion, almost A$4 billion more than in January. Imports dropped 4% in the month as fuel and lubricants declined, as well as civil aircraft and industrial transport equipment.
But June could mark trade’s peak as iron ore has fallen into a bear market with the end of a supply crunch, due to output resuming in Brazil and Chinese steel mills pulling back from record production. The spot price has dropped to $99.50 a ton, down 20% from the five-year peak hit last month, and is being pummeled as the U.S.-China trade war morphs into a currency battle.
Bulk commodities have been “battered by the rising trade tensions,” Australia & New Zealand Banking Group Ltd. said. The tensions have hit when signs of rising supply are worrying the market, it said, referring to Vale SA’s plan to bring back more of the capacity that was suspended after a dam burst.
The windfall has helped Australia’s government forecast a budget surplus this fiscal year; yet with iron ore’s surge in recent months it may turn out to have already achieved that in the 12 months through June. The nation hasn’t earned more than it spent since before the financial crisis in late 2008.
Another potential milestone could be the economy’s first current-account surplus since the 1970s, with second-quarter data due Sept. 3."

Real wages dropped 0.5% in June from a year earlier, labor ministry data showed on Tuesday, after a downwardly revised 1.3% annual decline in May.
Monthly wage data showed nominal total cash earnings in June increased 0.4%, climbing for the first time since last December after a revised 0.5% decline in May.
Regular pay, which accounts for the bulk of monthly wages, also rose for the first time since December, edging up 0.1%.
One-off special payments were up 0.9% in June from a year earlier, after dropping a revised 0.4% in May.
Overtime pay was 0.2% lower in June from a year earlier, falling again after growing a revised 0.9% in May.
Revelations this year that labor ministry officials used faulty polling methods which forced revisions cast doubt on the accuracy of the ministry's wage data from 2004 to 2017.
The error has made it harder to gauge the actual strength of wage growth.
Japan is scheduled to raise its sales tax to 10% from 8% in October. The last sales tax hike in April 2014 hit consumers hard and triggered a deep downturn.
Solid domestic consumption has partly offset the drag on the world's third-largest economy from weak exports."

The industry figures add to signs of slowing demand from households, the one sector of the economy which has held up relatively well since June 2016's vote to leave the European Union, helped by rising employment and wages.
The British Retail Consortium, which represents major high-street chains and supermarkets, said annual total sales growth picked up to 0.3% in July after contracting by 1.3% in June and 2.7% in May.
""While any growth is welcome after two months of decline, it's clear that most players need more than sunshine to get back on their feet,"" Paul Martin, UK head of retail at survey sponsor KPMG, said. 
The BRC said July spending growth was the lowest for that month since 1995, and especially modest given record temperatures had followed a rainy June, which would normally spur extra purchases on summer clothes and barbecue food.
Last year, the men's soccer World Cup and generally good weather boosted spending, adding to tough year-on-year comparisons in recent months.
Barclaycard reported a similar trend in its monthly consumer spending data, which showed 1.7% growth, the fastest since April but still relatively subdued.
The one bright spot was spending on cinema tickets - up 15% on a year earlier - which Barclaycard attributed to the popularity of Disney films ""The Lion King"" and ""Toy Story 4"".
""Underlying uncertainty about the wider economic and political landscape (is) causing many to hold off making purchases on bigger-ticket items,"" Barclaycard director Esme Harwood said.
New British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said last month he was committed to taking Britain out of the European Union on Oct. 31, even if that meant leaving without a deal - something businesses fear would cause major disruption.
Barclaycard said the proportion of consumers who said they still felt comfortable making big purchases had dropped to 54% from 60% over the course of a month, while job loss fears had risen to the highest in more than two years.

New car sales suffered their biggest July fall since 2012, motor industry data showed on Monday, and Britain's biggest private-sector employer, supermarket chain  Tesco  (LON:TSCO), said it was cutting 4,500 jobs on top of several thousand earlier this year.

786,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 05, 2019 12:43PM ET</span>",U.S. services sector slows; orders hit three-year low,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. services sector activity slowed in July as new orders dropped to their lowest level in three years, suggesting the economy lost further momentum early in the third quarter.
The report from the Institute for Supply Management (ISM) added to last week's data showing a slowdown in hiring and prolonged weakness in manufacturing in July.
These reports, together with an escalation in the trade war between the United States and China, suggest the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates gain next month to sustain the 10-year economic expansion, the longest in history. The U.S. central bank last week cut its short-term rate citing rising risks to the economy from trade tensions and weakening global growth.
""The trade war was already inflicting damage to the economy, and now it has been ramped up,"" said Jennifer Lee, a senior economist at BMO Capital Markets in Toronto. ""The Fed will step in again, likely in October but possibly sooner, but there is only so much already-low rates can do.""
The ISM said its non-manufacturing activity index fell 1.4 percentage points to a reading of 53.7. It was the second straight monthly decline in the index. A reading above 50 indicates expansion in the sector, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the services index would slip to a reading of 55.5 in July. The ISM reported last week that factory activity slowed to a three-year low in July, noting that ""trade remains a significant issue.""
President Donald Trump on Thursday announced an additional 10% tariff on $300 billion worth of Chinese imports starting Sept. 1. China let the yuan breach the key 7-per-dollar level on Monday for the first time in more than a decade.
The deterioration in the trade relations between the two economic giants pressured financial markets. The dollar (DXY) dropped against a basket of currencies. Stocks on Wall Street tumbled.
Treasury prices rose, with the gap between the three-month Treasury bill rate and 10-year yields jumping nearly 27 basis points, the widest since April 2007. This curve ""inversion"" between the two maturities has preceded every U.S. recession in the past 50 years.
SLOWING ECONOMY
Economists said last month's slowdown in the services industry measure was consistent with slowing economic growth.
""Although today's reading is consistent with the deceleration that we have been anticipating for some time with the waning of fiscal stimulus and tighter financial conditions, the weaker-than-expected reading hints that tepid growth in the trade-exposed goods sector may be spilling into domestic demand,"" said Jonathan Millar, an economist at  Barclays  (LON:BARC).
The economy grew at a 2.1% annualized rate in the second quarter, down from a 3.1% pace in the January-March quarter. Growth estimates for the third quarter are around a 1.5% rate. The economy is slowing largely as the stimulus from last year's $1.5 trillion tax cut fades.
The ISM described the pace of growth in the services sector as continuing ""to cool off, noting ""ongoing concerns related to tariffs and employment resources.""
The ISM's services sector measure of new orders fell to a reading of 54.1 last month, its lowest since August 2016, from 55.8 in June. A gauge of new export orders dropped to 53.5 in July from a reading of 55.5 in June.
There was also a further deceleration in prices paid for materials and services, pointing to benign inflation. But a measure of services industry employment increased to a reading of 56.2 in July from 55.0 June. This suggests job growth will likely remain solid, even though the pace of hiring is slowing.
The economy created 164,000 jobs in July, pulling back from the 193,000 positions added in June, the government reported on Friday.
According to the ISM, 13 non-manufacturing industries reported growth in July, including accommodation and food services, utilities and professional. The five industries reporting a decline included retail trade, wholesale trade and educational services.
The construction industry said ""tariffs continue to push costs higher, and customers are looking for more discounts due to mortgage rate fluctuations. Respondents in the public administration sector described demand as ""strong"" but also complained about ""pressures for skilled labor.""
While a separate survey from data firm Markit offered an upbeat assessment of the nonmanufacturing industry in July, service providers were less optimistic about the future.
""With trade tensions escalating over the past few days since the end of July, we think further weakening in business sentiment is likely, although upcoming policy actions remain uncertain,"" said Daniel Silver, an economist at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) in New York."

The Institute for Supply Management (ISM) said its non-manufacturing activity index fell to 53.7 from 55.1 the month before. Analysts polled by Reuters had forecast a reading of 55.5 for July.
A reading above 50 indicates expansion in the sector.
Slower growth in the services sector, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, comes at a time that the U.S.-China trade war has been squeezing manufacturers.

LONDON (Reuters) - Euro zone business growth hit a wall in July as demand crumbled, according to a survey which showed a deepening downturn in manufacturing is increasingly affecting the bloc's dominant services industry.
Last month the European Central Bank all but promised to ease policy further as the bloc's growth outlook deteriorates and Monday's survey will do little to sway market expectations for loosening.
IHS Markit's Euro Zone Composite Final Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI), considered a good measure of overall economic health, dropped to 51.5 in July from June's 52.2, moving closer to the 50 mark separating growth from contraction.
""They weren't a massive surprise, the composite PMI was left unrevised. There was no worsening in growth but it remains pretty weak,"" said Jack Allen-Reynolds at Capital Economics.
Markets ignored the PMI data and instead focused on an escalation of a trade war between the United States and China which drove the yuan to its lowest levels in over a decade on Monday.
The dispute poses the biggest threat to global growth, Reuters polls have found, and in another escalation China on Friday said it would fight back against U.S. President Donald Trump's abrupt decision to impose 10% tariffs on the remaining $300 billion in Chinese imports.
Those headwinds hurt manufacturers and figures last week showed factory activity contracted in July at its fastest rate in six years.
That factory malaise is now having a greater effect on services and a PMI for the industry fell to 53.2 from 53.6 the month before and below the flash reading of 53.3.
BREAKDOWN
Italy was alone amongst the bloc's four biggest economies where the PMI rose, offering some hope of a timid recovery there but activity in Germany's private sector hit its weakest level in more than six years, suggesting Europe's largest economy started the third quarter on a weak footing.
""The economic weakness in the currency union is still concentrated in Germany and Italy. While Italy's PMI edged up in July it was still very weak and pointing to only a small increase in GDP,"" Allen-Reynolds said.
Growth also slipped in France and Spain.
However in Britain, gearing up to split from the European Union, growth unexpectedly accelerated to a nine-month high in July, possibly soothing some worries about whether the country is slipping into recession before Brexit.
Forward-looking indicators suggested there won't be a turnaround anytime soon and demand for services in the euro zone waned, hit by falling new export business -- which includes trade between member countries in the bloc. The sub-index dropped to 49.2 from 49.4.
That had an effect on broader optimism and a composite future output index fell to 58.8 from 59.2, its lowest reading since October 2014.
With the outlook gloomy -- affected by trade war worries, slowing sales growth and Brexit woes -- IHS Markit said the PMI indicated third-quarter economic growth of only around 0.1%, slower than the 0.3% predicted in a Reuters poll last month.
""Poor survey and hard data prints recently, along with the announcement of 10% additional tariffs on Chinese goods imports to the US will likely weigh on investor sentiment for the euro area in August,"" RBC economists told clients."

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's dominant services sector unexpectedly perked up in July, a major survey showed on Monday, but this did little to shift fears that Brexit risks and U.S.-China trade tensions are pushing the economy close to recession.
The IHS Markit/CIPS UK Services Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) rose to a nine-month high of 51.4 from 50.2 in June, above all forecasts in a Reuters poll of economists that had pointed to an unchanged reading.
Despite the improvement, the services PMI stands well below its long-run average and a composite PMI also including last week's weak manufacturing and construction numbers only just rose above the 50 mark that divides growth from contraction.
Services account for about 80% of British economic output, though the UK PMI does not cover retailers or public services.
A PMI for the euro zone services sector fell short of expectations but still beat its British equivalent.
""We expect growth below trend until Brexit is resolved, but see a robust labour market and resilient consumer -- reflected in today's modest beat,""  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) economists Jacob Nell and Bruna Skarica said.
The Bank of England expects official data on Friday to show growth in the world's fifth-largest economy slowed to zero in the three months to June, as the boost from premature Brexit preparations in early 2019 fades.
The start of the third quarter looks little better, with worries mounting that Prime Minister Boris Johnson is seriously considering taking Britain out of the European Union on Oct. 31 without a transition deal, risking major economic disruption.
Even without a chaotic Brexit, the BoE sees a one-in-three chance the economy will be shrinking in year-on-year terms by early next year.
Car sales fell to their lowest since 2012 in July, adding to woes for a sector that says it will be one of the hardest hit by a no-deal Brexit that would sever pan-European supply chains.
Sterling weakened to its lowest in nearly two years against the euro (EURGBP=) on Monday, while 10-year British government bond yields (GB10YT=RR) fell to an all-time low below 0.5%, with little immediate reaction to the data.
The low level of bond yields reflects increased trade tensions between the United States and China as much as Brexit, and this adds to challenges for British companies, though IHS Markit said some firms reported help from the weaker currency.
The survey showed the fastest influx of new export orders since September 2018.
Not all services companies benefited equally, and activity at business services companies contracted at a rate exceeded only once in the past 10 years.
""The overall picture is one of an economy that is only just managing to skirt recession, with July's performance among the worst since the height of the global financial crisis in 2009,"" said Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit."

The Sentix research group said its investor sentiment index for the euro zone dropped to -13.7 in August from -5.8 in July, far below the -7.7 analysts had forecast.
Expectations fell to -20.0 from -13.0, their lowest since August 2012, when the euro zone debt crisis was in full swing.
European Central Bank President Mario Draghi promised in July 2012 to do ""whatever it takes"" to save the euro, a pledge that is widely credited with holding the bloc together.
""As the end of Draghi's time in office nears, economic expectations have again reached a point where Draghi felt obliged to give his 'whatever it takes' speech,"" Sentix director Patrick Hussy said.
In July the ECB revamped its interest rate guidance and asked its staff to prepare options for more policy easing, explicitly opening the door to a rate cut and more bond purchases as soon as September. The U.S. Federal Reserve cut interest rates last week .
""Measures announced by central banks have not turned economic expectations around,"" Hussy said.
A sub-index for Germany tumbled to -13.7, its weakest since August 2009, from -4.8. Sentix said dependence on exports and concern over China was a burden for Europe's largest economy, as a dispute over tariffs dragged on longer than many had hoped.
""A recession in Germany is preprogrammed,"" Hussy said.

ROME (Reuters) - Italy's economy may be set for a modest recovery in the next few months, two surveys suggested on Monday, giving the government some breathing space as it prepares a challenging 2020 budget in the autumn.
The euro zone's third-largest economy has been broadly stagnant for the last five quarters, and gross domestic product was flat in the second quarter on both a quarter-on-quarter and a year-on-year basis, data showed last week.
Things may be about to improve, however, national statistics bureau ISTAT said on Monday, citing its leading indicator for July, while a separate survey of service sector activity showed a significant improvement in the same month.
Confidence improved last month among both firms and consumers, who are more upbeat about prospects for the economy and jobs, ISTAT said in its monthly economic bulletin.
Its composite leading indicator ""has interrupted the downward trend (that was) in place since the end of last year, pointing to a scenario of a slight improvement in production levels,"" the statistics bureau said.
Italy's labor market has been picking up for several months, despite the stagnant economy.
The jobless rate fell to 9.7% in June, below expectations and the lowest reading since January 2012, while the employment rate increased to the highest on record, ISTAT said last week.
Italy's services sector grew for a second month running in July and by more than expected, IHS Markit's closely watched survey of purchasing managers showed on Monday.
The group's Business Activity Index for services rose to 51.7 in July from 50.5 in June, climbing further above the 50 threshold that separates growth from contraction and posting its highest reading since March.
A Reuters survey of eight analysts had forecast a reading of 50.6.
The government of the anti-establishment 5-Star Movement and the right-wing League has promised sweeping tax cuts next year, a pledge that will be difficult to square with its commitment to the European Commission to keep a lid on the budget deficit.
While there have been signs of improvement in services and employment, the manufacturing sector continues to struggle.
IHS Markit's sister survey for manufacturing, published last week, showed activity contracting for a tenth month running in July, and at roughly the same rate as in June.
The government's most recent official forecast sees full-year 2019 GDP growth of just 0.2%, leaving Italy in its customary position among the euro zone's most sluggish economies."

The final Jibun Bank Japan Services Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) edged down to 51.8 from 51.9 in June on a seasonally adjusted basis, staying above the 50 threshold that separates contraction from expansion for the 34th month.
""There were some signs that the underlying services economy was beginning to lose momentum, with employment and new business growth both easing,"" said Joe Hayes, economist at IHS Markit, which compiles the survey.
""Optimism moderated as some firms were concerned that the looming consumption tax hike could impact demand.""
Japan is scheduled to raise its sales tax to 10% from 8% in October.
Policymakers are hoping domestic demand will help offset external pressures that have increased on the back of slowing global growth and the prolonged and intensifying trade war between China and the United States.
Latest survey data showed employment increased for a 33rd month, but the pace of increase was the slowest since October.
Business expectations slipped to a 23-month low of 52.9, while new business at Japanese service providers was at a one-year low amid reports of subdued sales at some companies.
The composite PMI, which includes both manufacturing and services, edged up to 51.2 from 50.8 in the previous month.
Manufacturing survey data last week showed that factory activity deteriorated for a third month in July as the world's third-largest economy felt the pinch from slowing overseas demand, which has hit exports, industrial production, and business confidence.
Japan's cabinet on Friday approved a plan to remove South Korea from a list of countries that enjoy minimum export controls, a move likely to heighten tensions between the neighboring countries.
""With the escalation of Japan-Korea tensions, softening growth in services in the run-up to the sales tax increase could see recession risks become increasingly greater,"" said IHS Markit's Hayes."
794,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 05, 2019 05:17AM ET</span>",U.K. Services Growth Can’t Prevent Economic Stagnation in July,"(Bloomberg) -- The U.K.’s dominant services industry unexpectedly grew at the fastest pace in nine months in July, but the expansion may not be enough to rescue the economy from stagnation.
IHS Markit said its Purchasing Managers Index for the sector rose to 51.4 last month, the highest since October. Still, the rate of growth remains “much softer” than the average over the past decade, and taken together with measures showing contractions in manufacturing and construction, indicates the economy remained flat, Markit said.
“The overall picture is one of an economy that is only just managing to skirt recession, with July’s performance among the worst since the height of the global financial crisis in 2009,” said Chris Williamson, chief business economist at Markit.“ The latest PMI numbers are indicative of the economy stagnating at the start of the third quarter.”
July’s surveys are the latest to show the impact Brexit uncertainty is having on the economy, while worse could be ahead. Boris Johnson’s election as prime minister last month has ratcheted up concern over a potentially damaging no-deal exit, sending the pound tumbling.
Even with a Brexit deal, the future may not be rosy. The Bank of England, which bases its forecasts on a smooth departure from the European Union, last week lowered its prediction for 2019 growth, and said it sees weak business investment persisting into 2020.
A measure of new work in the drove the improvement in services in July, Markit said, although the firm also noted “widespread reports” that Brexit uncertainty and economic concerns were encouraging clients to delay spending decisions.
Meanwhile, business optimism slipped to its lowest level since March, with firms citing domestic political uncertainty and concerns about the global economic outlook. Still, some noted hopes that demand could recover if there was clarity about the U.K.’s future outside of the EU."

The Caixin/Markit services purchasing managers' index (PMI) slipped to 51.6, the lowest reading since February, from June's 52.0. The 50-point mark divides growth from contraction, and the overall service index has shown expansion every month since it was started in 2005.
In July, a sub-index for new export orders placed with Chinese services firms swung back to expansion at a three-month high of 54.0, compared with 49.5 in the previous month. Caixin/Markit said survey respondents commented that strong demand across international markets supported the latest upturn in new work from abroad.
Overall new business remained largely stable, though the sub-index dipped slightly to 53.2 from 53.4 in June, suggesting a string of government support measures for the economy over the last year were propping up domestic demand.
""In general, China's economy showed signs of recovery in July, thanks to large-scale tax and fee cuts, as well as ongoing support from monetary policy and government-driven infrastructure investment,"" said Zhengsheng Zhong, director of macroeconomic analysis at CEBM Group, in a statement accompanying the Caixin release.
The survey showed business confidence for the year ahead remained unchanged from June's level, though some companies expect that relatively weak market conditions in the coming months could weigh on demand.
Employment in the sector increased at a slightly faster pace than in June. The employment index has shown expansion every month since September.
Chinese service providers also registered a solid rise in cost burdens last month, due to higher prices for materials, staff and fuel, outpacing the prices charged, as a number of firms indicated competitive market conditions had dampened overall pricing power.
Separately, an official gauge last week showed non-manufacturing activity grew at its slowest pace in eight months in July.
The intensifying trade dispute between the United States and China has broadened beyond tariffs on goods to other areas of such as the fast growing telecommunications equipment and services sector.
Beijing has been counting on a strong services sector to pick up the slack as exports falter and manufacturers shed jobs, due to rising labor costs and the trade war.

Car sales by Japanese automakers in South Korea slumped 32% in July from the prior month, after a trade spat between the countries turned increasingly acrimonious.
Honda Motor Co.’s vehicle registrations dropped 42%, while Toyota Motor Corp. saw a decline of 38%, according to data from the Korea Automobile Importers & Distributors Association (KAIDA). Even so, Japanese car sales from January through July are up 6.7% from a year earlier.
Consumers in South Korea have boycotted some Japanese travel and consumer products in response to Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s restrictions on sales to South Korea of materials for high-tech components. A drop in automobile sales suggests South Koreans are becoming increasingly willing to halt spending on big-ticket items because of the spat.
Yoon Dae-sung, vice chairman of KAIDA, said in a statement that the beginning of the holiday season and “decline of some brands” weighed on an increase in volumes and introduction of new cars. He didn’t single out any manufacturers or countries of origin.
“We cannot ignore the consequences of political issues between Japan and Korea that might lead to the sales downturn in Korea,” said Yoshiaki Kawano, an auto analyst at IHS Markit. He added that the market in South Korea hasn’t been doing well due to the sluggish economy, which has hurt sales of domestic vehicles and imports despite government efforts to reduce taxes on vehicles.
Total imported car sales in South Korea rose 0.3% in July from the prior month. Mercedes-Benz sales rose 11% in the period, while BMW gained 14%. South Korea is Japan’s third-largest export market, worth 5.79 trillion yen ($54.7 billion) in trade last year.“
“Various market factors have an influence sales, and it can’t be said completely that the recent Japan-Korea relationship is the main reason for the decline in sales,” said Kayo Doi, a spokeswoman for Toyota. A representative for Honda didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.
Last week, Japan removed its trading partner from a list of trusted export destinations, and said the measure will take effect Aug. 28. South Korea fired back by saying it would take Japan off of its easy-trade list.
The latest flare-up between the countries happened after South Korean courts seized assets belonging to Japanese companies they held liable for cases of forced labor during the 1910-1945 period of colonization. Although Abe has denied that the export controls are retaliation, the spat has fanned nationalistic sentiments in both countries."
797,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 02, 2019 12:26PM ET</span>","U.S. economy is adding plenty of jobs, but not hours for workers","By Jason Lange
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. economy is adding lots of jobs, but a drop in the number of hours at work points to a dimmer outlook for economic growth as businesses brace for an escalating trade war with China.
Many economists think the economy only needs to add about 100,000 jobs a month to keep up with new entrants to the workforce. So data released on Friday showing 164,000 jobs were added in July suggests the historically low jobless rate might fall further.
That is, as long as the economy doesn't go into a recession.
The Labor Department's employment report for July showed an index of hours worked across the economy fell 0.2% in July. The index, which economists treat as an early indicator of economic growth, has been cooling for much of this year.
So far, this reading might only point to slower growth, rather than a sharp turn toward economic contraction. https://tmsnrt.rs/336RHbk ""The slowing is taking place in a gradual and unthreatening fashion,"" said Michael Feroli, an economist at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM).
But there are worrisome signs in the economy. A significant part of the weakness in hours worked came from the manufacturing sector, which is particularly exposed to an escalating trade war with China.
President Donald Trump has raised tariffs on nearly half of China's imports to the United States, and on Thursday he said he planned to slap a 10% tariff on the remainder starting in September. The trade war has already led to Chinese retaliatory tariffs on U.S. exports, and Beijing on Friday vowed to respond with more punitive measures if Trump pushed ahead with the new tariffs. The trade tensions are weighing on the global economy as well.
That is hitting American factories, where the number of hours worked in July was actually smaller than the same month last year.
GRAPHIC: Manufacturing jobs - https://tmsnrt.rs/2KlWDkg
The trade war is happening at the same time that the main driver of the U.S. economy - consumer spending - has stayed strong. This has helped the U.S. labor market continue to improve, even among workers who have been slower to see the fruits of the recovery from America's 2007-2009 recession.
In July, the number of workers who couldn't get full-time hours because of the economy fell below 4,000 for the first time since 2006. The number of unemployed Americans who have been looking for work at least 27 weeks fell to its lowest level since 2007.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. job growth slowed in July and manufacturers slashed hours for workers, which together with an escalation in trade tensions between the United States and China could give the Federal Reserve ammunition to cut interest rates again next month.
The Labor Department's closely watched monthly employment report on Friday came a day after President Donald Trump announced an additional 10% tariff on $300 billion worth of Chinese imports starting Sept. 1, a move that led financial markets to almost fully price in a rate cut in September.
The U.S. central bank on Wednesday cut its short-term interest rate for the first time since 2008. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell described the widely anticipated 25-basis-point monetary policy easing as insurance against downside risks to the 10-year old economic expansion, the longest in history, from trade tensions and slowing global growth.
""There has been some slowing, and yesterday's tariff announcement suggests more trade-related weakening in the months ahead,"" said Jim O'Sullivan, chief U.S. economist at High Frequency Economics in White Plains, New York. ""We still expect the Fed to ease again at the September meeting.""
Nonfarm payrolls increased by 164,000 jobs last month, the government said. The economy created 41,000 fewer jobs in May and June than previously reported. July's job gains were in line with economists' expectations. 
The average workweek fell to its lowest level in nearly two years in July as manufacturers reduced hours for workers, a sign that economic growth slowed further early in the third quarter. 
The U.S.-China trade war is taking a toll on manufacturing, with production declining for two straight quarters. Business investment has also been hit, contracting in the second quarter for the first time in more than three years and contributing to holding back the economy to a 2.1% annualized growth rate. The economy grew at a 3.1% pace in the first quarter. 
The White House's ""America First"" policies are also restricting trade flows. A separate report from the Commerce Department on Friday showed sharp declines in both imports and exports in June, leading the trade deficit to dip 0.3% to $55.2 billion during the month.
The July payrolls marked a further deceleration in job growth from an average of 223,000 per month in 2018. Economists say it is unclear whether the loss of momentum in hiring was due to ebbing demand for labor or a shortage of qualified workers.
Still, the pace of job growth remains well above the roughly 100,000 needed per month to keep up with growth in the working-age population. The unemployment rate was unchanged at 3.7% in July as 370,000 people entered the labor force. 
Despite the lowest jobless rate in nearly 50 years, wage gains remain moderate, contributing to a tame inflation environment, which could be supportive of a rate cut next month. Inflation has undershot the Fed's 2% target this year, rising 1.6% on a year-on-year basis in June after a 1.5% gain in May. 
Average hourly earnings rose 8 cents, or 0.3%, in July, after the same increase in June. That lifted the annual increase in wages to 3.2% in July from 3.1% in June. The trend in wage gains has slowed from late 2018 when wages were rising at their fastest rate in a decade.
Fed funds futures implied traders saw a roughly 94% chance of the Fed cutting rates again next month, according to CME Group's FedWatch tool. 
Prices of U.S. Treasuries were trading higher while the dollar (DXY) was weaker against a basket of currencies. U.S. stocks fell.
SLOWING ECONOMY
Even with the step-down in employment growth and moderate wage gains, the labor market is supporting the economy as the stimulus from last year's $1.5 trillion tax cut package fades.
Economic growth in the third quarter is seen at around a 1.5% rate. The labor force participation rate, or the proportion of working-age Americans who have a job or are looking for one, rose to 63.0% in July from 62.9% in June. 
A broader measure of unemployment, which includes people who want to work but have given up searching and those working part-time because they cannot find full-time employment, fell two-tenths of a percentage point to 7.0% last month, the lowest level since December 2000.
Construction payrolls increased by 4,000 jobs after shooting up by 18,000 in June. Manufacturing employment rose by 16,000 jobs after increasing by 12,000 in June. The strong manufacturing job gains are at odds with weakening activity in the sector. A survey on Thursday showed manufacturing employment hit its lowest level since November 2016 in July.
The weakness was underscored by another report on Friday from the Commerce Department showing factory orders rising less than expected in June and unfilled orders shrinking further.
The sector, which accounts for more than 12% of the U.S. economy, is being hobbled by trade tensions, weakening global growth, an inventory bulge - concentrated in the automotive industry - and design problems at aerospace giant  Boeing Co  (N:BA). Factory workers put in fewer hours last month.
The manufacturing workweek dropped 0.3 hour to 40.4 hours, the lowest since November 2011. That contributed to the overall average workweek falling to 34.3 hours, the fewest since September 2017, from 34.4 hours in June.
Factory overtime dropped by 0.2 hour in July to 3.2 hours.
""The drop in aggregate hours suggests production weakened even more than hiring,"" said Chris Low, chief economist at FTN Financial in New York. 
Government employment increased by 16,000 jobs in July, boosted by local government hiring, adding to June's gain of 14,000. Professional and business services employment rose by 38,000 jobs last month. 

There were also increases in healthcare, leisure and hospitality, financial activities and wholesale trade employment. But retail payrolls dropped by 3,600 jobs, declining for a sixth straight month.

Factory goods orders increased 0.6%, boosted by demand for machinery and transportation equipment, the Commerce Department said on Friday. Data for May was revised down to show factory orders falling 1.3% instead of dropping 0.7% as previously reported.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast factory orders would rise 0.8% in June. Shipments of manufactured goods increased 0.4% in June after edging up 0.1% in May. Unfilled orders at factories dropped 0.7% after declining 0.8% in May. Inventories rose 0.2% after the same gain in May.
Factory orders increased 0.2% compared to June 2018.
The problems in manufacturing and accompanying weak business investment have caught the attention of Federal Reserve officials. The U.S. central bank on Wednesday cut interest rates for the first time since 2008 to insure against downside risks to the economy from trade tensions and slowing global growth.
Fed Chairman Jerome Powell described manufacturing as ""not growing much,"" saying ""we hope to help that with this rate cut.""
Manufacturing, which accounts for more than 12% of the U.S. economy, has been hamstrung by trade tensions, weakening global growth, an inventory bulge - concentrated in the automotive industry - and design problems at aerospace giant Boeing (N:BA).
A survey on Monday showed a measure of national factory activity dropped to near a three-year low in July, with manufacturers saying ""trade remains a significant issue.""
Transportation equipment orders rebounded 3.7% in June after dropping 7.5% in May. Orders for civilian aircraft and parts soared 75.1% after tumbling 52.0% in May.
The surge in aircraft orders is likely to be short-lived as Boeing has cut production and deliveries of its bestselling MAX 737 aircraft, which was grounded in March after two fatal plane crashes in Indonesia and Ethiopia.
Machinery orders jumped 2.1% after edging up 0.1% in May.
The Commerce Department also said June orders for non-defense capital goods excluding aircraft, which are seen as a measure of business spending plans on equipment, increased 1.5% instead of the 1.9% surge reported last month.
Shipments of core capital goods, which are used to calculate business equipment spending in the gross domestic product report, rose 0.3% in June instead of 0.6% as previously reported."

OTTAWA (Reuters) - Canada posted a narrower trade surplus in June, the second in as many months, despite significant declines in exports and imports of crude oil, aircraft and other transportation equipment, official data showed on Friday. 
Statistics Canada reported a surplus of C$136 million ($103 million) in goods. The agency had reported a trade surplus of $762 million in May but revised that figure downwards on Friday to C$556 million. 
Analysts in a Reuters poll had forecast a trade deficit of C$300 million. Friday marked the first time Canada had posted back-to-back trade surpluses since November and December 2016.

The Canadian dollar held a near six-week low of 1.3248, or 75.48 cents U.S. after the data release.
""It wasn't a great month, but it's been a very strong quarter,"" said Stephen Tapp, deputy chief economist at Export Development Canada. ""Canadian trade is kind of coming back down to earth after a long string of record-setting performance.""
""We're hoping that this one month doesn't make a broader trend,"" he added.
Exports of energy products fell 7.4%, Statscan said, while crude exports were down 8.6% - the first monthly decrease seen this year. Prices declined 13.5% while volumes rose 5.6%.
June's decline, however, remains well above the low reported at the end of last year. Statscan said crude oil exports have more than doubled since the low seen in December 2018, largely because of higher prices. 
Meanwhile, exports of aircraft and other transportation equipment were down 25.1% in June. Exports of aircraft led the decline, falling 40.8%, with fewer commercial aircraft being sent to the United States. 
However, overall second quarter exports of aircraft, Statscan said, were up - rising 39.4% compared to the previous quarter.
Canada also imported fewer aircraft in June, aircraft dropped 54.9%, largely because of fewer imports of airliners from the United States. Meanwhile, energy imports dropped 14.8% - driven largely by lower crude shipments from the United States and Saudi Arabia.
Canada sent 74.8% of its goods exports to the United States in June. Exports to the United States fell 3.9%, largely because of a drop in crude oil, while imports decreased 3.8%. 

As a result, Canada's trade surplus with the United States narrowed slightly in June, to C$5.7 billion from C$5.9 billion in May.

The Commerce Department said on Friday the trade deficit slipped 0.3% to $55.2 billion. Data for May was revised slightly to show the trade gap widening to $55.3 billion instead of the previously reported $55.5 billion.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the trade gap would shrink to $54.6 billion in June.
The goods trade deficit with China decreased 0.8% to $30.0 billion, with imports falling 0.7%. Exports to China were unchanged in June. President Donald Trump on Thursday escalated the trade war with China, announcing an additional 10% tariff on $300 billion worth of Chinese imports starting Sept. 1 after negotiators failed to kick-start trade talks between the world's two largest economies.
The U.S.-China trade tensions have caused wild swings in the trade deficit, with exporters and importers trying to stay ahead of the tariff fight between the two economic giants. The trade deficit with Mexico was the highest on record in June.
In June, goods imports fell 2.2% to $212.3 billion. Imports of consumer goods fell $0.9 billion, pulled down by a $1.4 billion drop in imports of cellphones. Crude oil imports declined $1.4 billion, reflecting cheaper oil.
Goods exports fell 2.8% to $137.1 billion. Exports of consumer goods fell $1.9 billion. There were also decreases in exports of capital goods and motor vehicles.
When adjusted for inflation, the goods trade deficit fell $0.3 billion to $86.1 billion in June. The government reported last week that trade cut 0.65 percentage point from gross domestic product in the second quarter. The economy grew at a 3.1% rate in the April-June quarter."

could soon spill over into other areas of the economy, a survey showed on Friday.
The IHS Markit/CIPS construction Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) rose to 45.3, a less severe contraction than June's 43.1 -which was the weakest reading in more than 10 years - but still well below the 50 level at which growth begins.
Economists polled by Reuters had expected the index to recover more strongly to 46.0.
A sharp drop in new orders - down for four months in a row - meant a quick turnaround was unlikely and confidence in the sector was the lowest since November 2012, IHS Markit said.
""Construction companies have started to respond to lower workloads by cutting back on input buying, staffing numbers and sub-contractor usage,"" Tim Moore, economics associate director at IHS Markit, said.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. investors' inflation expectations were hammered on Thursday, a day after the U.S. Federal Reserve cut interest rates for the first time since 2008, while Chairman Jerome Powell signaled the central bank has not entered an outright easing cycle.
U.S. President Donald Trump's threat of more tariffs on Chinese goods further eroded investors' confidence on whether domestic inflation would ever reach the Fed's 2% goal, analysts said.
The U.S. bond market's gauges of investors' inflation outlook tumbled to their lowest levels in about 6-1/2 weeks.
""They were disappointed. They didn't feel the Fed had their back,"" said Gennadiy Goldberg, senior interest rates strategist at TD Securities.
Powell at a news conference on Wednesday following a two-day policy meeting said, ""Let me be clear – it's not the beginning of a long series of rate cuts.""
In late trading, the yield spread between 10-year Treasury Inflation Protected Securities, or TIPS, and 10-year Treasury notes was 1.691%, down 8 basis points from Wednesday, according to Tradeweb and Refinitiv data.
The 10-year breakeven rate on Thursday touched 1.682%, the lowest level since June 17.
The five-year breakeven rate hit 1.474%, which was also the lowest since mid-June. It finished at 1.483%, down over 9 basis points on the day.
Powell and a number of Fed officials have raised concerns about stubbornly low inflation, which would be a factor for them to consider lowering interest rates.
Some traders had even bet on the central bank cutting rates by half a point on Wednesday instead of the quarter point move the Fed implemented.
""It's with the Fed under-delivering,"" said Subadra Rajappa, head of U.S. rates strategy at  Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN).
Still the interest rates market suggested a high likelihood the Fed would lower rates at its next meeting in September.

In addition to their disappointment over the Fed's mild turn, TIPS holders were wrong-footed by Trump's threat to impose an additional 10% tariff on $300 billion worth of Chinese imports starting on Sept. 1, even as trade talks between the world's two biggest economies continue.
Trump's announcement compounded worries about global trade and inflation. It also sent U.S. benchmark crude prices down 7%, marking their biggest one-day drop in more than four years.
Energy prices are major factors for investors calculating their inflation outlook.

806,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 01, 2019 04:07PM ET</span>",Mexico's dependence on U.S. demand spells trouble for weak economy,"By Sharay Angulo
MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Under the threat of U.S. trade tariffs, Mexico's president has pledged to make his country less reliant on U.S. demand. But exports to its northern neighbor have been one of the few things driving Latin America's second-largest economy this year.
Mexican gross domestic product increased 0.1% in the April-June period from the prior quarter, narrowly averting a recession that would have dealt a major blow to President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador's pledge to rev up the $1.2 trillion economy.
Mexico still sends 80% of its exports to the United States and U.S. demand for its goods has been one of the few recent bright spots on its cloudy economic horizon.
Domestic demand has been modest, and gross fixed investment and foreign direct investment have fallen, the most recent data shows. 
Mexico's main stock index has dropped more than 17% this year, though the peso currency has been stable, bolstered by high interest rates, 
Meanwhile, U.S. manufacturing activity slowed to a near three-year low in July while hiring at factories shifted into lower gear, suggesting a further loss of momentum in economic growth early in the third quarter.
That all spells trouble for a country essentially joined at the hip with the United States, and analysts say Mexico's reliance on U.S. demand could aggravate the risk of a full-blown recession in the coming months.
""Export growth has been the most dynamic component of GDP in 2019 without question,"" said Luis de la Calle, a former Mexican trade official. Without U.S. buyers, Mexico's economy would be facing tougher times than it is already, he said.
Dragged down by mining, construction and energy production, Mexico's industrial output fell 1.6% in the first five months of 2019, versus a year earlier. The only industrial sector bucking the trend was export-oriented manufacturing, which advanced 1.0%.
In dollar terms, exports climbed 4.2% during the first half of 2019 compared with last year, led by robust demand for goods from the automotive and electronic sectors. But the economy as a whole expanded only 0.3% during the first six months of the year.
U.S. President Donald Trump's multibillion-dollar trade war with China has helped propel Mexico to the top of the list of leading U.S. trading partners this year.
The jump came despite threats by Trump to slap tariffs on all Mexican exports if Mexico did not contain increasing illegal immigration to the United States from Central America.
Since then, Lopez Obrador has repeatedly stressed the importance of making Mexico more self-sufficient economically so it cannot be held hostage to threats from abroad.
The left-wing populist, who has only held office since December, surely knows the road to greater self-sufficiency is long and bristling with obstacles, however. And Mexico is still highly vulnerable to the so-called Colossus of the North, as the United States is known by some of its southern neighbors.
""If the slowdown already visible in some U.S. industrial sectors linked to Mexico persists, we'll be seeing adverse effects in the second half of the year,"" said Jose Luis de la Cruz, chief economist at the IDIC think tank.
FLAGGING DEMAND
Should demand for manufactured goods wane, Mexico will be increasingly dependent on consumer spending, which makes up about two-thirds of the economy, to underpin growth.
Big ticket purchases have been tepid, though, with car sales falling 6.4% in the first six months of the year.
Mexico's Nemak (MX:NEMAKA), an auto parts maker that supplies U.S. companies such as  Ford Motor Co  (N:F) and General Motors Co (N:GM), generated 56% of its revenues in North America last year. It is now projecting an 8% drop in sales volume by the end of 2019.
A Nemak spokesman said the company's 2019 revenue forecast was based on the likelihood U.S. sales of light vehicles and their production in North America would fall. Shares in the company have declined more than 44% in the past year.
Automotive goods make up nearly 36% of Mexican manufacturing exports by value, according to the car industry. U.S. consumers absorb three-quarters of Mexican exports of light vehicles, the biggest component of the sector's output.
The probability of a U.S. recession in the next 12 months reached 32.9% in July, up from 12.5% a year earlier, a monthly report by the Federal Reserve of New York showed.
That is the highest level registered since 2007, when the global financial crisis began to take hold. During the ensuing recession, the U.S. economy contracted 2.5% in 2009, but the Mexican economy shrank 5.3%.
Whatever happens in the United States, Lopez Obrador's failure to persuade investors about his own economic vision has been holding back investment at home, said Jorge Sanchez, an economist at Mexico's FUNDEF think tank.
Investor confidence in Mexico has been shaken by some of the decisions made by Lopez Obrador, including pulling the plug on a partly built, $13 billion airport for Mexico City and his retreat from the prior government's opening of the oil and gas industry to private capital.
""Mexico's problem is more of an internal matter than about the United States,"" Sanchez said.
The government this week signaled it wanted to lift the sluggish economy by unveiling a $25 billion stimulus package.

Proud of its hard-won record of macroeconomic stability, it remains adamant that better times are coming. Finance Minister Arturo Herrera said on Wednesday that, far from slowing, the economy would pick up speed in the second half of the year.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. manufacturing activity slowed to a near three-year low in July and hiring at factories shifted into lower gear, suggesting a further loss of momentum in economic growth early in the third quarter as trade tensions between Washington and Beijing persist.
Other data on Thursday showed the number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits rose last week, while construction spending fell sharply in June as investment in private projects tumbled to its lowest level in 1-1/2 years. 
The slowdown in factory activity and accompanying weak business investment have caught the attention of Federal Reserve officials. The U.S. central bank on Wednesday cut interest rates for the first time since 2008, to insure against downside risks to the economy from trade tensions and slowing global growth.
Fed Chairman Jerome Powell told reporters during a news conference that the preemptive monetary policy easing was ""not the beginning of a long series of rate cuts."" Powell described manufacturing as ""not growing much,"" saying ""we hope to help that with this rate cut.""
The Institute for Supply Management (ISM) said its index of national factory activity slipped to 51.2 last month, the lowest reading since August 2016, from 51.7 in June. It was the fourth straight monthly decline in the index. The ISM said ""trade remains a significant issue."" 
A reading above 50 indicates expansion in the manufacturing sector, which accounts for about 12% of the U.S. economy. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the ISM index rising to 52.0 in June. 
""For a Fed concerned that the trade war is inflicting major wounds on business investment and manufacturing, today's reports will only nudge the needle toward another rate cut,"" said Sal Guatieri, a senior economist at BMO in Toronto.
The United States' trade war with China has hurt business sentiment. That, together with disruptions to supply chains caused by import tariffs, is weighing on manufacturing.
Manufacturing is also taking a hit from an inventory overhang, which has resulted in businesses placing fewer orders with manufacturers. A reduction in the production of Boeing's (N:BA) MAX 737 aircraft, which was grounded in March after two fatal plane crashes in five months, is also a drag on activity.
The dollar firmed against a basket of currencies as investors continued to digest Wednesday's rate decision and Powell's comments. U.S. Treasury prices rose. Stocks on Wall Street were trading higher.
FACTORY EMPLOYMENT SLOWS
The ISM's forward-looking new orders sub-index rebounded to a reading of 50.8 last month from 50.0 in June. A gauge of factory employment fell to 51.7, the lowest since November 2016, from a reading of 54.5 in June. That poses a downside risk to manufacturing payrolls in July.
The government is due to publish July's employment report on Friday. According to a Reuters survey of economists, nonfarm payrolls likely increased by 164,000 jobs in July after surging by 224,000 in June. Manufacturing payrolls are expected to have risen by 5,000 jobs last month after advancing 17,000 in June.
Despite the persistent weakness, U.S. manufacturing is in relatively better shape compared to the rest of the world. Reports on Thursday showed factory activity contracted across Asia and Europe in July.
The ISM said nine industries, including wood, computer and electronic products and textile mills reported growth last month. Machinery, transportation equipment, and electrical equipment, appliances and components were among the nine industries reporting a contraction. 
Machinery manufacturers said ""business has slowed."" Electrical equipment, appliances and components makers said ""general business trends are continuing to show signs of weakness resulting from tariffs and cost impacts of importing and exporting.""
Despite the economy shifting into lower gear, mainly as the stimulus from last year's $1.5 trillion tax cut package fades, the labor market has remained resilient. The economy grew at a 2.1% annualized rate in the second quarter. Economists expect growth will slow to around a 1.5% pace in the third quarter. 
In a separate report on Thursday, the Labor Department said initial claims for state unemployment benefits rose 8,000 to a seasonally adjusted 215,000 for the week ended July 27.
Economists had forecast claims increasing to 214,000 in the latest week. The four-week moving average of initial claims, considered a better measure of labor market trends as it irons out week-to-week volatility, fell 1,750 to 211,500 last week.
""There have been a few periods earlier in the expansion in which claims filings were lower than what we have seen reported in recent weeks, and the trend in job growth likely has slowed to some degree,"" said Daniel Silver, an economist at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) in New York. ""But the claims data signal that any softening in the labor market is likely to be modest and don't point to any sort of substantial downshift in activity.""
Job gains averaged 172,000 per month in the first half of this year, below the monthly average of 223,000 in 2018, in part because of a shortage of qualified workers. The economy needs to create roughly 100,000 jobs per month to keep up with growth in the working-age population. The unemployment rate is expected to have held steady at 3.7% in July. 

In a third report on Thursday, the Commerce Department said construction spending dropped 1.3% in June, the biggest decline in seven months, after falling 0.5% in May.

The Institute for Supply Management’s index eased to 51.2 last month from 51.7 in June, according to data released Thursday. Figures above 50 signify expansion, and the median estimate in a Bloomberg survey of economists was for a July reading of 52. Measures of output, factory employment and input prices all declined during the month.
Key Insights
The fourth straight downturn in the overall index of factory activity, inching closer to outright contraction, is consistent with the recent trend of manufacturing weakness throughout the world. Producers are beset by a combination of tepid global economies and trade policies and tariffs that have left supply chains at some companies in disarray.While manufacturing makes up only about 11% of the U.S. economy, the risk is that further weakness will extend to service providers and prompt those companies to reduce investment and limit hiring, endangering the record-long expansion.Details of the ISM’s report showed a gauge of production declined for the third time in four months, pushing a measure of manufacturing employment to its lowest level since November 2016. An index of exports from manufacturers dropped to the lowest level since February 2016.Get More

A separate factory index from IHS Markit came in at 50.4 on Thursday. That’s the lowest in almost a decade and just shy of contraction, though an improvement from a preliminary reading of 50.
The ISM data showed prices paid by factories for materials used in manufacturing contracted in July for a second month, indicating input costs are getting cheaper amid sluggish global demand.
A gauge of producers’ order backlogs retreated by 4.3 points to 43.1, a sign manufacturers have ample capacity to meet demand.

HONG KONG (Reuters) - Hong Kong's central bank lowered its benchmark interest rate on Thursday, its first cut since late 2008, tracking a cut in U.S. rates, although tight cash conditions in the city kept banks from reducing borrowing costs.
The Hong Kong Monetary Authority keeps its policy in lock-step with the U.S. Federal Reserve as the city's currency is pegged to the greenback in a range of 7.75-7.85 per dollar.
On Thursday, the HKMA cut the base rate it charges through its overnight discount window by 25 basis points to 2.5%. The Fed cut rates on Wednesday for the first time since the global financial crisis, reflecting central banks' bias towards easing policy amid slowing global economic growth and the protracted Sino-U.S. trade war.
HKMA chief executive Norman Chan warned on Thursday that the Hong Kong Interbank Offered Rate (HIBOR), which provides a benchmark for many local currency loans, may not immediately track the Fed's move given domestic liquidity pressures.
He said Hong Kong's rates may be influenced by domestic factors, such as large initial public offers, in the stock market.
 Alibaba  (N:BABA) is teeing up a secondary listing up to $20 billion in Hong Kong, which would be the biggest secondary listing globally in seven years. Brewer Anheuser Busch InBev NV (BR:ABI) marketed but then dropped a $9.8 billion IPO for its Asia business last month.
""So I expect HIBOR would continue to be influenced by local supply and demand conditions and may not immediately follow the move in LIBOR,"" he said.
(GRAPHIC: Creeping up - HIBOR LIBOR prime: https://tmsnrt.rs/2MxpHaY)
UNDER PRESSURE
In a sign liquidity pressures had elevated funding costs, HSBC (L:HSBA) (HK:0005), the city's largest bank, Bank of China (Hong Kong) and Hang Seng Bank (HK:0011), said they would not cut the benchmark often used for mortgages in line with the HKMA's move, keeping their best lending rate at 5.125%.  Standard Chartered  Bank (L:STAN) also left its rate unchanged at 5.375%. Lenders have little room to trim rates given that HIBOR - the rate at which they borrow - remains elevated, said Carie Li, economist at OCBC Wing Hang Bank in Hong Kong.
""If banks don't get a lot back from these loans their net interest margin is compressed,"" said Li.
Hong Kong has one of the most expensive housing markets in the world and most mortgages are priced over HIBOR, or below the best lending rate, also known as the prime rate.
HIBOR eased marginally across the curve on Thursday while the Hong Kong dollar was a touch firmer at 7.8254 per dollar.
In neighbouring Macau, where the local currency is pegged to Hong Kong's, the base rate was lowered by 25 bps to 2.5%, the local monetary authority announced on Thursday.
Chan said Hong Kong's financial market and currency have not been affected by recent social unrest in the city. Hong Kong has been embroiled in a political crisis in the past months over a controversial extradition bill.
""Financial markets, overall, have been operating normally and smoothly,"" said Chan.
However, retailers are taking a knock from the protests with June retail sales down 6.7% from a year earlier, the biggest decline since February.
Slowing global demand and the U.S.-China trade war also weighed on economic activity. Data on Wednesday showed Hong Kong's economy grew less than expected in the second quarter, with some banks lowering their 2019 growth forecasts for the city.
These headwinds could drive up the unemployment rate, currently at 2.8%, Paul Chan, Hong Kong's financial secretary, said in a blogpost on Sunday.

LONDON/HONG KONG (Reuters) - Factory activity contracted across Asia and Europe in July, fuelling worries a prolonged U.S.-China trade war and an economic slowdown could tilt the world toward recession, which central banks would have to fight with depleted ammunition.
Manufacturing activity in the euro zone fell at its steepest rate since late 2012 last month as demand sank, a survey compiled by IHS Markit showed, puncturing sentiment among factory managers. [ECUR/PMIM]
Forward-looking indicators in Thursday's survey suggest manufacturing won't rebound anytime soon and is likely to embolden policymakers at the European Central Bank, who last week all but promised to ease policy further as the bloc's growth outlook deteriorates.
Earlier figures from Germany, Europe's largest economy, showed a recession among its manufacturers deepened. France and much of the rest of the euro zone also faltered.
""The manufacturing sector is going through some sort of correction, some of it due to trade uncertainty, some of it due to a slowdown in other countries,"" said Jacqui Douglas, chief European macro strategist at TD Securities.
""Some of the commentary ... is about the falling demand from Asia, so there is some sort of global phenomenon going on here where manufacturing is getting hit quite hard."" 
British manufacturers' output fell by the most in seven years last month, adding to signs the economy may slip into recession as businesses confront falling demand from Europe and China and the risk of a disruptive no-deal Brexit.
New Prime Minister Boris Johnson has promised to take Britain out of the European Union on Oct. 31, regardless of whether he can secure a revised transition deal with the bloc. 
Other Purchasing Managers' Indexes showed manufacturing activity contracting in China for a second consecutive month, while export-driven economies in North Asia - Japan, South Korea and Taiwan - have been in pain for longer.
South Korea's exports, a bellwether for global trade, tumbled for an eighth straight month as an escalating political and economic dispute with neighboring Japan painted an increasingly gloomy picture for Asia's fourth-largest economy. 
Taiwan's streak of contraction reached its 10th month, while Indonesia's PMI fell below 50 for the first time in six months. Vietnam, Philippines and Thailand PMIs suggested mild growth. 
In India, where the economy relies more on domestic demand, manufacturing growth picked up. 
Data later in the day is likely to show U.S. factories maintained a modest expansion.
RATES FALLING
As expected, the Federal Reserve cut interest rates on Wednesday, but Chairman Jerome Powell said the move was not necessarily the start of a lengthy easing cycle. He also signaled, however, that the Fed might cut further.
The Bank of Japan and the ECB have signaled their readiness to ease, although they have less room to move than the Fed.
Expectations have grown that the BOJ's next policy move will be to ease, and the ECB is expected to cut rates in September, according to Reuters polls of economists. [ECILT/JP][ECILT/EU]
In Hong Kong, the central bank cut its base rate for the first time in a decade, as its currency peg to the U.S. dollar forced the monetary authority to move with the Fed.
Central banks in Australia, India and Russia, among others, have also already loosened policy.
However, later on Thursday the Bank of England is unlikely to cut rates, even as the risk of a disorderly Brexit darkens growth prospects.
And while more stimulus from Chinese policymakers is expected, the People's Bank of China gave no sign of whether it will immediately follow the Fed's rate cut, as it has done on occasion.
In China, Asia's economic center of gravity, the Caixin/IHS Markit Manufacturing PMI for July rose to 49.9 from 49.4 in June, remaining below the 50 mark dividing expansion from contraction.
The readings were largely in line with an official gauge that showed factory activity last month shrank at a slower-than-expected pace.

U.S. and Chinese negotiators ended a brief round of trade talks on Wednesday with little sign of progress. They agreed to meet again in September.
The International Monetary Fund has warned their trade dispute will reduce global output by 0.2%. Many economists say any escalation could lead to a global recession.

""We expect that this downward trend in manufacturing will continue in 2019 until the trade and technology negotiations make some progress,"" said Iris Pang, Greater China economist at ING.

HONG KONG (Reuters) - Hong Kong retail sales, a key part of the city's economy, felt a growing impact in June from mass protests, government data showed on Thursday.
The government said June retail sales fell 6.7% from a year earlier, the biggest decline since February, as local consumer sentiment turned cautious and growth in visitor arrivals slowed.
Protests against a proposed extradition law began in late April and widened in June, though they remained peaceful until July, when there was violence at some demonstrations.
Businesses say with the violence has added to the toll on tourism and the pivotal retailing industry.
Many businesses in Hong Kong are already facing strains from China's economic slowdown, a weak Chinese yuan and fallout from the Sino-U.S. trade war.
""The near-term performance of retail sales will likely remain subdued, as the weakened global and local economic outlook and other headwinds continue to weigh on consumption sentiment,"" a government spokesman said after release of the June retail data.
""The recent mass demonstrations, if continued, would also dent the retail business further,"" he said.
Retail sales fell to HK$35.2 billion ($4.50 billion), a fifth consecutive month of declines. May's decline was revised fractionally to 1.4%.
For 2019's first half, retail sales fell 2.6% in value from a year earlier.
""The decline trend of retail sales industry in the coming months will be more obvious, which may fall more than 10%,"" said Angela Cheng, an economist at CMB International Capital. ""We remain pessimistic about Hong Kong's future retail business.""
On Wednesday, Hong Kong reported its economy had 0.6% annual growth in the second quarter, below the average forecast of 1.6% from five economists.
Fitch Ratings said on Tuesday the unrest could damage business confidence and the quality of governance. It also raised longer-term concerns about policy paralysis and erosion of the rule of law. Fitch affirmed Hong Kong's AA+ rating on June 11.
BIGGER HITS COMING?
Hong Kong retailers say they expect sales for July and August to drop by double-digits from a year earlier, while hoteliers are bracing for a wave of cancellations.
The city's Federation of Trade Unions said hotel occupancy rates fell 20% in June year-on-year, and probably 40% in July.
Tourism, especially from mainland China, has dropped markedly. Britain, Japan, Singapore and others have issued travel alerts. [nL4N24V2LB}
June tourist arrivals rose 8.5% from a year earlier to 5.14 million, according to the Hong Kong Tourism Board, slowing from a 19.5% rise in May. Mainland visitors increased 10.1%, accounting for 77.8% of the total. (https:// The Hong Kong Retail Management Association has changed its full-year retail sales forecast to a double-digit fall instead of single-digit growth. PwC has revised its Hong Kong full-year retail sales forecast to a 5% drop, from a 3% fall.

814,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 01, 2019 04:50AM ET</span>",World food prices ease for second month running in July: U.N. FAO,"ROME (Reuters) - World food prices eased for a second month running in July after five consecutive monthly gains, pushed down by falls in the prices of some cereals, dairy products and sugar, the United Nations food agency said on Thursday.
The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) food price index, which measures monthly changes for a basket of cereals, oilseeds, dairy products, meat and sugar, averaged 170.9 points last month from a downwardly revised 172.7 points in June.
That figure was previously given as 173.0. 
FAO did not update its forecast for world cereal production on Thursday. The next estimate will come on Sept 5.
The FAO cereal price index fell 2.7% from June due to lower wheat and maize prices, but was still up 4.1% from its level in July last year. FAO's all rice price index marked its fifth successive month of stability, the agency said.
The FAO dairy price index fell 2.9% from June, the second straight month of decline, and the index value was down almost 3% compared with the corresponding month last year. Quotations for butter declined the most, followed by cheese and Whole Milk Powder (WMP). 
The FAO sugar price index was down 0.6% in July from the month before, mainly on expectations for higher sugarcane yields in India, the world’s largest sugar producer, following above average rainfalls in the main sugar producing regions. 
By contrast, the vegetable oil price index gained 0.8% from the previous month, with firmer soy and sunflower oil prices more than offsetting a further drop in palm oil values. The index was still 11% below last year's corresponding level.

The meat price index rose 0.6% in July from June, posting the sixth consecutive moderate month-on-month increase.

Hours before the Bank of England is due to update its economic outlook, the monthly purchasing managers' index (PMI) added to signs that the economy is at risk of slipping into recession as businesses battle falling demand from Europe and China and the risk of a disruptive no-deal Brexit.
July's IHS Markit/CIPS manufacturing PMI remained at the six-and-a-half-year low of 48.0 it struck in June, a shade better than the median forecast of a fall to 47.7 in a Reuters poll of economists.
But the survey's output component fell further below the 50-mark that separates growth from contraction to 47.0, its lowest since July 2012 when the euro zone was in the throes of a debt crisis.
""July saw the UK manufacturing sector suffocating under the choke-hold of slower global economic growth, political uncertainty and the unwinding of earlier Brexit stockpiling activity,"" IHS Markit economist Rob Dobson said.
New Prime Minister Boris Johnson has promised to take Britain out of the European Union on Oct. 31, regardless of whether he can secure a revised transition deal with the bloc, pushing sterling to its weakest since November 2016 against a basket of currencies .
Businesses fear a no-deal Brexit would lead to major disruption at ports following the reimposition of tariffs and customs checks, and IHS Markit said foreign customers were already reducing their reliance on British firms.
""Clients delayed, canceled or re-routed orders away from the UK, leading to a further decline in new work intakes from both domestic and overseas markets,"" Dobson said.
Britain's car industry said on Wednesday that investment fell by more than 70% in the first half of 2019 due to Brexit worries. The Confederation of British Industry said small manufacturers were the gloomiest since the 2016 Brexit referendum.
Brexit has compounded broader problems affecting Europe's manufacturing industry, which has suffered from reduced Chinese demand as a by-product of U.S. tariffs on imports from China.
A euro zone flash manufacturing PMI for July fell to its lowest since 2012 and growth in the currency bloc sank to 0.2% in the second quarter from 0.4% at the start of the year.
The Bank of England predicts British economic growth will sink to zero in the second quarter from 0.5% in the first three months of 2019, when growth got a boost as businesses rushed to stockpile goods before the original Brexit date of March 29.
July's survey showed manufacturers' stock levels were fairly stable as some businesses continued to run them down while others started to build up again ahead of the new Oct. 31 deadline.
Businesses also reported the weaker pound was pushing up the cost of some imports, though overall raw material costs rose at the slowest rate in three years, as did the prices manufacturers sold their goods at."
816,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 01, 2019 04:11AM ET</span>",Euro zone July factory activity contracts at fastest rate in six years,"LONDON (Reuters) - Manufacturing activity in the euro zone contracted at its steepest rate since late 2012 last month as demand sank, a survey showed, puncturing sentiment among
factory managers.
Forward-looking indicators in the survey suggest the sector won't rebound any time soon and will likely embolden policymakers at the European Central Bank, who last week all but promised to ease policy further as the bloc's growth outlook deteriorates.
IHS Markit's July final manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) was 46.5, just above an earlier flash reading of 46.4 but below June's 47.6 and chalking up its sixth straight month below the 50 level that separates growth from contraction.
July's headline index was at its lowest since December 2012 and a measure of output, which feeds into a composite PMI due on Monday and is seen as a good gauge of economic health, dropped to a more than six-year low of 46.9 from 48.5.
""The euro zone PMI dashboard is a sea of red, with all lights warning on the deteriorating health of the region's manufacturers,"" said Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit.
""Rising geopolitical concerns, including trade wars and Brexit, and worries about slower economic growth both domestically and internationally were all widely reported as having subdued current demand and hit confidence in the outlook.""
A future output index, which measures optimism, plummeted to 52.6 from 56.6, its lowest reading since the end of 2012.
New orders fell for a tenth month and factories reduced headcount for a third month as they completed backlogs of work at the sharpest rate in seven years."

In an update on the country's budget, the ministry said it had cut the forecast from a prediction of 2% made when the government presented the budget in December.
A preliminary estimate published by the national statistics agency on Wednesday showed that Mexico's economy expanded by 0.1% in the April-June period from the previous quarter, narrowly escaping a recession."
818,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 31, 2019 09:56PM ET</span>","China factory activity shrinks again in July, pressure eases slightly: Caixin PM","BEIJING (Reuters) - Pressure on China's factories eased a little in July thanks to growth-boosting steps from the government, but overall manufacturing activity remained in contraction as a trade war with the United States dented export orders, a private survey showed on Thursday.
The readings were largely in line with an official gauge that showed factory activity last month shrank at a slower-than-expected pace.
The Caixin/Markit Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) for July rose to 49.9 from 49.4 in June, and just below the neutral 50-mark dividing expansion from contraction on a monthly basis.
That was slightly above economists' expectations of 49.6, according to a Reuters poll.
""China's manufacturing economy showed signs of recovery in July. Policies such as tax and fee reductions designed to underpin the economy had an effect,"" Zhengsheng Zhong, Director of Macroeconomic Analysis at CEBM Group, wrote in a note accompanying the data.
The moderate improvement seen in the survey was partly driven by a recovery in domestic demand, with July factory output growing marginally after a brief drop in the previous month.
New orders also swung back to expansionary territory at 50.2 but remained much weaker compared with the historical average.
The still-soft conditions were underscored by new exports orders shrinking again in July amid deteriorating global demand. While the slump was less severe than in June, the outlook remained clouded with survey respondents citing the China-U.S. trade dispute for dampening sales to foreign customers.
U.S. and Chinese negotiators ended a brief round of trade talks on Wednesday with little sign of progress and agreed to meet again in September. It was their first in-person talks since a G20 truce in June as both sides try to find a way out of the year-long dispute.
Earlier in the week, U.S. President Donald Trump warned Beijing against waiting out his first term to finalize any trade deal, saying if he wins re-election in the November 2020 U.S. presidential contest, the outcome will be worse for China.
While the latest survey showed business confidence for the year ahead picked up from June's record low to a three-month high in July, some companies surveyed anticipated that the trade dispute will weigh on future output.
Factory gate prices also declined for the first time since January, which could rekindle worries about deflation and prompt more aggressive stimulus from Beijing.
China's top decision-making body of the ruling Communist Party said on Tuesday that government will step up efforts to boost demand and support the economy, but will not use the property market as a form of short-term stimulus.
The labor market remained sluggish in a sign of broadening stress across key industries. Manufacturers shed jobs for the fourth straight month, the quickest pace since February, the survey showed.
So far, Beijing has relied on a combination of fiscal stimulus and monetary easing to support an economy growing at its slowest pace in nearly 30 years, including hundreds of billions of dollars in infrastructure spending and tax cuts for companies.
But the economy has been slow to respond, and business confidence remains shaky, weighing on investment.
China observers have said that Beijing's recent growth-boosting measures will take time to filter through to the broader economy, and many analysts are of the view that further stimulus is needed to prevent a deeper downturn and to help stabilize growth.
People's Bank of China (PBOC) Governor Li Gang said recently that current interest rate levels are appropriate, but traders are speculating that China could trim rates soon after the U.S. Federal Reserve cuts its main benchmark rate.
As widely expected, the Fed on Wednesday eased policy for the first time since the financial crisis, but doused market views that it would embark on a lengthy easing campaign."
819,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 31, 2019 09:53PM ET</span>","Japan July manufacturing contracts for third month, output fall deepens - PMI","TOKYO (Reuters) - Japanese manufacturing deteriorated for a third month in July, a revised survey showed on Thursday, offering another sign of how trade protectionism and slower global growth are denting the economy.
The final Jibun Bank Japan Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) was up a notch at a seasonally adjusted 49.4 compared to 49.3 in June, but stayed below the 50.0 threshold that separates contraction from expansion for a third month.
The July final reading edged down from the preliminary 49.6.
Factory output contracted for a seventh month and slipped at the fastest pace in four months, suggesting the production slump hitting the export-reliant economy was firmly taking hold.
""Forward-looking survey indicators suggest that manufacturers in Japan are set for another difficult quarter, as firms scaled down stocks and input purchasing to keep a lid on costs,"" said Joe Hayes, economist at IHS Markit, which compiles the survey.
The weakening July reading fits with official figures, such as for industrial production and exports, showing the economy is feeling the pinch from the U.S.-China trade standoff, slower Chinese growth and demand weakening globally.
Individual items in the PMI report further underlined the gloomy outlook for the world's third-largest economy.
Total new orders and new export orders again showed shrinkage, at 48.1 and 47.6 respectively, though at a reduced pace compared with June. 
Firms' purchasing levels were at a three-year low due to the weakening output requirements and already-sufficient stock volumes.
""More signs that the manufacturing downturn has now become deeply rooted was apparent in prices data,"" said IHS Markit's Hayes.
""Output charges were reduced at the fastest pace in nearly three years amid increasing efforts to stimulate sluggish demand.""

Employment offered a slightly brighter picture, with the jobs index edging up to a three-month high, though backlogs of work hovered just off more than six-year lows touched in June.

BRASILIA (Reuters) - Brazil's central bank cut its benchmark interest rate to a record low 6.00% on Wednesday, making an aggressive move with the first reduction in borrowing costs since March 2018, citing subdued inflation and looser policy in major economies.
The bank's nine-member monetary policy committee, known as Copom, voted unanimously to lower the Selic rate by 50 basis points. Fourteen out of 27 economists in a Reuters poll predicted a 25-basis point cut to 6.25%, while 10 expected a more aggressive move to 6.00%. BR/INT
In a statement accompanying its decision, Copom cited data showing underlying inflation at ""comfortable levels"" amid a ""possible resumption"" of a gradual economic recovery.
Soon after the U.S. Federal Reserve cut interest rates for the first time in more than a decade, Brazilian policymakers also highlighted a dovish global backdrop.
""The global outlook has become benign, owing to changes in monetary policy in major economies,"" Copom's statement said. ""Nevertheless, the risks associated with a slowdown in global growth remain.""
Analysts had said in the run up to Wednesday's decision that recent progress on fiscal reforms, which should boost investor sentiment and bring down long-term inflationary pressures, would also give the central bank cover to cut interest rates.
Central bank President Roberto Campos Neto had previously sought to play down a direct link between a major social security overhaul and a rate cut. But Copom's last policy statement in June made clear that uncertainty over the reform was the biggest single obstacle to lower rates."
822,By Investing.com,"<span>Jul 31, 2019 04:15PM ET</span>","Fed Lowers Interest Rates by Quarter Point, First Cut Since ‘08","Investing.com - The Federal Reserve cut interest rates for the first time since 2008 as inflation continued to track below target and signs of slowing global growth persisted. But Fed Chairman Jay Powell dashed hopes that aggressive cuts may follow, saying that the cut does not represent the start of a lengthy easing cycle. 
 
The Federal Reserve cut its benchmark rate by 25 basis points to a range of 2.0% to 2.25% from 2.25% to 2.5%. 
The rate cut was fully priced in, according to Investing.com's Fed Rate Monitor Tool, though some had been holding out hope for a more aggressive 50-basis-point cut as inflation continues to undershoot the Fed's target. 
""In light of the implications of global developments for the economic outlook as well as muted inflation pressures, the Committee decided to lower the target range for the federal funds rate to 2 to 2-1/4 percent,"" the Fed said. 
But at his press conference, Powell said the the move was ""a mid-cycle policy adjustment,"" indicating that the market's idea of continual rate cuts in the future was off base. 
The most recent measure of core personal consumption expenditures (PCE), the Fed's preferred measure of inflation, came in at 1.7%, below the central bank's 2% target.
President Donald Trump, a day earlier, had called on the Fed to make a “large cut” to offset a series of hikes last year.
""I'm very disappointed in the Fed,” Trump told reporters Tuesday morning. ""I would like to see a large cut, and I'd like to see immediately the quantitative tightening stop.” 
In a move to further ease financial conditions, the central bank pledged to end its balance sheet shrinking program, which many argue counters rate cuts, at the end of the month, two months earlier than initially anticipated.
""The Committee will conclude the reduction of its aggregate securities holdings in the System Open Market Account in August, two months earlier than previously indicated,"" the Fed said. 
 
 
The last time the Fed cut rates was Dec. 16, 2008, the heart of the Financial Crisis and three months after the collapse of Lehman Bros., which had brought series of emergency cuts in the interim.
The Fed capitulated to cutting rates to 0% that day, but established a target range of 0% to 0.25%, saying “weak economic conditions are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels of the federal funds rate for some time.”
Rates had been at 4.25% at the end of 2007. The FOMC wouldn’t hike until Dec. 16, 2015.
The Fed’s path of hiking rates to the current level, which has drawn the ire of the president, began on March 15, 2017, where it noted that the FOMC “expects that economic conditions will evolve in a manner that will warrant gradual increases in the federal funds rate.”"

824,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 31, 2019 11:59AM ET</span>",U.S. labor costs post smallest increase in 1-1/2 years,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. labor costs rose at their slowest pace in 1-1/2 years in the second quarter, the latest indication of benign inflation that could allow the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates on Wednesday for the first time in a decade.
Other data on Wednesday suggested a further slowdown in economic growth at the start of the third quarter. Manufacturing activity in the Midwest contracted for a second straight month in July, declining to its lowest level in more than 3-1/2 years.
While private payrolls rebounded this month, the pace of growth remained moderate, adding to the host of factors that are likely to encourage the Fed to announce its first rate cut since 2008 when policymakers conclude a two-day meeting at 2 p.m. EDT (1800 GMT).
The 10-year economic expansion, the longest in history, is facing headwinds from a bitter trade war between the United States and China, slowing global growth and Britain's potential disorderly departure from the European Union. 
The Employment Cost Index, the broadest measure of labor costs, increased 0.6% in the second quarter, the smallest gain since the fourth quarter of 2017, the Labor Department said. The ECI had increased 0.7% for two straight quarters.
In the 12 months through June, the ECI rose 2.7%, slowing from a 2.8% increase in the year through March. 
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the ECI would rise 0.7 percent in the April-June period. 
The ECI is widely viewed by policymakers and economists as one of the better measures of labor market slack. It is also considered a better predictor of core inflation. Labor costs picked up over 2018 as a tightening labor market pushed up wage growth. The pace of increases has since moderated somewhat despite the unemployment rate being near a 50-year low.
""The historical relationship between the unemployment rate and wage growth seems to have weakened somewhat during this business cycle, however, leading us to expect only measured incremental improvements in wage pressures,"" said Blerina Uruci, an economist at  Barclays  (LON:BARC) in Washington.
The report came on the heels of data on Tuesday showing a key measure of inflation increased 1.6% in the 12 months to June, continuing a pattern of slow gains that have seen it undershoot the Fed's 2% target this year.
In the second quarter, wages and salaries, which account for 70 percent of employment costs, rose 0.7% after rising by the same margin in the prior period. Wages and salaries were up 2.9% in the 12 months through June, matching the gain in the year through March.
Private sector wages and salaries rose 0.6% in the second quarter after increasing 0.7% in the first quarter. They were up 3.0% in the 12 months through June after rising by the same margin in the year through March.
The dollar was little changed against a basket of currencies as traders awaited the Fed's decision on rates. U.S. Treasury prices rose marginally. Stocks on Wall Street were trading slightly higher, lifted by upbeat earnings from Apple (O:AAPL).
LOSING ALTITUDE
The economy is losing speed largely as the stimulus from last year's $1.5 trillion tax cut package fades. That loss of momentum was underscored by a second report on Wednesday showing the Chicago Business Barometer fell to 44.4 in July, the lowest reading since December 2015, from 49.7 in June. 
The index is jointly developed by MNI Indicators and ISM-Chicago. A reading below 50 indicates a contraction in manufacturing in the Midwest region. Automobiles account for a large portion of the index. The auto sector is struggling with slow sales and an inventory bloat.
The survey's production measure plunged to a 10-year low. A measure of new orders received by factories contracted further and firms continued to accumulate inventories. The gauge of factory employment contracted for the first time since October 2017 and hit the lowest level since October 2009. 
Coming on the heels of other weak July regional factory surveys, this month's drop poses a downside risk to the closely watched Institute for Supply Management (ISM) national manufacturing index. 
The July ISM index is scheduled to be released on Thursday. According to a Reuters survey of economists, the ISM manufacturing index likely rose to a reading of 52.0 in July from 51.7 in June. 
""The extreme weakness in July's Chicago PMI points to a weaker-than-expected manufacturing ISM tomorrow,"" said Chris Low, chief economist at FTN in New York.
Manufacturing, which accounts for about 12% of the economy, is being undercut by an inventory overhang, trade tensions, weakening global growth and design problems at aerospace giant Boeing (N:BA).
The troubles in manufacturing are contributing to slower job growth. The ADP (NASDAQ:ADP) National Employment Report showed private payrolls increased by 156,000 jobs in July after rising 112,000 in June. The ADP report, which is jointly developed by Moody's Analytics, was released on Wednesday, two days ahead of the government's more comprehensive employment report. 
Nonfarm payrolls likely increased by 162,000 jobs in July, according to a Reuters survey, after surging by 224,000 in June. Job gains averaged 172,000 per month in the first half of this year, below the monthly average of 223,000 in 2018.

The pace of job gains, however, remains above the roughly 100,000 per month needed to keep up with growth in the working-age population. The unemployment rate is expected to have held steady at 3.7% in July.

OTTAWA (Reuters) - Canada's economy grew by a higher-than-expected 0.2% in May, the third increase in as many months, thanks to a rebound in manufacturing, Statistics Canada data showed on Wednesday.
Analysts in a Reuters poll had predicted an increase of 0.1% in May following a larger-than-expected increase of 0.3% in April. Overall, 13 of the 20 industrial sectors monitored expanded in May, the national statistical agency said.
The Canadian dollar strengthened to 1.3135, or 76.13 cents U.S., after the May GDP data was released. 
The latest Canadian economic data was released on the same day the U.S. Federal Reserve is scheduled to announce its latest interest rate decision, with markets anticipating a rate cut.
The Bank of Canada has held interest rates steady since October 2018 as it monitors Canadian economic data. Canada's central bank is not expected to move for the rest of the year.
""Strong growth in the last several months underscores why the (Bank of Canada) has maintained a neutral policy bias even as the Fed is set to lower rates,"" said Josh Nye, a senior economist with RBC Economics Research.
Brian DePratto, a senior economist with TD Economics, agreed, noting the current economic backdrop ""should give the Bank of Canada some near-term comfort in 'going it alone' and holding is stance of monetary policy constant as its peers ease.""
On Wednesday, Statscan said durable manufacturing rose by 2.3%, more than offsetting the 1.7% drop seen in April. Meanwhile, the transportation equipment manufacturing sub sector experienced a growth of 5.7% after motor vehicle production returned to normal levels following some temporary plant shutdowns in April.
Canada's construction industry also registered gains in May, rising 0.9% and recording its fourth jump in five months. Residential construction posted its strongest growth in more than a year, rising by 2.2% as construction of double, row and other multi-unit dwelling expanded.
However, contractions were felt within the mining, quarrying and oil and gas extraction industries, dropping by of 0.8% following a gain of 5.5% in April, thanks in large part to a decline in extractions from the oil sands.

Separate data from Statistics Canada showed that Canadian producer prices fell by 1.4% in June, the biggest decline in nearly two years, on lower prices for energy and petroleum goods. Raw materials prices dropped by 5.9%, the second consecutive monthly decline, spurred by continued trade uncertainties, including Canada's ongoing dispute with China.

826,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 31, 2019 09:26AM ET</span>","Russia's 2019 GDP growth seen slowing to 1%, central bank to cut rates further: Reuters poll","By Andrey Ostroukh
MOSCOW (Reuters) - The Russian central bank is likely to lower interest rates this year faster than previously thought as economic growth is on track to undershoot official forecasts, a monthly Reuters poll showed on Wednesday.
Slowing inflation and stumbling economic growth should give the central bank more room cut rates provided no external shocks, such as new Western sanctions, hit its commodity-dependent economy and markets.
In 2019, Russia's gross domestic product is seen growing by 1.0%, the average forecast among analysts and economists from 21 banks and companies polled in late July showed.
That is less than the 1.2% GDP growth predicted in the same poll a month ago and the 2.3% expansion officially reported for 2018. Most of the forecasts in the Reuters poll are based on at least 10 individual projections.
The central bank, which has cut rates twice this year as the economy and inflation have slowed, had forecast 2019 GDP growth at 1.0-1.5%.
Inflation expectations for 2019 among analysts in the Reuters poll remained stable compared with a month ago.
Annual inflation is seen at 4.3% in 2019, the July poll showed, slowing further to 3.9% in 2020. In June, analysts forecast 2019 inflation at 4.3% and 2020 inflation was seen at 4.0%, the central bank's target level.
The central bank is now seen cutting its key rate, currently 7.25%, to 7.00% in the fourth quarter. In late June, analysts had predicted that the rate would reach that level only in the first quarter of 2020.
In 12 months from now, the rouble is seen at 66.50 versus the dollar and 76.85 versus the euro. The previous poll foresaw exchange rates of 66.50 and 76.31, respectively.
""The rouble continues to enjoy sanctions oblivion and accrued non-resident inflows into the local debt,"" said Vladimir Miklashevsky, senior economist and trading desk strategist at Danske Bank.
""Fed's loose stance is another factor favoring the rouble,"" Miklashevsky said, referring to plans by the U.S. Federal Reserve to lower rates.
On Wednesday, the rouble's official exchange rates, set by the central bank, were 63.38 per dollar and 70.60 per euro, with the Russian currency rising on hopes that the Fed will trim U.S. interest rates for the first time in more than 10 years."

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Euro zone economic growth halved in the second quarter and inflation slowed sharply in July, reinforcing market expectations that the European Central Bank will further ease monetary policy in September.
The European Union's statistics office said on Wednesday that gross domestic product in the 19 countries sharing the euro grew 0.2% quarter-on-quarter in the April-June period, down from 0.4% in the previous three months and returning to the anaemic rates seen in the third and fourth quarters of last year.
Inflation, which the ECB wants to keep below, but close to, 2%, also slowed to 1.1% year-on-year in July from 1.3% in June - the lowest reading in 17 months. (For a graph see: https://tmsnrt.rs/2OxUaZa)
""We expect the ECB to respond to this broad-based economic weakness – which we think is likely to continue – with a round of extra policy easing, including restarting QE and cutting rates,"" said Daniele Antonucci, economist at  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS).
Core inflation, which strips out volatile unprocessed food and energy and which the ECB scrutinizes in policy decisions, also fell to 1.1% in July from 1.3% in June. 
The even more narrow measure excluding also alcohol and tobacco prices that many market economists look at was down to 0.9% from 1.1%, strengthening the case for a package of ECB measures to support the economy and faster inflation. 
""The ECB more or less announced what it will do - cutting rates, probably restarting QE and putting in place the tiering system for the banks,"" said Peter Vanden Houte, chief economist at ING.
""The big question is if all of this will have much of an impact on both inflation and growth as we are starting to get to the limits. Now it's up to governments with more pro-active fiscal policy to step in as the ECB cannot do it alone.""
The slower price growth comes even though the unemployment rate fell to 7.5% of the workforce, its lowest in 11 years, data showed.
Antonucci said the inflation and growth data, with downside risks for both, provided clear grounds for the ECB to push though a new package of measures as soon as September. The ECB's Governing Council holds its next monetary policy meeting on Sept. 12.

""That's likely to include a 10 basis point deposit rate cut to -0.50%, plus an announcement or a strong hint that the central bank will restart net asset purchases,"" he said.

BERLIN (Reuters) - German retail sales rose in June the most in more than 12 years and unemployment edged up less than expected in July, data showed on Wednesday, offering a rare ray of hope that household spending will prop up Europe's largest economy.
Germany's labor market has become the foundation of a consumption-driven growth cycle, now in its 10th year. The job market has so far remained largely immune to an economic slowdown that's being driven by a slump in manufacturing.
Retail sales jumped by 3.5% on the month in June after a revised 1.7% drop in May, measured in real terms, data from the Federal Statistics Office showed. It was the largest monthly increase since December 2006 and easily beat a Reuters forecast of 0.5%.
In the first half of the year, retail sales rose by 2.2% on the year in real terms, the data showed, driven by sharp gains in online retailing.
The sales figures come after a survey published on Tuesday showed consumer morale worsened for the third month in a row heading into August. A global economic downturn, trade disputes and Brexit uncertainty fueled people's fears of losing their jobs and their income.
But the latest report by the Federal Labour Office showed that such fears are unjustified, at least for now. The number of people out of work edged up by only 1,000 to 2.283 million in seasonally adjusted terms. The Reuters consensus forecast was for a rise of 2,000.
The jobless rate held steady at 5.0%, slightly above the record-low 4.9% reached earlier this year.
""Unemployment and underemployment increased in July, mainly due to the beginning of the summer break,"" said Daniel Terzenbach, a senior official at the Labour Office.
Terzenbach added that the demand from companies for new employees was declining only slightly and employment was continuing to increase, albeit less dynamically than recently.
Nonetheless, Germany's economic output is widely expected to stagnate or even shrink in the comings months.
The DIW economic institute said in its monthly report that it expects the German economy to stagnate in the second quarter and shrink by 0.1% in the third quarter.
""Orders are deteriorating, consumers are becoming more skeptical and even the hitherto robust labor market is losing steam - combined not a good outlook for the current quarter,"" DIW chief economist Claus Michelsen said.
Preliminary German GDP growth data for the second quarter is due on Aug. 14."

Gross domestic product contracted 0.3% from the previous quarter, while growth on a year -ago basis remained at 0.6%, according to data released on Wednesday. Both results were well below the estimates of economists surveyed by Bloomberg.
With the neighboring Chinese economy slowing and global demand stuttering, Hong Kong’s trade-dependent economy was facing a full-year deceleration even before protests over the government’s extradition bill began to disrupt business and tourism in June.
There is “no room for optimism for the second quarter and the entire year,” according to a statement from Hong Kong’s government late Tuesday that cited Chief Executive Carrie Lam’s remarks at a lunch for representatives of international and local chambers of commerce.
Lam said the territory’s economic momentum has weakened in recent months on the U.S.-China trade war and other “uncertainties,” while pledging to “spare no efforts” to deal with anti-government protests that risk harming the city’s growth.
“Mrs. Lam also said that the disputes in society in recent months are not conducive to Hong Kong’s continued development and that she would spare no efforts to deal with them,” according to the statement. “She pointed out that everyone should continue to have confidence in the city and she firmly believes that with the concerted efforts of various sectors, Hong Kong would find opportunities amid difficulties.”
Figures on Thursday may indicate retail sales dropped year-on-year for a fifth month in June, with demonstrations and the subsequent police crackdown deterring shopping and tourism.
What Bloomberg’s Economists Say...
“Carrie Lam says there is ‘no room for optimism’ on 2019 growth. We agree. Four important growth drivers for the former colony are exports, tourism, finance and property. On each of them, the signs are discouraging.”--Tom Orlik, chief economist. See his full HONG KONG INSIGHT
For more insight from Bloomberg Economics, click hereInternational companies are also feeling increasingly pessimistic about the city’s prospects, according to a survey of AmCham Hong Kong members.
“AmCham urges the government to stem any further damage and show clear leadership in meeting the expectations of Hong Kong people and in restoring the city’s international reputation for effective governance under the ‘one country, two systems’ framework,” AmCham President Tara Joseph said in a press release.
Small businesses in the city have also become much more pessimistic, with a sentiment index of small and medium companies dropping to the lowest in the seven years the survey has been conducted. The attitude of companies toward investment, sales, and profits all declined, as did all nine industry sub-indices, according to the results of the survey by  Standard Chartered  (LON:STAN) Plc."

House prices increased by 0.3% compared with a year earlier after rising by 0.5% in June, a level of growth that has only been weaker once since early 2013. A Reuters poll of economists had pointed to a 0.1% rise in July.
In monthly terms, house prices also rose by 0.3%, a touch stronger than the median forecast in the poll for a rise of 0.2% and up from 0.1% in June.
Nationwide chief economist Robert Gardner said uncertainty was weighing on the housing market which has slowed since the 2016 decision by voters to leave the European Union.
More than three years later, Britain has yet to leave the EU and many investors are worried about the possibility of a departure without the cushion of a transition deal on Oct. 31, the latest deadline for Brexit. 
""In the near term, healthy labor market conditions and low borrowing costs will provide underlying support, though uncertainty is likely to continue to exert a drag on sentiment and activity,"" Gardner said in a statement. 
Nationwide has reported annual price growth of less than 1% for eight months in a row, compared with about 5% at the time of the 2016 Brexit referendum.
However, the relatively stable pattern in the lender's figures this year echoes other indicators which suggest that a weakening of the housing market in 2018 might have bottomed out.
Bank of England figures published on Monday showed a stronger-than-expected rise in mortgage approvals.

A survey published earlier on Wednesday showed consumers remained relatively upbeat.

831,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 31, 2019 02:25AM ET</span>","Australia's Inflation Gets Boost From Higher Oil, Lower Currency","(Bloomberg) -- Australia’s inflation slightly exceeded forecasts in the three months through June as an earlier surge in oil prices filtered through the economy and a weaker currency showed some impact.
Consumer prices advanced 1.6% from a year ago and gained 0.6% from the first quarter, driven by a jump in fuel prices and a rise in overseas travel costs, data from the statistics bureau showed in Sydney Wednesday. Still, the core measures closely watched by the Reserve Bank mostly matched expectations.
“The recent weakening of the Australian dollar played a part, with international travel increasing,” said Sarah Hunter, head of macroeconomics at BIS Oxford Economics in Sydney. “With the headline rate now well below the RBA’s 2-3% target band, the data is very unlikely to alter the trajectory for the cash rate.” She forecasts another interest-rate cut in the fourth quarter and a potential further easing in “early 2020.”
The RBA has renewed its drive to return inflation to target, executing back-to-back rate cuts in June and July to try to drive down unemployment and force companies to offer higher pay. Like much of the developed world, Australia has struggled to generate price growth; its efforts have been further hampered by a government push to drive down costs ahead of an election.
The Aussie dollar is down more than 15% from its peak in January last year, reflected by tradables prices jumping 1.2% in the quarter. But non-tradables, which are affected by domestic variables, rose just 0.2% as the government’s campaign paid some dividends, with electricity prices edging lower.
While the currency impact is helpful, the effect isn’t as pronounced as in the past. Embattled retailers trying to fend off fierce competition from global rivals have been loath to pass on higher costs to already stretched consumers. Moreover, the depreciation is unlikely to be prolonged with major economies adopting easing biases and the Federal Reserve expected to cut this week.
The Aussie dollar rose after the report and was trading at 68.85 U.S. cents at 1 p.m. in Sydney.
“Low inflation speaks to deep underlying problems in the Australian economy,” said Callam Pickering, an economist at global jobs website Indeed, who previously worked at the central bank. He cited “low wage growth and high rates of underutilization that have persisted for a number of years.”
The economy’s weakness was reflected in bank lending data released simultaneously with CPI today. It advanced just 0.1% in June, with personal and business borrowing both declining, a worrying sign when growth has been weakening since the middle of last year.
The key driver of today’s rise in headline inflation was oil, which surged 27% in the first three months of the year before easing back a little in the second quarter. Crude’s impact takes time to work its way through the economy, demonstrated by fuel prices climbing from February through May, before falling back in June to reflect the global oil market."

The manufacturing purchasing managers’ index rose to 49.7 in July, led by better conditions for large companies. The below-50 reading still signals contraction, though is better than the median estimate of 49.6 in a survey of economists. The non-manufacturing gauge fell to 53.7.
A gauge of new export orders rose to 46.9 from 46.3, with the stronger result signaling some optimism just as trade talks with the U.S. resume in Shanghai. The Communist Party’s politburo meeting on Tuesday pledged to tackle ongoing tensions over trade “effectively” while offering incremental additions to stimulus policies.
“The PMI reading is unlikely to dispel growth concerns,’’ said Zhou Hao, a senior emerging market economist at  Commerzbank AG  (DE:CBKG) in Singapore. “High frequency data, such as weekly car sales, still point to somewhat weakening industrial activities and domestic demand.’’
July has more working days than June, which could also have helped lift production. Measures for output, new orders, employment, imports, purchasers’ quantity, input and export prices, backlogs of work and business activity expectation all improved from a month earlier. Still, small and medium enterprises saw a deterioration in conditions.
“Stimulus is having a positive impact, though a return to strong expansion is not coming anytime soon,’’ said Patrick Bennett, head of macro strategy for Asia at Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce in Hong Kong. “Signs of stabilization in recent activity data continue with this result.’’"
833,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 31, 2019 01:06AM ET</span>",Trade war keeps China's factories in reverse gear for third month,"By Lusha Zhang and Ryan Woo
BEIJING (Reuters) - China's factory activity shrank for the third month in a row in July, an official survey showed, underlining the growing strains on the world's second-biggest economy as the Sino-U.S. trade war hits business profits, confidence and investment.
Wednesday's weak manufacturing reading adds to global growth risks and explains why policymakers around the world have stepped up easing measures, with some others considering doing so soon, to counter the fallout from international trade frictions.
The Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) rose to 49.7 in July, from the previous month's 49.4, China's National Bureau of Statistics said on Wednesday, but remained below the 50-point mark that separates growth from contraction on a monthly basis. Analysts polled by Reuters had predicted a reading of 49.6.
Deteriorating global demand saw export orders shrinking for the 14th month, the survey showed, though the sub-index ticked up fractionally to 46.9 from June's 46.3.
The contraction in total new orders also moderated slightly, while factory output offered one brighter note, with growth quickening this month.
The official gauge came on the second day of U.S. and Chinese trade negotiators' meeting in Shanghai, their first in-person talks since a G20 truce last month, though expectations for progress remain low.
""We expect that this downward trend in manufacturing will continue in 2019 until the trade and technology negotiations make some progress,"" said Iris Pang, ING's Greater China economist.
In a row that has dragged on for more than a year, the world's two largest economies have slapped billions of dollars of tariffs on each other's imports, disrupting global supply chains and shaking financial markets. That has prompted central banks from South Korea to Australia to South Africa to cut rates, with the U.S. Federal Reserve also widely expected to ease later on Wednesday for the first time since the global financial crisis.
Sluggish demand at home and abroad has led to a months-long spell of depressed activity for China's manufacturers, and a sharp U.S. tariff hike announced in May threatens to crush already-thin profit margins.
The survey also showed persistent decline in orders from domestic customers, and even though demand conditions improved slightly it still remained worryingly weak despite a raft of recent stimulus measures.
Some manufactures have cut this year's sales target as clients delay purchase orders in a wait-and-see approach, while others have already relocated their production capacity to neighboring countries to avoid the tariff hit. All of this has seen Chinese factories continuing to shed jobs in July.
The pressure on the manufacturing sector and weakening profits have prompted analysts' warnings of a further period of stress for China before growth is expected to stabilize or recover.
MORE STIMULUS
The survey also showed small and mid-sized manufacturers fared worse than last month, while activity in larger companies, many of which are state-controlled, jumped back to expansion territory in July. That suggests policymakers' efforts to support the private sector are yet to bear fruit.
So far, Beijing has relied on a combination of fiscal stimulus and monetary easing to support an economy growing at its slowest pace in nearly 30 years, including hundreds of billions of dollars in infrastructure spending and tax cuts for companies.
But the economy has been slow to respond, and business confidence remains shaky, weighing on investment.
A separate official business survey showed activity in China's services sector grew at its slowest pace in eight months in July, knocked by growing pressure on the broader economy from U.S. trade measures, with the official reading at 53.7 in July from 54.2 in June.
Services growth was partly dragged by a contraction in the property sector, while activity in the construction industry also slumped, indicating recent fiscal stimulus is yet to fully flow through to infrastructure investment.
Beijing has been counting on a strong services sector to pick up the slack left by faltering trade as it tries to shift the economy away from a dependence on heavy industry and manufacturing exports.
China's top decision-making body of the ruling Communist Party said on Tuesday that government will step up efforts to boost demand and support the economy, but will not use the property market as a form of short-term stimulus.
""The Politburo meeting suggested government had no plans to loosen the real estate market. We expect property investment to slow in the second half of this year, and that would weigh on the construction sector,"" said Liu Xuezhi, an analyst with Bank of Communications.
China observers have said that Beijing's recent growth-boosting measures will take time to filter through to the broader economy, and many analysts are of the view that further stimulus is needed to prevent a deeper downturn and to help stabilize growth.
""With the headwinds to growth from U.S. tariffs, cooling global demand and tighter property controls likely to intensify, we continue to anticipate further monetary easing in the coming months,"" said Julian Evans-Pritchard, senior China economist at Capital Economics."

836,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 30, 2019 07:36PM ET</span>","Mood darkens for UK's smaller manufacturers, consumers stoic","LONDON (Reuters) - Optimism among smaller British manufacturers tumbled to a three-year low in July, hit by a slowing global economy and the Brexit crisis at home, although consumers remain relatively upbeat, surveys on Wednesday showed.
The Confederation of British Industry's (CBI) gauge of optimism among small- and medium-sized (SME) manufacturers fell to -28 from -12 in April, its lowest level since July 2016, just after Britain voted to leave the European Union.
A separate indicator of consumer confidence from market research company GfK rose unexpectedly in July to -11 from -13 in June, beating all forecasts in a Reuters poll of economists but broadly in line with its range this year.
Overall, the two figures chimed with other data that show deep pessimism in British businesses about the outlook but resilience among consumers.
Both surveys were conducted before Boris Johnson won the contest to become British prime minister on July 23 with a promise to leave the European Union on Oct. 31, with or without a deal.
""With orders falling and output and headcount stalling, the new Prime Minister must restore confidence and set out a pro-enterprise path that supports SME manufacturers,"" CBI economist Alpesh Paleja said.
""Securing a Brexit deal ahead of the October deadline remains a top priority for smaller manufacturers.""
Firms' optimism about export orders over the coming year was the lowest since April 2009, during the depths of the financial crisis, while domestic orders dropped at the fastest pace since April 2013 during the three months to July, the CBI said.
The GfK survey of just over 2,000 people, conducted for the European Commission, showed they were mostly upbeat about their personal financial prospects in the coming year, helped by wages rising at the fastest pace since the financial crisis.
""Consumers have generally been less affected by Brexit uncertainties than business since the referendum. However, the coming months to the October 31 departure date will test the strength of this confidence,"" GfK executive Joe Staton said.

837,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 30, 2019 01:14PM ET</span>","U.S. consumer spending, prices rise moderately","By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. consumer spending and prices rose moderately in June, pointing to slower economic growth and benign inflation that could see the Federal Reserve cutting interest rates on Wednesday for the first time in a decade.
The report from the Commerce Department on Tuesday showing the smallest gain in consumer spending in four months came as Fed officials started a two-day policy meeting. The 10-year old economic expansion, the longest in history, is slowing as the stimulus from last year's $1.5 trillion tax cut package fades. 
The economy is also facing headwinds from a bitter trade war between the United States and China, a likely disorderly exit from the European Union by Britain and weak global growth. With those risks in mind, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell early this month signaled the U.S. central would ease monetary policy soon. 
But a strong labor market and signs that the economy was not slowing abruptly have significantly reduced the probability of the Fed reducing borrowing costs by 50 basis points, as anticipated by financial markets earlier this month. President Donald Trump, who has been critical of the Fed, on Tuesday repeated his call for ""a large cut.""
""Nobody expects that the economy is now headed toward a rip-roaring second half of the year, but near-term concerns about a rapid weakening have diminished,"" said Jim Baird, chief investment officer at Plante Moran Financial Advisors in Kalamazoo, Michigan. 
Consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, gained 0.3% as an increase in services and outlays on other goods offset a decline in purchases of motor vehicles. Consumer spending rose 0.5% in May.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast consumer spending climbing 0.3% last month. The data was included in last Friday's second-quarter gross domestic product report, which showed consumer spending increased at a 4.3% annualized rate, accelerating from a tepid 1.1% pace in the January-March period.
Robust consumer spending blunted some of the hit to GDP from weak exports, business investment and a slowdown in inventory accumulation. The economy grew at a 2.1% rate last quarter, pulling back from the first quarter's brisk 3.1% pace.
Consumer prices as measured by the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index edged up 0.1% in June as food and energy prices fell. The PCE price index gained 0.1% in May. That kept the annual increase in the PCE price index at 1.4% for a second straight month.
Excluding the volatile food and energy components, the PCE price index rose 0.2% last month, increasing by the same margin for a third straight month. In the 12 months through June, the so-called core PCE price rose index to 1.6% after advancing 1.5% for three consecutive months.
The core PCE index is the Fed's preferred inflation measure and has undershot the central bank's 2% target this year.
The dollar was little changed versus a basket of currencies, with investors on the sidelines ahead of the Fed's rate decision. U.S. Treasury prices dipped and stocks on Wall Street were trading down. 
LOWER GROWTH PATH 
When adjusted for inflation, consumer spending gained 0.2% in June. This so-called real consumer spending rose 0.3% in May. Last month's small gain in core consumer spending likely sets up consumption for a step-down in the third quarter after the robust growth recorded in the April-June period.
""While we don't know much about the third quarter at this point, the trajectory for spending through June looks roughly consistent with our estimate for a 2.4% pace of real consumption growth in the third quarter,"" said Daniel Silver, an economist at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) in New York.
Consumer spending continues to be underpinned by strong confidence and job growth. In a separate report on Tuesday, the Conference Board said its consumer confidence index jumped 11.4 points to 135.7 in July, the highest reading this year.
The survey's so-called labor market differential, derived from data about respondents who think jobs are hard to get and those who think jobs are plentiful, rebounded to 33.4 from 28.2 in June, suggesting a drop in the unemployment rate in July. 
That measure closely correlates to the unemployment rate in the Labor Department's employment report. The government will publish July's employment report on Friday. Given robust consumer confidence some economists said further rate cuts were unlikely after Wednesday's anticipated 25 basis points reduction of the Fed's benchmark overnight interest rate.
""While the Fed is locked into a rate cut on Wednesday this report points to strength that is inconsistent with the need for an insurance cut and the case for one and done for now has grown,"" said John Ryding, chief economist at RDQ Economics in New York.
Last month, spending on goods rose 0.3%. Spending on services also rose 0.3%. Consumer spending in June was supported by a 0.4% rise in personal income, which followed a similar increase in May. Wages increased 0.5%. Savings shot up to $1.34 trillion from $1.31 trillion in May.
There were some encouraging signs on the housing market, which has contracted for six straight quarters, despite low mortgage rates. Housing has been hamstrung by expensive building materials and land and labor shortages, which are contributing to a dearth of homes for sale.
A third report on Tuesday showed the S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller composite index of home prices in 20 metropolitan areas rose 2.4% in May from a year ago after increasing 2.5% in April. House price inflation has been slowing after last year's surge in mortgage rates dampened demand for housing.

The moderation in prices and a sharp drop in mortgage rates this year have revived demand. Another report from the National Association of Realtors showed contracts to buy previously owned homes rose for a second straight month in June.

The Insolvency Service, a government agency, said 4,321 companies entered insolvency in the April-June period on an underlying basis, excluding bulk closures of personal service companies. This was up from 4,213 in the first quarter and marked the largest total since early 2014.
The figures showed fewer personal insolvencies, chiming with other data that show resilience among consumers but a muted picture of the business economy.
""Today's figures are evidence of a difficult period for UK businesses,"" Duncan Swift, president of insolvency and restructuring trade body R3, said.
""Businesses which stockpiled items ahead of the original Brexit deadline of 29 March will now be seeing those decisions have an impact on their cash flow levels.""

The number of personal insolvencies continued to decline after striking an eight-year high at the end of 2018, dropping to 30,937 in England and Wales in the second quarter from 31,346 in the first three months of 2019, the Insolvency Service said.
The fall masked some concerning trends, R3's Swift said.
While the number of less-severe forms of insolvency such as individual voluntary arrangements and debt relief orders declined in the first quarter, the number of full-blown bankruptcies rose to their highest since late 2014.
The rate of individuals entering insolvency over the year to June rose to 26.2 per 10,000 adults from 25.8 in the first quarter -- the highest rate since early 2012 and reflecting a spike in insolvency in late 2018, the figures showed.
""The situation is still serious for the UK's personal finances,"" Swift said."
840,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 30, 2019 05:27AM ET</span>",Euro zone economic sentiment declines as expected in July,"BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Euro zone economic sentiment continued to worsen as expected in July on less optimistic industry, services, retail trade and construction and inflation expectations among companies an consumers decreased as well, data showed on Tuesday.
The European Commission's monthly sentiment survey showed the overall index for the 19 countries sharing the euro at 102.7 points in July, down from 103.3 in June and 105.2 in May, a trend underlining the expected economic slowdown. Economists polled by Reuters had expected a deterioration to 102.6.
Last week, European Central Bank President Mario Draghi all but pledged to ease policy further amid the deteriorating growth outlook and even hinted at a reinterpretation of the ECB's inflation target.
Officials told Reuters last week an interest rate cut in September appeared certain, while government bond purchases and a revamped policy message were also likely. 
The fall of the sentiment index in July was caused mainly by lower optimism in industry, where the index fell to -7.4 from -5.6, an easing in services to 10.6 from 11.0 a fall in retail trade to -0.7 from 0.1 an in construction to 5.0 from 7.6.
Sentiment among consumers, however, improved to -6.6 from -7.2.
Separately, the Commission said its business climate indicator, which points to the phase of the business cycle, plunged to -0.12 points in July from 0.17 in June -- its lowest reading since September 2013 and much lower than the expected 0.08 in a Reuters poll of economists.

The Commission said inflation expectations among euro zone consumers 12 months ahead fell to 20.6 in July from 21.9 in June and 23.2 in May and selling price expectations in the manufacturing sector declined to 1.7 in July from 3.2 in June and 5.3 in May.

The euro zone's second-biggest economy grew 0.2% in the April-June period, down from 0.3% in the previous three months, according to preliminary data from the INSEE statistics agency.
That was just below a Reuters poll of 28 economists, which had an average estimate of 0.3%.
Household spending, the traditional motor of French growth, grew only 0.2%, slowing from 0.4% in the first quarter despite a more than 10 billion euro ($11.1 billion) package of measures launched by the government to boost purchasing power.
However, stronger business investment helped offset weaker consumer spending, growing 1.2% after 0.7% in the first quarter.
Exports grew 0.2% in the second quarter while imports were 0.1% higher, which meant foreign trade made no contribution to the overall growth rate.
While domestic demand added 0.4 percentage points to growth, companies running down their inventories rather than producing new goods knocked 0.2 percentage points off growth.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's factory output tumbled the most in nearly 1-1/2-years in June, data showed on Tuesday, adding to a slew of indicators suggesting slowing global growth and the bruising U.S.-China trade war were taking a toll on the export-reliant economy.
The data comes hours before the conclusion of the Bank of Japan's two-day policy meeting, where the board is expected to scrutinize the impact overseas risks could have on its view the economy will sustain a moderate recovery.
Industrial output sank 3.6% in June, government data showed, more than a median market forecast for a 2.0% drop. It was the worst slump since January 2018, and followed a 2.0% rise in the previous month.
Manufacturers surveyed by the government expect output to rise 2.7% in July and 0.6% in August, offering some hope that solid domestic demand will make up for some of the weakness in overseas shipments.
""Industrial output growth has been moving sideways,"" the government said, keeping its assessment on factory output unchanged.
On a quarter-to-quarter basis, output rose 0.5% in the April-June period after dropping 2.5% in the first three months of this year.
Manufacturing activity has weakened across the globe as simmering international trade tensions hurt business sentiment, forcing the International Monetary Fund to cut its global growth forecast and prodding some central banks to expand stimulus.
Japan has seen a similar pattern with manufacturers' sentiment having worsened, though service-sector activity remains firm as they are less vulnerable to the impact from slowing global trade. A trade row between Japan and South Korea is making matters more difficult for their manufacturers.
Most Asian economies, including Japan, are feeling additional pressure as China's growth cools to near 30-year lows.
Both Indonesia and South Korea cut their main rates by 25 basis points (bps) this month. And on Wednesday, the U.S. Federal Reserve is widely expected to deliver a 25 bp rate cut.
Yet, with robust domestic demand making up for weak Japanese exports, many BOJ officials see no imminent need to ramp up monetary support, and prefer to save its limited ammunition for when the economy faces bigger problems, sources with its thinking have said.

Japan's economy expanded an annualized 2.1% in the first quarter but many analysts expect growth to have slowed as the U.S.-China trade row hurts exports. October's scheduled sales tax hike may also curb consumption, they warn.

Power, LMC Automotive","(Reuters) - U.S. auto sales are expected to drop 1.8% in July from a year earlier, as higher prices continue to keep buyers away, according to industry consultants J.D. Power and LMC Automotive.
The consultancies estimate total U.S. vehicle sales of about 1.40 million units in July, with retail sales of new vehicles expected to drop 2% to 1.18 million units on a selling day adjusted basis, compared with a year earlier.
Despite the expected decline in sales, overall vehicle prices are seen touching new records in July, driven by buyers paying more for recently launched sports utility vehicles (SUVs).
""July will be another month of modest sales declines but with high vehicle expenditures as the average new vehicle sales price exceeds $33,000, up over $1,400 from July 2018,"" Thomas King, senior vice president of the data and analytics division at J.D. Power, said in a statement on Monday.
Average new vehicle retail transaction prices for July are on pace to reach $33,065, up from $31,767 a year ago, according to the consultants.
The average number of days a new vehicle remains with dealers before being sold to a retail customer are 73 days through July 21, up six days from a year earlier, while industry incentive spending is on pace to exceed $4,000 per unit for the month, the highest level since December 2018, the consultancies said.
""While trade risk remains a threat, transaction prices continue to rise and economic growth is moderating, sales in the second half of the year could outperform expectations,"" Jeff Schuster, president of LMC Automotive's Americas operations and global vehicle forecasts, said in the statement.
The two consultancies increased their forecast for 2019 total light-vehicle sales by 40,000 units to 17 million units, a 1.9% fall from the previous year.

845,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 29, 2019 07:58AM ET</span>","UK consumer lending growth sinks to five-year low in June, housing market picks up","By David Milliken and William Schomberg
LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's housing market appeared to benefit from a brief lull in Brexit worries last month, Bank of England data showed on Monday, but consumer lending growth was the weakest in over five years, adding to the mixed signals coming from the economy.
Uncertainty about Brexit has weighed on house prices, especially in London and southeastern England, since voters decided in June 2016 to leave the European Union.
But there have been signs of a stabilization coinciding with the decision to extend the original March 29 deadline for Britain's EU departure until the end of October, and the closely watched RICS poll of surveyors has recovered in recent months.
The BoE said the number of mortgages approved for house purchase rose to 66,440 in June from 65,647 in May.
That was the highest since January and above the average forecast from economists in a Reuters poll.
Net mortgage lending, which typically lags behind approvals, also rose more than expected, up by 3.7 billion pounds ($4.6 billion) in June.
""June's mortgage data ties in with the view that housing market activity has got some help from the avoidance of a disruptive Brexit at the end of March,"" Howard Archer, economist at EY ITEM Club, said.
Faster wage growth and a jobs boom are also supporting house prices but Archer said he expected them to rise by no more than 1.5% this year, roughly their current growth rate.
If Britain leaves the EU without a deal on Oct. 31 - something Prime Minister Boris Johnson says his government is actively preparing for - then house prices could quickly fall by around 5%, Archer added.
Last week industry body UK Finance reported the number of approvals for house purchase near a two-year high in June, while its measure of consumer lending growth picked up slightly. 
The BoE said net lending to consumers in June alone rose by 1.046 billion pounds, again faster than forecast and stronger than in recent months. 
However, it is lower than the average monthly increase of around 1.5 billion pounds chalked up in the 12 months to June 2018 and the annual rate of lending growth slowed to 5.5% from May's 5.7%, the weakest since April 2014.
British consumer spending has been a driving force of growth since the Brexit referendum, helping to offset a drying up of business investment. But in recent months it has lost momentum. 
The slowdown partly reflects strong spending a year ago, boosted by major sporting events, such as the men's soccer World Cup, and better weather.
By contrast, business lending rose by 2.6 billion pounds in June - above its post-referendum average - to give an annual growth rate of 4.4%, the highest since the series started in 2012.
""Firms haven't suddenly adopted a defensive mindset, despite the risk of a no-deal Brexit,"" Samuel Tombs, an economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said.
Increased borrowing was concentrated in larger firms, however, and borrowing by small businesses was almost flat.

A separate survey by Bibby Financial Services, which offers trade finance, reported that half of small businesses feared a recession this year and 44% were struggling with cashflow, in part due to pre-Brexit stockpiling of raw materials.

846,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 29, 2019 01:49AM ET</span>","China's Economy Weakened Further in July, Early Indicators Show","(Bloomberg) -- China’s economy continued to weaken in July, bolstering the case for greater policy support to shore up growth as talks over the trade dispute with the U.S continue.
The slowdown is seen in a Bloomberg Economics gauge aggregating the earliest available indicators on market sentiment and business conditions. While China and the U.S. will resume in-person negotiations this week after an almost three-month hiatus, small firms’ worries about business have deepened, a measure of exports is getting worse, and decelerating producer prices continue to squeeze profits.
China’s growth rate is on a long-term slowdown as the economy matures, but with trade and company profits shrinking and investment growth weak, the immediate outlook for the economy is still a source of concern for policy makers. While the resumption of talks with the U.S. renews some hope of a deal, deep divisions remain between the two sides.
“Trade disputes are still a key risk to both Chinese and other major economies,” according to David Qu from Bloomberg Economics. “Producer prices are under pressure, as material prices may be influenced by the concerns about trade, and as we see in the PMI surveys, domestic confidence is still subdued.”
The official purchasing managers’ surveys for this month are due for release on July 31.
The outlook for export-oriented small business eased in July, and an index gauging conditions for small companies slowed to the weakest in more than three years, with overall demand subdued and investment appetite down, according to economists from  Standard Chartered  (LON:STAN) Plc.
“We expect exporters to remain cautious on production and investment prospects, given weakening external demand on sluggish global growth and the protracted trade friction with the U.S.,” Standard Chartered economists Shen Lan and Ding Shuang wrote in a note.
Outbound shipments from South Korea also suggested weaker demand from overseas. Their exports fell 13.6% in the first 20 days of July from a year earlier, indicating shrinking demand for components from Chinese assemblers of electronics such as iPhones. Conditions reported by sales managers also weakened in the month due to low business confidence, especially in manufacturing, according to London-based World Economics Ltd.
Markets are anxiously looking for signals of any escalating policy support, with some expecting an announcement from the meeting of top-ranking leaders that’s due to happen soon in Beijing. However, the uncertainty of what will happen with the U.S. may mean that any action is limited for now. Policy makers have also stressed their commitment to moderate, targeted stimulus measures in order to avoid inflating asset prices.
“China’s second-half economic outlook continues to be clouded by great uncertainty over trade relations with the U.S., which in turn constrains its policy responses,” Liu Li-gang, chief China economist at  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C). in Hong Kong, wrote in a note. “Policy easing will continue, but any stimulus will be restrained to leave fiscal head-room if U.S.-China trade tensions re-escalate.”

Eighty-nine percent of respondents reported difficulty filling high-skill positions, up from 78% in the April survey, according to the National Association for Business Economics. At the same time, difficulty filling low- and mid-skill jobs eased moderately.
While firms continue to thirst for talent, some 73% of domestic companies, said they have made no changes to hiring or investments in response to U.S. trade policy. Within the goods-producing sector, 38% indicated they were delaying investments and 31% of companies said they were putting off hiring. The biggest adjustment among manufacturers was in supply chains, with 56% saying they had to make adjustments because of tariffs.
For the first time in seven years, reductions in prices were as common as increases, indicating scant inflationary pressures. Materials costs rose but increases weren’t as widespread. Thirty percent said materials costs rose over the past three months, down from 39% in April.
“More panelists report falling sales and lower profit margins at their firms over the past three months than in the previous survey,” survey chair Sam Kyei said in a statement."

SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korean exports probably fell in July for the eighth month in a row, but at a slower pace, as a trade rift with Japan dragged on an economy already hurting from weak global demand and the U.S.-China tariff war, a Reuters poll showed.
Exports in July were forecast to contract 11.3% from a year earlier, according to the median estimate of 18 economists surveyed, marginally better than a 13.7% fall in June - the biggest decline in nearly three-and-a-half years.
""It is hard to see (the smaller contraction in July) as a sign of recovery, since it results from one more working day from a year earlier,"" said Lee Sang-jae, an economist at Eugene Investment & Securities.
U.S. and Chinese trade negotiators meet in Shanghai this week for their first face-to-face meeting since a G20 truce last month, but expectations are low for a breakthrough.
South Korea's economy swung back to growth in the second quarter, dodging a technical recession, although the expansion was mostly driven by government spending, suggesting the central bank will cut rates again to stoke demand.
Earlier in July, the Bank of Korea delivered a surprise interest rate cut, while shaving this year's growth forecast to the lowest in a decade, as a brewing dispute with Japan piled more pressure on the trade-dependent economy.
""We certainly do not rule out another rate cut if economic data continues to deteriorate,"" said Defa Zhao, economist at Continuum Economics.
U.S. economic growth slowed less than expected in the second quarter helped by consumer spending, but financial markets expect the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates on Wednesday for the first time in a decade due to rising global uncertainties.
The poll also estimated that South Korea's imports this month would drop 8.1% from a year earlier, hit by Japan's export curbs on key chip and display production materials as well as weak domestic demand.
For the first 20 days of July, shipments fell a sharp 13.6% from a year earlier, while imports dropped 10.3% on year with those from Japan falling 14.5%, preliminary data showed.
Separately, 16 economists saw South Korea's consumer price inflation inching up to a median 0.9% in July in annual terms from 0.7% in June.
Earlier this month, the Bank of Korea trimmed its inflation estimate to 0.7% from 1.1% previously, which was already below its 2% target.
The survey also expects industrial output in June to have contracted by a seasonally adjusted 0.2% from May.
June industrial output data will be released at 8 a.m. on Wednesday local time (2300 GMT on Tuesday).

DAR ES SALAAM (Reuters) - Tanzania's economic growth slowed to 6.6% year-on-year in the first quarter of 2019 from 7.5% in the same period a year earlier, official data showed on Sunday, weighed down by softer construction, agriculture and manufacturing activity.
A leaked report from the International Monetary Fund said earlier this year that Tanzania's economy has not been expanding as fast as official figures suggest. It said lower growth was partly due to President John Magufuli's ""unpredictable and interventionist"" policies.
In the first quarter, construction, the biggest driver of GDP, grew 13.2%, compared with 15.6% a year ago, the state-run National Bureau of Statistics (NBS).
However, growth in the mining sector, which has been the target of repeated government interventions, rebounded to 10.0% from a 5.7% decline during the same period in 2018. Tanzania is Africa's fourth-largest gold producer.
""The growth (of the mining sector) was mainly due to an increase in production of gold, coal and diamonds,"" said NBS.
Magufuli embarked on an ambitious program of industrialization after coming to power in late 2015, investing billions of dollars in infrastructure, including a new rail line and a major hydropower plant and reviving the national airline.
But critics say government intervention in mining and agriculture have discouraged investment. Foreign direct investment has slumped and private sector lending growth dropped below 4% in 2018, from an average of 20% between 2013-16.
Agriculture, which accounts for about a third of economic activity, also slowed in the first quarter of this year, with crop production growing 6.0% compared to 8.9% in the same period last year, the statistics bureau said.
Last year the government sent the military to seize the cashew harvest, the main export crop, after complaints by farmers that prices offered by brokers were too low.
Manufacturing, another key GDP contributor, grew 4.8% in the first quarter compared with 5.3% a year earlier.
Tanzania's economy grew 7% last year, according to the government which has forecast 7.1% growth in 2019.
Earlier this month, however, the World Bank released its own estimates that said Tanzania's economy grew 5.2% in 2018.
Following the World Bank report, Tanzania said it might revise its 2018 GDP growth rate after meetings in August.
In April, a leaked report from the International Monetary Fund predicted lower growth of around 4-5% in the ""medium-term"".
The IMF report said there were serious weaknesses in Tanzania's official data."

The balance of firms reporting growth stood at -9%, indicating a less widespread slowdown than June's -13%, which was the weakest reading in nearly seven years, the CBI's monthly Growth Indicator showed.
An indicator measuring expectations for the next three months was the strongest since October last year at +9%.
Britain's economy has been whip-lashed by the twists and turns of Brexit so far in 2019 and by a slowdown in the global economy, caused in large part by rising trade tensions between the United States and China.
Growth was strong in the first three months of the year, as many companies tried to complete work before possible disruption after the original March 29 deadline for leaving the European Union, which has since been pushed back.
The hangover from that early 2019 rush is widely expected to have caused gross domestic product to flat-line or even contract in the second quarter.
""We expect underlying growth to remain subdued with risks from Brexit and global trade tensions remaining high,"" Annie Gascoyne, the CBI's director of economic policy, said.
Britain's new Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said he is prepared to lead Britain out of the EU without a deal on Oct. 31 if necessary.
That new Brexit deadline could cause a repeat of the stock-building seen in early 2019, some economists have said."
853,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 26, 2019 10:16PM ET</span>",China's industrial profits fell 3.1% year-on-year in June,"BEIJING (Reuters) - Profits earned by China's industrial firms contracted in June after a brief gain the previous month, fuelling concern that a slowdown in manufacturing from a bruising trade war will drag on economic growth. 
China's industrial profits have been softening since the second half of 2018 as the economy slowed and the U.S.-China trade dispute escalated, with many industrial firms putting off business decisions and scaling back manufacturing investment.
Economic growth in the second quarter slowed to a near 30-year low. 
Industrial profits fell 3.1% in June from a year earlier to 601.9 billion yuan ($87.5 billion), according to data released by the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) on Saturday, following a 1.1% gain in May.
In the first six months, industrial firms earned profits of 2.98 trillion yuan, down 2.4% from a year earlier, compared with a 2.3% drop in January-May.
The drop in first-half profits was driven by declining profits in the auto, oil processing and steel sectors, Zhu Hong of the statistics bureau said in a statement accompanying the data. 
Producer price inflation, one gauge of industrial profitability, eased to zero in June from a year earlier, rekindling worries about deflation, which could prompt authorities to launch more aggressive stimulus measures.
U.S. and Chinese negotiators will meet on Tuesday for the first time since their presidents, Donald Trump and Xi Jinping, agreed in late June to revive talks in a bid to end the year-long trade war.
The governments of the world's largest economies have levied billions of dollars of tariffs on each other's imports, disrupting global supply chains and shaking financial markets in the dispute over how China does business with the rest of the world.
June marked the first full month of higher U.S. tariffs on $200 billion of Chinese goods, which the United States imposed after trade talks broke down. Both exports and imports fell.
DIVERGING FORTUNES
Saturday's data showed that profits from the construction material and machinery industries helped cushion the fall in overall profits in the first half, likely due to higher government spending on infrastructure, which has supported some companies, such as railway equipment makers, miners and metal producers. 
Sany Heavy Industry Co Ltd said this month that it expected first-half profits to jump 91.8%-106.6% from a year earlier.
However, earnings for telecommunications and electronic equipment manufacturers, which are more vulnerable to U.S. tariffs than other product classes, declined 7.9% in Jan-June.
The most-actively traded iron ore contract on the Dalian Commodity Exchange rose 16.4% in June, weighing on profits in the steel sector. 
Profits at China's state-owned industrial firms were down 8.7% on an annual basis for the first six months, according to the statistics bureau.
Liabilities of industrial firms rose 5.6% year-on-year as of the end of June versus a 5.3% increase by end-May.

Private sector profits rose 6.0% in Jan-June, slowing from 6.6% in the first five months.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. economic growth slowed less than expected in the second quarter as a surge in consumer spending blunted some of the drag from declining exports and a smaller inventory build, which could further allay concerns about the economy's health.
But the fairly upbeat report from the Commerce Department on Friday had some red flags for the 10-year-old economic expansion, the longest on record. Business investment contracted for the first time in more than three years and housing declined for a sixth straight quarter.
Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell early this month flagged the two sectors as areas of weakness in the economy. They are likely to provide additional cover for the Fed to cut interest rates next Wednesday for the first time in a decade because of rising risks to the economy's outlook from a bitter trade war between the United States and China, and slowing global growth.
""The key to future economic growth is business spending. Evidently, businesses do not share the ebullience consumers have,"" said Sung Won Sohn, an economics professor at Loyola Marymount University in Los Angeles. ""This is not a good sign for the economy because there would be fewer jobs for consumers. For this reason, the Fed will cut rates next week.""
The Fed is widely expected to cut its benchmark rate by a quarter point at its July 30-31 meeting.
Gross domestic product increased at a 2.1% annualized rate in the second quarter, stepping down from an unrevised 3.1% pace in the January-March period. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast GDP increasing at a 1.8% rate in the second quarter. They estimate the speed at which the economy can grow over a long period without igniting inflation at between 1.7% and 2.0%.
President Donald Trump, whose administration has sought to boost the economy through a cocktail of massive tax cuts, government spending and deregulation, downplayed the slowdown in growth and blamed the Fed for the loss of momentum.
""Not bad considering we have the very heavy weight of the Federal Reserve anchor wrapped around our neck,"" Trump wrote on Twitter. ""Almost no inflation. USA is set to Zoom!""
Revisions to growth data published by the government on Friday also confirmed the economy missed the White House's 3.0% target in 2008, growing at a rate of 2.9%. When measured on a year-on-year basis the economy only expanded 2.5%, instead of 3.0% as previously estimated.
Trump, who likes to brag about the economy being one of the biggest successes of his first term, had highlighted the year-on-year growth figure as evidence of the effectiveness of his policies.
Economists, who are forecasting growth this year around 2.5%, say the massive fiscal stimulus, which included a $1.5 trillion tax cut package, had no lasting impact on growth, while driving up the country's debt.
""The data makes one thing clear, the tax cuts did not result in a permanent shift upward in the growth path of the U.S. economy,"" said Joe Brusuelas, chief economist at RSM in New York.
The GDP report showed a pickup in inflation last quarter, though the trend remained well below the Fed's 2% target.
The dollar rose to a two-month high versus a basket of currencies as robust consumer spending further diminished expectations of a more aggressive 50 basis point rate cut on Wednesday. U.S. Treasury yields slipped. Stocks hit record highs, also boosted by robust earnings from Google-owner Alphabet (O:GOOGL) and Twitter (N:TWTR).
STRONG CONSUMER SPENDING
Growth in consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, surged at a 4.3% rate in the second quarter, the fastest since the fourth quarter of 2017. That followed a more lackluster 1.1% growth rate in the first quarter, blamed on a 35-day partial shutdown of the government.
Spending is being supported by the lowest unemployment rate in nearly 50 years and helped offset some of the weakness from exports, which fell at a 5.2% rate last quarter after growing in the first quarter.
The plunge in exports led to a wider trade deficit, which subtracted 0.65 percentage point from GDP growth last quarter. Trade contributed 0.73 percentage point in the January-March period.
Robust consumer spending helped businesses to whittle down an inventory overhang. Inventory investment increased at a $71.7 billion rate, slowing from the first quarter's $116.0 billion pace of increase. Inventories cut 0.86 percentage point from GDP growth in the second quarter after adding 0.53 percentage point in the first quarter.
Economists said inventories still remained high and will continue to hurt manufacturing.
Business investment fell at a 0.6% rate in the second quarter, the first contraction since the first quarter of 2016. It was pulled down by a 10.6% pace of decline in spending on structures, depressed by decreases in commercial and healthcare, and mining exploration, shafts and wells.
Spending on intellectual products, including research and development, increased. Business spending on equipment rebounded at a 0.7% rate in the second quarter, but is seen constrained by design problems at aerospace giant Boeing (N:BA).
Boeing reported its biggest-ever quarterly loss on Wednesday due to the spiraling cost of resolving issues with its 737 MAX airplane, grounded worldwide in March after two fatal crashes in Ethiopia and Indonesia. It warned it might have to shut 737 MAX production completely if it runs into new hurdles with global regulators to getting its best-selling aircraft back in the air.
Growth in government investment accelerated, notching its best performance in 10 years, but spending on homebuilding contracted for a sixth straight quarter, the longest such stretch since the Great Recession."
855,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 26, 2019 12:21PM ET</span>",Mining drags on Mexico economic activity amid recession debate,"MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexico's economy activity was flat in May after the mining sector dragged down overall economic activity, fueling a debate over whether Latin America's second-largest economy is heading towards a recession.
The country's national statistics agency INEGI reported on Friday that economic activity was essentially flat from a month earlier but contracted 0.4 percent when compared with the same month a year earlier.
Mexico's preliminary economic data for the April-June period is due next week, and is likely to trigger further differences of opinion about whether Mexico is in a recession or heading that way.
The government is unlikely to accept that a small contraction in the economy is a recession, but private economists will argue that it marks a technical recession, after the economy shrunk in Q1.
Goldman Sachs' head of Latin American research Alberto Ramos highlighted in a research note that a 8.9% contraction in the mining sector compared to the same month a year earlier was largely to blame for the overall flat activity.
Mexico is the world's top silver producer and one of the largest producers of both copper and gold. The mining sector is an important part of the Mexican economy, contributing about 4 percent of its GDP.
Jonathan Heath, a former HSBC chief economist appointed to the central bank board by President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador's government, called the results in a Tweet ""not such bad news,"" considering that many had feared a larger contraction.
Newly appointed Finance Minister Arturo Herrera has said he was ""very, very far from thinking that we are close to a recession"" after some banks forecast second-quarter GDP results would show six months of contraction.
Earlier this week, Lopez Obrador criticized the use of GDP as a yardstick for development and past actions by the International Monetary Fund, which had lowered its GDP growth estimate for Mexico for this year to 0.9% from 1.6%.
Lopez Obrador reiterated his forecast for 2% growth this year and that his administration would measure its success in numbers on poverty reduction, wealth distribution as well as access to education and health services."
856,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 26, 2019 08:39AM ET</span>",U.S. economy misses Trump's 3% target in 2018,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. economic growth in 2018 missed the Trump administration's 3% target by any measure, which could renew criticism of the White House's $1.5 trillion in tax cuts. 
The Commerce Department said on Friday that gross domestic product increased at a 2.9% rate last year, confirming an estimate which was published in March. The department's annual revisions to GDP data also showed the economy growing 2.5% in the 12 months through the fourth quarter of 2018, down from the previously reported 3.0%.
President Donald Trump had highlighted the year-on-year growth figure as proof that the tax cuts and a government spending blitz, which have helped to swell the federal government deficit, had put the economy on a sustainable path of strong growth.
The White House and Republicans have argued that the massive tax cuts, which included slashing the corporate tax rate to 21% from 35%, would pay for themselves through strong economic growth. Democrats assailed the tax cuts as benefiting wealthy Americans at the expense of the middle-class. 
The updated GDP data, and signs that the economy shifted into lower gear in the second quarter after receiving a boost from exports and an accumulation of unsold goods in the first three months of 2019, are undercutting that argument.
Trump likes to showcase the economy as one of the biggest achievements of his first term in office, declaring last July that his administration had ""accomplished an economic turnaround of historic proportions."" On the campaign trail, Trump boasted he could boost annual GDP growth to 4%.
The downgrade to the 2018 year-on-year measure to below 3% may well irk a commander-in-chief who has been quick to blame the U.S. Federal Reserve in particular for actions he sees as stymieing his growth agenda. The Fed meets on interest rates next week, and Trump has already been jawboning policymakers to cut borrowing costs, which he says would allow the economy to take off ""like a rocket ship.""
Economists, though, have long cautioned that the 3% growth target was unrealistic, given low productivity among other factors. Economists estimate the economy's growth potential, or the pace at which it can expand without generating too much inflation, at around 2%. 
An alternative measure of economic growth, gross domestic income (GDI), rose 2.5% in 2018. The average of GDP and GDI, also referred to as gross domestic output and considered a better measure of economic activity, increased 2.7% in 2018.
The updated Commerce Department data also showed growth in the second and third quarters of last year was not as robust as previously estimated, and the economy grew much more slowly in the fourth quarter than had been reported in March. 
Still, the economy's performance in 2018 was an acceleration from the 2.4% growth notched in 2017. It matched the performance in 2015 during the Obama administration. The economy grew 2.8% in the 12 months through the fourth quarter of 2017.
The data also showed growth in consumer spending peaking in the second quarter and decelerating sharply in the final three months of 2018. 
Growth in the first quarter of 2018 was revised up to a 2.5% annualized rate from 2.2%. Second-quarter growth, which prompted Trump's mission accomplished declaration, was cut to a 3.5% pace from a 4.2% rate. Growth in the third quarter was slashed to a 2.9% rate from a 3.4% pace. Fourth-quarter GDP growth was lowered to a 1.1% pace from a 2.2% rate. 
The downward revisions to the three quarters largely reflected downgrades to business investment, suggesting corporations likely did not plow their tax windfall back into their businesses. Some companies like Apple (O:AAPL) used their windfall for share buybacks.

But the lower taxes boosted savings last year. The saving rate was raised to 7.7% from 6.7%, reflecting upward revisions to repatriated profit from the rest of the world. Corporate profit estimates were, however, marked down in both 2017 and 2018.

857,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 26, 2019 08:32AM ET</span>",U.S. Growth Slows to 2.1% as Trade Tensions Weigh on Businesses,"(Bloomberg) -- U.S. economic growth slowed in the second quarter by less than forecast as consumer spending topped estimates, though weaker business investment and exports underscored the risks spurring the Federal Reserve toward an interest-rate cut next week.
Gross domestic product expanded at a 2.1% percent annualized rate, according to Commerce Department data Friday that topped forecasts for 1.8%. That follows an unrevised 3.1% advance in first quarter and updated data showing growth last year was slower than previously reported.
Consumer spending, the biggest part of the economy, increased 4.3%, while government spending climbed 5% and offered the biggest boost in a decade. Nonresidential investment fell 0.6% for the first drop since 2015 and residential decreased for a sixth straight period.
The mixed report highlights how President Donald Trump -- who's repeatedly called for lower interest rates -- is enjoying signs of a solid economy while his trade war with China weighs on the expansion and fuels uncertainty for global businesses. Revised data released Friday showed the economy missed Trump's 3% growth goal in 2018, after previous data had showed it matching.
Friday’s report showed fresh evidence that trade is weighing on the expansion as exports dropped 5.2% while imports rose just 0.1%. Overall growth on a year-over-year basis slowed to 2.3%, the weakest pace in two years.
Economic Risks
The report on the broadest measure of all goods and services comes as Fed is expected to cut interest rates next week by a quarter point. The GDP report isn’t likely to sway that outcome, though officials are likely to consider the weakness in trade and corporate investment as risks to the economic outlook.
Excluding the volatile trade and inventories components of GDP, final sales to domestic purchasers increased at a 3.5% pace, the best in a year. Economists monitor this measure for a better sense of underlying demand. Inventories were a drag on growth, subtracting 0.86 point from growth after a 0.53 point contribution in the prior period.
The Fed's preferred underlying inflation measure, the personal consumption expenditures price index excluding food and energy, firmed to a 1.8% annual pace in the quarter, closer to policy makers' 2% objective.
The expansion, which this month became the longest on record, is cooling as the effects of the 2018 fiscal stimulus fade and global growth slows, with the International Monetary Fund again cutting its estimate earlier this week. A stronger dollar and new tariffs are also making it less desirable to do business with the U.S.
Other data have highlighted the cooler pace of growth, with manufacturing figures showing tepid conditions and bellwether  Caterpillar  Inc (NYSE:CAT). reporting a lackluster second quarter. A U.S. measure of production has declined in consecutive quarters, the common definition of recession, while a gauge of global factory activity contracted in May and June.
Orders Gaining
A more upbeat report Thursday showed business-equipment orders jumped in June by the most since early 2018, signaling company investment may be regaining momentum that would help support the economy in coming months.
Consumer sentiment is near historical highs and robust spending is backstopping growth. Retail sales have advanced for four straight months, the longest streak since early 2018, indicating Americans are benefiting from a tight labor market and elevated wages. Coffee chain  Starbucks Corp  (NASDAQ:SBUX). on Thursday said U.S. comparable-store sales soared 7% from a year earlier.
Trump targets growth of about 3%, though economists see the pace of growth remaining under 2% through at least the end of next year. Revised GDP figures released Friday show 2.5% growth on a fourth-quarter-to-fourth-quarter basis last year. That compares with a previous estimate of 3% and an upwardly revised 2.8% in 2017, the first year of Trump’s presidency.
Government spending got a boost from a 15.9% surge in federal nondefense expenditures, which contributed the most in two decades to growth. That was boosted by delayed compensation for some federal employees after the government shutdown that ended in January.

858,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 26, 2019 02:11AM ET</span>",UK economy's mixed signals hard to read for new PM Johnson,"By Andy Bruce
LONDON (Reuters) - Rarely has Britain's economic outlook been so unclear for a new prime minister as it is for Boris Johnson, with strengths such as the lowest unemployment in 44 years contrasting with signs in business surveys of a slowdown or even a recession.
More than three years into the Brexit crisis, Britain's economy probably slowed to a standstill in the April-June period and might even have contracted for the first time since 2012, economists say.
At least part of the weakness can be attributed to a hangover from a stockpiling boom in the run-up to the original Brexit date of March 29, when companies brought forward work to get ready for possible disruption.
But there are other suggestions of more underlying problems.
Below are some important gauges of the health of the world's fifth-biggest economy.
BUSINESS INVESTMENT
Business investment has flat-lined since the Conservative Party won the 2015 general election with a pledge to hold a referendum on membership of the European Union. That ended a rise which began after the financial crisis of 2008/09.
The malaise looks likely to continue as companies assess the risk that Britain leaves the EU on Oct. 31 without a deal, something Johnson has said he is prepared to do if he cannot strike a new agreement with the bloc.
(GRAPHIC: UK business investment - https://tmsnrt.rs/2y8zEmP)
On the face of it, the labor market is the strongest part of Britain's economy. The unemployment rate is the lowest since the three months to January 1975 and pay is rising at the fastest rate in a decade.
But there are also signs of weakness emerging. Employment growth slowed sharply in the three months to May and self-employment accounted for all the jobs added. The number of employees fell by the largest amount since 2011.
(GRAPHIC: Signs of slowing in UK jobs market - https://tmsnrt.rs/2Md2ACD)
ECONOMIC GROWTH
Official data showed strong growth of 0.5% in the first quarter from the last three months of 2018, fueled by the stockpiling boom.
The hangover from that rush and earlier-than-usual closures of auto plants in April, also linked to the March 29 Brexit deadline, mean gross domestic product probably showed zero growth or shrank in the second quarter.
Official GDP data is due on Aug. 9 but business surveys published recently have painted a picture of an economy struggling for momentum.
The closely watched IHS Markit/CIPS survey of the services sector is deep into territory associated in the past with interest rate cuts by the Bank of England.
(GRAPHIC: UK economy stalling-PMI - https://tmsnrt.rs/2MbbgcD)
GOVERNMENT FINANCES
The new finance minister is under less immediate pressure to fix the public finances than his most recent predecessors but he will have only limited resources to boost government spending or cut taxes, as promised by Johnson in his leadership campaign.
Britain's headline measure of total government debt stands at more than 1.6 trillion pounds ($2.0 trillion), equivalent to 75% of economic output, down only slightly from historic peacetime highs of more than 80% a few years ago.
Britain's budget deficit has shrunk to just over 1% of GDP in the last financial year from nearly 10% a decade ago, but official budget forecasters predicted in March that it will rise again this year.
That forecast did not take into account the higher spending and tax cuts pledged by Johnson during his campaign, nor the hit to the public finances that would follow a no-deal Brexit.
(GRAPHIC: UK public finances - https://tmsnrt.rs/2OeFspO)
HOUSING MARKET
The housing market slowed after the 2016 Brexit vote, especially in London where house prices fell at the fastest rate since the financial crisis in the 12 months to May, according to official data.
But there are signs that the worst of the slowdown may have passed.
The Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors says the housing market showed tentative signs of recovery in June as interest among buyers rose for the first time since just after the Brexit referendum, and sales also staged a rare increase.

859,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 26, 2019 01:36AM ET</span>","Asian firms cut capex, weakening outlook for demand and jobs","By Patturaja Murugaboopathy and Gaurav Dogra
(Reuters) - Asian firms have cut back capital spending this year, and that means a recovery in regional earnings, jobs and overall demand could take a while.
A Reuters analysis of 6,500 major Asian companies, with comparable financial data available, showed their cumulative capital expenditures in January-March fell 1% to $198.7 billion - the first annual decline for a quarter in two years.
Tensions from the U.S.-China trade war, the risk of disrupted supply chains and waning demand have weighed on business confidence and spending this year.
The decline in capital expenditure (capex) suggests that the weak global growth momentum could persist until there's a meaningful recovery in confidence.
The analysis showed that tech and industrial firms - the two sectors caught in the trade war crossfire - led the capex declines in the March quarter.
Tencent Holdings Ltd (HK:0700), Samsung Electronics (KS:005930), Hangzhou Hikvision Digital Technology Co Ltd (SZ:002415) and MediaTek Inc (TW:2454) were among the Asian firms that cut their capex by more than 25% in the quarter from a year earlier, the data showed.
(GRAPHIC: Asia companies capex - https://tmsnrt.rs/2MelOYj)
The trade war and softening in global demand led to the decline in capex in Asia, said Alicia Garcia Herrero, chief Asia Pacific economist at Natixis SA in Hong Kong.
Changes in the global supply chain mean ""corporates need to rethink their future plans"", especially tech firms that can face ""strong sanction power by the U.S.,"" she said.
Rob Subbaraman, head of global macro research at Nomura, said South Korea, Taiwan, Singapore and Malaysia could have weak corporate capex this year, given their open economies with high exposure to tech and China.
Stalling factory activity in most Asian economies has raised concerns over the manufacturing sector's productivity and profits.
In China, Asia's economic powerhouse, and in Japan, manufacturing surveys have been weak.
(GRAPHIC: Asia manufacturing PMI - https://tmsnrt.rs/2Me5VBe)
A Reuters analysis of Refinitiv data showed cumulative profits of about 1,300 top Asian firms likely fell for the third consecutive quarter in April-June.
(GRAPHIC: Profit growth for Asian firms - https://tmsnrt.rs/32M3L1M)
While Asian central banks have started to cut their interest rates, following the Federal Reserve's dovish turn, some analysts doubt this will help revive corporate spending in the region.
""Although relocation of supply chains will form part of new capital expenditure, corporates will be more conservative in expansion,"" said Natixis's Garcia Herrero, adding that falling interest rates with reduce debt burdens ""but not necessarily mean corporates will invest""."

Dwelling values jumped 1.5% in the three months through June 30, the steepest gain since the second quarter of 2018, according to final data from the Urban Redevelopment Authority released Friday.
The government introduced cooling measures to slow price increases just over a year ago, in early July 2018. They included raising stamp duties for second homes and tightening loan-to-value limits for housing loans granted by financial institutions. The curbs didn’t take long to have an impact, with home prices falling for a second straight quarter in the three months through March 31.

862,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 26, 2019 01:27AM ET</span>",North Korea's Economy Shrinks by Most Since 1990s Famine,"(Bloomberg) -- North Korea’s economy shrank last year by the most since the peak of its 1990s famine, as international sanctions make it harder for Kim Jong Un to feed his people while developing nuclear weapons.
Gross domestic product contracted 4.1% in 2018, according to estimates from South Korea’s central bank. This marks the worst performance since 1997 when a series of droughts, floods and botched economic policies caused a deadly famine. GDP shrank 3.5% in 2017.
North Korea’s exports plunged 86% to just $240 million, while imports fell 31%, the Seoul-based Bank of Korea said Friday. About 90% of North Korean shipments go to China, the country’s biggest ally. China has beefed up its enforcement of sanctions since Pyongyang’s sixth nuclear test in 2017.
The annual report highlights the cost of defiance as North Korea holds on to nuclear weapons development despite tightening sanctions. Kim this week resumed launching ballistic missiles and unveiled the country’s largest submarine yet, even though just weeks earlier he met with U.S. President Donald Trump to rekindle nuclear talks.
“Sanctions have clearly bitten North Korea,” said Kim Suk-Jin, a researcher at the Korea Institute for National Unification. “It shows prominently in the drop in exports.”
The chance of starvation on a similar scale as before may be unlikely, because unofficial markets have mushroomed across the country under the tacit consent of the government. North Korea’s economy also shrank for nine years in a row during the 90s, while it contracted only four years in the 2010s.
With the Pyongyang regime not releasing official data, the BOK is regarded as the most authoritative source for economic analysis on its neighbor, though there are limits.
It’s not just North Korean industries suffering. The government is also struggling with a lack of money, South Korean lawmaker Kim Min-ki told reporters on July 16, citing a briefing by the National Intelligence Service. Crops in stock for this year are expected to dry up “early,” he said.
Per capita income in North Korea was estimated at 1.4 million won ($1,205) in 2018, or about 3.9% that of South Korea, the BOK said.
Statistics from other institutes also show the food situation is worsening. Paddy production fell at least 17% last year in provinces that account for half of North Korea’s rice, while sanctions have led to shortages of necessary agricultural items, including machinery and spare parts, the World Food Program and Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations said in a May assessment.
Estimates vary, but the number of people who died from starvation between 1994 and 2000 probably totaled from hundreds of thousands to more than a million, according to the Korea Institute for National Unification.
Below are further details from the BOK, which bases its calculations on data obtained from a range of South Korean agencies:
The agricultural and fisheries industry shrank 1.8% last year, the most since 2010. Mining -- a cash cow for North Korea until sanctions started to target exports of iron ore, minerals and other resources -- contracted 17.8%, the biggest since estimates began in 1990. Manufacturing industry shrank 9.1%, while services industry managed a 0.9% increase.North Korea has seen a boost in tourism from China in recent years."

SEOUL (Reuters) - North Korea's economy shrank in 2018 for a second straight year, and by the most in 21 years, as it was battered by international sanctions aimed at stopping its nuclear program and by drought, South Korea's central bank said on Friday.
North Korea's gross domestic product (GDP) contracted by 4.1% last year in real terms, the worst since 1997 and the second consecutive year of decline after a 3.5% fall in 2017, the South's Bank of Korea estimated.
North Korea does not disclose any statistics on its economy. The South Korean central bank has been publishing its estimates since 1991, based on information from various sources including the South's foreign trading agencies.
""Sanctions that were added and strengthened in 2017 had a severe impact as drought hurt the farming sector, which accounts for more than 20% of output,"" Park Yung-hwan, head of the Bank of Korea's National Accounts Coordination Team, told reporters.
North Korea's international trade fell 48.4% in value in 2018 as toughened international sanctions cut exports by nearly 90%, the worst loss in exports since the central bank started publishing data nearly 30 years ago.
Output in the mining sector shrank 17.8% because of sanctions on exports of coal and minerals, while the agriculture, forestry and fisheries sector contracted by 1.8% because of drought, it said.
North Korea's population was estimated at 25.13 million and annual income per head at $1,298, the South Korean central bank said.
The troubles facing an economy already functioning badly because of inefficiencies and isolation, likely explain North Korea's efforts to throw off sanctions in it negotiations with the United States.
""The economy couldn't but contract severely given the sanctions that North Korea is under,"" said Benjamin Katzeff Silberstein, a North Korea economy expert with the U.S.-based Stimson Center.
""This suggests that there's been a massive increase in domestic use of coal and minerals. This is such a crucial export commodity and now that very little of it is being sold abroad, as compared to normal years, domestic industry is probably getting financially doped by cheap energy at the moment given how much of production is still going on,"" he said.
SANCTIONS, DROUGHT
The United States and South Korea say tightening international sanctions over North Korea's nuclear weapon and ballistic missile programs have been instrumental in leader Kim Jong Un's decision to pursue denuclearization talks with the United States. 
North Korea has sought relief from the sanctions, but denies that it has or will ever be politically swayed by them.
Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump have met three times since June last year. 
In February, their second summit collapsed after they were unable to narrow differences between a U.S. demand for the North's complete denuclearization and a North Korean demand for sanctions relief.
The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies said last week rates of malnutrition and disease were increasing in North Korea as it faces a harvest that is half of what was expected.
James Belgrave, an official at the U.N. World Food Programme who visited North Korea in April, said recently that there had been a drop of up to 20% in North Korea's wheat and barley production due to an early dry spell.
""The wheat and barley crops did look very dry and were visibly affected – patchy development, shorter than they should have been, and agricultural officers in the counties were worried,"" Belgrave told Reuters.
North Korea lacks adequate agricultural infrastructure, farming techniques and fertilizers, and sporadic famines are common, according to experts based in South Korea.

In the 1990s, a nationwide famine killed as many as one million people.

BUENOS AIRES (Reuters) - Argentina's economic activity rose for the first time in over a year in May, a rare boost for President Mauricio Macri as he looks to dig the South American country out of a crippling recession ahead of presidential elections later this year.
The 2.6% rise versus the same month a year ago topped even the most optimistic estimates from analysts polled by Reuters, and broke a run of 12 consecutive months of falling economic activity.
The monthly growth will come as welcome news for Macri, whose popularity has taken a pounding from a tumbling economy. The center-right leader faces a tight election race against a resurgent opposition ahead of an Oct. 27 vote.
Argentina's Treasury said the rise was due to strong growth from the farming sector, which it said was up nearly 50% versus a year ago, as well as improvements in sectors including transport, industry, commerce and construction.
""Looking forward, it is expected the agricultural campaign, which unlike 2018 enjoyed good weather conditions, will continue to contribute to growth,"" the ministry said, adding better salaries and lower inflation should also help.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - New orders for key U.S.-made capital goods surged in June, suggesting some improvement in business investment, but economic growth is still expected to have slowed sharply in the second quarter amid weaker exports and a smaller inventory build.
Still, the longest U.S. economic expansion on record remains supported by a strong labor market. Other data on Thursday showed the number of Americans filing claims for unemployment benefits dropped to a three-month low last week.
The economy has been hurt by the U.S.-China trade war and slowing growth overseas. These factors are expected to encourage the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates next Wednesday for the first time in a decade.
The Commerce Department said orders for non-defense capital goods excluding aircraft, a closely watched proxy for business spending plans, jumped 1.9% last month after rising 0.3% in May.
Orders for these so-called core capital goods in June increased across the board, with demand for machinery rising by the most in nearly 1-1/2 years. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast core capital goods orders would gain 0.2% in June.
""The stronger-than-expected orders are a positive sign that business investment and manufacturing sector activity have not weakened substantially further following softness earlier in the year,"" said Veronica Clark, an economist at Citi in New York.
Core capital goods orders rose 1.9% on a year-on-year basis. Core capital goods shipments, which are used to calculate equipment spending in the government's gross domestic product measurement, increased 0.6% in June after advancing 0.5% in the prior month. 
The third straight monthly increase in core capital goods orders did little to change expectations that business spending on equipment contracted in the second quarter after falling in the January-March period for the first time in three years.
The government will publish its snapshot of second-quarter GDP on Friday. According to a Reuters survey of economists, GDP likely increased at a 1.8% annualized rate in the April-June quarter, moderating from the first quarter's brisk 3.1% pace.
The dollar slipped against a basket of currencies after European Central Bank President Mario Draghi signaled another round of monetary easing but expressed caution about pulling the trigger too quickly. U.S. Treasury prices fell. Stocks on Wall Street were trading lower.
'SLOWED NOTABLY'
Business investment and housing have been flagged by the Fed as areas of weakness in the economy. 
Fed Chairman Jerome Powell early this month described business investment as appearing to have ""slowed notably,"" saying this might ""reflect concerns about trade tensions and slower growth in the global economy.""
June's surge in core capital goods orders suggests a pickup in business spending on equipment, but economists cautioned that the strength could be short-lived given an inventory glut in the motor vehicles industry and design problems at Boeing (NYSE:BA) that are helping to undercut the manufacturing sector. 
Manufacturing accounts for about 12% of the economy. The sector's woes were highlighted by  Caterpillar  (NYSE:CAT), which on Wednesday reported earnings below Wall Street's estimates and said its full-year profits were expected to be at the lower end of its earlier forecast.
Boeing also reported its biggest-ever quarterly loss on Wednesday due to the spiraling cost of resolving issues with its 737 MAX and warned it might have to shut production of the grounded jet completely if it runs into new hurdles with global regulators to getting its best-selling aircraft back in the air.
The single-aisle plane was grounded worldwide in March after two fatal crashes in Ethiopia and Indonesia. Production of the aircraft has been reduced and deliveries suspended.
Overall orders for durable goods, items ranging from toasters to aircraft that are meant to last three years or more, increased 2.0% in June, the most since August 2018, after declining 2.3% in the prior month. Unfilled orders fell for a second straight month.
""Nevertheless, with the incoming global data still deteriorating and domestic capacity utilization falling, we still expect overall business investment to remain weak in the second half of the year,"" said Michael Pearce, a senior U.S. economist at Capital Economics in New York. 
In a second report on Thursday, the Commerce Department said the goods trade deficit fell 1.2% to $74.2 billion in June, with imports dropping $4.6 billion to $210.5 billion. Imports fell broadly last month, potentially hinting at some cooling in domestic demand after gaining speed in recent months.
Goods exports fell $3.7 billion to $136.3 billion last month. The decline was across the board, with exports of consumer goods tumbling 10.9%, the largest drop since 1989.
Despite the smaller trade deficit in June, trade was probably a drag on GDP growth in the second quarter. Falling imports and exports also suggest the White House's ""America First"" policies are hampering trade flows, which economists say are hurting the global economy.

The Commerce Department also said wholesale inventories rose 0.2% after increasing 0.4% in May. Stocks at retailers fell 0.1% last month following a 0.3% rise in May. The slowdown in inventory growth reflects an acceleration in consumer spending in the second quarter.

The regional central bank's composite manufacturing index dipped to -1 in July, which was the lowest level since -2 in August 2016. It was zero in June.
“Regional factory growth remained basically flat this month, and a number of firms noted increased uncertainty because of trade concerns and weaker domestic demand,” Kansas City Fed economist Chad Wilkerson said in a statement.
“However, nearly 80% of manufacturing contacts reported confidence in their local economy,” Wilkerson said.
The survey's six-month outlook gauge was 9, down from 11 in June.
The Kansas City Fed serves Kansas, Colorado, Nebraska, Oklahoma and Wyoming, and parts of Missouri and New Mexico.
On Tuesday, the Richmond Fed said its regional factory barometer took a record drop in July to its lowest level since January 2013.
On the other hand, regional manufacturing gauges from the New York and Philadelphia central banks rebounded this month from steep declines in June.

869,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 25, 2019 11:08AM ET</span>",U.S. Economic Growth Seen Stumbling as Trade Hits Companies,"(Bloomberg) -- Terms of Trade is a daily newsletter that untangles a world embroiled in trade wars. Sign up here. 
Trade tensions likely helped push down U.S. economic growth last quarter to match the slowest pace of Donald Trump’s presidency, with a robust consumer keeping things from looking even worse.
Gross domestic product figures due Friday will likely show business investment weakened, despite getting a late-quarter boost from higher equipment orders in June. Uncertainty from the yearlong U.S.-China tariff war compounded weakness stemming from slowing global growth and falling oil prices.
GDP rose 1.8% on an annualized basis in the second quarter, according to the median projection of analysts, which would be the slowest since 2017.
Net exports and inventories probably took a substantial bite in the April-June period, unwinding gains from the first quarter and reflecting fluctuations in companies’ stockpiles -- before and after various Trump tariff deadlines.
Together those items undercut what likely was the strongest increase in consumer spending since 2014. Continued solid gains in jobs and wages prevented growth from sinking into the doldrums -- at least for now.
‘‘The biggest factor weighing on growth is a rather sizable swing downward in inventories and net exports -- so they were the biggest contributors in the first quarter and they’ll be the biggest drag on the second quarter,” said Ellen Zentner, chief U.S. economist at  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS).
The GDP report is unlikely to make much difference in a widely anticipated Federal Reserve move next week to cut interest rates by a quarter point. But the data will provide more detail on the state of the U.S. economy to help frame the central bank’s thinking on whether to follow up with additional easing this year, as investors are predicting.
The report, which will include annual revisions to data going back to 2014, is due at 8:30 a.m. in Washington.
While the 1.8% growth estimate isn’t far below the average rate during a relatively tepid expansion, it would still be the weakest since Trump took office in the first quarter of 2017. And it would mark a sharp decline from the 3.1% pace at the start of 2019.
Data Thursday showed a proxy for business investment jumped in June by the most since early 2018, aiding second-quarter GDP and indicating momentum for the third quarter. But a wider-than-expected merchandise-trade deficit and below-forecast inventories signaled a bigger drag from those items that overshadowed the more positive report.
The Atlanta Fed’s GDPNow tracking estimate for second-quarter growth fell to 1.3% from 1.6% after Thursday’s data.
What Our Economists Say
“While headline growth will be considerably slower than it was in the first quarter, the underlying fundamentals will be much more encouraging as consumer spending proves, once again, that it is up to the task of shouldering an outsized share of GDP gains.”-- Carl Riccadonna, Eliza Winger and Yelena Shulyatyeva
The Trump administration targets annual growth of 3% and the president has frequently complained that the Fed’s interest-rate increases under Chairman Jerome Powell have held back the economy.
But it’s the trade war that’s partly holding things back now.
Companies are hesitating to expand as they wait to see if the U.S. and China resolve their differences, according to the Fed’s Beige Book and other anecdotal evidence.  Caterpillar  Inc (NYSE:CAT)., a frequent economic bellwether, said Wednesday that tariffs are boosting production costs and competition in China is eating into sales.
The grounding of Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co.’s 737 Max jet for safety reasons is also denting the economy, with the company’s plane orders slowing to a trickle. The Institute for Supply Management’s index of manufacturers’ new orders fell in June to the lowest level since 2015, suggesting broader factory weakness will persist in coming months.
Trade Deficit
A widening trade deficit and less inventory accumulation may have knocked as much as 1.7 percentage point off the headline growth figure, ING Bank NV estimated before Thursday’s data. Those categories added a combined 1.5 point to growth in the first quarter. Imports likely jumped last quarter before the U.S. and China reached a trade truce in late June.
“There certainly was still a lot of flux as far as businesses looking at the outlook in regards to trade and having to manage around that,” said Sam Bullard, senior economist at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) & Co.
Even so, the headwinds haven’t made much impact on the chief pillar of the economy -- consumer outlays, which probably climbed at a 4% pace during the period. Consumption looks to have rebounded from a paltry 0.9% first-quarter rate, which reflected the federal government shutdown and extremely cold weather in parts of the U.S.
“The good news is that the consumer came roaring back in the second quarter,” said Ryan Sweet, head of monetary-policy research at Moody’s Analytics Inc. “When you strip out net exports and inventories, that’s really the engine of the economy.”
With companies continuing to add workers at an elevated pace, and wage gains remaining solid, the Fed is seen favoring a less-dramatic quarter-point cut over a half-point reduction. The bigger question is whether the headwinds start filtering through to consumers.
“Does that potentially bleed over into the service sector and consumer spending? That’s what they’re looking at hard right now,” Bullard said."

Initial claims for state unemployment benefits dropped 10,000 to a seasonally adjusted 206,000 for the week ended July 20, the lowest level since mid-April, the Labor Department said on Thursday. Data for the prior week was unrevised.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast claims would increase to 219,000 in the latest week. The Labor Department said no claims were estimated last week.
The four-week moving average of initial claims, considered a better measure of labor market trends as it irons out week-to-week volatility, fell 5,750 to 213,000 last week.
Layoffs remain low despite a bitter trade war between the United States and China, which has helped to cloud the economic outlook and boost expectations the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates next Wednesday for the first time in a decade.
Thursday's claims report also showed the number of people receiving benefits after an initial week of aid fell 13,000 to 1.68 million for the week ended July 13. The four-week moving average of the so-called continuing claims slipped 4,500 to 1.70 million.
The continuing claims data covered the week the government surveyed households for July's unemployment rate.
The four-week average of continuing claims rose 9,000 between the June and July survey weeks, suggesting little change in the jobless rate this month. The unemployment rate ticked up one-tenth of a percentage point to 3.7% in June."

The data bodes ill for Germany's export-reliant economy which has been hit hard by weaker foreign demand, trade disputes and Brexit uncertainty.
The Ifo institute said its business climate index fell to 95.7 from an upwardly revised 97.5 in June. The July reading undershot a consensus forecast for 97.1.
It was the fourth monthly decline in a row and marked the lowest level since April 2013.
""The most important German economic indicator suggests that the German economy is heading toward a recession,"" VP Bank analyst Thomas Gitzel said.
Ifo President Clemens Fuest said the German economy was navigating troubled waters, adding that companies were less satisfied with their current business situation and were also looking ahead with increased scepticism.
""In manufacturing, the business climate indicator is in freefall,"" Fuest said, with the sub-index for the sector posting its biggest drop since February 2009.

The Ifo figures chimed with a survey among purchasing managers released on Wednesday that showed the recession in manufacturing worsened in July with the performance of German goods producers dropping to the lowest level in seven years.

SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea's economy swung back to growth in the second quarter, dodging a technical recession, although the expansion was mostly driven by government spending, suggesting the central bank may need to cut rates again to stoke demand.
Gross domestic product grew by a seasonally adjusted 1.1% in the April-June period from the first quarter, central bank estimates showed, just beating the median forecast of 1.0% growth tipped in a Reuters survey of 12 economists.
However, the Bank of Korea estimates showed the economy would have contracted without increased government spending, following previous quarter's surprise contraction.
""Details of the GDP data confirmed the economy has been dependant on government spending and support my expectation of another interest rate cut in the fourth quarter,"" said Park Sang-hyun, economist at HI Investment & Securities.
Heavily reliant on exports of chips, smartphones, autos and ships, South Korea's economy has been hit especially hard by the year-long China-U.S. trade dispute, which has hurt supply chains and global growth.
BOK estimates showed government spending contributed 1.3 percentage points to second-quarter GDP while private-sector activity presented a 0.2 percentage point drag as companies slashed investment due to the uncertain outlook.
Last week, the BOK cut interest rates for the first time in three years, earlier than market expectations for a cut in August, and trimmed its 2019 economic growth forecast to a decade low of 2.2% from the previous 2.5%.
South Korea's economy shrank 0.4% in the first quarter due to delays in government spending as private investment also slowed.
On a year-on-year basis, Asia's fourth-largest economy expanded 2.1% in the second quarter, compared with 2.0% growth forecast in the poll and 1.7% growth in the first quarter, the central bank estimated.
Merchandise exports returned to growth of 2.3% in the April-June period after a 3.2% contraction in the first, which was the worst reading since the final quarter of 2017.
But export prospects remain uncertain as Japan has curbed chip and display production materials shipments to South Korea, which Seoul says is related to a diplomatic row over compensation of forced labor during World War Two.
The BOK said in a report to parliament on Tuesday that Japan's export curbs were one of the top three risks to the domestic economy. Governor Lee Ju-yeol added that this year's growth could dip further due to the curbs.
Analysts have downgraded their forecasts for 2019 growth, with some seeing growth falling short of 2%.

""The current run of pay awards at 2.5% looks set to continue as we head into the quieter months of the pay bargaining year,"" XpertHR analyst Sheila Attwood said.
Until about a year ago annual pay settlements in Britain averaged around 2%, but they have risen as employers found it harder to recruit staff.
Average weekly earnings - an official statistic that also includes pay rises from promotions and job changes - rose at their fastest annual rate in more than a decade at 3.6% in the three months to May.
Consumer price inflation, Britain's main inflation benchmark, held at 2% in June.
XpertHR's data showed that over the past year, median pay deals in the private sector were 2.5% while public sector pay rises averaged 2.3%.
On Monday, Britain's finance ministry said it planned to offer pay rises of more than 2% to teachers, senior doctors, police, prison guards and the military this year.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Sales of new U.S. single-family homes rebounded sharply in June, but sales for the prior three months were revised down, indicating that the housing market continued to tread water despite lower mortgage rates and a strong labor market.
Other data on Wednesday showed manufacturing activity slowing to a near 10-year low in early July, with production volumes and purchases falling. Weak housing and manufacturing are offsetting strong consumer spending, holding back the economy and posing a threat to the longest expansion in history. 
Worries about slowing growth, especially tied to trade tensions between the United States and China, and weakness overseas are likely to encourage the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates next Wednesday for the first time in a decade.
The Commerce Department said new home sales rebounded 7.0% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 646,000 units last month. May's sales pace was revised down to 604,000 units from the previously reported 626,000 units. 
Data for March and April was also revised down. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast new home sales, which account for about 11% of housing market sales, increasing 6.0% to a pace of 660,000 units in June. New home sales are drawn from permits and tend to be volatile on a month-to-month basis. Sales increased 4.5% from a year ago. 
""There is no evidence here to change the narrative that the response of the housing market to lower mortgage rates has been underwhelming,"" said John Ryding, chief economist at RDQ Economics in New York. ""The best description of home sales is that they have leveled out in the neighborhood of 620,000.""
The 30-year fixed mortgage rate has dropped to an average of 3.81% from a more than seven-year peak of 4.94% in November, according to data from mortgage finance agency Freddie Mac.
New home sales in the South, which accounts for the bulk of transactions, rose 0.3% in June to a 13-month high. Sales in the Midwest dropped 26.3% to their lowest level since September 2015. Sales in the West rebounded 50.4%, the biggest gain since August 2010, more than recouping May's 38.5% plunge.
In the Northeast, sales dropped for the second straight month, hitting their lowest level in eight months.
While cheaper mortgage rates and the lowest unemployment rate in nearly 50 years are supporting demand for housing, expensive materials and land and labor shortages are constraining builders' ability to produce sought after lower-priced homes. The median new house price was unchanged at $310,400 in June from a year ago. There were 338,000 new homes on the market last month, up 0.6% from May.
HOUSES TOO EXPENSIVE 
""Half of today's buyers are looking for homes under $288,000,"" said Robert Frick, corporate economist at Navy Federal Credit Union in Vienna, Virginia. ""The building industry is constrained by a lack of labor and lots zoned for building, so they tend to devote their resources to higher-margin houses.""
The housing market hit a soft patch last year and has since struggled to gain traction, with residential investment contracting for five straight quarters. A report on Tuesday showed home resales tumbled in June as tight supply pushed previously owned house prices to a record high. 
While single-family homebuilding rebounded in June, permits increased moderately and continued to lag housing starts. 
June's largely weak housing data left economists anticipating that residential investment contracted again in the second quarter, contributing to an expected slowdown in economic growth last quarter. 
According to a Reuters survey of economists, gross domestic product likely increased at a 1.8% annualized rate in the April-June quarter, moderating from the first quarter's brisk 3.1% pace. The government will publish its snapshot of second-quarter GDP on Friday. 
The dollar was little changed against a basket of currencies, while U.S. Treasury prices rose. Stocks on Wall Street were mixed after disappointing earnings from  Caterpillar  (N:CAT) and Boeing (N:BA), which reported its biggest loss in decades.
The earnings reports from Caterpillar and Boeing underscore the manufacturing sector's struggles. In a separate report on Wednesday, data firm IHS Markit said its Flash U.S. manufacturing PMI slipped to a reading of 50.0 in July, the lowest since September 2009, from 50.6 in June. 
The reading is in line with the neutral 50.0 threshold, which IHS Markit said signaled stagnant manufacturing business conditions. Manufacturing, which accounts for about 12% of the U.S. economy, is being hobbled by an inventory overhang, especially in the automobile sector.
The U.S.-China trade tensions and weak global demand are also undercutting the sector.
IHS Markit said while production levels dropped slightly early this month, the rate of decline was the biggest since August 2009. It also noted that a decrease in factory employment had ended a six-year period of sustained job creation across the manufacturing sector.

The data firm said a downturn in the automotive sector and heightened global economic uncertainty were factors behind the loss of momentum in manufacturing early this month.

Real estate consultancy Colliers International (O:CIGI) forecast housing prices in one of the world's most expensive property markets will fall 4% in the second half, but still rise 6% for the full year.
Hong Kong has been rocked by a series of sometimes violent protests for over two months against an extradition bill - its most serious crisis since the city was handed back by Britain to China in 1997 but with democratic freedoms under a ""one country, two systems"" formula.
Tourism numbers are falling in the wake of the demonstrations, with retailers and hoteliers warning of slowing sales.
""The social incident has an impact on the market sentiment, but not yet much on prices,"" said Daniel Shih, senior director of valuation & advisory services of Colliers International Hong Kong.
""Buyers are just being more prudent and adopting a 'wait-and-see' approach.""
He told a news conference that the fundamentals of Hong Kong's economy and property market have not changed much, adding
that expectations of lower interest rates will also support housing prices in the second half.
Separately, realtor Midland's Hong Kong residential CEO Sammy Po said home transactions and prices in districts where violent clashes broke out were affected. But he added that overall sales volumes, especially for small to medium-sized properties, were still solid.
""From past experiences, political events have little impact on the property market,"" Po said.
He forecast housing prices would rise another 3% to 5% in the second half, resulting in a gain of 12% for the full year.

SYDNEY/MELBOURNE (Reuters) - Most world economies from Germany to Japan are bearing the brunt of an interminable U.S.-China trade war but one country that has been insulated from the blow so far is Australia, which is rolling in record export dollars. 
Iron ore prices are hitting new highs, yet the Aussie dollar is wallowing near recent lows while Chinese demand for Australian goods has remained strong, proving to be a triple bonanza for the A$1.9 trillion ($1.3 trillion) economy.
In 2018, exports of goods and services from Australia jumped 13% from 2017. In the five months to May, as the trade war intensified, they rose 15% from a year earlier.
The export boom is providing Australia's newly re-elected government with more fiscal firepower to prop up the country's struggling economy, which is expanding at its slowest pace since the 2008 global financial crisis.
It has also lifted the Reserve Bank of Australia's (RBA) confidence, with Governor Philip Lowe recently saying ""a pickup in the resources sector"" was supporting the economic outlook. Exports account for about a quarter of gross domestic product (GDP).
""Trade is a big support for the Aussie economy,"" said Sydney-based CommSec economist Ryan Felsman, who expects Australia's record stretch of 28 years of recession-free growth to extend awhile. 
""There are uncertainties around global trade, but Australia has been weathering the storm,"" Felsman added. ""The economy is in a slow lane but the support from trade is certainly helping.""
Indeed, a series of record trade surpluses might even have gifted Australia its first current account surplus in four decades last quarter from a deficit of A$2.9 billion - the smallest since 1979.
This comes at a time when global growth is slowing, hurt largely by the escalating tariff dispute between the United States and China which has hit trade and, in turn, business sentiment around the world.
(GRAPHIC: Australian exports are on the rise, A$ depreciating - https://tmsnrt.rs/32LDl07) 
'ONE-TRICK PONY?'
Australia has been the biggest beneficiary of a recent surge in prices of its top export, iron ore, after a dam disaster in Brazil crimped global supply. Shanghai iron ore prices hit a 5-1/2 year peak of $126.5 earlier this month. 
Iron ore's share of Australia's total exports to China is 43%. But China is also a big buyer of Aussie coal and foods such as dairy and meat, while education and tourism are major attractions too.
Australian exports aimed solely at Chinese domestic consumption have been rising. 
They now account for 5% of Australia's GDP, larger than the value added of the country's retail industry at 4.6%, according to an analysis by Commonwealth Bank of Australia based on data from the Asian Development Bank.
Surprisingly, that demand is equally led by both mining and non-mining industries, the analysis showed. 
""Australia's exports to China are much deeper and wider than just exports of iron ore to make steel for Chinese fixed investment,"" said Joseph Capurso, Sydney-based senior currency strategist at CBA. 
""We hope this goes some way to busting the myth that the Australia-China trade relationship is a one-trick pony based on iron ore.""
A third factor helping Australia's economy is a weaker Aussie dollar .
The commodity-linked currency has been on a slippery slope for much of this year, boosting Australian exporters' revenues. It is currently trading around $0.7000, compared with around $0.90 during the mining boom. 
The broken link between soaring exports and the depreciating local dollar has led the government of Prime Minister Scott Morrison to promise a budget surplus this year after a decade of shortfalls.

NO FLOW
The Aussie dollar has been weighed by expectations that interest rates in Australia will stay low for a long time to come after the RBA cut rates twice since June to a record low 1% and as miners have so far held back from hefty capital works.
Some analysts see the Aussie sliding to $0.65 this year on expectations the RBA will take interest rates deeper into record territory, a move that would further support export revenues.
The benefit of strong external demand and prices is not felt across the economy, though. In the current cycle, global miners such as BHP Billiton (AX:BHP) (L:BHPB) are no longer seen splurging. They are hiring fewer people and doling out smaller pay hikes, government data shows. 
Capital spending by Australia's top three iron ore miners had reached $45 billion in 2011/12. It is now around $13 billion.
Still, economists are hopeful exports will come to the rescue yet again.
""More fiscal stimulus is likely to be required and this will be made possible by stronger-than-expected tax revenues on the back of the surging iron ore price,"" AMP economist Shane Oliver said.
""Ultimately the combination of rate cuts, fiscal stimulus, the lower Aussie dollar, infrastructure spending, stronger mining investment and hopefully continuing solid export demand will see Australia avoid recession and growth pick up again sometime next year.""

Consumer demand has generally been robust since Britain voted to leave the European Union in June 2016, but the housing market has slowed, especially in London and surrounding areas.
Bank of England Chief Economist Andy Haldane said on Tuesday that there were signs the slowdown in the housing market had bottomed out.
The number of mortgages approved for house purchase rose to 42,653 in June, on a seasonally-adjusted basis, up from 42,407 in May and close to April's two-year high of 42,792.

Household lending expanded by 3.3%, keeping a steady growth pace for the fifth straight month, and corporate lending grew by 3.8%, in line with May. This suggested that the recent economic slowdown has yet to significantly dent bank lending.
Still, with economic growth slowing sharply this year on weak export demand for manufactured goods, the ECB has already flagged more policy easing and the only question is whether it pulls the trigger at Thursday's policy meeting or wait until September.
While market expectations for policy action are split, some point out that the economy has appeared to stabilize with confidence indicators steadying, unemployment still falling and the ECB's own lending survey pointing to modest but steady activity ahead.
The annual growth rate of the M3 measure of money supply, which often foreshadows future activity, grew by 4.5% in June after 4.8% in May, trailing forecasts for 4.7%.

LONDON, (Reuters) - Euro zone business growth was weaker than expected in July, hampered by a deepening contraction in manufacturing, and forward-looking indicators in surveys published on Wednesday suggest conditions will get worse next month.
That will make disappointing reading for policymakers at the European Central Bank, who are expected to signal on Thursday a bias toward cutting its already-negative deposit rate this year to try to boost growth and inflation.
Doing little to dispel those expectations, IHS Markit's Flash Composite Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI), considered a good guide to economic health, dropped to 51.5 this month from a final June reading of 52.2, missing the median expectation in a Reuters poll for 52.1 and closer to the 50 mark separating growth from contraction.
""It's a pretty gloomy picture,"" said Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit.
""People are saying they expect the year ahead to be harder given rising geopolitical concerns, Brexit becoming an increasing worry and rising trade tensions.""
Williamson said the PMI suggested economic growth of 0.2% - or possibly as low as 0.1% - this quarter, weaker than the 0.3%
predicted in a Reuters poll.
A PMI for the bloc's dominant service industry fell to 53.3 from June's 53.6, matching the median Reuters poll forecast.
Manufacturing activity contracted for a sixth month and at its sharpest rate since late 2012. The factory PMI fell to 46.4 from 47.6, below all forecasts in a Reuters poll which had predicted no change from June's reading.
An index measuring output, which feeds into the composite PMI, sank to 47.0 from 48.5 - its lowest reading since April
2013.
""The divergence between the two sectors is unusually wide. The question remains - how long can services continue to grow while manufacturing is in this deepening downturn,"" Williamson said.
Demand for manufactured goods fell at the second fastest rate in over six years and factories again turned to completing old orders to stay active. The backlogs of work index fell to a seven-year low of 43.3 from 45.5.
Services firms also suffered from weak demand and they cut back on hiring. The employment index fell to 53.5 from 54.2.
As forward-looking indicators were painting a downbeat picture, businesses across the euro zone grew less optimistic. The future output index fell to 58.5 from 59.2, its lowest since October 2014.

Markit's flash composite Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI), which tracks the manufacturing and services sectors that together account for more than two thirds of the economy, fell to 51.4 from 52.6 in the previous month.
That undershot analysts' consensus forecast of 52.3 and was the lowest reading since March, though it still remained above
the 50 mark that separates growth from contraction.
The drop was driven by a decline of the manufacturing sub-index which fell to 43.1 from 45.0. The latest reading was the lowest since July 2012.
""The health of German manufacturing went from bad to worse in July,"" said Phil Smith, Principal Economist at IHS Markit. He pointed to an accelerated drop in export orders, the most marked seen in over a decade.
""The automobile industry is the business sector which is under pressure the most,"" IHS Markit economist Chris Williamson
said. He blamed trade disputes, Brexit and falling demand from abroad for German cars as well as other industrial products.
The survey figures and other economic data from Germany suggest a slight contraction of gross domestic product in both
the second and third quarter which together would be viewed as a technical recession, Williamson said.
The contagion of the manufacturing crisis to other sectors of the economy so far had remained limited, however, as Germany's solid labor market and robust household spending were providing a buffer against external shocks.
""The services sector remains encouragingly resilient,"" Williamson said.
The PMI sub-index for business activity in services eased slightly to 55.4 from 55.8 in June.

52.7 in June, below a forecast of 52.5 points.
A reading above 50 indicates that activity is expanding, while anything below that level signifies a contraction.
The services PMI fell to 52.2 points from 52.9, while the manufacturing PMI declined to 50.0 from 51.9, with both those

""Following a seven-month high in June, growth of the French private sector eased at the start of the third quarter. The slowdown was driven by softer new order growth, as sales at manufacturers slipped back into contraction territory at a time of ongoing geopolitical tensions,"" said IHS Markit economist Eliot Kerr.

Inflation has been mild since an unpopular consumption tax was scrapped in June 2018, while transport costs have declined amid a government effort to cap domestic fuel prices.
The consumer price index climbed 1.5% from a year earlier in June, the fastest since May 2018, when it rose 1.8%. A Reuters poll had forecast a 1.6% rise.
The annual inflation rate had remained unchanged at 0.2% for the past three months.
Inflation in June saw increases in 10 out of the 12 groups tracked in the index, particularly household furnishings and equipment, recreational services, and utilities, data from the Statistics Department showed.
Costs, however, were down in the transport and clothing sectors, the data showed.
In May, Malaysia's central bank cut its key interest rate for the first time since 2016, amid low inflation and concerns over slowing economic growth.  
Bank Negara Malaysia (BNM) has said it expected headline inflation to be broadly more stable compared to 2018.
Inflation is likely to remain moderate amid slowing global economic growth, analysts have said.

But the country's services sector showed signs of picking up, offsetting some of the pressure on the economy.
The Jibun Bank Flash Japan Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) edged up to a seasonally adjusted 49.6 from a final 49.3 in the previous month, but stayed below the 50.0 threshold that separates contraction from expansion for a third month.
Factory output, total new orders and new export orders again contracted, though at a slightly more modest pace compared with June.
""Weak demand from China remained a key factor behind sluggish demand for Japanese goods,"" said Joe Hayes, economist at IHS Markit, which compiles the survey.
""Heightened frictions between Japan and South Korea also add downside risk to the manufacturing supply chain in Japan, creating additional slack that services may once again have to compensate for.""
Japan this month tightened restrictions on the export to South Korea of three materials used in South Korean high-tech equipment, such as chips and smartphone displays.
Employment offered a bright spot, with the jobs index up at 51.3 from a final 50.8 in the previous month with companies hiring workers at a three-month high.
However, firms' backlogs of work remained at more than six-year lows, and they continued to cut back on purchases of raw materials.
Separate data showed Japanese service activity expanded. That, in turn, helped lift a composite PMI index which includes both manufacturing and services.
The Jibun Bank Flash Japan Services PMI climbed to 52.3 in July, up from a final 51.9 in June on a seasonally adjusted basis, their highest level since February.
If sustained, solid growth in services could help offset external pressure on the export-reliant economy, which is suffering from slowing global demand and the U.S.-China trade war.
Japan is exposed to the dispute as it exports big volumes of electronics items and heavy machinery to China which are used to make finished goods shipped to the United States.
A recent string of gloomy data, including faltering exports and slumping core machinery orders, offered the latest warning sign of the world's third-largest economy's exposure to a global growth slowdown.

886,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 23, 2019 07:41PM ET</span>",Cracks in home building sector rattle Australia's economy,"By Tom Westbrook
SYDNEY (Reuters) - At the height of Australia's residential property boom two years ago, Sydney builder Toby Searle couldn't get carpenters and bricklayers to return his phone calls, such was the demand for workers.
Now he can't stop them ringing. ""All of a sudden we were getting emails, phone calls, people coming to site and dropping business cards off just looking to get a foot in the door,"" he said. ""Some guys would be struggling out there.""
Demand for new building work has slowed to a crawl, with home building approvals in May plunging to six-year lows, in concert with tighter lending and a sharp slide in home values.
The pullback, in a construction sector that employs nearly a tenth of the national workforce, is weighing on the faltering economy just as the central bank puts unemployment and underemployment at the top of its list of hard-to-fix problems.
Then there is the knock-on effect, as the dwindling appetite for building ricochets through the supply chain, slowing land releases, crimping sales in timberyards, and driving layoffs from labor hire firms to engineers and architects.
""We've clear evidence of projects put on ice,"" architect Greg Barnett told Reuters in the offices of his Sydney firm, where the slowdown has meant laying off about 10% of his 100-strong workforce of designers.
""We knew it was coming, but not as severe as it has. It's been a very quick stop.""
'JOBS ARE AT THEIR ZENITH'
As home prices in Sydney and Melbourne have posted their sharpest drops in a generation, falling by 11% and 15% respectively from peaks in 2017, plans for property development and house construction have dried up.
A fall in home building approvals, which hit their lowest since 2013, is now flowing through to work underway.
Trade hours worked posted their sharpest fall in more than three years, dropping 2.5% in May, according to Australian Bureau of Statistics data, and the industry expects more to come.
""Our jobs under construction are at their zenith,"" said Peter Levinge, chief executive of family-owned Melbourne home-building company, Dennis Family Corporation, which has some 670 jobs in progress.
""Over the next 12 months or so, that will start to fall away as the pipeline decreases,"" he told Reuters in a telephone interview.
""If you're not filling your pipeline at the same rate as you're taking jobs to site, obviously that forces your workforce, or your use of subcontracted labor, to diminish.""
To be sure, other construction sectors are picking up some slack, with office and infrastructure building still strong, keeping overall construction levels not far below their 2018 peak.
And recent signs the property market has stabilized have driven a lift in inquiries at Levigne's Melbourne sales offices that has him optimistic.
But few in the industry expect a meaningful improvement within a year, which will leave tradesmen from carpenters to bricklayers scrambling for work in the meantime.
""Land sales have been pretty slow for the last 12 months,"" said Jack Hoffman, general manager for Australia's largest privately owned land developer, Satterley Property Group, which had people queuing for land sales in Victoria state a year ago.
""If sales of land slow down, then home building will slow down as well,"" he said, while hoping for a pickup ""perhaps some time next year"".
QUIETENED UP
It may not be soon enough. Australia's central bank is counting on labor market strength to lift wages and inflation while it cuts interest rates to record lows to try and stimulate growth.
Australia's economy is growing at its slowest in a decade, and weakness across the construction supply chain will only weigh further.
It has already prompted building supplier Boral Ltd (AX:BLD) to cut its domestic outlook and New Zealand-headquartered Fletcher Building Ltd (NZ:FBU) to warn last month of a deeper-than-expected hit to its Australian building supplies outlets.
Timberyards which struggled to fill orders two years ago have turned quiet and so have the phones at labor hire firms.
""A lot of our clients are telling us that they're a bit quieter,"" said Sorcha Hunter, director of Hunter Labour Hire, a Sydney-based firm that provides workers for residential and commercial building projects across the city.
The sentiment has investors at once gloomy and on the lookout for bargains.
""I wouldn't say I'm particularly confident about the building cycle in Australia,"" said Simon Mawhinney, chief investment officer at fund manager Allan Gray, who expects a further downturn in the sector.
""But it's also important to look at these things from the perspective of how much you pay,"" he added, noting a recent investment in supplier CSR Ltd (AX:CSR) had performed well, with the stock lifting from multi-year lows after asset sales.
Nevertheless, those on the coalface are steeling themselves for tough times ahead. ""It's definitely quietened up,"" Sydney builder Charlie Kobayati said.
""We're being undercut. People are getting desperate."""

888,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 23, 2019 01:36PM ET</span>",U.S. existing home sales drop more than expected in June,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S home sales fell more than expected in June as a persistent shortage of properties pushed prices to a record high, indicating the housing market was struggling to regain speed since hitting a soft patch last year. 
Housing and manufacturing are the main areas of weakness in the economy. They are offsetting strong consumer spending, resulting in a slowdown in economic activity that, together with trade tensions and tepid global growth, could see the Federal Reserve cutting interest rates next Wednesday for the first time in a decade.
The National Association of Realtors said on Tuesday existing home sales dropped 1.7% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.27 million units last month. The median existing house price increased 4.3% from a year ago to an all-time high of $285,700 in June. 
""Meager inventory levels, especially in the entry-level segment, and still-rising prices continue to limit the selection of homes available to more budget-conscious buyers,"" said Matthew Speakman, an economist at Zillow.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast existing home sales slipping 0.2% to a rate of 5.33 million units in June. Existing home sales, which make up about 90% of home sales, decreased 2.2% from a year ago. That was the 16th straight year-on-year decline in home sales.
The weakness in housing comes despite cheaper mortgage rates and the lowest unemployment rate in nearly 50 years. 
Supply has continued to lag, especially in the lower-price segment of the housing market because of land and labor shortages, as well as expensive building materials. The government reported last week that permits for future home construction dropped to a two-year low in June.
According to the NAR, there was a 19% drop from a year earlier in sales of houses priced $100,000 and below. The Realtors group said there was strong demand in this market segment, but not enough homes for sale. 
The NAR also said last year's revamp of the U.S. tax code, which reduced the amount of mortgage interest payments homeowners could deduct, was weighing on demand for homes priced at $1 million and above. 
The 30-year fixed mortgage rate has dropped to an average of 3.81% from a more than seven-year peak of 4.94% in November, according to data from mortgage finance agency Freddie Mac. 
Last month, existing home sales rose in the Northeast and Midwest. They tumbled in the populous South and in the West.
June's drop in existing homes sales likely means less in brokers' commissions, which suggests that housing probably remained a drag on gross domestic product in the second quarter. Spending on homebuilding contracted in the first quarter, the fifth straight quarterly decline.
The Atlanta Fed is forecasting GDP rising at a 1.6% annualized rate in the second quarter. The economy grew at a 3.1% rate in the January-March period. The government will publish it snapshot of second-quarter GDP on Friday.
The PHLX housing index (HGX) fell, underperforming a broadly firmer U.S. stock market that was boosted by upbeat earnings and forecasts from Coca-Cola (N:KO) and United Technologies (N:UTX). The dollar rose to a five-week high against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices were mixed.
TIGHT INVENTORY
There were 1.93 million previously owned homes on the market in June, up from 1.91 million in May and unchanged from a year ago. The tight inventory boosted house price inflation, which had been slowing after a jump in mortgage rates last year dampened demand for housing.
Economists, however, do not believe the re-acceleration in home prices reported by the NAR is a true picture of home values. In a separate report on Tuesday, the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) said its house price index rose a seasonally adjusted 5.0% in May from a year ago, slowing from an increase of 5.2% in April.
""We believe that the FHFA index is the more reliable indicator because the price measures reported in the existing home sales report don't control for changes in the mix of sales,"" said Daniel Silver, an economist at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) in New York. ""The FHFA index continues to show that the pace of appreciation has been cooling lately, which is a message consistent with several other related measures.""
Last month, houses for sale typically stayed on the market for 27 days, up from 26 days in May and a year ago. Fifty-six percent of homes sold in June were on the market for less than a month. At June's sales pace, it would take 4.4 months to exhaust the current inventory, up from 4.3 months in May. 

A six-to-seven-month supply is viewed as a healthy balance between supply and demand. First-time buyers accounted for 35% of sales last month, up from 32% in May and 31% a year ago. Economists and realtors say a 40% share of first-time buyers is needed for a robust housing market.

The increase comes as the deadly African swine fever disease spreads across the world's top pig herd, slashing output and pushing prices of the country's favorite meat up.
China's pork imports for the first six months of the year came in at 818,703 tonnes, up 26.3% from a year earlier.
China's wholesale pork prices rose rapidly in the first-half of March, triggering large purchases of meat from overseas markets, including the United States. They have been rising rapidly again in recent weeks, with China's average wholesale pork prices rising 36.4% from a year earlier to 23.76 yuan ($3.45) per kg as of July 19.
Retail pork prices have also increased in recent weeks but at a slower pace than whole sale prices, with prices up 34.6% from a year earlier at 27.29 yuan per kg as of July 10.
Meanwhile, China's first-half pork output fell less-than-expected, declining 5.5% to 24.7 million tonnes of pork, as it tackled the devastating disease.
China's agriculture ministry is investigating local veterinary authorities in 10 provinces as it tries to slow the ongoing spread of the deadly African swine fever virus.
African swine fever kills almost all pigs it infects but does not harm people. There is no vaccine or cure.

While data early in the financial year does not always offer a good guide to full-year performance, due to changes in the timings of payments and provisional spending data, Friday's figures showed public spending running ahead of forecast.
In March Britain's Office for Budget Responsibility forecast public borrowing would rise from a 16-year low of 1.1% of economic output in 2018/19 to 1.3% of GDP or 29.3 billion pounds in 2019/20.
However on Thursday it predicted borrowing could jump by 30 billion pounds a year in 2020/21 if Britain leaves the EU without a transition deal on Oct. 31, triggering a recession.
Both candidates to succeed Theresa May as prime minister in an ongoing Conservative Party leadership contest have said they will keep the option of a no-deal Brexit on the table.
The OBR also described Boris Johnson's and Jeremy Hunt's campaign pledges of tax cuts and increased spending as ""expensive"" and said commitment to fiscal discipline was slipping after years of public spending restraint.
Finance minister Philip Hammond expects to lose his job, and neither candidate has endorsed Hammond's budget goals of keeping the budget deficit below 2% of GDP and lowering public debt as a share of GDP.
Friday's figures showed that public sector net debt totaled 83.1% of GDP in June, excluding public-sector banks, or 74.8% once the effect of a temporary Bank of England lending scheme was stripped out too.
Britain's debt-to-GDP ratio was below 40% before the 2008/09 financial crisis."
894,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 19, 2019 01:43AM ET</span>","Japan's core inflation hits two-year low, might push BOJ to ease again soon","By Kaori Kaneko
TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's core inflation slowed to its weakest in about two years in June, data showed on Friday, underlining the nation's long battle to boost consumer prices and adding to speculation the Bank of Japan could deliver more stimulus later this month.
With the global economy slowing and factory production faltering in the face of a bruising Sino-U.S. trade war, BOJ officials have said they remain ready to expand stimulus, joining the U.S. Federal Reserve in signaling an easing may be coming soon.
Indeed, BOJ Governor Haruhiko Kuroda said on Thursday the central bank will scrutinize economic developments until the last minute in deciding policy this month, suggesting that whether to stand pat or increase stimulus will be a close call.
Japan's core consumer price index, which includes oil products but excludes fresh food prices, rose 0.6% in June from a year earlier, matching economists' median estimate.
The June reading was the weakest since July 2017 when the index climbed 0.5% and compared with a 0.8% gain in May.
The so-called core-core CPI, which strips away the effects of volatile food and energy costs and is closely watched by the BOJ to gauge how much the economy's strength has translated into price gains, was up 0.5% in June from a year earlier.
The data shows the central bank is still a long way off from achieving its elusive 2% inflation target as the U.S.-China trade dispute and slowing global demand put pressure on the export-reliant economy.
""The global economy is weakening and energy prices are on the decline, while Japan's wage recovery is sluggish. Consumer inflation has not risen as per the BOJ's scenario,"" said Hiroaki Mutou, chief economist at Tokai Tokyo Research Institute.
""As the Fed is expected to cut rates in July, I think the BOJ will have to take action as the central bank is concerned about the yen's move.""
Data showed the biggest contributory factor for the lower June core CPI index was a sharp slowdown in energy prices. Reduction in mobile charges by Japan's major mobile carriers also weighed on the index.
Analysts see core consumer prices will remain subdued in coming months due to the recent oil tumble - a supply-side issue that adds to Japan's protracted demand-led inflation problem.
As U.S.-China trade frictions cloud the global outlook, an increasing number of market players expect the BOJ’s next move to be a loosening of monetary policy with some betting of action as early as the next rate review on July 29-30.
Many BOJ officials are wary of ramping up an already massive stimulus program as years of heavy money printing has pushed borrowing costs to zero, straining commercial banks’ margins and leaving the central bank with little ammunition to fight the next recession.
Yet, the global strains are pushing many policymakers to switch gears. South Korea, South Africa and Indonesia all eased policy on Thursday.
Fed policymakers, moving toward their first interest rate reduction in a decade later this month, have sketched out arguments for whether rates should be cut by a quarter or a half a percentage point."
895,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 18, 2019 12:45PM ET</span>",U.S. weekly jobless claims rise as expected,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The number of Americans filing applications for unemployment benefits increased moderately last week, pointing to still strong labor market conditions despite signs that economic activity was slowing.
Other data on Thursday showed factory activity in the mid-Atlantic region rebounded sharply in July, reaching its highest level in a year. That added to recent surveys on manufacturing that have suggested the struggling sector was stabilizing. 
The improvement in the regional factory surveys likely reflects a decision by President Donald Trump not to impose tariffs on Mexican goods after the two countries struck a deal on immigration. But manufacturing, which makes up about 12% of the economy, remains hamstrung by weaker business spending on equipment, an inventory glut, a bitter trade war between the United States and China, and softening global growth.
""This big swing in the data over the past couple of months may reflect changing attitudes on trade given that the sampling for the June reports probably occurred around the time of peak concern about trade policy between the U.S. and Mexico,"" said Daniel Silver, an economist at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) in New York.
Initial claims for state unemployment benefits rose 8,000 to a seasonally adjusted 216,000 for the week ended July 13, the Labor Department said, remaining in the middle of their 193,000-230,000 range for this year. Last week's increase in claims was in line with economists' expectations.
The claims data tends to be volatile around this time of the year because of summer factory closures, especially in the automobile industry, which occur at different periods. This can throw off the model the government uses to strip out seasonal fluctuations from the data. 
Layoffs remain low despite the U.S.-China trade tensions, which have contributed to a dimming of the economy's outlook and led the Federal Reserve to signal it would cut interest rates at its July 30-31 meeting for the first time in a decade.
Last week's claims data covered the survey period for the nonfarm payrolls component of July's employment report. Claims were little changed between the June and July survey periods, suggesting strong job growth this month. The economy created 224,000 jobs in June.
""Firms remain extraordinarily reluctant to lay off workers and the labor market remains extremely tight,"" said John Ryding, chief economist at RDQ Economics in New York. ""There is no reason to expect anything but a solid jobs report for the month.""
The dollar was steady against a basket of currencies, while U.S. Treasury prices fell. Stocks on Wall Street were lower.
WORKERS SCARCE
There are, however, concerns that a shortage of workers and the Trump administration's tougher stance on immigration could impede job growth. The Fed's Beige Book report of anecdotal information on business activity collected from contacts nationwide published on Wednesday showed some manufacturing and information technology firms in the Northeast reduced their number of workers from mid-May through early July. 
It said ""a few reports highlighted concerns about securing and renewing work visas, flagging this as a source of uncertainty for continued employment growth."" 
Solid job growth is helping to underpin the economy, which is slowing as last year's massive stimulus from tax cuts and more government spending fades. Weak manufacturing and housing, as well as a widening trade deficit are partially offsetting strong consumer spending.
The Atlanta Fed is forecasting gross domestic product rising at a 1.6% annualized rate in the second quarter. The economy grew at a 3.1% pace in the January-March period.
The slowdown in activity was underscored by a second report on Thursday from the Conference Board showing its measure of future economic growth fell for the first time in six months in June. The 0.3% drop in the leading indicator, the largest since January 2016, ""suggests growth is likely to remain slow in the second half of the year,"" the Conference Board said.
But manufacturing appears to be improving. In a third report, the Philadelphia Fed said its business conditions index jumped to a reading of 21.8 in July from 0.3 in June. 
That was the highest level since July 2018 and reflected strong increases in measures of new orders, employment and shipments. The improvement in manufacturing in the region that covers eastern Pennsylvania, southern New Jersey and Delaware mirrors other measures on factory activity. 
It probably overstates the outlook for manufacturing, however. A survey from the New York Fed on Monday showed a mild rebound in its business conditions index in July after contracting in June. 
While overall manufacturing production increased last month, output at factories fell at a 2.2% annual rate in the second quarter, the sharpest decline in three years, the Fed reported on Tuesday. Manufacturing production dropped at a 1.9% pace in the first quarter.
""The troubles that have plagued industry continue to linger,"" said Roiana Reid, an economist at Berenberg Capital Markets in New York. 
The Philadelphia Fed survey's measure of prices received by manufacturers in the mid-Atlantic region increased this month, as did a gauge of prices paid by factories. Both measures, however, remained well below their lofty readings over the past few month, consistent with expectations of moderate inflation.

The survey's six-month business conditions index jumped to a reading of 38.0 this month, the highest reading since May 2018, from 21.4 in June. Its six-month capital expenditures index increased to 36.9 from a reading of 28.0 in the prior month.

896,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 18, 2019 09:11AM ET</span>",Philly Fed's regional business index hits one-year high,"(Reuters) - The Philadelphia Federal Reserve said on Thursday its barometer on business activity in the U.S. Mid-Atlantic region jumped to its strongest level in a year in July amid ongoing trade disputes between the United States and its trading partners.
The regional central bank's index rose to 21.8, the highest level since July 2018. Analysts polled by Reuters had forecast a reading of 5.0 this month.
Last month, the index had fallen to 0.3 which was the lowest since February.
A figure above zero suggests the region's business activity is growing.
""Manufacturing conditions in the region showed improvement this month,"" the Philadelphia Fed said of the July figures.
This was the second regional Fed survey this week that showed a recovery in business sentiment from a sharp deterioration in June. On Monday, the New York Fed said its gauge on manufacturing growth in New York recorded its largest gain in more than two years in July.
The Philadelphia Fed's July data showed broad improvement including sizable increases in new orders and employment.
The survey's new orders measure rose to 18.9, the highest since January from 8.3 the prior month.
The employment gauge jumped to 30.0, the strongest level since October 2017. It was 15.4 the month before, while the average workweek index increased to 23.0 in July, the highest reading in 14 months, Philadelphia Fed said.
The regional Fed's six-month business conditions barometer increased to 38.0, the highest since May 2018, from 21.4 in June.
""The survey’s future indexes indicate that respondents continue to expect growth over the next six months,"" Philadelphia Fed said."
897,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 18, 2019 04:41AM ET</span>",UK retail sales jump in June in much-needed lift for economy,"LONDON, (Reuters) - British retail sales rebounded unexpectedly in June, according to official data that may raise hope the economy will sidestep a downturn in the second quarter.
Monthly retail sales volumes jumped 1.0%, the Office for National Statistics said, well above all forecasts in a Reuters poll of economists that had pointed to a 0.3% drop.
Compared with June 2018, sales were up by 3.8%, again stronger than all forecasts.
Many economists think Britain's economy is in danger of shrinking in the second quarter, a hangover from the stockpiling boom that took place ahead of the original Brexit deadline in March.
But the unexpected strength of retail sales in June could help to reduce that risk. Still, retail sales over the three months to the end of June grew by just 0.7%, the weakest reading since the three months to February.
""Retail as a whole saw a return to growth in the month of June, mainly due to growth in non-food stores with increased sales in second-hand goods, including charity shops and antiques,"" ONS statistician Rhian Murphy said.
The figures clashed with a British Retail Consortium survey that showed sales fell in the year to June at the fastest pace on record for that month.
Some sectors did not enjoy a rebound last month, the official data showed. Department store sales declined for a sixth consecutive month, the worst such run in records that date back to the late 1980s.
Until recently, consumers have so far largely taken Brexit in their stride, helped by modest inflation and stronger growth in wages.
That has helped the world's fifth-biggest economy at a time when many companies have been cutting back on investment because of uncertainty about Brexit.
Stable inflation, a steady rise in wages and the lowest unemployment since 1975 have continued to boost household incomes, although after inflation wages are still below their peak before the financial crisis.
But there have been other signs consumers are turning more cautious as Britain's political crisis drags on.
The two contenders to become prime minister next week have both said they are willing to take Britain out of the European Union without a transition deal, if necessary."

China's total corporate, household and government debt rose to 303% of GDP in the first quarter of 2019, from 297% in the same period a year earlier, the IIF said in a report this week which highlighted rising debt levels worldwide.
The IIF is a private global financial industry association, based in Washington.
""While authorities' efforts to curb shadow bank lending (particularly to smaller companies) have prompted a cutback in non-financial corporate debt, net borrowing in other sectors has brought China's total debt to over $40 trillion - some 15% of all global debt,"" the report said.
""Of note, onshore bond issuance suggests a big pickup in borrowing by local governments and banks this year.""
China's economic growth slowed to 6.2% in the second quarter, its weakest pace in at least 27 years, as demand at home and abroad faltered in the face of mounting U.S. trade pressure.
To revive investment and protect jobs, Beijing has been encouraging banks to lend more, particularly to struggling smaller firms. It has also unveiled billions of dollars in tax cuts and infrastructure spending.

901,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 18, 2019 01:09AM ET</span>","Australia jobless rate stuck at 5.2%, signals more work for RBA","By Swati Pandey
SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australian full-time employment surged in June but the jobless rate stayed stuck at 5.2% for a third straight month as more people looked for work, a sign of spare capacity that argues for more policy stimulus.
Thursday's figures from the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) showed 500 new jobs were added last month as a slump in part-time work overshadowed the 21,100 jump in full-time employment.
The monthly employment series has gained even more importance recently as the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) is closely watching labor market trends, awaiting a much-needed pick-up in wage growth and inflation.
""This report reinforces the view that labor market conditions have eased,"" said Callam Pickering, APAC economist for global job site Indeed.
The RBA has recently estimated that the jobless rate will need to fall to 4.5% to generate any wage pressures. To help achieve that level it chopped interest rates twice since June to a record low of 1% as the economy grapples with subdued home prices and miserly consumer spending.
Economists expect another cut later this year, probably by November while some are predicting policy at 0.5% in 2020 as the RBA steps up efforts to revive growth in Australia's A$1.9 trillion economy which has slowed to decade lows.
Financial markets pared the chance of an August move by the RBA as Thursday's report was ""not dramatic enough"" to prompt a cut next month, AMP chief economist Shane Oliver said.
Rates futures now imply a 12% chance of a 25-basis-point cut to 0.75% from 20% before the data. The Aussie dollar rose 0.3% to hover near the day's high at $0.7031.
""We see a further slowdown in jobs growth over the next six months,"" Oliver said, citing a slowing in jobs ads, vacancies and hiring plans.
""We remain of the view that (the RBA) will still have to cut rates further later this year ultimately taking the cash rate down to 0.5% early next year.""
Getting unemployment to 4.5% looks like a tough task as Thursday's data showed it held at 5.2% in June. The jobless rate got as low as 4.9% in February but has since been nudging higher.
That upturn has come even as hiring remained solid. Overall annual employment growth of 2.4% handily outpaced the U.S. performance of 1.6%.
Yet a constant influx of skilled migrants means the labor force is also expanding rapidly. Australia's annual population growth of 1.6% is among the highest in the developed world.
That explains why participation stayed at a record peak of 66.0% in June, meaning nearly two of every three people are currently engaged in the labor market.
""Putting the pieces together, another rate cut appears more likely than not,"" Indeed's Pickering said.
""November is the most likely month."""
902,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 17, 2019 11:20PM ET</span>",Australia Sees Jobs Boom in West as Resources Comeback on Cards,"(Bloomberg) -- Employment jumped and the labor force swelled in Australia’s western mining heartland, offsetting job losses in every other state, suggesting forecasts of a resource investment revival might be coming to pass.
In Western Australia, 13,800 jobs were added in June, the participation rose 0.3 percentage point and unemployment fell almost half a percentage point to 5.8%, data from the statistics bureau showed in Sydney Thursday. In contrast, New South Wales, the economy’s growth driver in recent years and Australia’s biggest state, shed 17,400 positions.
“The pickup in full-time hiring in Western Australia may be a sign that the trough in resource investment may soon come to an end,” said Tamara Mast Henderson, an economist at Bloomberg Economics. “There was less slack in Australia’s labor market in June, as indicated by a drop in underutilization. This adds to reasons the Reserve Bank of Australia is likely to leave its policy rate unchanged in August. We don’t expect any more easing this year.”
The RBA executed its first back-to-back interest-rate cuts in seven years as it redoubled efforts to drive unemployment down to 4.5%, the bank’s new estimate of the rate needed to reignite inflation. It’s betting that a combination of policy easing, government tax cuts, infrastructure investment, and firms upgrading and building new mines will reignite an economy that slowed sharply in recent quarters.
Rising Salaries
BHP Group and  Rio Tinto  (LON:RIO) Group, the world’s two largest miners, are among those with vast new operations under construction in Western Australia’s Pilbara region as they prepare to replace aging mines scheduled to shutter. Rising salaries in the state’s mining sector already reflect a tighter labor market, with some roles commanding higher wages than at the peak of the last mining investment boom, according to advisory firm BDO International Ltd.
Perth-based Fortescue Metals Group Ltd. has pledged project spending of about A$5.5 billion ($3.9 billion) on two new iron ore mines in Australia in the past 18 months, while BHP is developing the $3 billion South Flank project and Rio has sanctioned the $2.6 billion Koodaideri mine.
The Australian dollar climbed after the release and traded at 70.26 U.S. cents at 12:50 p.m. in Sydney. Money markets are pricing in about a 60% chance the central bank will cut rates by another quarter point in December. The cash rate is currently at a record-low 1%.
Thursday’s report also showed positive data on slack in the labor market: under-employment declined 0.4 percentage point to 8.2% and underutilization fell 0.3 point to 13.4%.
RBA Governor Philip Lowe’s (NYSE:LOW) lowering of estimated full employment in the economy follows in the footsteps of other developed-world counterparts, who’ve had to wait for their jobless rates to fall to exceptionally low levels to spur wage growth. Even then, it has proved a prolonged wait for it to feed into inflation.
Pushing down the jobless rate is likely to prove an uphill battle -- not least because so many additional people are entering the labor market. Meanwhile, debt-laden households have hunkered down and cut spending as they grapple with stagnant incomes and weakening house prices erode their wealth.
The labor market has held up surprisingly well even as the economy slowed sharply in the past 12 months. One explanation for the resilience is that much of the hiring is coming from government-related programs that are impervious to prevailing economic conditions.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's exports fell for a seventh straight month in June, pressured by Sino-U.S. trade frictions, slowing China growth and rising trade protectionism, as manufacturers' business confidence hit a three-year low.
Exports have been a drag on the world's third-largest economy, weighing on factory output and threatening to undermine capital expenditure.
Exports in June fell 6.7% from a year earlier, Ministry of Finance data showed on Thursday, dragged down by declining sales of tankers, China-bound car parts and steel pipes. That compared with a 5.6% decrease expected by economists and a 7.8% fall in May.
Separately, the Reuters Tankan survey showed Japanese manufacturers' business confidence hit a three-year low in July, highlighting the fragility of the export-led economy.
The batch of gloomy data underscored expectations among some analysts that the central bank will roll out more stimulus at its policy review later in the month.
Bank of Japan officials have said they remain ready to ease further if economic conditions worsen, joining the U.S. Federal Reserve in signaling additional monetary stimulus amid deteriorating global conditions.
""The export picture should remain bleak in coming months,"" Robert Subbaraman, chief economist and head of global markets research, Asia ex-Japan at Nomura, wrote in a report.
The economic strains showed no signs of abating as a lack of progress on U.S.-China trade negotiations and heightened global uncertainty weighed on corporate spending.
U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping agreed last month to another truce in the year-long trade row between the world's two largest economies, but no deadline has been set for the negotiations to conclude.
Adding to global trade uncertainties, Japan is in a deepening row with South Korea after Tokyo curbed exports of some materials used to make high-tech equipment.
By region, Japan's exports to the United States rose 4.8% in the year to June, up for the ninth straight month, driven by semiconductor-making equipment and cars, the trade data showed.
The increased U.S.-bound shipments raise some concerns that Trump could pile pressure on Japan to curb its auto exports to the United States and open its highly-protected agriculture market to fix what he calls unfair trade imbalances.
Imports from the United States fell 2.5% in the year to June, causing Japan's trade surplus with the world's biggest economy to increase 13.5% from a year earlier to 669.9 billion yen ($6.21 billion), the data showed.
Exports to China, Japan's biggest trading partner, tumbled 10.1% year-on-year in June, down for fourth consecutive month.
Asia-bound shipments, which account for more than half of Japan's overall exports, declined 8.2% in the year to June.
Japan's overall imports fell 5.2% in the year to June, versus the median estimate for a 0.4% decline, bringing the trade balance to a surplus of 589.5 billion yen, versus the median estimate for a 420.0 billion yen surplus."

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japanese manufacturers' business confidence hit a three-year low in July, highlighting the fragility of the export-led economy as external demand slackens in the face of cooling global growth and trade friction, the Reuters Tankan showed.
In another worrisome sign, sentiment in the service sector improved this month but is forecast to tumble three months ahead.
The Reuters Tankan aligned with the Bank of Japan's closely watched quarterly tankan business survey out earlier this month, which showed big manufacturers' business confidence fell to a nearly three-year low in the quarter to June.
Both the Reuters and BOJ surveys underscore expectations among some analysts of a possible ramping up of the central bank's stimulus at its policy review later in the month.
BOJ officials have said they remain ready to ease further if economic conditions worsen, joining the U.S. Federal Reserve in signaling additional monetary stimulus amid deteriorating global conditions.
U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping last month agreed to another truce in the year-long trade row between the world's two largest economies, but no deadline has been set for the negotiations to conclude.
Adding to the intensifying global trade friction, Japan is in a deepening row with South Korea after Tokyo curbed exports of some materials used to make high-tech equipment.
""Uncertainty is high on the outlook due to friction between the United States and China and rows between Japan and South Korea,"" a chemicals maker manager wrote in the survey taken July 1-12.
In the Reuters poll of 504 large- and mid-sized companies, the sentiment index for Japanese manufacturers worsened to 3 in July from 6 in June, dragged down by industries such as textiles/paper, steel/nonferrous metals and precision machinery.
It was the lowest reading since August 2016, posting a second straight month of declines. The outlook wasn't much to write home about either, with the poll predicting the index to inch up to 4 over the coming three months.
The service-sector index grew to 25 in July from 22 in the previous month, led by real estate/construction and wholesalers.
However, the index is seen falling to 16 in October, dragged down by retailers in a worrying sign for private consumption which accounts for roughly 60% of the world's third largest economy.
Given the broadening pressures on the economy, investors are watching out for any plans by Japan to postpone a scheduled sales tax hike to 10% in October. The last tax rise to 8% from 5% dealt a blow to consumers and triggered a deep economic slump.
Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has delayed a planned tax hike twice since then, but he has repeatedly pledged to go ahead this time, barring a big economic shock on the scale of the collapse of Lehman Brothers more than a decade ago.
""As the sales tax hike draws near, the retail sector is slowing. We cannot expect the kind of front-loading spending to boost consumption ahead of the tax increase,"" a retailer wrote.

The Reuters Tankan indexes are calculated by subtracting the percentage of pessimistic respondents from optimistic ones. A positive figure means optimists outnumber pessimists.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. homebuilding fell for a second straight month in June and permits dropped to a two-year low, suggesting the housing market continued to struggle despite declining mortgage rates.
The Commerce Department report on Wednesday also showed housing completions at a six-month low and a modest increase in the number of homes under construction, indications that an inventory squeeze that has haunted the market could persist for a while. Weak housing and manufacturing are holding back the economy, offsetting strong consumer spending.
Land and labor shortages, as well as expensive building materials, are making it difficult for builders to meet demand for housing, especially in the lower price segment of the market. 
Mortgage rates have been decreasing since the Federal Reserve signaled it was pausing its interest rate raising campaign. Borrowing costs could drop further as the U.S. central bank is poised to cut rates this month for the first time in a decade to protect the economy from rising threats from Washington's trade dispute with Beijing, and slowing global growth.
""Residential housing construction is one of the leading indicators of a recession, and while construction activity isn't dropping precipitously, housing is stuck in a rut,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG in New York. ""If the Fed thinks rate cuts are going to send housing construction up like a rocket, they better think again.""
Housing starts decreased 0.9% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.253 million units last month as a rebound in the construction of single-family housing units was overshadowed by a plunge in multi-family homebuilding, the government said.
Data for May was revised slightly down to show homebuilding falling to a pace of 1.265 million units, instead of slipping to a rate of 1.269 million units as previously reported. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast housing starts dipping to a pace of 1.261 million units in June. 
Single-family homebuilding, which accounts for the largest share of the housing market, increased 3.5% to a rate of 847,000 units in June, partially recouping some of May's sharp drop. Single-family housing starts fell in the Northeast, but rose in the Midwest, West and South.
Building permits tumbled 6.1% to a rate of 1.220 million units in June, the lowest level since May 2017. Permits have been weak this year, with much of the decline concentrated in the single-family housing segment.
The housing market hit a soft patch last year and has been a drag on economic growth for five straight quarters. Economists have said housing had no impact on GDP in the second quarter. 
A Fed report on Wednesday described residential construction as ""flat"" from mid-May through early July. The Fed's Beige Book report of anecdotal information on business activity collected from contacts nationwide also viewed the economy as continuing ""to expand at a modest pace ... with little change from the prior reporting period."" [nFOMHIEF5B]
The Atlanta Fed is forecasting gross domestic product rising at a 1.6% annualized rate in the April-June quarter. The economy grew at a 3.1% pace in the first quarter. The government will publish its advance GDP growth estimate for the second quarter next Friday.
The PHLX housing index (HGX) fell, underperforming in a broadly weak U.S. stock market. The dollar weakened against a basket of currencies, while U.S. Treasury prices rose.
DOWNWARD TRAJECTORY
""These prints are in line with our view of a slowing housing market that is likely to continue on a downward trajectory for the rest of this year, but with no significant risks of an immediate slump,"" said Igor Cesarec, an economist at  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) in New York. ""We continue to expect residential investment to be either flat or provide a slight boost to GDP growth in the second half of the year.""
The 30-year fixed mortgage rate has dropped to about 3.75% from a peak of 4.94% in November, according to data from mortgage finance agency Freddie Mac. 
A survey on Tuesday showed confidence among homebuilders increased in July. Builders, however, complained ""they continue to grapple with labor shortages, a dearth of buildable lots and rising construction costs that are making it increasingly challenging to build homes at affordable price points relative to buyer incomes.""
Permits to build single-family homes rose 0.4% to a rate of 813,000 units in June. Despite the increase last month, permits continue to lag housing starts, suggesting single-family homebuilding could remain sluggish.
Starts for the volatile multi-family housing segment dropped 9.2% to a rate of 406,000 units last month. Permits for the construction of multi-family homes plunged 16.8% to a pace of 407,000 units. Permits for buildings with five units or more were the lowest since March 2016.
Housing completions fell 4.8% to 1.161 million units last month, the lowest level since December. 

Realtors estimate that housing starts and completion rates need to be in a range of 1.5 million to 1.6 million units per month to bridge the inventory gap. The stock of housing under construction increased 0.5% to 1.135 million units in June.

The Washington-based group's seasonally adjusted index on loan requests, both to buy a home and refinance one, fell 1.1% to 500.2 from 505.8 in the week ended July 12.
The group's barometer on loan applications for home purchases, which is seen as a proxy on future housing activity, decreased 3.8% to 265.1.
The Commerce Department said on Wednesday that housing starts decreased 0.9% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.253 million units last month as a rebound in the construction of single-family housing units was offset by a plunge in multi-family homebuilding.
Most fixed-mortgage rates MBA tracks were increased by as much as 8 basis points from the week before.
For example, interest rates on 30-year fixed-rate ""conforming"" mortgages, or loans whose balances are $484,350 or less, averaged 4.12% last week, higher than last week's 4.04% but still below this year's average of 4.45%.
Mortgage rates rose in step with a spike in U.S. bond yields last week in the wake of stronger-than-forecast inflation data and a dismal 30-year government bond auction.
The jump in mortgage rates did not hurt interest to refinance an existing home, particularly among those who seek loans guaranteed by the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) which helps first-time homebuyers and borrowers with patchy credit.
MBA's seasonally adjusted gauge on refinancing rose 1.5% to 1,827.3 from prior week's 1,779.7.
The refinance share of mortgage activity increased to 50.0% of total applications from 48.7% the previous week. FHA’s share of total applications expanded to 10.6% from 10.1% the week before.
""Refinance applications increased, with activity reaching its highest level in a month, driven mainly by FHA applications. Historically, government refinance activity lags slightly in response to rate changes,"" Joel Kan, MBA's associate vice president of economic and industry forecasting, said in a statement."

The declines reported on Wednesday came a day after Hong Kong retailers warned that July and August sales could drop by double-digits from a year earlier as tourists put off their visits.
Like many export-reliant Asian economies, Hong Kong has been hit hard by the year-long U.S.-China trade war, and grew at its slowest pace in nearly 10 years in the first quarter.
Commerce and economic development secretary Edward Yau said on Wednesday he saw ""negative signals"" from the economy beyond known declines in trade, retail and cargo freight posted in the first five to six months.
""Three weeks ago I met with the tourism sector and they expected a 5 to 10% impact, but now the hotel sector is worried the impact would be larger,"" Yau told reporters.
The government will expand funding to better help smaller companies, he added.
The Hong Kong Federation of Trade Unions said on Wednesday the number of tour groups from mainland China has declined to 5,641 in June from a monthly average of 7,800 in the beginning of the year.
Hotel occupancy rates fell as much as 20% in June from a year earlier, and are expected to drop 40% in July on-year, it said. Hong Kong is one of Asia's most popular tourist destinations and a global financial hub.
Millions have taken to the streets over the past month to protest a bill that would allow people to be sent to mainland China for trial in courts controlled by the Communist Party.
Some of the demonstrations have turned violent, with clashes between police and protesters, and the city is bracing for more unrest in coming weeks.
Government officials have said the extradition bill is effectively dead but activists say they want it formally withdrawn.
On Monday, Financial Secretary Paul Chan said economic growth in the second quarter will be slower than the first, hurt by trade tensions.
He said he hasn't seen obvious capital outflows triggered by the protests, but the violent clashes would hurt Hong Kong's international image."

EU statistics agency Eurostat said prices in the 19-country euro zone were 1.3% higher year-on-year in June, compared with a flash estimate of 1.2%. Inflation in May was 1.2%, the lowest rate since April 2018.
On the month, prices were 0.2% higher, slightly more than the 0.1% market forecast, according to Eurostat data released on Wednesday.
The European Central Bank (ECB), whose monetary policy committee meets next week, targets a rate of close to but below 2%.
ECB board member Benoit Coeure said on Wednesday the bank was ready to act if necessary to help inflation move toward that target. The ECB at its meeting last month put off any rate hike for at least a year.
Eurostat said that the core inflation measure the ECB looks at in policy decisions, which excludes the volatile components of food and energy, was 1.3% in June on the year after 1.0% in May. It had earlier estimated the June rate at 1.2%.
A narrower indicator, which also excludes alcohol and tobacco prices, increased to 1.1% in June from 0.8 in May, confirming its earlier estimate.
The revisions follow a slight uptick in the price rise of energy - to 1.7 from 1.6% - and of non-energy industrial goods - to 0.3 from 0.2%. Inflation for unprocessed food ticked down to 0.7% from the initial 0.8% estimate

912,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 17, 2019 04:42AM ET</span>",London house prices fall in May at fastest rate in a decade,"LONDON, (Reuters) - House prices in London fell at the fastest rate in almost 10 years in May, according to data that also showed consumer price inflation held at the Bank of England's 2% target for a second month running in June.
House prices in the capital fell 4.4% in annual terms, marking the biggest fall since August 2009, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said.
Extending a period of weakness in the property since the Brexit vote more than three years ago, house price growth across the United Kingdom slowed to 1.2%, matching February's six-year low.
Some other surveys have suggested recently that the housing market might be past the worst of its slowdown.
London house prices are now 6.4% below their July 2017 peak, a disappointment to some homeowners but a much smaller fall than the 17.8% peak-to-trough hit during the global financial crisis.
Furthermore, the current downturn in the capital represents only a small hit given that London house prices have almost doubled since the financial crisis, leaving the city unaffordable for many buyers.
Separate data from the ONS showed not only stable consumer price inflation, as expected in a Reuters poll of economists, but also a reduction in pipeline price pressures for British factories.
Households, whose spending drives Britain's economy, have been helped by modest rates of inflation combined with the lowest unemployment rate in 44 years and rising wages.
The ONS said producer input costs, which eventually feed through into prices on the high street, fell 0.3% in annual terms in June, the first decline in three years."
913,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 17, 2019 04:09AM ET</span>",European Car Sales Resume Downward Spiral With Big June Drop,"(Bloomberg) -- European car registrations fell sharply in June, resuming a downward spiral this year that has seen profit warnings at German manufacturer  Daimler  AG (DE:DAIGn) and a quarterly automotive division loss at rival BMW AG.
Sales dropped 7.9% to 1.49 million cars, the European Automobile Manufacturers’ Association said Wednesday, the worst monthly decline since December. France and Spain had falls of more than 8%, while German and U.K. sales fell 4.7% and 4.9% respectively.
While the industry group blamed the June drop on fewer working days during the month, the weak showing adds to the gloom enveloping the sector and brings the fall to 3.1% since the start of 2019. Daimler (DE:DAIGn) last week issued its fourth profit warning in just over a year due to the costs of a recall and allegations of emissions-tampering in diesel cars. The carmaker also blamed weaker global markets. BMW (DE:BMWG) in May reported its first loss in a decade in the main automotive division.
At the year’s half-way mark, Europe is likely facing a second annual decline in car sales. The industry association has already revised its prediction for the year to a 1% drop, blaming uncertainty surrounding Brexit and flattening demand. It had previously forecast a 1% rise. Before last year, the industry had enjoyed uninterrupted annual growth since 2013.
“We’re standing in front of a difficult second half of the year,” said Peter Fuss, a partner at EY consultancy. “Little positive impetus for the new car market in the EU can be expected in the coming months.”
In addition to weakening markets, a truce in the U.S.-China trade spat remains delicate. U.S. President Donald Trump said late Tuesday he could impose additional tariffs on Chinese imports if he wanted to, after promising to hold off on more duties last month. Tensions between the two nations have hurt China’s economy, prompting car sales to slump, and have hurt the export of U.S.-made cars from BMW and Mercedes-Benz.
The Stoxx Europe 600 Automobiles & Parts Index declined 0.4%. Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) AG fell 0.1% in early European trading, while  Renault  SA (PA:RENA) dropped 0.6%.
More Optimistic
French automaker Renault SA was more optimistic on Tuesday, saying it expects European vehicle sales to remain stable this year, barring a hard Brexit. While the French carmaker expects some recovery in volumes during the rest of 2019 thanks to new models, it sees the global car market shrinking by around 3%.
Renault’s partner Nissan Motor Co. was the worst hit during the first six months of this year, registering a 24% drop in European sales. Honda sales fell 15.4% and Fiat-Chrysler saw a 9.5% decline.
In May, European car sales rose 0.1%, an unexpected and slight reprieve in a nine-month run of lower sales. The market benefited from trade-in incentives for older diesel cars and two additional shopping days that month.
The possibility that the car market has passed a peak would come at a particularly unfavorable time for manufacturers, who are scrambling to pay for an unprecedented shift to electric and autonomous vehicles. Battery-powered car sales are still a fraction of the total, something that could change as tough emissions regulations come into effect next yea

Registrations fell to 1.49 million cars last month from 1.62 million a year earlier across the European Union and EFTA countries, the Brussels-based Association of European Carmakers said in a statement. Calendar effects resulted in two fewer sales days in most markets, accentuating the decline.
Registrations for the first half closed 3.1% lower, ACEA said. For European carmakers, weakening demand at home compounds the pressure from a sharper contraction in China and emerging markets that may yet bring more profit warnings.
Nissan's aging model lineup contributed to a 26.6% June sales slump while Volvo Cars, owned by China's Geely, saw deliveries tumble 21.7%.

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Singapore's exports fell more than expected in June, marking their biggest decline in six years, as the city-state struggles against tepid global demand and the Sino-U.S. trade war.
The grim trade numbers add to a slew of weak economic data and reinforce economists' expectations the central bank could ease monetary policy at its October meeting.
Non-oil domestic exports in June fell 17.3%, the fourth month of year-on-year decline, data from the trade agency Enterprise Singapore showed on Wednesday, slowing from the revised 16.3% decline the month before.
This was worse than the 9.9% contraction predicted by 10 economists in a Reuters poll and the biggest decline since February 2013 when exports fell 33.2% from the year before, Refinitiv Eikon data show.
""It's everything bad coming together. You have a global economic slowdown, a trade war and a Chinese slowdown,"" said Selena Ling, economist at OCBC Bank.
The drop in annual exports was mainly due to a 31.9% fall in electronics shipments. Exports to the majority of Singapore's top markets, including China and Europe, fell sharply in June, although those to the United States posted a small rise.
On a seasonally adjusted month-on-month basis, exports contracted 7.6% in June after growing a revised 5.8% in May. The poll called for a 3.9% contraction from the month before.
""The outlook (for Singapore's economy) is definitely more pessimistic now,"" said Maybank Kim Eng economist Lee Ju Ye.
Singapore's economy grew at its slowest annual pace in a decade in the second quarter, preliminary data showed last week, raising bets that a technical recession and monetary policy easing could be just around the corner.
OCBC's Ling said the outlook for Singapore's economy is bleak and she has cut her growth forecast three times this year.
""It doesn't look like there's light at the end of the tunnel yet,"" she added."
916,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 17, 2019 12:00AM ET</span>",Hong Kong’s Economy Starts to Feel the Hit from Protest Chaos,"(Bloomberg) -- Hong Kong is beginning to reckon with the economic cost of ongoing protests against the government’s extradition bill, as the disruption risks driving away local shoppers and deterring tourists from mainland China.
The Hong Kong Retail Management Association said Tuesday that “most members” reported a single-to-double-digit drop in average sales revenue between June and the first week of July, when multiple demonstrations converging on major office and retail districts took place.
The threat to Hong Kong’s vital retail sector will hit its economy at a time when it is already slowing. Retail sales data for June is due for release on August 1, with the value of goods sold having contracted every month since February.
The “industry is worried that these events will damage Hong Kong’s international image as a safe city, a culinary capital, and a shopping heaven,” the association said in a statement.
Chief Executive Carrie Lam’s bid to ease extraditions to the mainland prompted hundreds of thousands of protesters to take to the streets in a wave of historic protests that has brought parts of the city to a halt since early last month.
Hong Kong Financial Secretary Paul Chan said at a briefing July 15 that second quarter economic output is expected to be “slow,” though there haven’t been obvious capital outflows amid the demonstrations.
Sales Drop
Sa Sa International Holdings Ltd., a seller of cosmetics, reported a 15.3% drop in same store sales in Hong Kong and Macau for the three months through June. The company said the demonstrations had affected some stores, as had a high comparison from the previous year.
For the same period, Chow Tai Fook Jewellery Group Ltd. reported an 11% decline. The political backdrop and a decline in mainland visitors increases the likelihood of a two percentage-point reduction in its first-half operating margin, Catherine Lim, an analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence in Singapore, wrote in a note.
These Brands Are Caught in the Middle of Hong Kong’s Protests
The chances of a marked economic impact from the protests raises comparisons with the Occupy movement that blocked parts of central Hong Kong five years ago. Economic growth slowed in the fourth quarter of 2014 from the previous period, and the government at the time partially blamed that weaker performance on the protest, saying it “affected tourism, hotel, catering, retail and transport industries.”
Carry On
This year, the number of visitors to the city from mainland China has been increasing strongly, thanks in part to the opening of a new bridge linking Hong Kong with the city of Zhuhai, in Guangdong province. Arrivals in May surged 23.6 percent from a year earlier, with the June tally not yet available.
Images of protesters blocking major city thoroughfares -- and retail outlets -- is likely to pose a significant risk if the demonstrations continue. On July 1, a gathering that ultimately saw protesters break into and vandalize the city’s legislative building hampered retailers in the shopping district of Causeway Bay and elsewhere.
Hong Kong Turmoil Has Wealthy Eyeing Havens Beyond China’s Grasp
Yet most businesses are attempting to carry on.
“There were so many people, it was a mess, no one wanted to come in,” said Chen Yan, 30, who works at the counter of a pharmaceutical store in Causeway Bay. “But we haven’t changed our operations because of the protests. We expect it to be temporary.”

The trade-reliant economy took a sharp downturn in the second quarter, prompting analysts to downgrade growth forecasts for this year and predict a possible recession. Exports have been weakening since last year as a technology boom waned, but the outlook worsened considerably in 2019 amid a U.S.-China trade war, which is weighing on China’s economy.

918,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 16, 2019 05:08PM ET</span>",Argentina inflation cools for third straight month in June,"By Marina Lammertyn
BUENOS AIRES (Reuters) - Argentina consumer prices rose 2.7% in June, the country's statistics agency said on Tuesday, slowing for a third straight month as the government looks to rein in stubborn inflation that has dogged Latin America's No. 3 economy.
Rolling 12-month inflation was running at 55.8% in June, edging down for the first time this year from the 57.3% recorded a month earlier, while year-to-date inflation was 22.4%, the National Institute of Statistics and Censuses (INDEC) said.
The slower rise will be welcome news for Argentine President Mauricio Macri, who has been struggling to stabilize the country's battered economy through unpopular austerity measures as he seeks re-election in October.
""Inflation is still too high, but it's going down,"" Argentine central bank chief Guido Sandleris told reporters after the data was released.
""We've now had three consecutive months where we've seen inflation slow, and we believe this will continue to happen in the coming months... Inflation will continue to fall in July,"" he said.
The June inflation data is one of several recent economic indicators, including a stronger peso and slowly falling interest rates, that paint a slightly rosier picture of Macri's chances of staying in office.
Goldman Sachs analyst Alberto Ramos said in a note that while inflation was still elevated, the investment bank expected it to moderate further in the second half of the year given recent currency stability and measures to control price rises.
But he said uncertainties remained, especially with the upcoming presidential elections, and said 12-month inflation would likely be ""a still extraordinarily high"" 38.4% by the end of 2019.
Argentina is still digging itself out of a biting recession, after 2018 saw inflation rise 47.6%, part of the broader financial turmoil that has left a third of the country's population in poverty, pushed interest rates skyward and sent the peso tumbling against the dollar.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. retail sales increased more than expected in June, pointing to strong consumer spending, which could help to blunt some of the drag on the economy from weak business investment. 
The report from the Commerce Department on Tuesday did not change market expectations that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates this month for the first time in a decade. 
But coming on the heels of solid employment growth in June and a pickup in underlying inflation, the signs of strong consumer spending further reduced the possibility of the U.S. central bank cutting rates by 50 basis points at its July 30-31 policy meeting as markets had initially anticipated. 
Fed Chairman Jerome Powell last week told lawmakers the central bank would ""act as appropriate"" to protect the economy against risks stoked by a trade war between the United States and China, as well as slowing global growth.
""It certainly will counteract weak business spending to some degree,"" said Robert Frick, corporate economist at Navy Federal Credit Union in Vienna, Virginia. ""Given that the Fed is most worried about foreign economies and the threat of an escalating trade war, it is unlikely to dissuade them from cutting rates soon."" 
Retail sales increased 0.4% last month as households stepped up purchases of motor vehicles and a variety of other goods, including furniture and building materials. Data for May was revised slightly down to show retail sales gaining 0.4%, instead of rising 0.5% as previously reported. 
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast retail sales edging up 0.1% in June. Compared to June last year, retail sales advanced 3.4%.
Excluding automobiles, gasoline, building materials and food services, retail sales jumped 0.7% last month after an upwardly revised 0.6% increase in May. These so-called core retail sales, which correspond most closely with the consumer spending component of gross domestic product, were previously reported to have increased 0.4% in May.
    June's strong gain in core retail sales followed solid increases in April and May, suggesting consumer spending accelerated in the second quarter after rising at its slowest pace in a year in the January-March period.
The upbeat retail sales data buoyed the dollar against a basket of currencies, while U.S. Treasury prices fell. Stocks on Wall Street were trading mostly lower as quarterly earnings from three big banks, including Goldman Sachs (N:GS), drew mixed reactions from investors.
BROAD GAINS
Consumer spending is being supported by a tight labor market, even as the broader economy is slowing as weaker business investment, an inventory overhang, a trade war between the United States and China, and softening global growth pressure manufacturing. 
The Fed reported on Tuesday that manufacturing output rose 0.4% in June, boosted by increased production of motor vehicles and parts, after gaining 0.2% in May. Still, factory production dropped at an annual rate of 2.2% in the second quarter, the biggest decrease in three years, after contracting at a 1.9% pace in the January-March period.
With consumer spending and job growth regaining momentum, some economists argued that the Fed should not cut rates at the end of this month.
""While growth may be moderating it is not faltering,"" said Joel Naroff, chief economist at Naroff Economic Advisors in Holland, Pennsylvania. ""That is a big difference that should not be difficult to comprehend, but I guess the Fed chair and his band of economic gurus don't seem to get the point."" 
Following the retail sales and industrial production data, the Atlanta Fed lifted its GDP growth estimate for the second quarter by two-tenths of a percentage point to a 1.6% annualized rate. The economy grew at a 3.1% pace in the January-March quarter.
The government will publish its snapshot of second-quarter GDP next Friday. The economy is losing speed in part as last year's stimulus from massive tax cuts and more government spending fades.
Auto sales increased 0.7% in June after a similar gain in May. Receipts at service stations fell 2.8%, reflecting cheaper gasoline. Sales at building material stores rebounded 0.5% after dropping 1.5% in May. Receipts at clothing stores rose 0.5%. 
Online and mail-order retail sales climbed 1.7%, matching May's increase. There were also increases in sales at furniture stores and at restaurants and bars. Spending at hobby, musical instrument and book stores was unchanged. Sales at electronics and appliances stores fell 0.3%.
While core inflation perked up in June, gains are likely to remain moderate. A separate report on Tuesday from the Labor Department showed import prices dropped 0.9% last month, the biggest decrease in six months, after being unchanged in May.
Import prices, which exclude tariffs, were held down by a 6.2% drop in the cost of petroleum products. There were also decreases in the prices of imported food and capital goods. 
The cost of goods imported from China fell 1.5% in the 12 months through June, the largest decrease since February 2017.
But with dollar depreciating against the currencies of the United States' main trade partners recently, some economists did not expect import deflation to continue.

""The dollar has depreciated in recent weeks, and this could put some upward pressure on imported inflation over time,"" said Daniel Silver, an economist at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) in New York.

The National Association of Home Builders and  Wells Fargo  & Co (N:WFC) said on Tuesday their index of builder confidence in newly built, single-family homes increased to 65 from 64 in June. Analysts polled by Reuters had forecast the reading to remain steady at 64.
""Builders report solid demand for single-family homes. However, they continue to grapple with labor shortages, a dearth of buildable lots and rising construction costs that are making it increasingly challenging to build homes at affordable price points relative to buyer incomes,"" NAHB Chairman Greg Ugalde said in a statement.
The NAHB index is seen as a proxy on domestic housing starts, which will be released on Wednesday at 8:30 a.m. EDT (1230 GMT). Analysts polled by Reuters forecast home builders likely broke ground at an annualized pace of 1.261 million units in June, down from a 1.269 million pace in May.
The NAHB survey's components rose broadly in July.
The gauge on current single-family home sales rose to 72 from 71 while the barometer on prospective buyers increased one point to 48.
The measure on expectations on home sales over the next six months edged up to 71 from 70 in June.
Last week, interest rates on U.S. 30-year fixed mortgages fell to 4.04% from 4.07% the previous week.

Sales in the “control group” subset, which excludes food services, car dealers, building-materials stores and gasoline stations, increased 0.7%, also exceeding projections. Some analysts view the measure as a more accurate gauge of consumer demand. Excluding automobiles and gasoline, retail sales increased 0.7%.
The rebound in sales underscores Fed Chairman Jerome Powell’s view that consumer spending and finances remain healthy amid a tight labor market that’s been supporting the expansion. Strength at retailers may also complicate the debate for policy makers as they gather July 30-31 to chart their course amid growing headwinds from slowing global growth to trade tensions.
Powell in congressional testimony last week left it all but certain that the Fed is poised to cut rates for the first time in a decade. Still, he told lawmakers that consumer spending has reliably driven growth and rebounded to a solid pace after first-quarter weakness.
The initial reading of second-quarter gross domestic product is due July 26. A survey this month showed growth probably slowed to a 1.8% annualized pace from 3.1%, though consumption was seen picking up.
Broad Strength
Eleven of 13 major retail categories increased, led by a 1.7% increase in nonstore retailers, which include online vendors. Electronics and appliance stores and gasoline stations both fell.
Filling-station receipts decreased 2.8%, the most since December, as gasoline prices fell a second month. The figures aren't adjusted for price changes, so lower retail sales in the category could reflect changes in gasoline costs, sales, or both.
Sales at automobile dealers climbed 0.7%, the same pace as the prior month. Industry data from Wards Automotive Group previously showed unit sales unchanged in June after a May rebound.
A separate Labor Department report Tuesday showed import prices decreased 0.9% in June from the prior month, as export prices fell 0.7%. Data on business inventories are due for release at 10 a.m. in Washington.

922,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 16, 2019 05:44AM ET</span>","UK core pay growth strongest in nearly 11 years, but jobs growth slows","By William Schomberg and David Milliken
LONDON (Reuters) - British wages, excluding bonuses, rose at their fastest pace in nearly 11 years, official data showed on Tuesday, but there were potential signs of future weakness in jobs growth, the economy's silver lining since the Brexit referendum.
Core earnings rose by an annual 3.6% in the three months to May, the biggest increase since mid-2008 and stronger than the median forecast of 3.5% in a Reuters poll of economists.
Including bonuses, pay growth beat all forecasts in the poll, rising to 3.4%, the Office for National Statistics said, with a change in the timing of public health workers' pay rises accounting for a small part of the increase.
Many economists say the strength of Britain's labor market is at least in part due to employers hiring workers who they can later lay off if needed, rather than making longer-term investment commitments ahead of Brexit.
Unemployment held at its joint lowest rate since the three months to January 1975, forcing many employers to offer higher pay to their workers whose spending has helped the economy.
""However, the booming jobs market has inevitably shown signs of losing momentum in recent months,"" Tej Parikh, chief economist at the Institute of Directors. 
""As more and more people have entered work, businesses have found it harder to fill vacancies, and skills shortages are now clearly evident across all sectors.""
The pick-up in pay has been noted by the Bank of England which says it might need to raise interest rates in response, assuming Britain can avoid a no-deal Brexit.
The BoE said in May it expected wage growth of 3% at the end of this year.
Tuesday's data showed the number of people out of work fell by 51,000 to just under 1.3 million.
But the growth in employment slowed to 28,000, the weakest increase since the three months to August last year and below the forecast of an increase of 45,000 in the Reuters poll.
While there was a chunky rise in the number of self-employed workers, the number of employees fell by the most since 2011, and job vacancies dropped to their lowest in more than a year.
Some recently published surveys of companies have also suggested employers are turning more cautious about hiring as Britain approaches its new Brexit deadline of Oct. 31. 
Both the contenders to be prime minister have said they would leave the EU without a transition deal if necessary, raising the prospect of a shock to the economy in just over three months' time.

A survey published last week showed that companies were more worried about Brexit than at any time since the June 2016 vote to leave the European Union and they planned to reduce investment and hiring.

BERLIN (Reuters) - The mood among German investors deteriorated more sharply than expected in July, a survey showed on Tuesday, with the ZEW institute pointing to the unresolved trade dispute between China and the United States as well as political tensions with Iran.
ZEW said its monthly survey showed economic sentiment among investors fell to -24.5 from -21.1 in June. Economists had expected a less severe drop to -22.3.
A separate gauge measuring investors' assessment of the economy's current conditions plunged to -1.1, the lowest level since June 2010.
The weak reading bodes ill for the German economy which is expected to post only meager growth of 0.5 percent this year.
ZEW President Achim Wambach said the pessimism among German investors was probably driven by the continued slide in incoming orders for German industry.
German industrial orders fell far more than expected in May, data released earlier this month showed, with the government warning manufacturing would remain weak in the coming months.
""A lasting containment of the factors that are causing uncertainty in the export-oriented sectors of the German economy is currently not in sight,"" Wambach said.
""The Iran conflict seems to be intensifying and the ongoing trade dispute between the United States and China is a burden not only for Chinese economic development.""

Wambach also pointed to business uncertainty caused by the potential for Britain to leave the European Union in late October without a divorce deal.

925,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 16, 2019 05:10AM ET</span>",China's January-June fiscal revenues +3.4% year-on-year: finance ministry,"By Kevin Yao and Stella Qiu
BEIJING (Reuters) - China's local governments sharply accelerated their bond issuance in June as they looked to ramp up infrastructure spending to support economic growth that slowed to a 27-year low.
Beijing is counting on a recovery in infrastructure investment to help stabilize the world's second-largest economy as the U.S.-China trade war drags on, weighing on its vast manufacturing sector and business confidence.
But the economy has been slow to respond to earlier growth boosting measures, raising questions over whether more support is needed and if that risks a sharper build-up in debt.
Net local government bond issuance rose to 717 billion yuan ($104.31 billion) in June, the highest so far this year and accounting for a third of the first half's total, Hao Lei, a finance ministry official, told reporters on Tuesday. 
Over 60% of the funds raised from bonds in the first six months were used for infrastructure projects such as shanty-town redevelopment, and highway and railway construction, said Hao, adding that more than half of the funds went to existing projects. 
In the first half, local governments' total net bond issuance reached 2.1765 trillion yuan, accounting for 70.7% of the annual quota, the finance ministry said. 
The ministry did not give figures on local governments' issuance of special bonds, which exclusively fund infrastructure projects. 
Data on Monday showed China's economic growth slowed to 6.2% in the second quarter - the weakest pace since 1992 - from 6.4% in the first as demand at home and abroad faltered in the face of mounting U.S. trade pressure.
Fixed-asset investment in January-June rose 5.8% from a year earlier, picking up from 5.6% in the first five months.
Infrastucture investment rose 4.1%, only slightly better than the 3.8% increase seen in all of 2018.
But investment readings for June showed some signs of improvement, albeit modest, raising hopes that policy loosening efforts over the past year are beginning to gain traction. 
Infrastructure growth quickened last month to 3.9% on-year from 1.6% in May, according to Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) Merril Lynch. 
Separate official data on Tuesday showed fixed-asset investment project approvals in the first six months increased 81% by value from a year earlier.
Beijing began fast-tracking approvals last year as part of its push for more infrastructure spending, though analysts had cautioned it would take time for the effects to be felt.
The National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) approved 94 fixed-asset investment projects in January-June, worth a total of 471.5 billion yuan ($68.60 billion), Meng Wei, a spokeswoman for the state planner, told reporters.
That compared with 102 projects worth 260.3 billion yuan in the same period last year. 
""We estimate the quickest turnaround time for project launch post-NDRC approval is four to six months,"" ANZ said in a report on Tuesday. 
""In the wake of recent government efforts, we expect infrastructure investment to pick up moderately in H2 to about 5-6% y/y...However, China is unlikely to return to double-digit growth in the infrastructure sector in the near future."" 
SUPPORTIVE FISCAL POLICY
Earlier this month, Premier Li Keqiang said China's economy was facing new downward pressure, and the government would respond with more fiscal policy measures.
Beijing has already announced tax cuts worth nearly 2 trillion yuan and a quota of 2.15 trillion yuan for local governments to sell special bonds this year to fund key infrastructure projects.
Fiscal spending increased 10.7% in the first six months from a year earlier, while revenue rose 3.4%.
""In the first half, the nationwide fiscal spending growth was significantly faster than revenue growth, providing a strong support for investment in key areas,"" Liu Jinyun, another official with the ministry said at the same briefing.
Slower fiscal revenue growth this year was largely due to Beijing's tax and fee cuts, which has put pressure on local governments, the finance ministry's Hao said.
But he added the central government has stepped up fund transfers to local government to help ease financial strains. 
China's tax revenues rose only 0.9% in the first half from a year earlier, compared with a 5.4% rise in the first quarter.

932,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 15, 2019 10:11AM ET</span>","Brazil economic activity rebounds in May, cooling recession fears","By Jamie McGeever
BRASILIA (Reuters) - Economic activity in Brazil rose in May, a central bank indicator showed on Monday, the first increase this year and an indication that Brazil may avoid slipping back into recession.
The closely watched index, a leading indicator of gross domestic product (GDP), rose 0.54% in May, rebounding sharply from an upwardly revised -0.32% in April and slightly ahead of the median forecast in a Reuters poll of economists of 0.50%.
It snapped a run of four consecutive monthly declines, a run not seen since the first half of 2016 when Brazil was mired in one of the worst recessions in its history, and was the biggest rise since June 2018.
With GDP having contracted 0.2% in the first quarter, this might offer a sign that the economy may have avoided contraction, and therefore technical recession, in the second quarter.
The data follows figures last week that showed service sector activity in Brazil, which accounts for more than 70% of the economy, stagnated in May, confounding expectations for a fall. April's monthly growth was revised up as well.
But it is only one month. Overall, economic activity is still lower than it was for most of last year, the non-seasonally-adjusted IBC-Br index shows.
""The overall picture still shows a very moderate recovery in economic activity,"" analysts at XP Investimentos wrote in a note to clients on Monday.
Alberto Ramos, head of Latin American research at Goldman Sachs in New York, notes that, according to the monthly IBC-Br series, real GDP is still 7.9% below the December 2013 peak and just 3.6% above the December 2016 cyclical trough. This makes the current recovery the weakest on record.
If the IBC-Br economic activity in June remains constant at May's level, real GDP would decline 0.5% in the second quarter from the first, Ramos estimates.
The central bank expects second-quarter growth will be ""relatively stable"", suggesting the economy will skirt recession. The central bank and government both recently cut their 22019 GDP growth forecasts to 0.8%."

Fed 'Empire State' factory index posts biggest gain in over two years,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - The New York Federal Reserve said on Monday its gauge of manufacturing growth in New York state recorded its biggest increase in more than two years in July, returning to positive territory to suggest regional activity was expanding again.
The index's increase reversed the prior month's record 26 point drop that had stoked concerns about a sudden contraction in business activity across New York state.
""Manufacturing firms in New York State reported that business activity grew modestly in July,"" the New York Fed said of the latest figures.
U.S. business sentiment has been bogged down by trade tensions between the United States and its major trading partners. Some of those concerns have been offset by hopes the Federal Reserve would lower short-term interest costs to boost borrowing and demand.
The regional Fed's ""Empire State"" index on current business conditions jumped to 4.3 points this month from -8.6 in June, which had been the first negative reading since October 2016.
For July, analysts polled by Reuters had forecast a reading of 2.0.
A reading above zero suggests an expansion in regional business activity.
Details in the latest ""Empire"" report were mixed.
The new orders index rose to -1.5 from -12.0, which had been a three-year low.
The six-month outlook measure climbed to 30.8 from 25.7 the month before.
On the other hand, the employment gauge fell deeper into negative territory to -9.6 in July, which was the lowest since January 2016.
The index on prices paid slipped to 25.5 from 27.8, while the gauge on prices received ticked down to 5.8 from 6.8.

The level was earlier hit three years ago - its lowest since data became available in 2009, according to the report https://www.markiteconomics.com/Public/Home/PressRelease/757d0d0649724cfa8f1d71057cee35f2.
Hopes of pro-business government policies and a better financial flow continue to underpin optimism toward output and profitability growth in the year ahead, said Principal Economist Pollyanna De Lima said.
""As such, firms plan to expand capacities by taking on additional workers, though sentiment for all measures of expenditure are anaemic.""
Capital investment confidence in India is among the weakest of all countries for which comparable data are available, ahead of only China and the UK, while optimism regarding research and development is below the average for emerging markets, she said.
India expects its economy to grow 7% this year, after growth slowed to a five year-low of 6.8% in the last fiscal year, as New Delhi cautioned of challenges in keeping fiscal deficit in check earlier this month.
The country is also staring at a deficit monsoon this year, raising concerns over the output of summer-sown crops in a nation where 55% of arable land is rain-fed.
The survey also found companies were concerned about potential depreciation in the rupee pushing prices for imported materials higher, a lack of skilled labor, likely tax hikes, financial difficulties and customers increasingly demanding discounts.
The IHS Markit reports are produced on a triannual basis, with data collected in February, June and October.
A similar survey report last month by Thomson Reuters/INSEAD showed confidence among broader Asian companies was also at a 10-year low and showed little signs of easing."

939,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 15, 2019 12:50AM ET</span>",Why China Can’t Get Its Economy Moving,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- China’s new GDP numbers show that the world’s second-biggest economy is growing more slowly than at any time since the early 1990s. Chinese leaders know what they need to do to arrest the slide: pump more credit into private companies, which generate the majority of jobs and growth. The fact that growth isn’t picking up regardless of their efforts would suggest banks are resisting this imperative. But, the issue isn’t whether they’re complying, it’s how they’re choosing to do so.
The government is correct that the private sector’s health is essential to the viability of the overall economy. Private firms account for 80% of jobs, 60% of economic growth and about half of all fiscal revenue in China -- and manage to do so with far lower levels of debt than state-owned companies. Since May 2018, the central bank has thus repeatedly cut banks’ reserve requirement ratios to free up liquidity, then nudged banks to direct that credit toward private firms, especially small- and medium-sized enterprises.
At the same time, authorities have demanded that banks reduce risk which, in a slowing economy, should mean more conservative and market-oriented lending practices. Chinese banks consider small, private companies as the single riskiest group of borrowers in the economy. Unlike state-owned firms, they’re not backed by the government and often don’t have a lot of assets that they can post as security. 
Banks have found a way to balance these competing demands by ramping up a very specific type of lending -- discounting of bankers’ acceptances.
While bankers’ acceptances exist the world over, they play an outsized role in China’s financial system. When a company buys something from a supplier, it can pay using a bankers’ acceptance, issued by a bank on behalf of the buyer. When the acceptance matures at some pre-arranged point in the future, the supplier exchanges it for cash from the bank for the amount of the sale. The bank then seeks payment from the company on whose behalf it issued the acceptance. Sometimes, however, the company that’s been paid with an acceptance needs money before it’s due. It can then go to any bank and exchange the acceptance for cash, albeit at a discount to the value of the acceptance. In short, discounting is not unlike a low-interest payday loan, with the bank lending against future income. The discount rate is currently about 3.6%, which means that if a company cashes in a 100-yuan acceptance that matures in six months, it will receive a discounted 98.2 yuan from the bank. 
For the past year, growth in bank lending to nonfinancial companies has been driven solely by bankers’ acceptance discounting. At the end of April 2019, the outstanding volume of discounted bankers’ acceptances -- what the People’s Bank of China refers to as “paper financing” -- was up 2.92 trillion yuan ($425 billion), or 76%, from a year earlier, accounting for 32% of all new credit created in that period. Meanwhile, new medium- and long-term loans declined 6% over the same period to 5.53 trillion yuan. Short-term loans (which accounted for 4% of new loans) fell 67%.
For banks, discounting seems like a handy solution to their political dilemma. Most of the companies that present acceptances for discounting are small, privately owned firms -- just the kind of companies the government is looking to support. At the same time, discounting is the safest type of corporate loan a bank can make. While the cash goes to a company, the counterparty risk lies with the bank that issued the acceptance.
In effect, discounted bankers’ acceptances are interbank loans. Consequently, the risk-weighted capital that banks need to set aside against them is far less than that required for ordinary corporate loans. That’s particularly useful at a time when the large volume of bad-loan write-offs is making unprecedented demands on bank capital. What acceptances don’t do, unfortunately, is expand economic activity. As a rule, companies don’t like discounting their acceptances. Many Chinese firms operate on wafer-thin margins, and discounting erodes their profits. Only when they desperately need cash -- to pay wages, bonuses, taxes and social security contributions, utilities and interest on loans -- do they resort to the tactic.
While acceptances are useful as a way of getting cash to companies that are otherwise struggling to stay alive, therefore, they don’t provide either the investment capital or working capital needed to stimulate growth. For that, banks would have to extend real (and far riskier) loans to companies, which they’re still loath to do.
The central bank has supported discounting as the answer to the private sector’s problems. Other branches of the government are less convinced. At the end of June, an official from the National Audit Office said the financing environment for small firms hasn’t “fundamentally improved.” Till now, Chinese policymakers and banks have been able to convince themselves that they can make the country’s financial system safer while also stimulating growth. They may soon have to choose between the two."

Gross domestic product rose 6.2.% in the April-June period from a year earlier, below the 6.4% expansion in the first quarter and matching economists’ estimates. In June, factory output rose 6.3%, retail sales rose 9.8%, while investment gained 5.8% in the first half of the year -- all three beating estimates.
The slowdown adds to the pressure Chinese policy makers face as they attempt to negotiate a deal with the U.S. while balancing the objective of job creation with the need to defuse financial risks at home. Although Chinese negotiators are talking with their U.S. counterparts again, there is no certainty that a deal will be reached.
“We expect Beijing to ramp up stimulus measures in the second half despite more limited policy room, though markets should not put too high expectations on the scale and duration of these stimulus measures,” Nomura International economists led by Lu Ting wrote in a recent research note. “Domestic policies will to a large extent be dependent on the U.S.-China trade tensions.”"

ROME (Reuters) - Italy's business outlook improved more sharply than that of any other country in the four months to June, according to a global survey released on Monday which offers signs of hope for the country's struggling economy.
The survey, conducted three times a year by IHS Markit, showed Italy's business confidence at a one-year high, with optimism regarding future activity, employment and capital expenditure all rising from the previous survey in February.
The euro zone's third largest economy eked out growth of 0.1% in the first quarter, emerging from a shallow recession in the second half of last year, and national statistics bureau ISTAT has warned the second quarter may see another contraction.
However, the IHS Market survey showed the net balance of companies forecasting an increase in activity in the coming 12 months at +29%, up from +23% in February and the highest since June 2018.
""This improvement since the opening quarter is the greatest among all the countries for which comparable data are available,"" said IHS Markit, which surveyed some 12,000 businesses in 17 major countries and regions between June 12-25.
The improvement in confidence in Italy was broad-based. Manufacturers' net activity balance of +28 was the highest since February 2018, while service providers posted a balance of +30, which was a one-year high.
Service companies cited expectations of improved internal demand, more public investment and better utilization of technology as reasons for confidence, while manufacturers expected a recovery in foreign demand and a lower tax burden.
Conversely, political instability and an increasing global trend towards trade protectionism were reported by both manufacturers and services as the main threats to the outlook.
While the Italian economy has been broadly stagnant since the second quarter of 2018, a recent plunge in borrowing costs may improve credit conditions and sentiment.
Italian bond yields fell this month to their lowest since 2016, thanks to a deal with the European Commission, which averted a clash over Italy's public finances, and to expectations that the ECB will retain its ultra-dovish stance under its incoming president, Christine Lagarde.
The labor market has also showed signs of improvement. The jobless rate fell to a 7-year low of 9.9% in May, as some 67,000 jobs were created, while the overall employment rate rose to 59%, its highest level on record."
945,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 12, 2019 11:53AM ET</span>","U.S. producer prices up slightly, point to moderate inflation","By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. producer prices rose slightly for the second straight month in June as an acceleration in the cost of services was offset by cheaper energy goods, resulting in the smallest annual increase in producer inflation in nearly 2-1/2 years. 
The report from the Labor Department on Friday also showed a slowdown in underlying producer prices last month, a sign that overall inflation could remain moderate for a while despite strong gains in prices of some consumer goods and services in June. The tepid readings also suggested that tariffs on Chinese imports were not yet having an impact on inflation. 
The low inflation environment and rising risks to the economy from the trade war between the United States and China, and cooling global growth are likely to see the Federal Reserve cutting interest rates this month for the first time in a decade. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell on Wednesday told lawmakers the U.S. central bank would ""act as appropriate"" to protect the economy against these risks. 
""We don't anticipate any significant acceleration in inflation through the remainder of this year,"" said Ryan Sweet, a senior economist at Moody's Analytics in West Chester, Pennsylvania. ""Therefore, the Fed can cut rates in July and then keep them unchanged through 2020.""
The producer price index for final demand edged up 0.1% last month after a similar gain in May. In the 12 months through June, the PPI rose 1.7%, the smallest gain since January 2017, slowing from a 1.8% increase in May. 
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the PPI unchanged in June and increasing 1.6% on a year-on-year basis.
Excluding the volatile food, energy and trade services components, producer prices were unchanged in June after rising 0.4% for two straight months. The so-called core PPI increased 2.1% in the 12 months through June after advancing 2.3% in May. 
The dollar was little changed against a basket of currencies, while U.S. Treasury prices rose. Stocks on Wall Street were trading higher, with the S&P 500 and Dow indexes hitting record highs on rate cut expectations.
GOODS PRICES FALL
The Fed, which has a 2% inflation target, tracks the core personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index for monetary policy. The core PCE price index increased 1.6% year-on-year in May and has undershot its target this year. 
In June, wholesale energy prices fell 3.1% after slipping 1.0% in the prior month. Goods prices decreased 0.4% last month after declining 0.2% in May. A 5.0% drop in gasoline prices accounted for nearly 60% of the decline in the cost of goods last month. 
Wholesale food prices rebounded 0.6% in June, driven by chicken eggs and fresh fruits and melons. Corn prices surged 19.9%, the largest rise since July 2015. But meat prices fell. 
Excluding food and energy, goods prices were unchanged for the third straight month.
""The prices of core goods that companies pay to produce their products are seeing no lift from the tariffs that the Trump administration has put in place,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG in New York. ""That's not good news as it speaks volumes to the weakening demand seen in the manufacturing sector this year.""
Manufacturing is struggling under the weight of trade tensions, an inventory bloat and a slowing global economy.
The cost of services increased 0.4% in June, the most since October 2018, after rising 0.3% in May. Services were boosted by an increase in margins received by wholesalers and retailers.
The cost of healthcare services rose 0.2% last month, matching May's gain. While prices for doctor visits and dental care were unchanged last month, the cost of hospital care increased a solid 0.4%. 
Those healthcare costs feed into the core PCE price index. Last month's gains in wholesale healthcare prices, combined with an increase in costs at the consumer level in June, were seen offsetting a 1.8% drop in portfolio management prices. 
Economists are forecasting the core PCE price index rising 0.2% in June, which would lift the annual increase to 1.7%. June's PCE price data is scheduled to be released on July 30.

""While core PCE will likely remain around this somewhat below 2% range for the next few months, favorable base effects later in the year continue to imply a return to the 2% target around the start of 2020,"" said Veronica Clark, an economist at  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) in New York.

Imports to the smaller Port of Long Beach dropped 13.7% from June 2018, more than offsetting the 3.5% gain at the Port of Los Angeles, which processed 396,306.5 20-foot equivalent units, a standardized maritime measurement for counting cargo containers.
June was the second month of import declines at the sprawling facility, which is in the midst of what is typically the peak season for inbound shipments of goods earmarked for winter holiday sales.
Logistics companies ranging from ocean shippers to parcel delivery companies are bellwethers for the global economy. Many have warned that the global economy is cooling, due in part to trade tensions between the United States and China.
May's decline was largely due to China's Cosco Shipping's (SS:601919) cutting volume at the Port of Long Beach, S&P Global Market Intelligence's trade data firm Panjiva said in a recent report. A spokesman for the Long Beach Port on Thursday said the facility saw similar shifts by cargo ships in June.
U.S. seaports booked record imports in 2018 after retailers rushed to bring in a swath of Chinese goods - including furniture, appliances and auto parts - before they were subject to new tariffs. Retailers stuffed warehouses to the rafters and are still working through that inventory.
The Trump administration escalated the trade conflict this May, announcing a tariff hike on $200 billion of Chinese products. China retaliated with tariffs on $60 billion of U.S. goods.
The United States has paused plans to hit China with tariffs on an additional $300 billion of goods while the two countries seek a trade deal.
""Retailers still want to protect their customers against potential price increases that would come with any additional tariffs, but with the latest proposed tariffs on hold for now and warehouses bulging, there's only so much they can do,"" said Jonathan Gold, the National Retail Federation's vice president for supply chain and customs policy.
U.S. exports, which have been hard hit by China's retaliatory tariffs, fell 3.4% year-on-year in June, the two ports said."
947,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 12, 2019 01:10AM ET</span>",Five Reasons Why Poland’s Inflation Surge Shouldn’t Be Ignored,"(Bloomberg) -- Poland’s central bank is adamant that this year’s steep pickup in inflation is nothing to worry about.
Yes, price growth will quicken more, admits Governor Adam Glapinski. But after it’s expected to hit 3% this year and near 3.5% in early 2020, it will start to ease in about 12 months’ time, he says. That’s enough, the policy maker said, to maintain interest rates at the record-low level they’ve been at since 2015.
There are grounds to believe him. The world’s major central banks are leaning toward looser monetary policy as the global economy loses steam -- a factor that will restrain Polish inflation. The zloty strengthened to a 14-month high against the euro in July, reducing the prices of imports.
But, equally, there are reasons to question whether Glapinski’s narrative is overly optimistic. Here are some.
1. Booming wages
An influx of workers from neighboring Ukraine has for years offset labor shortages, helping keep salaries -- and inflation -- in check. But looser rules in Germany could lure away a quarter of the country’s Ukrainian workforce in the next four years, according to a central bank study published last month. Unemployment, meanwhile, remains near a record low.
2. Tax shake-up
Levies on Poland’s biggest retailers and providers of telecommunications services are expected to be shifted to customers. That will boost services prices, which have been the second-biggest driver of inflation of late. Furthermore, there’s evidence of the end of cut-throat competition among telecoms as well as banks, which have been increasing fees. This bodes well for their shareholders but worse for consumers, who can expect higher prices if price competition declines.
3. Food costs
Price for everyday items from pork to potatoes have rocketed. The gains may not be over as hot, dry weather threatens this year’s harvest and global meat prices rise. That’s putting the squeeze on low-income households, where food makes up a bigger share of budgets. Such families may be experiencing inflation that’s 0.6 percentage point higher on average, according to recent central-bank data.
4. Energy market
An inflation threat that failed to materialize this year, energy costs haven’t disappeared as a risk factor. Prices for medium-sized and large companies will be deregulated in 2020, meaning greater fluctuations. There’s no decision yet on costs for consumers, which were frozen by the government for 2019, giving the central bank a helping hand.
5. Closing the regional gap
Poland’s economy has been the envy of its neighbors in recent years, boasting stellar expansion alongside benign inflation that’s allowed the central bank to maintain loose monetary policy. That era is drawing to a close. Looking around eastern Europe, Poland’s belated inflation spurt -- the European Union’s fastest acceleration this year -- could have further to run. Within the region, only Polish inflation will quicken next year, according to the European Commission.
None of these threats ruffles the central bank. Piotr Szpunar, who’s responsible for staff projections, says downside risks pose a greater danger to his forecasts.
Not everyone’s convinced.
“We see inflation approaching 4% at the start of 2020,” economists at Santander (MC:SAN) Bank Polska SA wrote. “But even in our price-growth scenario, it seems very unlikely that the MPC will decide to tighten monetary policy before the end of that year.”

948,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 12, 2019 12:10AM ET</span>",Singapore’s Shock Contraction Sends Warning for World Trade,"(Bloomberg) -- An unexpected contraction in Singapore’s economy in the second quarter sent a warning shot to the world economy as simmering trade tensions wilt business confidence and activity.
Gross domestic product in the export-reliant city state shrank an annualized 3.4% in the quarter from the first three months of the year, the biggest decline since 2012. That was worse than the 0.5% expansion forecast in a Bloomberg survey of economists and followed growth of 3.8% in the first quarter.
Like South Korea’s economy -- which already contracted in the first quarter -- Singapore is often held up as a bellwether for global demand given its heavy reliance on foreign trade. The bad data comes ahead of China trade figures later Friday and quarterly GDP numbers on Monday, which will likely show a clear weakening in the economy.
“Singapore is the canary in the coal mine, being very open and sensitive to trade,” said Chua Hak Bin, an economist at Maybank Kim Eng Research Pte in Singapore. The data “points to the risk of a deepening slowdown for the rest of Asia.”
Across Asia and Europe, factory activity shrank in June while the U.S. showed only a meager economic expansion. Asia is the world’s growth engine and contributes more than 60% of global GDP, according to the International Monetary Fund.
Rob Subbaraman, head of global macro research and co-head of global markets research at Nomura Holdings Inc, concurred, saying the “large downside GDP miss does not bode well for the rest of Asia.”
Singapore’s complicated integration in regional and global supply chains makes it vulnerable to a slowdown in world growth and tariff wars. Exports have already taken a big hit over the past few months, with shipments plunging in May by the most since early 2013.
“I thought the numbers would be bad, but this is ugly,” Chua said. “The whiff of a technical recession is real. We thought it might be shallow, but the risk now is that it might be deeper.”
Compared with a year ago, Singapore’s GDP growth slowed to 0.1% in the second quarter, lower than the 1.1% median estimate in a Bloomberg survey. The Ministry of Trade’s figures are advanced estimates based on the first two months’ data, and will likely be revised when the final estimates are published next month.
The Singapore dollar fell as much as 0.1% to 1.3588 against the U.S. dollar after the data.
Aside from trade tensions, a cooling technology boom is weighing on the outlook. About 40% of Singapore’s exports are integrated circuits alone, according to Tuuli McCully, head of Asia-Pacific economics at Scotiabank in Singapore.
“The downturn in the global semiconductor sector is reflected in Singapore more than in most countries in the region,” McCully said.
The slump wasn’t restricted to Singapore’s export sector only. While manufacturing contracted an annualized 6% in the second quarter from the previous three months, construction plunged 7.6%, reversing a 13.3% expansion in the first quarter. The services industry shrank 1.5% in the second quarter.
That weakness may prompt the Monetary Authority of Singapore, the nation’s central bank, to keep policy unchanged in October or possibly ease. The MAS uses the exchange rate as its main tool and left policy settings steady in April.
“If by October there is a recession and the U.S.-China trade war still fails to find a resolution, the MAS would probably have to ease policy,” Chua said.
The government sees the economy expanding 1.5%-2.5% this year, compared with 3.1% in 2018. Officials are set to revise that projection in August, Minister for Trade & Industry Chan Chun Sing told Parliament this week, adding that Singapore was “well-placed to weather the storm” given its sound economic fundamentals, strong fiscal position, and progress in restructuring the economy.
What Bloomberg Economists Say
“As weak as Singapore’s standstill in 2Q GDP was, 2H will probably be much worse without a rapprochement in U.S.-China trade relations. Our forecast for a 0.2% year-on-year contraction in 2019 remains on course.”
-- Tamara Henderson, Asean economist
A restart to U.S.-China trade negotiations has done little to convince economists that the global economy can skirt a slowdown through the end of 2019 and perhaps beyond.  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) analysts last month cut both their 2019 and 2020 growth forecasts by 20 basis points each, to 3% and 3.2%.
“With a resolution of the U.S.-China trade conflict and a rebound in the global tech cycle both still elusive, the downside risks to growth in the region are mounting,” said Krystal Tan, an economist at Australia & New Zealand Banking Group Ltd. in Singapore.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. underlying consumer prices increased by the most in nearly 1-1/2 years in June amid solid gains in a range of goods and services, but that did not change expectations the Federal Reserve would cut interest rates this month.
Signs of a pick-up in underlying inflation and a strong labor market reported by the Labor Department on Thursday, however, further tempered financial market expectations of a 50 basis point cut at the end of the month and views that the Fed would lower borrowing costs at least twice this year. 
A rate cut at the July 30-31 policy meeting, the first in a decade, is almost certain after Fed Chairman Jerome Powell on Wednesday told lawmakers the U.S. central bank would ""act as appropriate"" to protect the economy from rising risks such as trade tensions and slowing global growth. 
""This argues against aggressive monetary stimulus from the central bank,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG in New York. ""Fed officials are unlikely to cut interest rates more than one or two times this year no matter how badly the Trump economics team wants even more stimulus to stoke the economy's engines of growth going into next year's presidential election.""
President Donald Trump has repeatedly urged the Fed to cut rates because of low inflation and last week said the economy ""would be like a rocket ship,"" with easier monetary policy.
The consumer price index excluding the volatile food and energy components rose 0.3% last month, the largest increase since January 2018, after four straight monthly gains of 0.1%.
The so-called core CPI was boosted by strong gains in prices for apparel, used cars and trucks, as well as household furnishings. There were also increases in the cost of healthcare and rents. In the 12 months through June, the core CPI climbed 2.1% after advancing 2.0% in May.
But the overall CPI edged up 0.1% last month, held back by cheaper gasoline and food, matching May's rise. It increased 1.6% year-on-year in June, slowing from May's 1.8% rise.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the CPI unchanged in June and the core CPI gaining 0.2%.
The Fed, which has a 2% inflation target, tracks the core personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index for monetary policy. The core PCE price index increased 1.6% year-on-year in May and has undershot its target this year. 
The central bank last month downgraded its inflation projection for 2019 to 1.5% from the 1.8% projected in March. Powell on Wednesday said ""there is a risk that weak inflation will be even more persistent than we currently anticipate.""
Following June's solid increase in the core CPI, Fed officials will be watching to see if that translates into a rebound in both consumers' and market-based inflation expectations, which have dropped over the past year.
""One of the primary reasons the Fed is going to cut rates is that inflation expectations have fallen, so if expectations bounce back it may limit the scope of the impending easing cycle,"" said Eric Winograd, senior economist at AllianceBernstein in New York. ""I think it will take a few months of data for that to happen.""
The dollar was little changed against a basket of currencies after the data, while U.S. Treasury prices fell. Stocks on Wall Street were mixed.
HEALTHY LABOR MARKET
In another report on Thursday, the Labor Department said initial claims for state unemployment benefits dropped 13,000 to a seasonally adjusted 209,000 for the week ended July 6, the lowest level since April. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast claims rising to 223,000 last week.
The labor market remains healthy despite the rising risks to the 10-year old economic expansion, the longest in history.
""The labor market has not weakened in a meaningful way since the escalations in trade policy a few months ago,"" said Daniel Silver, an economist at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) in New York.
Economic growth is also slowing as last year's massive stimulus from tax cuts and more government spending fades. Manufacturing is struggling, the trade deficit is widening again, consumer spending is rising moderately and the housing sector remains mired in a soft patch.
Economists expect the tightening labor market, which is lifting wages, and the imposition in May of more tariffs on Chinese goods to gradually push inflation towards its 2% target. 
In June, owners' equivalent rent of primary residence, which is what a homeowner would pay to rent or receive from renting a home, rose 0.3%, matching May's gain. The rent index shot up 0.4%. Healthcare costs increased 0.3%, after a similar advance in May. There was a 1.1% surge in the cost of dental services, but prescription drug prices fell 0.6%. 
Apparel prices jumped 1.1% after being unchanged in May. Prices for apparel tumbled in March and April after the government introduced a new method and data to calculate their cost. Used motor vehicles and trucks prices accelerated 1.6% in June after declining for four straight months.
The price of household furnishings and operations rose 0.8%, the biggest gain since 1991, driven by rising costs for gardening and lawn care services. There were also increases in the costs of motor vehicle insurance, education, new vehicles and communication.

But consumers paid less for gasoline last month, with prices dropping 3.6% after falling 0.5% in May. Food prices were unchanged last month after rebounding 0.3% in May. Food consumed at home fell 0.2% amid declines in the prices for beef, fish, eggs, cereals and fruit and vegetables.

Initial claims for state unemployment benefits declined 13,000 to a seasonally adjusted 209,000 for the week ended July 6, the lowest level since April, the Labor Department said on Thursday. Data for the prior week was revised to show 1,000 more applications received than previously reported.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast claims rising to 223,000 in the latest week.
The four-week moving average of initial claims, considered a better measure of labor market trends as it irons out week-to-week volatility, fell 3,250 to 219,250 last week.
The Labor Department said no claims were estimated last week. The claims data is entering a period of volatility as auto manufacturers temporarily shut down assembly plants for summer retooling. Companies carry out the plant closures at different times, which can throw off the model the government uses to strip out seasonal fluctuations from the data.
There is still no sign of an increase in layoffs related to a trade war between the United States and China, which has helped to dim the economy's outlook and raise expectations for an interest rate cut this month, the first in a decade.
Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell told lawmakers on Wednesday that the U.S. central bank would ""act as appropriate"" to protect the economy from the trade tensions and slowing global growth.
Fed officials are scheduled to meet on July 30-31. The economy is also slowing as last year's massive stimulus from tax cuts and more government spending fades. Manufacturing is struggling, the trade deficit is widening again, consumer spending is rising moderately and the housing sector remains mired in a soft patch.
Despite the rising risks to the 10-year old economic expansion, the longest in history, the labor market remains healthy. The economy created 224,000 job in June. While the unemployment rate ticked up one-tenth of a percentage point to 3.7%, that was because more people entered the labor market, a sign of confidence in their employment prospects.
Thursday's claims report also showed the number of people receiving benefits after an initial week of aid increased 27,000 to 1.72 million for the week ended June 29, the highest level since March. The four-week moving average of the so-called continuing claims rose 5,750 to 1.69 million."

The Commerce Department said on Wednesday wholesale inventories increased 0.4% as reported last month after advancing 0.8% in April. Wholesale inventories increased 7.7% on a year-on-year basis May.
The component of wholesale inventories that goes into the calculation of gross domestic product gained 0.2% in May.
An accumulation in inventories contributed to a 3.1% annualized increase in GDP in the first quarter. Inventories are expected to have subtracted from GDP growth in the second quarter. The Atlanta Federal Reserve is forecasting the economy grew at a 1.3% rate in the second quarter.
The government will publish its advance second-quarter GDP growth estimate later this month.
The inventory bulge is concentrated in the automobile industry, which is experiencing a slowdown in sales.
Excess inventory, together with trade tensions between the United States and China, sluggish global growth and design problems related to Boeing's (N:BA) MAX 737 aircraft are weighing on manufacturing.
In May, wholesale auto inventories increased 1.8% after surging 3.9% in the prior month. There were also increases in professional equipment, furniture and hardware inventories.
But electrical goods inventories fell by the most since January 2016. Metal inventories recorded their biggest drop since October 2016.
Sales at wholesalers nudged up 0.1% in May after declining 0.4% in April. Motor vehicle sales accelerated 3.2% in May after rising 1.0%. At May's sales pace it would take wholesalers 1.35 months to clear shelves, up from 1.34 months in April."

The exception was interest rates on 30-year fixed-rate ""conforming"" mortgages, or loans whose balances are $484,350 or less. They averaged 4.04% last week, lower than last week's 4.07%.
For the week, mortgage rates moved in step with a spike in U.S. bond yields after a stronger-than-expected increase in domestic payrolls in June.
The Labor Department said on Friday that the economy added 224,000 jobs in June after adding just 75,000 jobs in May while the unemployment rate increased to 3.7% from 3.6%.

BEIJING (Reuters) - China is likely to see vehicle sales drop again this year as opposed to earlier expectations for zero growth, the country's biggest auto industry association said, after it unveiled data showing the sector contracted for a 12th straight month in June.
The lower forecast by the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers (CAAM) comes amid a spate of downward revisions by industry experts, triggered by a prolonged and increasingly pronounced sales slump in the world's top auto market.
Sales in China, where auto demand last year contracted for the first time since the 1990s, could drop by less than 5% in 2019 if Beijing can effectively implement supportive policies, senior CAAM official Shi Jianhua said.
Car sales in China fell 2.8% in 2018.
Despite continued strength in new-energy vehicle (NEV) sales, overall auto sales in China have stayed bleak in the first half of 2019, with 12.3 million vehicles, or 12.4% less from a year earlier being sold over the period, CAAM data shows.
Sales in June fell 9.6% to 2.06 million vehicles.
The government needs to implement new policies to buoy sales, CAAM said, adding measures so far have not been ""as effective and strong as consumers had expected"".
China has since January been trying to boost consumption of wide-ranging goods as the world's No.2 economy slows further in 2019 amid a bruising trade spat with the United States.
But its measures to spur car sales have disappointed as they included no plans to relax controls over the issuance of new licenses for traditional-fuel cars in major cities.
Consumers were also disappointed as the government did not reinstate a tax cut on small-engine vehicles in rural areas, said Alan Kang, a senior analyst at consultancy LMC Automotive.
The implementation of new vehicle emission standards earlier than the central government's 2020 deadline by 15 cities and provinces, which account for over 60% of car sales in China, spooked buyers too and hurt sales, according to CAAM, analysts, dealers and consumers.
NEV SALES
Even as China's auto market weakened, sales of NEVs have continued to grow.
NEV sales rose 80% in June to 152,000 vehicles, bringing January-June sales to 617,000, up almost 50% from a year ago.
NEVs include plug-in hybrids, battery-only electric vehicles and hydrogen fuel cell vehicles. China, blighted by air pollution, has been a keen supporter of NEVs, requiring automakers to meet production quotas.
Last year, NEV sales in the country jumped almost 62% even as the broader market shrank.
CAAM said NEV sales rose sharply in June as buyers responded positively to incentives producers offered in anticipation of a planned rolling-back of official purchase subsidies.
Beijing implemented a 5-year subsidy program for the NEV sector in 2016 to support sales and encourage innovation. But it has been slowly rolling back the program and plans to phase out subsidies after 2020 amid criticism that some producers have become overly reliant on the funds."

Overall output expanded 0.3% after contracting by 0.4% in April, the Office for National Statistics said, stronger than all forecasts in a Reuters poll that had pointed a rise of 0.1%.
""The economy returned to growth in the month of May, following the fall seen in April. This was mainly due to the partial recovery in car production,"" ONS statistician Rob Kent-Smith said.
Car manufacturers in Britain brought forward their annual summer maintenance shutdowns to April to help dodge potential disruption in the aftermath of the original March 29 Brexit deadline, which has now been pushed back to October.
The Bank of England, worried about global trade tensions as well as Brexit uncertainty, forecast last month that economic output would flatline during the three months to June after growth of 0.5% in the first-quarter of the year.
Business surveys last week showed the world's fifth-biggest economy lost momentum in June and might even have shrunk in the second quarter of 2019.
But Wednesday's data suggested the economy might be on track to eke out a little growth in the second quarter.
Output in the three months to May was 0.3% higher than in the previous three-month period, helped by an upward revision to growth in March and again beating the consensus forecast for growth of 0.1%.

958,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 10, 2019 01:11AM ET</span>","China's June factory prices flat, food costs stay high","By Stella Qiu and Kevin Yao
BEIJING (Reuters) - China's producer prices flatlined in June on lower oil prices and weak global demand, fuelling concerns that a slowdown in manufacturing from a bruising trade war will further drag on growth in the world's second-biggest economy.
The producer price index (PPI) showed no growth in June from a year earlier, the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) said on Wednesday. That compared with a 0.6% rise in May and a gain of 0.3% forecast by economists in a Reuters poll.
The June PPI reading was the lowest since August 2016 when the index last fell year-on-year. Factory gate prices slowed from May as well, falling 0.3%. 
On the other hand, June consumer price growth in annual terms matched a 15-month high seen in May as supply shortages triggered by the African swine fever outbreak and extreme weather conditions continued to push up pork and fruit prices.
A cooling in producer prices, seen as a gauge of industrial demand that gives momentum to investment and profits in the Chinese economy, may rekindle worries about deflation and prompt the authorities to launch more aggressive stimulus. 
""The bigger picture is inflation, apart from food inflation, is actually pretty weak and with the economy continuing to cool, I think the return to factory-gate deflation is very likely,"" said Julian Evans-Pritchard, senior China economist at Capital Economics.
Tommy Xie, China economist at OCBC Bank in Singapore, also said he saw the risk of produce prices contracting in annual terms as early as next month. 
Upstream sectors were particularly weak, with prices for oil and natural gas extraction down 1.8% from a year earlier, the NBS data showed. Price gains in the coal mining sector also eased. 
Although Beijing and Washington reached another truce in their trade war last month, economists expect continuing pressure on the Chinese economy as manufacturers shift more production abroad to avoid U.S. tariffs on China-made goods. 
China's factory activity shrank more than expected in June as tariffs and weaker domestic demand hit new orders for goods. 
Beijing is fast-tracking more infrastructure projects but prices for some construction materials remain lackluster. 
Spot prices for steel rebar in June lingered below the levels of a year earlier and may worsen due to seasonal slackening of construction activity amid high temperatures and rainfall in summer. 
Premier Li Keqiang pledged earlier this month to implement financing tools including reserve requirement ratio (RRR) cuts to support small and private firms, adding to expectations for further stimulus measures. 
At the same time, however, he and other top policymakers have reiterated that China will not resort to large-scale stimulus.
Evans-Pritchard from Capital Economics said the government could adopt more monetary easing and off-budget fiscal support to bolster the economy.
""But I think the days of big drastic stimulus are probably over. The most we can hope for is really it (more government support) helps to dampen the headwinds and prevent the economy from slowing too sharply.""
CPI STILL ELEVATED 
The consumer price index (CPI) in June rose 2.7% in annual terms, driven by higher food prices. Fruit prices surged 42.7% from a year earlier while pork prices rose 21.1%. 
Analysts polled by Reuters expected consumer prices to rise 2.7%, matching the pace seen in May.
Some economists said consumer inflation may accelerate due to dwindling pig stocks, but others contended price rises will cool.
""CPI may have peaked in June and could come off steadily in the second half,"" said Wang Jun, Beijing-based chief economist at Zhongyuan Bank. ""There are deflationary risks but the overall pressure is not big, because deflationary risk is only restricted to manufacturing products.""
Core inflation that strips out volatile food and energy prices was at 1.6% in June from a year earlier, the same annual pace as in May.

On a month-on-month basis, CPI fell 0.1% in June after no change in May.

959,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 10, 2019 12:20AM ET</span>",China’s Looming Deflation Fears Strengthen Policy Easing Case,"(Bloomberg) -- The case for Chinese policy makers to ramp up stimulus grew stronger, as tepid domestic demand and falling commodity prices increase the risk of a return to factory deflation.
Growth in China’s producer price index slowed to zero in June from a year earlier, the weakest reading in almost three years. Prices fell 0.3% from May. The downward trend accentuates fears of a return of deflation for manufacturing, which would erode company profits and increase debt repayment pressures.
The prospect of falling prices adds to the case for the People’s Bank of China to increase stimulus to the economy, with policy makers keen to keep output stable amid restarted trade talks with the U.S. The government will release gross domestic product and other data for the second quarter on July 15.
Factory prices have “fallen faster than I expected, and if they continue to decelerate, it means overall domestic demand is weak,” said Liu Peiqian, Asia strategist at Natwest Markets Plc in Singapore. “While a single month’s data wouldn’t be enough to alter their monetary policy stance, the PBOC will likely take swift actions if it continues to drop at a rapid pace.”
On the other hand, consumer prices stabilized at 2.7% year-on-year, the same as in May and in line with estimates. Core inflation, excluding volatile food and energy prices, remained at 1.6%.
What Bloomberg’s Economists Say
China’s June price data intensify our concern that the industrial sector is slipping back into deflation. That is likely to get the PBOC’s attention because of the potential damage to industrial enterprises’ profits -- and the negative spillover that has on the economy. The divergence of consumer and factory prices will also put a squeeze on profits.
PPI is likely to go below zero, and this will increase pressure on the central bank.
-- David Qu, Bloomberg EconomistFor the full note, click here
Historically, lower producer prices in China put pressure on the global inflation outlook as export prices usually follow those at factory gate. If that also holds true this time, it would add to global concerns on growth and raise questions about what other central banks will do.
Given concerns over domestic asset price bubbles and the fragile yuan, China is unlikely to embark on an aggressive cycle of cuts to the benchmark one-year lending rate. Economists have dialed up expectations that the PBOC will reduce the amount of cash banks have to deposit with the central bank, according to a recent survey by Bloomberg. Borrowing costs of the PBOC’s daily open market operations are also seen declining.
U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell’s scheduled testimony to Congress later on July 10 will also provide clues as to China’s room to maneuver on domestic policy.
“The PBOC and the economy will likely maintain an easing bias, rather than tightening,“ Chang Jian,  Barclays  (LON:BARC) Bank PLC’s chief China Economist said on Bloomberg TV, noting that the central bank has been providing the markets with liquidity after the takeover of a small lender caused inter-bank lending issues.
“We do see some downward pressures to the data coming next week,” she said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. job openings fell in May, pulled down by declines in the construction and transportation industries, potentially flagging a slowdown in employment growth in the months ahead.
The Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey, or JOLTS report from the Labor Department on Tuesday also showed a sharp drop in hiring in May, but layoffs remained low. After hitting an all-time high of 7.6 million in late 2018, job openings have been flat this year, suggesting some cooling in the labor market. 
Still, the labor market remains strong. That is helping to underpin the economy, which is slowing amid trade tensions, tepid global growth and fading stimulus from last year's massive tax cuts and increased government spending. 
""The JOLTS report looks consistent with the idea that the labor market is cooling somewhat but that it remains in solid shape,"" said Daniel Silver, an economist at JP Morgan in New York. ""The JOLTS data don't show any obvious big reaction to the recent news on trade policy, which is consistent with the message from some other timelier labor market indicators.""
Job openings, a measure of labor demand, slipped by 49,000 to a seasonally adjusted 7.3 million in May, the government said in the JOLTS report. The job openings rate dipped to 4.6% from 4.7% in April.
Vacancies in the construction industry dropped by 65,000 in May. Job openings in the transportation, warehousing, and utilities sector declined by 60,000, while unfilled positions in the real estate and rental and leasing industry fell 49,000.
Construction and transportation industries have been identified as among those struggling with worker shortages.
Declining job openings were also corroborated by a survey from the National Federation of Independent Business on Tuesday showing a decrease in the share of small business owners reporting vacancies they could not fill in June, even as about fifth cited the difficulty of finding qualified workers as their single most important problem.
FACTORIES RUNNING OUT OF WORKERS 
But vacancies in manufacturing rose to a record 509,000 in May from 496,000 in April, suggesting that factories were running out of workers, despite a weakening in activity against the backdrop of an inventory overhang and the trade war between the United States and China. 
""There's no way we can level the playing field and bring factories back to the USA because there is simply no one available to work in them and produce the goods that Americans want,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG in New York
Hiring dropped by 266,000 to 5.7 million in May, with the biggest decrease in the professional and business services industry. The hiring rate fell to 3.8% from 4.0% in April. The drop in hiring explains the sharp step-down in job growth in May, with an increase of only 72,000 in nonfarm payrolls.
Job gains have since rebounded, with payrolls surging by 224,000 jobs in June, the government reported last Friday. The unemployment rate rose one-tenth of a percentage point to 3.7% as more people entered the labor market, a sign of confidence in their employment prospects.
The number of workers voluntarily quitting their jobs dipped to 3.4 million in May from 3.5 million in April. The quits rate was unchanged at 2.3% for the 12th straight month. 
The quits rate is viewed by policymakers and economists as a measure of job market confidence. There was, however, an increase in the number of workers quitting their jobs in the state and local education sector.
""A tight labor market and plentiful private sector opportunities appear to be drawing teachers away from their stable, but often poorly paid, jobs,"" said Julia Pollak, an economist at ZipRecruiter. 

Layoffs edged down in May, keeping the layoffs rate at 1.2% for a second straight month. There was, however, an increase in layoffs in the arts, entertainment, and recreation industry.

LONDON (Reuters) - Sales at British retailers rose at their slowest average pace on record over the past year as worries about Brexit weighed on consumers, a survey showed on Tuesday.
Average sales growth weakened to 0.6% in the 12 months to June, the British Retail Consortium, an industry group, said, the slowest increase since it began its records in 1995.
Retailers also had their biggest annual fall for June on record - down 1.3% - as the Brexit concerns mounted and the spending boost from a heatwave and the men's soccer World Cup in June 2018 affected the comparison, the BRC said.
""Overall, the picture is bleak: rising real wages have failed to translate into higher spending as ongoing Brexit uncertainty led consumers to put off non-essential purchases,"" BRC Chief Executive Helen Dickinson said.
""The continued risk of a no-deal Brexit is harming consumer confidence and forcing retailers to spend hundreds of millions of pounds putting in place mitigations,"" she added.
Last week, surveys of British companies suggested the economy shrank between April and June and Bank of England Governor Mark Carney warned of growing risks from a no-deal Brexit and global trade tensions.
In 'like-for-like' terms, which smooth out changes in the amount of retail space, sales fell by 1.6% in June and the 12-month average declined by 0.1%, the weakest reading in more than seven years.
Low unemployment has put more money into people's pockets which has lifted consumer spending. This in turn has helped the economy at a time of falling investment by many companies since the Brexit vote.
But the BRC's survey echoed two other weak gauges of consumer spending in June by the CBI and accountants BDO.
Uncertainty about Brexit has been aggravated by the ongoing Conservative Party leadership election. Many investors worry about the economic risks of a no-deal Brexit, which neither candidates has ruled out.
Over the last two weeks several British retailers have highlighted a tough environment.
Supermarket group Sainsbury's (L:SBRY) reported a third straight quarter of declining underlying sales and rival Asda (N:WMT) described the business environment as ""a perfect storm"". Health retailer Boots (O:WBA) said Britain could be heading for a recession.
""Pressure on retailers continues to mount and is seemingly coming from all angles: economic, geo-political, environmental and behavioural,"" said Paul Martin, head of UK retail at KPMG, which produces the survey with BRC. ""Consumer spending is only likely to fall further as things stand, and cost efficiency remains vital."""

It said that 30% of makers of transport equipment other than cars, which include shipyards, train builders and motorcycles, were using the facility, known as ""Kurzarbeit"". In the textiles sector, about 25% of companies were doing so.
The Kurzarbeit scheme was used by many struggling companies in the 2008-2009 recession, allowing them to preserve jobs by cutting employees' hours when plant usage was low and having the government compensate workers for part of their lost wages.
An Ifo survey of some 2,000 companies earlier this month found that 8.5% of manufacturers expect to use short-hours working in the coming three months, the highest level since early 2013. Some 3.8% are already using the facility.
It is being applied by 18% of leather and shoe makers, 9% of metal producers, 7% of machine makers and an equal share of carmakers and car parts suppliers.
In its tenth year of growth, Europe's largest economy has been cooling as punitive tariffs imposed by China and the United States on their respective imports hurt German manufacturers exporting to the world's two largest economies.
Unemployment in Germany fell slightly in June compared to the previous month, data from the Federal Labour Office showed on Monday, but there was an increase in the amount of underemployment, clearly pointing to a weakening in the economy.
Seasonally adjusted unemployment fell by 1,000 to 2.281 million compared to the month before. A drop of 3,000 had been forecast. The unemployment rate remained at 5%.
The government expects the economy to grow by a modest 0.5% this year.
German exports rebounded more strongly than expected in May, but failed to fully recover from a slump a month earlier.
Analysts said the rise did not signal the end of the problems for manufacturers and the economy almost certainly slowed down or even possibly contracted in the second quarter."

Real wages fell 1.0% in May, labor ministry data showed on Tuesday, after a downwardly revised 1.4% annual decline in April.
Monthly wage data showed nominal total cash earnings in May slipped an annual 0.2% after a revised 0.3% fall in April.
Regular pay, which accounts for the bulk of monthly wages, fell an annual 0.6% in May, the fifth straight month of decline.
One-off special payments climbed 2.5% in May from a year earlier, recovering from a revised 5.3% annual decline in the previous month.
Overtime pay also grew 0.8% in May from a year earlier, after dropping a revised 1.9% in April.
Revelations this year that labor ministry officials used faulty polling methods which forced revisions cast doubt on wage data issued by the ministry from 2004 to 2017.
The ministry said in January it used faulty polling methods in compiling monthly wage data - which covers about 33,000 firms - and had failed to accurately depict the actual strength of wage growth.
The error has made it harder to gauge the trend for wages.
The ministry defines ""workers"" as 1) those who are employed for more than one month at a firm that employs more than five people, or 2) those who are employed on a daily basis or have less than a one-month contract but had worked more than 18 days during the two months before the survey was conducted at a firm that employs more than five people.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's core machinery orders fell by the most in eight months in a worrying sign that global trade tensions are taking a toll on corporate investment, casting doubt that solid domestic demand can help offset external pressure on the export-reliant economy. 
Any downturn in business spending will hurt prospects for stronger wage growth and dampen the central bank's hopes that a sustained economic recovery will prod firms to boost prices and wages, helping to reach its 2% inflation goal.
Cabinet Office data on Monday showed that core orders, a highly volatile data series regarded as an indicator of capital spending in the next six to nine months, fell 7.8% in May from the previous month.
The reading, the biggest drop since September and down for the first time in four months, compared with a 4.7% decline seen by economists in a Reuters poll and followed April's 5.2% rise.
Policymakers are counting on domestic demand to offset risks such as the Sino-U.S. trade war and slowing global demand that could threaten to derail the world's third-largest economy.
Capital expenditure has been a bright spot in the fragile economy, helping first-quarter gross domestic product to expand at an annualized rate of 2.2%.
However, external risks cloud the outlook for Japan, which would weigh on business confidence and could in turn put a drag on capital expenditure.
That could fan concerns about domestic demand just as Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's government is set to raise the national sales tax to 10% in October.
""Despite a slump in May, machinery orders point to broadly stable capital spending in the second quarter. Even so, we expect investment growth to slow sharply over the coming quarters,"" said Marcel Thieliant, senior Japan economist at Capital Economics.
""Resilience is unlikely to last. Firms have revised down their capital spending plans in light of weaker external demand. And consumer spending is set to slow after October's sales tax hike.""
Underscoring fragile consumer confidence, a Cabinet Office survey showed on Monday that household sentiment fell to a three-year low in June, despite some moves toward frontloading spending ahead of the tax hike.
The survey of people such as taxi drivers, hotel workers and restaurant staff - dubbed ""economy watchers"" for their proximity to consumer and retail trends - showed the overall mood on current conditions had slipped 0.1 point from May month to 44.0, below the 50 threshold pointing to a steady reading for 18 months.
SALES TAX HIKE 
The previous tax hike to 8% from 5% in April 2014 dealt a blow to consumers and triggered a deep economic slump. Since then, Abe has twice delayed a planned further hike.
The Cabinet Office maintained its assessment on machinery orders to say they are showing a pick-up.
By sector, core orders from manufacturers fell 7.4% in May from the previous month, swinging sharply lower from the prior month's 16.3% gain, while those from the service-sector dropped 9.0%, down for the first time in three month, the Cabinet Office data showed.
The data comes a week after the Bank of Japan's quarterly tankan survey showed solid Japanese business expenditure plans, with big firms planning to raise their capital expenditure plan by 7.4% in the fiscal year to March 2020.
The BOJ will scrutinize the tankan results and a batch of other indicators at its policy-setting meeting later this month when it issues fresh economic and price projections.

Japan's capital expenditure has been driven by demand for boosting labor-saving technology to cope with a labor crunch in the fast-ageing population, high-tech investment and upgrading old plant and equipment.

Exports grew by 1.1% on the month in May, data from the Federal Statistics Office showed on Monday, surpassing the 0.5% rise forecast in a Reuters poll. In April, shipments abroad fell by 3.4%. 
Imports fell 0.5% on the month in May. The upshot was a rise in the trade balance to 18.7 billion euros ($20.99 billion) from 16.9 billion in the prior month.
Other recent data have painted a gloomy picture of German industry, with engineering orders falling and activity in the manufacturing sector contracting.
Separate Statistics Office data showed industrial output increased by 0.3% on the month in May, undershooting the forecast for a 0.4% rise. A month earlier, output fell 2.0%.
Andrew Kenningham, economist at Capital Economics, said May's rise in industrial production did not signal the end of the problems for Germany's manufacturers.
""On the contrary, it now looks almost certain that industrial production declined in the second quarter overall, contributing to a sharp slowdown in German GDP (gross domestic product) growth, if not an outright contraction,"" Kenningham added.
Figures released on Friday showed German industrial orders fell by 2.2%, far more than expected, in May.
Now its 10th year of expansion, the German economy returned to growth between January and March, posting a 0.4% expansion, but the Bundesbank expects a small contraction in the second quarter.
""As other economic indicators have also disappointed, the prospect of a decline in economic performance is increasing,"" said Alexander Krueger at Bankhaus Lampe. ""Growth forecasts are likely to be further reduced.""
In a sign that an economic slowdown is beginning to bite, a survey by the Ifo institute published on Thursday showed German manufacturers expect to make more use of ""Kurzarbeit"" -- a short-hours facility aimed at avoiding mass lay-offs.
Trade conflicts, Britain's expected departure from the EU and a cooling global economic outlook are causing headaches for Germany, which for many years relied on exports for growth but has come to depend increasingly on private consumption.

The survey conducted by Deloitte, a financial advisory firm, found that 83% of the CFOs believed that leaving the EU would hurt Britain's long-term business environment.
Only 4% said it was a good time to take on more balance sheet risk, the lowest percentage since the collapse of Lehman Brothers in 2008 which helped trigger the financial crisis.
Britain's economy has slowed sharply after a strong start to 2019 when companies were rushing to prepare for the original Brexit date in March which has been delayed until Oct. 31.
Surveys published last week suggested the economy shrank in the second quarter and Bank of England Governor Mark Carney warned of the growing risks from a no-deal Brexit and from an escalation of trade tensions in the world economy.
Almost two thirds of the CFOs surveyed by Deloitte expected to cut hiring in the next three years as a result of Brexit and 47% expected to reduce capital spending.
British companies cut back on business investment throughout 2018, the longest such run since the global financial crisis, raising concerns about the longer-term impact of the Brexit crisis on the country's economy.
Separately on Monday, the Confederation of British Industry, an employers group, said it expected business investment would fall by 1.3% in 2019, the biggest decline since the financial crisis, even if Britain manages to avoid a no-deal Brexit.
""Brexit uncertainty is crippling business investment. ""We're at risk of falling further behind our G7 competitors,"" Rain Newton-Smith, the CBI's chief economist, said.
The CBI kept its forecast for British economic growth in 2019 at 1.4% but cut its forecast for 2020 slightly to 1.5% from a previous estimate of 1.6%.
The Deloitte survey was based on responses from 79 CFOs, including 48 from FTSE 350 companies and was conducted between June 12 and 28."
971,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 05, 2019 10:13AM ET</span>","UK economy shows slowdown signs as recruiters, shoppers turn wary","By Navdeep Yadav and Bella Barber
LONDON (Reuters) - British employers and shoppers are turning increasingly cautious, indicators showed on Friday, suggesting two of the drivers of the economy during the Brexit crisis are losing momentum.
In a week when business surveys pointed to a contraction in overall output in the second quarter, the latest signals from Britain's boardrooms and high streets underscored the extent of the slowdown following a strong start to 2019.
That was when many companies were rushing to prepare for the original Brexit deadline in March.
The latest figures showed that the subsequent slowdown in the economy was not just payback for the stockpiling surge.
The number of people hired for permanent jobs via recruitment firms in Britain fell for a fourth month in a row in June, recruitment industry group REC said on Friday.
The figures represented a stark contrast to the robust hiring activity in 2018.
""Brexit stagnation continues to seize up the jobs market as the slowdown in recruitment activity continues,"" said James Stewart, vice chair at KPMG which produces the report with REC.
For temporary staff, hiring rose marginally in June, marking the weakest patch of growth since May 2013, when Britain's economy began to emerge from the after-effects of the global financial crisis.
Britain's labor market has been one of the strengths of the economy since the 2016 Brexit referendum.
Unemployment fell to its lowest rate since 1975 at 3.8% in the first quarter of 2019, according to official data.
Many economists have linked the jobs boom to uncertainty about Brexit which has made employers favor hiring workers -- who can be laid off quickly -- over the longer-term commitment of investing in equipment.
But the jobs surge has put more money into people's pockets which had driven consumer spending, offsetting a fall in investment by many companies.
Data on Friday showed Britain's high street retailers had a ""washout"" June, however, as shoppers did not respond to early summer sales discounts.
""We saw retailers discount early on in June, adding further pressure to tight margins, yet they still weren’t able to salvage the month,"" said Sophie Michael, head of retail at BDO, an accountancy and business advisory firm.
The survey chimed with another weak reading of retail sales published last week.
The Bank of England has said Britain's economy probably had zero growth in the April-June period, contrasting with growth of 0.5% in the first three months of 2019.
BoE Governor Mark Carney warned on Tuesday that the prospect of a no-deal Brexit and the rise in protectionist trade policies around the world, led by U.S. President Donald Trump, posed growing risks to the British economy.
Surveys published this week of Britain's manufacturing, construction and services sectors suggested the economy contracted by 0.1% in the second quarter.
That would be the first fall in gross domestic product since the end of 2012.
A survey published by an employers group showed British businesses turned gloomier, bucking an improvement in sentiment earlier this year."
972,By Investing.com,"<span>Jul 05, 2019 09:45AM ET</span>","U.S. Job Creation Surges, Denting Rate Cut Hopes","Investing.com - The U.S. economy created many more jobs than expected in June, putting a dent in the case for an immediate interest rate cut from the Federal Reserve.
Official government data released on Friday also showed an unexpected, but modest, increase in the unemployment rate, while annual wage inflation held steady. Overall, that's a brighter picture than recent indicators from the manufacturing and housing sectors have painted, but market reaction suggested that there is still widespread belief that the Fed will cut rates when its policy-making committee meets later this month. 
Nonfarm payrolls (NFP) rose by 224,000 in June, well above consensus expectations for 160,000 and a sharp rebound from a downwardly-revised 72,000 in May.
The jobless rate unexpectedly rose to 3.7%. Consensus had expected it to remain unchanged at 3.6%, which was the lowest level since December 1969.
Wage inflation grew 3.1% on an annualized basis, holding steady at the prior month’s reading. Consensus had expected an increase to 3.2%.
Markets have convinced themselves that the Fed will soon begin easing policy for the first time in a decade: interest rate futures suggest a quarter-point cut at the July 30-31 meeting is certain, and that there will be three such cuts in total by the end of the year, driven by the need to offset the damage caused by the U.S.'s trade dispute with China. 
The data did little to change that conviction. Marc Chandler, managing director of Bannockburn Global Forex, said they merely ""keep in check"" talk of a half-point rate cut. 
U.S. futures extended losses slightly following the release with S&P 500 futures down 0.3% compared to a drop of 0.2% beforehand.
The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of major currencies, extended gains and was up 0.4% at 96.745, compared to 96.537 immediately ahead of the release.
The benchmark 10-year Treasury yield rose sharply to 2.04%, compared to 1.97% before the publication. "

One quirk of this jobs report: It comes on a summer Friday after the U.S. Independence Day holiday July 4, so market activity could dissipate quickly after the numbers come out if trading desks have less staffing than usual.

Core machinery orders likely fell 4.7% in May from the previous month, the poll of 16 economists showed. While volatile, the data series is regarded as an indicator of domestic capital spending in the next six to nine months.
They rose 5.2% in April, which was the biggest gain since last October.
Compared with a year earlier, core orders, which exclude those for ships and electric utilities, are expected to have fallen 3.9% in May, the poll showed, following a 2.5% gain in April.
""China's economic slowdown, an inventory adjustment in IT-related items and the U.S.-China trade friction likely led firms to postpone their capital spending,"" said Akiyoshi Takumori, chief economist at Sumitomo Mitsui Asset Management Company.
""On the other hand, demand for labor-saving investment on the back of solid domestic demand and a preferable jobs market underpin machinery orders.""
The Cabinet Office will publish the machinery orders data at 8:50 a.m. Monday, July 8 Tokyo time(2350 GMT Sunday).
Analysts polled by Reuters also expected Japan's current account to register a surplus of 1.38 trillion yen ($12.8 billion) in May, down from 1.71 trillion yen in April.
Gains in the income balance, which includes earnings from overseas subsidies, offered some support but the trade deficit likely swelled due to weak exports, which resulted in a lower surplus, analysts said.
The finance ministry will announce the current account balance at the same time as the Cabinet Office's machinery orders.
The Bank of Japan's corporate goods price index (CGPI), which measures the prices companies charge each other for goods and services, likely rose 0.3% in June from a year earlier, slowing from a 0.7% gain in May.
Price falls in oil and coal related products, as well as chemical products and non-ferrous metal appear to have weighed on the index, analysts said.
The central bank will release CGPI on July 10.

House prices were up by 5.7% in the three months to June compared with the same period a year ago after rising by 5.2% in the three months to May, Halifax said on Friday. A Reuters poll of economists had pointed to a 5.9% rise.
Halifax cautioned that the annual increase was flattered by weak price growth in the corresponding period in 2018. In monthly terms, prices fell by 0.3% after a rise of 0.4% in May.
But Russell Galley, Halifax's managing director, said the housing market was ""displaying a reasonable degree of resilience in the face of political and economic uncertainty"".
Other measures of house prices have shown smaller increases than Halifax recently -- with prices in London falling -- but have also suggested a bottoming out in the market after a slowdown linked to worries about Brexit.
Halifax's measure of annual house price growth had been growing by nearly 10% a year at the time of the 2016 referendum.
Britain secured an extension to the deadline for its departure from the European Union until Oct. 31 but many investors remain worried about the possibility of a no-deal Brexit, something the two contenders to become prime minister say they are prepared to do if necessary.
""If the UK ultimately leaves the EU without a deal - be it on Oct. 31 or some other time - we believe house prices could quickly drop around 5% amid heightened uncertainty and weakened economic activity,"" Howard Archer, an economist with EY Item Club, a forecasting group, said."

(Reuters) - As domestic economic concerns overtake last month's national election euphoria, India's stock market rally has lost steam and the index is lagging its Asian peers.
The broader NSE index (NSEI) climbed to a record high in early June on hopes for more economic reforms after incumbent Prime Minister Narendra Modi's landslide election victory. But share prices have since succumbed to concerns over sluggish domestic consumption, rising bad bank loans and rich valuations.
(Graphic: India price performance - https://tmsnrt.rs/2G23rCn)
Lacklustre earnings growth in the fourth quarter of the financial year ending in March and slowing consumer spending capped the local market's gains even as other regional markets rose in tandem with a drop in U.S. yields and a revival of Sino-U.S. trade talks.
The NSE index has fallen 1.2% from a peak it hit on June 3, compared with the MSCI Asia-ex-Japan index's (MIAPJ0000PUS) gain of over 6% in that period.
""We still own Indian stocks, even though less so. The market has celebrated probably more than enough,"" said Michael Kelly, the global head of a multi-asset strategy for PineBridge Investments, referring to Modi's election victory.
Troubles in India's shadow-banking sector have also raised market volatility and caused short-term funding stresses in the banking system. As a result, companies' interest costs have soared, affecting their margins.
A Reuters analysis of 440 non-financial Indian companies showed their combined net profits fell for the second successive quarter in March. Their revenues also posted their slowest growth in five quarters due to slowing demand.
(Graphic: Indian companies revenue and profit growth - https://tmsnrt.rs/2YCXnXS)
India posted its slowest growth in five years in March, and recent data showing a fall in car sales and slowing industrial output points to a further slowdown in the economy.
(Graphic: India car sales - https://tmsnrt.rs/2FPWowb)
Below-normal rainfall this year is adding to concerns about growth. The monsoon season - which accounts for 70% of India's annual rainfall and is the lifeblood of its $2.5 trillion economy - has delivered 28% lower-than-normal rainfall since the start of the season on June 1, according to data compiled by the India Meteorological Department.
(Graphic: India rainfall map - https://tmsnrt.rs/2FQptb3)
Higher oil prices also pose a threat to the economy in the form of higher import costs, thereby widening the current account deficit. Analysts said rising oil prices would slow down consumer spending further.
(Graphic: India's twin deficits - https://tmsnrt.rs/2FLLGHd)
""The key risks for the market is a sharp rise in the oil prices,"" said Rajat Agarwal, a strategist at  Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN). He added higher oil prices had so far had a limited impact on the Indian rupee this year due to strong foreign portfolio inflows ahead of the elections.
Recent exchange data showed foreigners invested just $340 million in Indian equity markets in June, the lowest in five months.

The dispute is the latest flashpoint in a relationship long over-shadowed by South Korean resentment of Japan's 1910-1945 occupation of the Korean peninsula, in particular South Korean “comfort women”, a Japanese euphemism for women forced to work in Japanese military brothels before and during World War Two.
The latest bitterness over forced labor could disrupt global supplies of memory chips and smartphones. Samsung Electronics Co (KS:005930) and  SK Hynix Inc  (KS:000660) - the world's top memory chipmakers, and suppliers to Apple (O:AAPL) and China's Huawei Technologies - could face delays.
""A boycott is the most immediate way for citizens to express their anger,"" said Choi Gae-yeon of the activist group Movement for One Korea, that staged protests in front of a Japanese car dealership and a retailer in Seoul this week.
""Many people are angry at the attitude of the Japanese government.""
The row over forced labor exploded last year when a South Korean court ordered Japan's Nippon Steel & Sumitomo Metal Corp (T:5401) and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd to pay hundreds of thousands of dollars to South Korean plaintiffs.
Japan maintains that the issue of forced labor was fully settled in 1965 when the two countries restored diplomatic ties, and has denounced the ruling as ""unthinkable"".
Japan said on Monday it would tighten restrictions on the export of high-tech materials used in smartphone displays and chips to South Korea in connection with the dispute.
The restrictions came into effect on Thursday, fuelling calls for retaliation in South Korea.
Nearly 25,000 people had by Friday signed a petition posted on the South Korean presidential office website calling for a boycott of Japanese products and for tourists not to visit.
The government must respond to a petition that gets 200,000 signatures in a month.
Some Korean social media users posted ""Boycott Japan"" messages and shared a link to a list of Japanese brands that could be boycotted, including Toyota Motor (T:7203) and Fast Retailing's (T:9983) Uniqlo.
Toyota's South Korean unit and Fast Retailing's South Korean unit did not have an immediate comment.
""Japan boycott movement"" was among the most searched-for terms on South Korea's main online search engine Naver.
On Thursday, a South Korean actor deleted photographs he posted on social media of a visit he made to Japan after online criticism.
Shares linked to tourism fell on the South Korean market this week due to concern about prospects for travel to Japan.
Shares in South Korea's biggest tour agency,  Hana Tour  (KS:039130), fell 3.4 percent on Thursday before paring losses on Friday.
South Korea imported $54.6 billion worth of goods from Japan in 2018, while also paying for $11.5 billion worth of its services.
South Korea exported $30.5 billion in goods and $8.7 billion in services to Japan in the same year, according to South Korean customs and central bank data."

TOKYO (Reuters) - Household spending in Japan rose at the fastest pace in four years in May, in a sign improving domestic demand will offer some support for an economy facing growing external pressure.
A recovery in private consumption is seen as vital in Japan's fight against deflation, which has made companies reluctant to pass on rising costs to households.
Household spending grew 4.0% in May from a year earlier thanks to Japan's 10-day holiday, government data showed on Friday.
It rose at the fastest pace since May 2015 and was much stronger than the median forecast for a 1.6% increase.
From the previous month, it rose 5.5% for the month, which compared with a 1.4% contraction in April and the median estimate for a 1.2% gain.
The government raised its view on the household spending for the first time in four months, saying it is ""picking up"", an official said.
""Consumer spending in April-June is expected to have recovered from the previous month, which is likely to make up for some weakness in external demand,"" said Yoshiki Shinke, chief economist at Dai-ichi Life Research Institute.
""But there is a risk that consumer spending will worsen as sentiment weakens amid sluggish wage recovery and uncertainty over the economic outlook. Also a planned sales tax hike could dent spending after it is implemented.""
The strong growth in household spending in May was led by accommodation bills, mobile phone charges, transportation fees and electricity. 
The U.S.-China trade dispute has clouded the outlook for the export-reliant economy, and the concern is that a hit to business and consumer confidence could affect overall domestic consumption and choke growth.
Top representatives of the United States and China are looking to resume talks next week to try to resolve a year-long trade war between the world's two largest economies.
Some policymakers in Japan also worry a proposed tax hike could add to the pressure on growth as a previous tax increase in April 2014 dealt a blow to consumers and triggered a deep economic slump.
Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has repeatedly said he will raise the sales tax to 10% this October as scheduled, unless there is a big economic shock on the scale of the collapse of Lehman Brothers.
The Bank of Japan is counting on an improvement in consumer spending to achieve its elusive 2% inflation target, having failed to fire up consumer prices despite years of heavy money printing.
The central bank last month kept monetary policy steady but Governor Haruhiko Kuroda signaled a readiness to ramp up stimulus if global pressure on the economy intensifies.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India said on Thursday it needs $330 billion in investments over the next decade to power its renewable energy dream, but coal would remain central to its electricity generation.
The energy guzzling country wants to raise its renewable energy capacity to 500 Gigawatts (GW), or 40% of total capacity, by 2030. Renewables currently account for 22% of India's total installed capacity of about 357 GW.
""Additional investments in renewable plants up to year 2022 would be about $80 billion at today's prices and an investment of around $250 billion would be required for the period 2023-2030,"" according to the government's economic survey presented to parliament on Thursday.
India wants to have 175 GW of renewable-based installed power capacity by 2022.
The investment estimate reflects the magnitude of financial challenges facing one of the world's most important growth markets for renewable energy, with government data indicating a growth slowdown in private and capital investments in the year ended March 2019.
India, which receives twice as much sunshine as European countries, wants to make solar a cornerstone of its renewable expansion, but also wants to make use of its cheap and abundant coal reserves, the fifth-largest in the world.
The annual economic survey warned India against abruptly halting coal-based utilities, citing risks to its banking sector and the stability of the electricity grid.
""It may not be advisable to effect a sudden abandonment of coal based power plants without complete utilization of their useful lifetimes as it would lead to stranding of assets that can have further adverse impact on the banking sector,"" the survey said.
Thermal power plants account for 80% of all industrial emissions of particulate matter, sulfur and nitrous oxides in India. https://reut.rs/2Jb9whK
India, one of the world's largest coal producers and greenhouse gas emitters, estimates coal to be its energy mainstay for at least the next three decades. https://reut.rs/2LCxOTa
The country's coal use rose 9.1% to nearly a billion tonnes in 2018-19.
The survey said it would be difficult for a growing economy like India to migrate to renewable power supply unless ""sufficient technological breakthrough in energy storage happens in the near future"".
Environmentalists worry that India's rising use of coal at a time when many Western nations are rejecting the dirty fossil fuel will hamper the global fight against climate change, despite the country's commitment to renewable energy."

LONDON (Reuters) - Vietnam is determined to tackle U.S. concerns about steel exports at the center of a new tariff row, its finance minister said on Thursday.
The U.S. Commerce Department on Tuesday said it would slap tariffs of up to 456% on certain steel produced in South Korea or Taiwan which is then shipped to Vietnam for minor processing before being exported to the United States.
""We will be determined in managing the situation, handling the violations and handling the breaches,"" Dinh Tien Dung told Reuters in an interview through an interpreter.
""We want to demonstrate to President Donald Trump that we are taking a serious attitude to this.""
He added that, while there would be some economic impact from tariffs, the impact in the immediate future will not be that high because steel exports are not the biggest share of exports to the U.S.
He declined to say whether Vietnam would consider retaliatory tariffs, adding ""we first need to review (the situation).""
The Southeast Asian country has been deemed one of the biggest beneficiaries of a trade war between Washington and Beijing as some businesses are shifting their supply chains away from China to avoid U.S. tariffs.
After signing a free trade deal with the European Union last week, Dung said, Vietnam is now targeting a similar agreement with Britain after Brexit.
“We want to negotiate soon... the sooner the better,"" he said.
Economic growth would be between 6.5-6.7% this year, with a similar level expected next year, Dung said.
Spurred by robust exports and foreign investment, Vietnam's gross domestic product grew 6.71% in the second quarter of this year, slowing down from a revised expansion of 6.82% in the first quarter, official data showed last week.
Dung said the government had no plans for further dollar-denominated bond issuance.

The U.S. Commerce Department said on Tuesday it would slap tariffs of up to 456% on certain steel produced in South Korea or Taiwan which are then shipped to Vietnam for minor processing and finally exported to the United States.
""The Ministry of Industry and Trade has warned local companies about possible moves by importing countries, including the United States, to apply stricter requirements in trade protection cases,"" Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Le Thi Thu Hang said at a routine news conference in Hanoi.
Vietnamese companies should consider business strategies that include switching to domestic materials, she said.
Hang said Vietnam will continue to work with the United States in its efforts to crack down on goods of foreign origin illegally relabeled ""Made in Vietnam"" by exporters seeking to dodge tariffs.
Vietnam has been touted as one of the largest beneficiaries of the ongoing trade war between the United States and China, but recent comments from U.S. President Donald Trump have led some to believe that Vietnam may be the next target of U.S. tariffs.
Last month, Trump said Hanoi treated the United States ""even worse"" than China, amid the ongoing trade spat between Washington and Beijing.
Vietnam responded by saying it was committed to free and fair trade with the United States.
Vietnam's largest export market is the United States, with which it has a rapidly growing trade surplus, which widened to $17 billion in the first five months of this year from $12.9 billion in the same period last year."
988,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 04, 2019 04:11AM ET</span>","World food prices ease in June, dairy prices plunge: U.N. FAO","ROME (Reuters) - World food prices eased slightly in June, ending a run of five months of consecutive gains, pushed down by a plunge in the price of dairy products, the United Nations food agency said on Thursday.
The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) also kept its forecast for worldwide cereal production in 2019 unchanged from June but up some 1.2 percent on 2018 levels, with most of the growth expected to come from higher wheat production.
FAO's food price index, which measures monthly changes for a basket of cereals, oilseeds, dairy products, meat and sugar, averaged 173.0 points last month from an upwardly revised 173.5 points in May. That figure was previously given as 172.4.
The FAO dairy price index plummeted 11.9% from May's value, but was still up 9.4% since the start of the year, with June's price weakness triggered by increased export opportunities and weak import demand.
The FAO vegetable price index also fell, dropping 1.6% month-on-month and touching its lowest level since December, hit primarily by weakening palm oil and soy oil prices.
By contrast, the cereal price index rose 6.7% from May and was 3.8% up on the year, driven by a sharp increase in maize export price quotations, mainly due to expectations of much tighter export supplies in the world's largest producer, the United States.
The meat price index rose 1.5% on the month and the sugar index 4.2%.
In its third forecast for 2019, FAO predicted world cereal production would come in at 2.685 billion tonnes, unchanged from the June report and still up 1.2% on 2018 levels.
The forecast for world cereal utilization in 2019/20 rose marginally and now looks set to exceed 2.708 billion tonnes -- up 1.0% on 2018/19 levels, FAO said."

Property leaped 14% in Madrid and 13% in the Balearic Islands, which include Majorca, Fotocasa said Wednesday in an emailed statement. On a national level, appreciation was 5.8% versus a year earlier, or 6% as calculated by rival website Idealista.
Spain’s $5.9 trillion home market has attracted private equity investors and developers who study it for signs of cooling off and for how local governments are rolling out rent-restriction measures that may crimp returns. The trends also affect millions of Spanish homeowners and renters, as well as expats primarily from Western Europe who bought second homes or plan to settle in one of the world’s preeminent retirement destinations.
Private property websites use asking prices, which may not be as reliable as government calculations. Idealista’s 6% appreciation matched its annual rate measured through March, while Fotocasa showed a slowdown from 8.4% growth in the earlier period.
For global money managers, comparing property with traditional asset classes like fixed income is more stark this year, with $13 trillion of debt worldwide now yielding less than zero. For Spain-focused investors, the main comparisons are to the benchmark IBEX 35 stock index, which dropped 4.4% in the 12 months through June, and the Bloomberg  Barclays  (LON:BARC) Spanish government bond index, which returned an exceptional 8.8%.
There are far hotter national markets across the European Union than Spain’s. Latvia and the Czech Republic top the group, with 11.8% and 9.9% annual growth, respectively; that’s more than double the 4.2% EU average, according to fourth-quarter data from Eurostat.

990,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 03, 2019 02:10PM ET</span>",U.S. trade deficit at five-month high; labor market slowing,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. trade deficit jumped in May and trade tensions between the United States and China helped drive activity in the services sector to a two-year low in June, further signs that economic growth slowed sharply in the second quarter.
The economy's dimming outlook was also underscored by other data on Wednesday showing private employers adding far fewer-than-expected jobs to their payrolls last month. 
New orders for manufactured goods dropped in May for a second straight month.
The reports followed recent weak housing and business investment data, as well as moderate consumer spending. Business and consumer confidence have dipped.
The slowdown in activity as last year's massive stimulus from tax cuts and more government spending fades could prompt the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates this month. 
The U.S. central bank last month signaled it could ease monetary policy as early as its July 30-31 meeting, citing rising risks to the economy from the trade war between Washington and Beijing, and low inflation. The International Monetary Fund has lowered global growth estimates because of reduced trade flows as a result of the trade fights.
""One wonders how long Washington will continue to claim they are helping the U.S. economy,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG in New York. ""One of the factors behind the economy's fall in the Great Depression was protectionism and trade wars, and it will be a miracle if the world economy can avoid another downturn this time.""
The trade deficit rose 8.4% to $55.5 billion as a surge in imports overshadowed a broad increase in exports, the Commerce Department said. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the trade gap widening to $54.0 billion in May.
The goods trade deficit with China, a focus of President Donald Trump's ""America First"" agenda, increased 12.2% to $30.2 billion. Trump imposed additional import tariffs on Chinese goods, after a breakdown in negotiations, prompting Beijing to retaliate. Economists say the expectation of additional duties likely boosted imports from China, which jumped 12.8% in May. 
Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping last week agreed to a trade truce and a return to talks. White House trade adviser Peter Navarro said on Tuesday talks were heading in the right direction, but it would take time to get the right deal made.
The U.S.-China trade tensions have caused wild swings in the trade deficit, with exporters and importers trying to stay ahead of the tariff fight between the two economic giants. Trump on Wednesday accused China and Europe of ""playing big currency manipulation game and pumping money into their system in order to compete with USA."" 
""We still think it is slightly more likely than not that the trade dispute with China will ultimately escalate further,"" said Andrew Hunter, a senior U.S. economist at Capital Economics in London. ""Trade is likely to remain a modest drag on growth over the second half of this year, which we expect to compound a sharp slowdown in domestic demand growth.""
The dollar was little changed against a basket of currencies in thin U.S. trade ahead of Thursday's Independence Day holiday. Stocks on Wall Street rose, with the S&P 500 (SPX) index hitting a record high on expectations of a rate cut. U.S. Treasury prices also were higher.
IMPORTS SURGE 
In May, goods imports increased 4.0% to $217.0 billion. Apart from drawing more imports from China, the United States imported record amounts from the European Union, Mexico and Canada in May. The increase in imports was broad-based, with those of motor vehicle and parts soaring to an all-time high. 
Petroleum imports rose and crude oil was more expensive, helping to inflate the import bill in May. 
Goods exports increased 2.8% to $140.8 billion. Exports advanced across all sectors, including passenger aircraft despite Boeing (N:BA) in March suspending deliveries of its fastest-selling MAX 737 jetliner. The aircraft was grounded indefinitely following two deadly crashes in five months. 
When adjusted for inflation, the goods trade deficit increased $4.8 billion to $87.0 billion in May, suggesting trade could be a drag on second-quarter gross domestic product. 
Trade contributed 0.94 percentage point to the economy's 3.1% annualized growth pace in the first quarter. The Atlanta Fed is forecasting gross domestic product rising at a 1.3% rate in the April-June quarter.
Anxiety over trade is spilling over from manufacturing to the services industries. In a third report on Wednesday, the Institute for Supply Management said its non-manufacturing activity index fell to 55.1 in June, the lowest reading since July 2017, from 56.9 in May. 
A reading above 50 indicates expansion in the sector, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity. The ISM said ""a degree of uncertainty exists due to trade and tariffs."" 
The decrease in services industry activity reflected a decline in the new orders measure, which dropped to the lowest level since December 2017. A gauge of services employment also fell.
""The slowing trend evident across categories raises concern that a slowing trend most evident in manufacturing is also becoming more apparent in the broader economy,"" said Andrew Hollenhorst, an economist at  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) in New York. ""This should leave the Fed right on the precipice of providing some 'insurance' by cutting rates at the July meeting.""
The slowdown in employment was mirrored by the ADP (NASDAQ:ADP) National Employment Report showing private payrolls increased by 102,000 jobs in June from 41,000 in May, but below market expectations for a gain of 140,000. That suggests a moderate rebound in the private payrolls component of the government's closely followed employment report. 
The June employment report will be released on Friday. Economists polled by Reuters are looking for nonfarm employment to have increased by 160,000 jobs after rising by only 75,000 in May. The unemployment rate is expected to have held near a 50-year low of 3.6% in June. 

Still, layoffs remain low. A fifth report from the Labor Department showed initial claims for state unemployment benefits dropped 8,000 to a seasonally adjusted 221,000 for the week ended June 29.

Factory goods orders decreased 0.7%, weighed down by weak demand for transportation equipment, the Commerce Department said on Wednesday. Data for April was revised sharply down to show factory orders falling 1.2% instead of slipping 0.8% as previously reported.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast factory orders falling 0.5% in May. Factory orders rose 0.9% compared to May 2018. Manufacturing, which accounts for about 12% of the economy, is struggling amid an inventory bloat, trade tensions between the United States and China, and a reduction in the production of Boeing's (N:BA) 737 MAX aircraft.
The weak factory orders data was flagged by a report last month showing the second straight monthly drop in demand for long-lasting manufactured goods in April, as well as a drop in manufacturing production.
A survey on Monday showed a measure of national factory activity dropped to a near three-year low in June, with manufacturers expressing concern over the U.S.-China trade tensions.
Transportation equipment orders dropped 4.6% in May after tumbling 7.6% in April. Orders for civilian aircraft and parts declined 28.2%. There were increases in order for computers and electronic products and machinery.
The Commerce Department also said May orders for non-defense capital goods excluding aircraft, which are seen as a measure of business spending plans on equipment, rose 0.5% instead of the 0.4% gain reported last month.
Shipments of core capital goods, which are used to calculate business equipment spending in the gross domestic product report, increased 0.6% in May instead of 0.7% as previously reported.
Overall shipments of manufactured goods edged up 0.1% in May after dropping 0.6% in April."

The non-manufacturing index fell to 55.1 from 56.9, according to an Institute for Supply Management survey Wednesday. Three of the gauge's four components slipped, with employment dropping by the most in 16 months and new orders declining to the lowest level since December 2017.

In May, goods imports increased 4.0% to $217.0 billion. Imports of consumer goods rose $1.4 billion, while those of motor vehicle and parts soared $2.3 billion to a record high. There were also big increases in imports of capital goods and industrial supplies and materials.
Goods exports rose 2.8% to $140.8 billion. Exports of consumer goods increased $0.8 billion and soybean exports advanced $0.7 billion. Civilian aircraft exports rose $0.5 billion.

Initial claims for state unemployment benefits dropped 8,000 to a seasonally adjusted 221,000 for the week ended June 29, the Labor Department said on Wednesday. Data for the prior week was revised to show 2,000 more applications received than previously reported.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast claims dropping to 223,000 in the latest week. The Labor Department said only claims for Virginia were estimated.
Claims data could become volatile in the coming weeks as auto manufacturers temporarily shut down assembly plants for summer retooling. Companies implement the plant closures at different times, which can throw off the model the government uses to remove seasonal fluctuations from the data.
Claims continue to be watched for signs of an increase in layoffs stemming from trade tensions between the United States and China. Rising risks to economic growth from the trade war, and low inflation, prompted the Federal Reserve to signal last month interest rate cuts as early as at its July 30-31 meeting.
The four-week moving average of initial claims, considered a better measure of labor market trends as it irons out week-to-week volatility, rose 500 to 222,250 last week.
The claims data has no bearing on June's employment report, which is scheduled for release on Friday. Nonfarm payrolls probably increased by 160,000 jobs last month after rising by only 75,000 in May, according to a Reuters survey of economists. The unemployment rate is forecast unchanged near a 50-year low of 3.6% in June for a third straight month.
The economy is slowing as last year's massive stimulus from tax cuts and more government spending fades.
Manufacturing is struggling, the trade deficit is widening again, consumer confidence is ebbing and the housing sector remains mired in a soft patch.
The Atlanta Fed is forecasting gross domestic product to rise at a 1.5% annualized rate in the April-June quarter. The economy grew at a 3.1% pace in the first quarter following a temporary boost from exports and an accumulation of inventory.

Thursday's claims report also showed the number of people receiving benefits after an initial week of aid fell 8,000 to 1.69 million for the week ended June 22. The four-week moving average of the so-called continuing claims slipped 1,750 to 1.69 million.

LONDON (Reuters) - Euro zone business activity picked up slightly last month but remained weak as a modest but broad-based upturn in the services industry offset a continued deep downturn in factory output, a survey showed.
Worryingly for policymakers at the European Central Bank, who are under pressure to support growth, forward-looking indicators did not point to a bounce back and business expectations for the year ahead dropped.
By the end of September, the ECB will either cut its deposit rate or ease its forward guidance further by pledging to keep interest rates lower for longer, according to a majority of economists in a Reuters poll. [ECILT/EU]
The European Union's nomination of IMF chief Christine Lagarde to replace Mario Draghi at the helm of the ECB has reinforced expectations for easier monetary policy going forward.
Wednesday's release of IHS Markit's Euro Zone Composite Final Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI), considered a good measure of overall economic health, will also do nothing to change those views. It only nudged up to 52.2 in June from May's 51.8.
That was a touch higher than a preliminary reading of 52.1 but it remained close to the 50 mark separating growth from contraction.
The upturn was nevertheless evident throughout much of the euro zone, and earlier figures from three of the bloc's biggest economies -- Germany, France, and Spain -- showed services activity accelerated.
""The continued stagnation in Italy is a worry, while the small rebound in the Spanish services sector is encouraging,"" noted Nicola Nobile at Oxford Economics.
""Nonetheless, we continue to see the ECB headed for another dose of monetary policy easing in September as it attempts to reinvigorate the region's economy."" 
IHS Markit said the survey was indicative of GDP rising just over 0.2% in the second quarter, weaker than the 0.3% predicted in last month's Reuters poll. 
It was a different story in Britain, where the PMI suggested the economy contracted 0.1% last quarter as firms worried about Brexit and the slowing global economy. [GB/PMIS]
The robust German, French and Spanish readings helped a PMI covering the wider euro zone services industry bounce to 53.6 from May's 52.9, a counterweight to a fifth month of contraction in manufacturing. [EUR/PMIM]
""There is for now fairly little evidence of the protracted manufacturing weakness causing significant adverse spill-overs into the euro zone's domestic economy,"" wrote Nobile. 
Monday's factory PMI indicated there will be a slow start to the second half for manufacturers as new orders fell for a ninth month, stocks of raw materials were depleted again, backlogs of work were run down and headcount was reduced for a second month. 
While most of the forward-looking services indexes were positive they remained weak, and new export business -- which includes trade between member countries -- fell for a tenth month. The sub-index registered 49.4 compared to May's 48.2.
Citing trade war worries, rising geopolitical uncertainty and slowing global economic growth, firms were less optimistic. The composite future output index fell to 59.2 from 59.8, one of its lowest readings in over four years.

Despite store closures from bigger retailers, store openings have led to strong occupancy growth this quarter, Reis said.
Grocery stores have been a leading new occupant of those vacant spaces over the past year or so, along with discount clothing stores and even trampoline parks, the report said.
""The retail sector has been able to adapt to industry restructuring in a number of ways. Some stores have had success in adopting new business strategies in an effort to revitalize their brands,"" Chief Economist Victor Calanog said.
Metro level statistics show fewer metros, 21 of 77, with an increase in vacancy for the quarter, down from 28 metros in the first quarter.
The regional mall vacancy rate was flat in the quarter at 9.3%, compared with the first quarter, which was hit by a number of chains announcing store closures, such as JC Penney, Payless, and others.
Reis said that with minimal construction in the pipeline, vacancy rates were stable during the quarter, but it expects the performance of malls and neighborhood and community centers to be hurt by the continuing store closures throughout the second half of the year.
For neighborhood and community shopping centers, net absorption, measured in terms of available space sold in the market, rose to 2.4 million square feet compared with a negative of about 3.9 million square feet.
Only 1.5 million square feet of new construction was completed in the quarter, a 29.8 percent drop from a year earlier, according to the report.
Both the national average asking rent and effective rent, excluding landlord concessions, increased 1.7 percent from the year-ago quarter, Reis said."

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's Brexit crisis tipped the country's construction industry into its sharpest fall in a decade in June, a survey showed on Tuesday, in a stark sign of how quickly the world's fifth-biggest economy is slowing.
The IHS Markit/CIPS construction Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) plunged to 43.1, the lowest reading since April 2009 when the country was gripped by the global financial crisis and way below any forecast in a Reuters poll of economists.
The yield on 10-year British government bonds sank to its lowest level in nearly three years as investors, already anxious about the prospect of a no-deal Brexit under the country's next prime minister, took fright at the scale of the fall.
Construction accounts for only 6% of Britain's economy and economists say the PMI surveys can overstate the degree of turning points in gross domestic product.
But there have been other signs that overall activity has stalled, and possibly even contracted, in the second quarter.
On Monday, a PMI for Britain's manufacturing sector -- which represents 10% of the economy -- also showed a fall in activity in June as the global economic slowdown hit demand for exports, adding to the drag from Brexit worries.
Bank of England data meanwhile revealed the slowest growth in five years in borrowing by consumers, whose spending has helped cushion the economy from Brexit.
Samuel Tombs, an economist with consultancy Pantheon Macroeconomics, said the construction survey was ""a worrying sign that the damage wrought by Brexit uncertainty is building"".
The hit was felt across the breadth of the sector: homebuilding shrank for the first time in 17 months, commercial work fell for the sixth consecutive month and civil engineering contracted by the most since October 2009.
Shares in UK housebuilders  Persimmon  (L:PSN),  Taylor Wimpey  (L:TW) and  Barratt Developments  (L:BDEV) all fell while the broader UK stock market was up.
Tim Moore, associate director at IHS Markit, said it was ""almost impossible to sugarcoat"" the survey.
""In particular, new orders dropped to the largest extent for just over 10 years, while demand for construction products and materials fell at the sharpest pace since the start of 2010,"" he said.
There was one potential silver lining: job cuts were marginal and some firms said they had retained staff in anticipation of a recovery in sales.
Tombs at Pantheon Macroeconomics said the sector could experience a quick recovery around the turn of the year, if the Brexit deadline of Oct. 31 is delayed again.
In campaigning for the leadership of the ruling Conservative Party, both candidates to replace Theresa May as prime minister have said they are prepared to take the country out of the European Union without a transition deal if necessary.
The second-quarter slowdown in the economy contrasts with a strong start to 2019, when companies rushed to get ready for the original March 29 Brexit deadline.
A PMI for Britain's dominant services sector, which is due to be published on Wednesday, is expected to show only marginal growth in June, according to economists polled by Reuters."

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. manufacturing activity slowed to near a three-year low in June, with a measure of new orders received by factories tumbling, amid growing anxiety over an escalation in trade tensions between the United States and China.
Other data on Monday showed construction spending unexpectedly fell in May as investment in private construction projects dropped to its lowest level in nearly 2-1/2 years. The reports were the latest indications that economic growth slowed in the second quarter after getting a temporary boost from exports and an accumulation of inventory.
While the slowdown in factory activity was not as steep as had been flagged by some regional factory surveys, a sharp drop in a gauge of prices paid by manufacturers could be yet another reason for the Federal Reserve to consider cutting interest rates this month. 
The U.S. central bank last month signaled it could ease monetary policy as early as this month, citing low inflation as well as growing risks to the economy from U.S.-China trade tensions.
""Manufacturing is clearly taking it on the chin from the rising trade uncertainty,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG in New York. 
The Institute for Supply Management (ISM) said its index of national factory activity dropped to 51.7 last month, the lowest reading since October 2016, from 52.1 in May. It was the third straight monthly decline in the index. 
A reading above 50 indicates expansion in the manufacturing sector, which accounts for about 12 percent of the U.S. economy. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the ISM index would fall to 51.0 in June.
The ISM said businesses ""expressed concern about U.S.-China trade turbulence."" They were also spooked by potential tariffs on Mexican imports, which were averted at the eleventh hour.
The United States' bitter trade war with China has hurt business sentiment. That, together with disruptions to supply chains caused by import tariffs, is weighing on manufacturing. 
U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping on Saturday agreed to a trade truce and a return to talks.
But Trump said he was ""in no hurry"" to cut a deal and Chinese state media warned there was no guarantee an agreement would be reached. Trump in May raised import tariffs on $200 billion in Chinese goods, prompting Beijing to retaliate.
SLOWING ECONOMY
Manufacturing is also taking a hit from an inventory overhang, which has resulted in businesses placing fewer orders with manufacturers. A reduction in the production of Boeing's (N:BA) MAX 737 aircraft, which was grounded in March after two fatal plane crashes in five months, is also a drag on activity.
The weakness in factory activity is in sync with a slowdown in economic growth following a temporary boost from exports and an accumulation of inventory. Consumer spending is rising moderately, while the pace of job and wage growth has slowed. In addition, the housing market is struggling and the goods trade deficit widened in May.
The ISM's forward-looking new orders sub-index decreased 2.7 points to a reading of 50.0 last month, the lowest reading since December 2015. A measure of prices paid by manufacturers tumbled 5.3 points to 47.9. 
But there were some glimmers of hope for manufacturing. Factories reported hiring more workers, which included replacing retiring workers and adding summer help. The survey's factory employment gauge rose to 54.5 from 53.7 in May. 
That pointed to a moderate pickup in manufacturing payrolls in June after they were almost flat in May. It also suggested an improvement in overall job growth last month after nonfarm payrolls increased by only 75,000 in May. The government is scheduled to publish June's employment report on Friday.
Suppliers' deliveries are improving. While a measure of inventories contracted for the first time since December 2017, with many manufacturers saying they continued to align stocks with softening demand, more customers viewed inventories as too low, which could lead to some increase in orders.
Stocks on Wall Street were trading higher, with the S&P 500 index (SPX) hitting an all-time high, as technology stocks gained on a likely reprieve for Chinese telecoms company Huawei. The dollar (DXY) rose against a basket of currencies, but U.S. Treasury prices fell. 
Despite the persistent weakness, U.S. manufacturing is in relatively better shape compared to the rest of the world. Reports on Monday showed factory activity shrinking across much of Europe and Asia.
The ISM said 12 industries, including machinery, computer and electronic products, textile mills, furniture and electrical equipment, appliances and components reported growth last month. Apparel and transportation equipment were among the five industries reporting a contraction.
Computer and electronic products manufacturers complained that ""China tariffs and pending Mexico tariffs are wreaking havoc with supply chains and costs"" and described the situation as ""crazy."" Transportation equipment manufacturers said ""demand for the remainder of 2019 has softened significantly, due to issues in the aerospace industry.""
""While manufacturers' worst fears about an all-out trade war with China developing imminently have been allayed, uncertainty about the structure of future trading relations continues to linger,"" said Sarah House, a senior economist at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) Securities in Charlotte, North Carolina.
""We suspect factory activity will continue to struggle in the second half of the year."" 

A separate report from the Commerce Department on Monday showed construction spending declined 0.8% in May, the biggest drop since last November, after rising 0.4% in April. Construction spending surged in the first quarter, boosted by increased investment in roads and highways by state and local governments.

The Institute for Supply Management (ISM) said its index of national factory activity fell to 51.7 from 52.1 the month before. The reading was just above expectations of 51 from a Reuters poll of 77 economists.
A reading above 50 indicates expansion in the manufacturing sector and a reading below 50 indicates contraction.
The employment index rose to 54.5 from 53.7 a month earlier. Expectations called for a reading of 52.8.
The prices paid index fell to 47.9 from 53.2, compared to expectations of 53.0. It was the lowest reading since February 2016 and marked the third time in six months that the prices-paid measure has dropped into contraction.

The Commerce Department said on Monday construction spending declined 0.8%, the biggest drop since last November. Data for April was revised to show construction outlays rising 0.4% instead of being unchanged as previously reported.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast construction spending would rise 0.1% in May. Construction spending fell 2.3% on a year-on-year basis in May.
Weak construction spending was the latest indication that economic growth slowed in the second quarter after getting a temporary boost from exports and an accumulation of inventory.
Consumer spending is rising moderately, while the pace of job and wage growth has slowed. In addition, manufacturing and the housing market are struggling and the goods trade deficit widened in May.
Construction spending surged in the first quarter, boosted by increased investment in roads and highways by state and local governments.
Spending on private construction projects dropped 0.7% in May to the lowest level since January 2017. That followed a 1.0% decline in the prior month. Private construction outlays also fell in March.
Investment in private residential projects fell 0.6% in May to its weakest level since December 2016, after a 0.6% decrease in April. Private residential construction outlays have now declined for five straight months.
Homebuilding has remained weak even as mortgage rates have dropped sharply from last year's high levels. Spending on residential construction has contracted for five straight quarters.
Spending on private nonresidential structures, which includes manufacturing and power plants, decreased 0.9% in May after plunging 1.4% in the prior month.
In May, investment in public construction projects fell 0.9% after surging 4.5% in April. Spending on state and local government construction projects slipped 0.6% after jumping 4.3% in April. Outlays on federal government construction projects tumbled 5.2% in May after rising 7.3% in the prior month."
1005,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 01, 2019 08:56AM ET</span>",UK economy feels the strain of global slowdown as well as Brexit,"By William Schomberg and David Milliken
LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's economy has lost momentum and might have shrunk in the second quarter of 2019, according to data that showed the double impact of Brexit and the slowdown in the global economy.
Manufacturers had their worst month in more than six years and consumers increased their borrowing at the slowest pace since 2014.
The value of sterling fell against the dollar and the euro after the data was published.
Howard Archer, an economist with EY Item Club, a forecasting group, estimated that Britain's economy contracted by 0.2% in the April-June period.
The Bank of England last month cut its forecast for economic growth in the second quarter to zero.
That largely reflected an unwinding of the rush by many factories to get ready for the original Brexit deadline which has now been delayed until Oct. 31.
But economists said Monday's manufacturing purchasing managers' index showed how hard Britain's factories were also being hit by the slowdown in the world economy caused by the trade skirmishes between the United States and China.
The overall PMI slumped to 48.0 in June from May's 49.4, well below the average forecast in a Reuters poll of economists and its lowest reading since February 2013.
Export demand fell for a third month as manufacturers around the world lost confidence.
Allan Monks, an economist at JP Morgan, said the weak PMI survey challenged his view that manufacturing growth would rebound at the start of the third quarter.
Separate data from the Bank of England published on Monday showed lending to British consumers - whose spending has helped the economy cope with the Brexit crisis - rose by its weakest annual pace in more than five years in May.
The BoE data also showed the weakest increase since April 2017 in net mortgage lending.
Archer at EY Item Club said May's mortgage data chimed with other figures which suggested the relief from the delay of Brexit had been limited.
""Improved consumer purchasing power and robust employment growth has also recently been helpful for the housing market, but this has recently shown some signs of leveling off,"" he said.
Economists said they were waiting for Wednesday's PMI of Britain's dominant services industry to gauge the extent of the slowdown in the overall economy.
Chris Hare, an economist with HSBC, said he expected only a slight pick-up which would point to anemic underlying growth.
""So, considerations about Brexit deadlines notwithstanding, we do not think that now is the time for the Bank of England to be raising rates,"" he said.
The BoE has stuck to its message that it expects to raise borrowing costs, assuming Britain can avoid a no-deal Brexit."
1006,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 01, 2019 06:13AM ET</span>","Factories faltered in June, trade truce fails to brighten outlook","By Jonathan Cable and Leika Kihara
LONDON/TOKYO (Reuters) - Factory activity shrank across much of Europe and Asia in June as the simmering U.S.-China trade conflict put further strains on the manufacturing sector, keeping policymakers under pressure to deploy stronger steps to avert a global recession.
A series of mainly downbeat business surveys and official indicators released on Monday followed Saturday's warning by Group of 20 leaders who met in Osaka, Japan, of slowing global growth and intensifying geopolitical and trade tensions. The data was collected before the weekend summit.
The United States and China agreed at the summit to restart trade talks after U.S. President Donald Trump offered concessions including no new tariffs and an easing of restrictions on tech company Huawei, providing some relief to businesses and financial markets.
But analysts doubt the truce will lead to a sustained easing of tensions while lingering uncertainty could dampen corporate spending appetite and global growth.
""It's too early to turn optimistic. The two countries just kicked the can down the road and there's no knowing what could happen next,"" said Yoshiki Shinke, chief economist at Dai-ichi Life Research Institute in Tokyo.
""Global manufacturing activity hasn't hit bottom yet. U.S. business confidence, particularly that of manufacturers, has been weakening and if this continues, it may hurt economies across the world.""
Factory activity in the euro zone shrank faster last month than previously thought, in a broad-based downturn, according to IHS Markit's Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI), which also suggested there would be no quick turnaround. [EUR/PMIM]
Germany's export-dependent manufacturing sector contracted in June for the sixth time in a row, Italian activity declined for a ninth month and Spain's contracted at its fastest rate in more than six years.
France, the euro zone's second-biggest economy, bucked the trend and activity grew at its fastest pace in nine months.
But against a backdrop of Brexit uncertainty and global trade tensions, British manufacturers suffered the sharpest fall in activity in more than six years, its PMI showed, adding to signs of economic weakness there. [GB/PMIM]
""The global manufacturing sector has continued to deteriorate which will weigh on export orders,"" said Thomas Pugh at Capital Economics.
In China, Asia's economic engine, the Caixin/IHS Markit PMI came in at 49.4, falling short of market expectations and the worst reading since January.
It was the first time in four months the keenly-watched index has fallen below the neutral 50-mark dividing expansion from contraction on a monthly basis.
Japan also saw manufacturing activity contract in June to hit a three-month low, offering fresh evidence of an economy under the pump as global demand weakens.
Separately, a Bank of Japan (BOJ) survey showed big manufacturers' confidence hit a near three-year low, keeping its central bank under pressure to maintain or even ramp up a massive stimulus program.
In South Korea, factory activity shrank at the fastest pace in four months in June as the global trade slowdown deepened, prompting companies to cut production.
Activity fell in Malaysia and Taiwan, a sign the U.S.-China trade conflict's impact on the rest of Asia was broadening.
In India and Indonesia, where factories are less dependent on external demand for business, activity continued to grow albeit at a slower pace.
Vietnam's factory activity expanded at faster rate although new orders rose at their slowest since February. The Southeast Asian economy has been a rare beneficiary of the trade war as manufacturers shift their Chinese operations there to sidestep U.S. tariffs.
DWINDLING POLICY AMMUNITION
The U.S-China trade war has hurt business sentiment, threatened to disrupt supply chains and jolted financial markets, drawing warnings by policymakers over the widening fallout on the global economy.
International Monetary Fund Managing Director Christine Lagarde welcomed the resumption of trade talks between the two countries, but warned more needs to be done to resuscitate a global economy that had already hit a ""rough patch"".
Heightening worries over global growth have forced some central banks, such as those in Australia, New Zealand, India and Russia to cut interest rates.
While G20 leaders said they stand ready to take further action to prop up growth, many major economies have little fiscal and monetary space to battle another recession.
Expectations of a U.S. Federal Reserve interest rate cut have put pressure on the European Central Bank and the BOJ to follow suit, despite their dwindling options to arrest stalling growth.

""If the Fed cuts rates, the BOJ and the ECB must do something more powerful to contain currency appreciation,"" said Sayuri Shirai, a former BOJ policymaker who is currently a professor at Japan's Keio University.

1007,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 01, 2019 04:15AM ET</span>",Euro zone factory activity contracted for fifth month in June: PMI,"LONDON (Reuters) - Factory activity in the euro zone shrank faster last month than previously thought in a broad-based downturn, according to a survey on Monday that suggested there would be no quick turnaround.
The downbeat data will likely add to calls for the European Central Bank to ease monetary policy as it also highlighted weakening inflationary pressures.
IHS Markit's June final manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) was 47.6, below an earlier flash reading of 47.8 and May's 47.7, marking its fifth month below the 50 level separating growth from contraction.
An index measuring output change, which feeds into a composite PMI due on Wednesday and is seen as a good gauge of economic health, spent its fifth month below the breakeven mark, registering 48.5. It was 48.9 in May.
""Euro zone manufacturing remained stuck firmly in a steep downturn in June, continuing to contract at one of the steepest rates seen for over six years,"" said Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit.
""The disappointing survey rounds off a second quarter in which the average PMI reading was the lowest since the opening months of 2013.""
Indicating there will be a slow start to the second half, new orders fell for a ninth month, stocks of new materials were depleted again, backlogs of work were run down and headcount was reduced for a second month.
To try to encourage demand, factories barely increased their prices in June. The output prices PMI fell to 50.6 from May's 51.6, its lowest reading since September 2016.
Inflation in the euro zone was stable at 1.2% in June, a long way from the 2% the ECB would like it near, official data showed on Friday. [nL8N23Z29L]
""The downturn is also increasingly feeding through to lower inflationary pressures, as producers and their suppliers compete on price to retain customers and generate sales,"" Williamson said.
ECB President Mario Draghi in a speech last month called for additional stimulus in the absence of any improvement in weak growth and tepid inflation. The central bank will by the end of September either cut its deposit rate or ease its forward guidance further, a recent Reuters poll found. [ECILT/EU]

1008,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 30, 2019 10:36PM ET</span>",Japan big manufacturers' mood hits near 3-year low as trade war bites,"By Leika Kihara
TOKYO (Reuters) - Japanese big manufacturers' business confidence worsened to a nearly three-year low in the quarter to June, a central bank survey showed, in yet another sign of the growing economic toll exerted by slowing global demand and the U.S.-China trade war.
But service-sector mood improved and companies maintained their solid spending plans, the Bank of Japan's closely watched ""tankan"" survey showed on Monday, suggesting that solid domestic demand was partially offsetting weakness in overseas shipments.
A weekend truce in the U.S.-China trade war may also offer some respite, though analysts said there was little to cheer given soft global demand and lingering uncertainty over future developments in the trade talks. 
""Japan's economy is stagnating but not falling off the cliff with non-manufacturers' sentiment and capital expenditure holding up,"" said Yoshiki Shinke, chief economist at Dai-ichi Life Research Institute.
""This data alone won't force the BOJ to change its scenario that the economy continues to recover moderately. But that's not to say the outlook for Japan's economy has turned positive.""
The headline index gauging big manufacturers' sentiment slid to plus 7 in June from plus 12 in March, worse than a median market forecast and hitting the lowest level since September 2016, the tankan showed.
The index for big non-manufacturers rose to plus 23 from plus 21 in March, exceeding a median market forecast of plus 20.
Roughly 70% of the companies surveyed gave their replies on June 11, according to the BOJ, which meant the survey did not reflect the impact of an agreement reached on Saturday between the United States and China to restart trade talks.
CAPEX OUTLOOK MURKY
The data underscores the divergence between exporters, who are feeling the pinch from the trade tension, and service-sector firms benefiting from the resilience in private consumption.
A long public holiday in May gave a boost to retailers' sentiment as households splurged on leisure, though some firms complained that pent-up construction demand ahead of the 2020 Olympic Games may be peaking, a BOJ official told a briefing.
Big firms plan to raise their capital expenditure by 7.4% in the fiscal year to March 2020, slightly below market forecasts but roughly flat from three months ago, the tankan showed.
Any downturn in business spending could cast doubt on the BOJ's argument a sustained economic recovery will prod firms to boost prices and wages, helping inflation accelerate.
But Takeshi Minami, chief economist at Norinchukin Research Institute, said firms may simply be taking a wait-and-see stance given uncertainty over how the U.S.-China trade talks unfold
""Companies will likely stay cautious about boosting capital expenditure,"" he said. ""They won't revise up their spending plans when exports are weakening.""
Japan's economy expanded by an annualized 2.1% in the first quarter but many analysts predict growth to slow in coming months as the U.S.-China tariff row hurts trade, business sentiment and corporate profits. A scheduled sales tax hike in October may also curb consumption, they warn.

The tankan's sentiment indexes are derived by subtracting the number of respondents who say conditions are poor from those who say they are good. A positive reading means optimists outnumber pessimists.

1009,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 30, 2019 09:55PM ET</span>",China June factory activity unexpectedly shrinks as trade war weighs: Caixin PMI,"BEIJING, July 1 (Reuters) - China's factory activity unexpectedly shrank in June as domestic and export demand faltered, a private sector business survey showed on Monday, pointing to further strains on its vast manufacturing sector as the Sino-U.S. trade war drags on.
The downbeat readings suggest the world's second-largest economy is still losing steam despite a flurry of support over the past year, underlining an urgent need for more stimulus measures.
Leaders of the United States and China agreed at the G20 summit in Japan over the weekend to restart trade talks, giving investors some cause for optimism, though analysts say the lack of any substantive agreements from the meeting mean China's economic woes are likely to persist. 
The Caixin/Markit Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) for June came in at 49.4, the worst reading since January and below economists' expectations of 50.0.
It was the first time in four months that the keenly-watched index has fallen below the neutral 50-mark dividing expansion from contraction on a monthly basis. 
The survey finding was in line with an official gauge on factory activity published on Sunday, which showed manufacturing contracted at a faster-than-expected pace. 
""China's economy came under further pressure in June,"" Zhengsheng Zhong, Director of Macroeconomic Analysis at CEBM Group, wrote in a note accompanying the data.
""It's crucial for policymakers to step up countercyclical policies,"" he said.
Factory output and new orders both fell for the first time since January, with some companies reporting they had halted production lines because of the trade dispute.
Business confidence dropped to the lowest in over seven years as a result, and manufacturers shed jobs for the third straight month.
The Caixin survey's new orders sub-index - which measures new work both from home and abroad - fell sharply to 48.8 from 50.7 in the previous month.
Global fallout from the U.S.-China trade war is building as the dispute intensifies and enters its second year, disrupting supply chains, rattling financial markets and discouraging many companies from making new investments. 
Tensions between the world's two biggest economies escalated sharply in May, when talks to reach a broad deal collapsed as Washington accused Beijing of reneging promises on reforms. Both sides raised tariffs on each others' goods and the White House threatened even more. 
However, Chinese policymakers have been facing considerable weakness on the home front as well.
While tit-for-tat U.S.-China tariffs are expected to hit Chinese export-oriented firms hardest, the PMI survey suggested orders from domestic customers cooled faster in June than new business from abroad.
That's despite a sustained economic support program that began early last year, ranging from higher infrastructure spending to tax cuts to a spate of measures aimed at keeping struggling smaller firms afloat.
While new exports orders shrank, pointing to further factory weakness in the third quarter, the drop was modest.
CEBM Group's Zhong said that may reflect a rush by Chinese companies to ship goods to the United States ahead of any further tariffs. Similar ""front loading"" kept China's headline export growth fairly resilient for much of last year before they sharply tapered off in the fourth quarter.
With the trade war threatening to grow longer and costlier, many economists believe Beijing will need to roll out more stimulus to meet its 2019 economic growth target of around 6-6.5 percent.

Market expectations are centering on further cuts in the amount of cash banks must hold as reserves and even higher fiscal spending, though some China watchers also expect the central bank to cut one or more of its key policy interest rates to reduce corporate borrowing costs.

1010,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 30, 2019 09:05PM ET</span>","South Korea June factory activity shrinks, export orders in longest slump on record","SEOUL, (Reuters) - South Korea's factory activity shrank at the fastest pace in four months in June as the global trade slowdown deepened, prompting companies to cut back production and shed more jobs, a business survey showed on Monday.
New export orders contracted for the 11th straight month, the longest decline on record, which will likely add to pressure on the central bank to cut interest rates soon to reduce the risks of a recession.
The Nikkei/Markit purchasing managers' index (PMI) fell to 47.5, from 48.4 in May, marking the seventh decline in the past eight months.
The headline index dropped further below the 50-point level that separates growth from contraction, with major sub-indexes extending their weakness.
Total new orders from at home and abroad contracted for an eighth consecutive month, led by cooling demand from the key auto and electronics sectors. Fallout from the U.S.-China trade war was cited as a major factor, but export orders from all parts of the world were reported to be lower.
""Panellists reported that (the global trade slowdown) is taking its toll on their businesses, weighing on demand for goods and subsequently leading to cuts in production,"" said Joe Hayes, an economist at IHS Markit.
Facing weak demand, factories lowered the prices of their goods and hit the brakes, cutting output at the sharpest rate in four years. Job losses continued for a second month.
Worried that the Sino-U.S. trade dispute will drag on, South Korean manufacturers were only slightly optimistic of a pick-up in production in the next 12 months, the survey showed.
""Manufacturers remain fairly subdued about the future, with even the prospect of new product lines failing to lift their spirits,"" Hayes said.

South Korea's economy contracted by a seasonally adjusted 0.4% in the January-March period from the previous quarter.

1011,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 30, 2019 07:30PM ET</span>",Brexit and global slowdown hit UK factories in second quarter: BCC,"LONDON (Reuters) - The proportion of British manufacturers reporting a rise in their domestic orders has fallen to its lowest in seven years as Brexit uncertainty and the global slowdown take their toll, a leading employers group said on Monday.
Factories also showed the weakest picture for export orders in four years in the April-June period while a slight pick-up for services firms was not strong enough to make up for a weak start to the year, the British Chambers of Commerce said.
""These results indicate that underlying economic conditions in the UK remain decidedly downbeat,"" BCC economist Suren Thiru said.
Britain's economy began 2019 strongly, but the growth came largely from a surge in stockpiling by manufacturers seeking to protect themselves against the risk of border delays after the original March 29 Brexit deadline.
That deadline has been postponed until Oct. 31, and progress to resolve a stand-off in parliament over how to leave the European Union is on hold while the Conservative Party chooses a new leader who will take over as prime minister.
The BCC's Quarterly Economic Survey showed price pressures for services firms and manufacturers fell to their lowest level since 2016.
Thiru said the prospect of muted inflation would help consumers and allow the Bank of England to keep interest rates on hold as it waits for the outcome of Britain's Brexit impasse.
On Sunday another employers group, the Confederation of British Industry, reported that Britain's private sector had its worst three months in nearly seven years..
Later on Monday, the IHS Markit/CIPS purchasing managers index for the manufacturing sector, which is due to be published at 0830 GMT, is expected to show the factory sector shrank slightly in June.
The BCC survey was based on responses from 6,846 companies - making it the largest of its kind in Britain - and was conducted between May 20 and June 10.

1012,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 30, 2019 09:02AM ET</span>",Oil production cuts weigh on Saudi growth in first quarter,"DUBAI (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia's economic growth more than halved on a quarterly basis to 1.66% in the first quarter of this year, in line with expectations of only a modest pick up as oil production cuts weigh on the world's top crude exporter.
The Saudi oil sector grew 1% in the first quarter, government data showed on Sunday. This was almost twice the rate reached in the same period a year ago but a massive slowdown from the previous quarter, when the oil sector grew by almost 6% year-on-year.
The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and its Russia-led allies agreed in December to slash oil production by more than the market had expected. 
On Sunday, Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih said the cuts would most likely be extended by nine months.
This is expected to weigh on oil sector growth this year, while non-oil sector growth is likely to pick up slightly, on the back of a boost in government spending.
""We estimate that the oil sector will contract on an annual basis in 2Q and for the subsequent quarters in 2019,"" Monica Malik, chief economist at Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank, said in a research note.
Non-oil sector growth in the first quarter was 2.13%, largely in line with the same period last year, but up from a 1.8% growth in last year's fourth quarter.
Non-oil activity picked up particularly in the private sector, which saw a growth of 2.3%.
But ""the underlying drivers of non-oil activity remain relatively subdued, with the more favorable fiscal backdrop being a key factor supporting private sector activity in 1Q,"" Malik said.
The Saudi economy has suffered in recent years because of low oil prices and austerity measures aimed at reducing a huge budget deficit.
In 2017, the economy shrank for the first time since the global financial crisis almost a decade earlier, but last year it grew at a pace of 2.21%, buoyed by strong oil sector growth.

The IMF said last month real non-oil growth is expected to strengthen to 2.9% in 2019, boosting overall economic growth to 1.9%, higher than its earlier projection of 1.8%.

1013,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 30, 2019 04:47AM ET</span>","China's factory activity shrinks as U.S. tariffs, slowdown hit orders","BEIJING (Reuters) - China's factory activity shrank more than expected in June, an official manufacturing survey showed, highlighting the need for more economic stimulus as U.S. tariffs and weaker domestic demand ramped up pressure on new orders for goods.
The Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) stood at 49.4 in June, China's National Bureau of Statistics said on Sunday, unchanged from the previous month and below the 50-point mark that separates growth from contraction on a monthly basis. Analysts polled by Reuters predicted a reading of 49.5.
The weak manufacturing readings are likely to cast a shadow over the apparent progress U.S. and Chinese leaders made at the G20 summit in Japan over the weekend in restarting their troubled talks over tariffs amid a costly trade war.
They will also spark concerns about stalling growth in China and the risk of a global recession, despite slightly better-than-expected export and industrial profits data in May.
Many economists still expect the economy to face strong headwinds in coming months as domestic demand falters and external risks rise.
""Although the outcome of the G20 summit (in Osaka) might boost confidence for some entities, organic growth in the economy is still insufficient, and counter-cyclical stimulus policies need to be maintained,"" researchers at Huatai Securities wrote in a research note on Sunday.
""The PMI index continued to fall across the board this month, and only the raw material inventory sub-index was up due to weak demand,"" the research note read.
In June, China's factory output growth slowed, with the subindex falling to 51.3 from 51.7 in May while the contraction in total new orders accelerated to 49.6 from 49.8.
Export orders extended their decline with the sub-index falling to 46.3 from May's 46.5, suggesting a further weakening in global demand.
Import orders also worsened, reflecting softening demand at home despite a flurry of growth-supporting measures rolled out earlier this year.
Southwest Securities said weak new export orders reflected a fading of the front-loading effect, which had temporarily boosted exports as Chinese companies rushed to place orders before more tariffs took effect.
Presidents Donald Trump and Xi Jinping held ice-breaking talks at the G20 summit on Saturday. However, Chinese state media warned on Sunday Beijing and Washington will likely face a long road before the two countries could reach a deal.
Analysts at Nomura expect any gains achieved on a temporary trade deal between China and the United States would prove fleeting with a renewed escalation likely further down the road.
Trump has already imposed tariffs on $250 billion of Chinese goods and is threatening to extend those to another $300 billion, which would effectively cover all of China's exports to the United States. China has retaliated with tariffs on U.S. imports.
To deal with the economic challenges, policymakers have released a range of measures and are expected to launch more. Premier Li Keqiang last week pledged to cut real interest rates on financing for small and micro firms.
Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) said the lack of any substantive progress in Sino-U.S. trade talks at the G20 over the weekend suggested stimulus, including cuts to banks' reserve requirements, was likely to be needed.
""We expect more policy easing (two more reserve requirement ratio cuts in 2H this year, more fiscal measures to support infrastructure investment) to come in the next few months,"" Goldman Sachs said in a note.

After a surge earlier this year, caused by companies stockpiling ahead of the original March 29 Brexit deadline, private sector activity in the three months to June contracted at the quickest pace since September 2012.
The balance of firms reporting growth sank to -13%, according to the CBI's monthly Growth Indicator.
Rain Newton-Smith, the CBI's chief economist, blamed the weakness on the after-effects of the stockpiling rush, Brexit-related shutdowns in Britain's car industry and bad weather.
""But underlying activity and confidence is clearly subdued,"" she said. ""The UK economy is being stifled by uncertainty about the UK's relationship with the EU. The need for the new prime minister to secure a deal with the EU is urgent.""
Britain's Conservative Party is due to announce its new leader, who will become the next prime minister, on July 23. Both contenders - former foreign minister Boris Johnson and the current incumbent Jeremy Hunt - have said they are prepared to lead Britain out of the EU without a deal if necessary. 

The Bank of England has said it expects zero growth in the economy in the second quarter, reflecting the unwinding of the stockpiling boost in the first three months of the year, uncertainty about the Brexit outcome and slower global growth.

1016,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 28, 2019 11:50AM ET</span>","Moderate U.S. consumer spending, inflation support rate cut","By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. consumer spending increased moderately in May and prices rose slightly, pointing to slowing economic growth and benign inflation pressures, which could give the Federal Reserve ammunition to cut interest rates next month.
The report from the Commerce Department on Friday came just a week after the Fed signaled it could ease monetary policy as early as July, citing low inflation as well as growing risks to the economy from an escalation in trade tensions between the United States and China. Inflation has undershot the U.S. central bank's 2 percent target this year.
""Below-target inflation is a concern for the Fed, but not the primary reason they are leaning toward cutting interest rates,"" said Ryan Sweet, a senior economist at Moody's Analytics in West Chester, Pennsylvania. ""The Fed has an easing bias because of growth concerns, and low inflation has only helped lower the bar for even further rate cuts.""
Consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, rose 0.4% as households boosted purchases of motor vehicles and spent more at restaurants and on hotel accommodation. Data for April was revised up to show consumer spending advancing 0.6% instead of the previously reported 0.3 percent gain. 
Last month's increase in spending was in line with economists' expectations. 
Consumer prices as measured by the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index rose 0.2% last month as a 0.3%rebound in food prices was tempered by a 0.6% decline in the cost of gasoline and other energy goods. The PCE price index increased 0.3% in April. 
In the 12 months through May, the PCE price index increased 1.5%, slowing from April's 1.6% advance.
Excluding the volatile food and energy components, the PCE price index climbed 0.2% last month after a similar gain in April. That kept the annual increase in the so-called core PCE price index at 1.6% for a second straight month in May. 
The core PCE index is the Fed's preferred inflation measure. It hit the central bank's 2% target in March 2018 for the first time since April 2012. The Fed last week downgraded its inflation projection for 2019 to 1.5% from the 1.8% projected in March. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell at his press conference did not refer to weak inflation as ""transient.""
The low inflation projections were supported by a survey on Friday from the University of Michigan showing consumers this month expected slower price increases over the next 12 months compared to May. Consumers' inflation expectations over a five-year period fell to 2.3% from 2.6% last month.
The dollar (DXY) dipped against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury yields rose slightly as investors awaited crucial trade talks on Saturday between Washington and Beijing. Stocks on Wall Street were trading marginally higher.
LESS MOMENTUM
When adjusted for inflation, consumer spending rose 0.2% in May. This so-called real consumer spending increased by the same margin in April. The moderate increase in real spending in the last two months suggested consumer spending was struggling to accelerate after slowing sharply in the first quarter.
""It still looks like spending has firmed noticeably relative to the weak run around the turn of the year, but we now see less recent momentum than we had been expecting,"" said Daniel Silver, an economist at JP Morgan in New York. 
Consumer spending increased at a 0.9% annualized rate in the January-March quarter, the slowest in a year. The overall economy grew at a 3.1% rate last quarter, boosted by exports, an accumulation of inventory and government spending on highways and defense.
The tepid real consumer spending gain added to weak May reports on manufacturing, trade, job growth and the housing market in suggesting a deceleration in economic activity. 
The manufacturing sector's deepening troubles were underscored by a third report on Friday showing a measure of factory activity in the Midwest tumbled into contraction territory this month for the first time since January 2017. 
The MNI Chicago Business Barometer decreased by 4.5 points to a reading of 49.7 in June. A reading below 50 indicates contraction in the region's manufacturing. It added to other weak regional manufacturing surveys, including from the New York Fed, Richmond Fed and Philadelphia Fed. 
""The evidence that renewed uncertainties about trade and tariff policies and the impact on global supply chains and capital spending is adversely affecting manufacturing activity continues to build with this report,"" said John Ryding, chief economist at RDQ Economics in New York.
The economy is shifting into lower gear as last year's stimulus from massive tax cuts and increased government spending fades. Following the consumer spending data, the Atlanta Fed slashed its second-quarter gross domestic product forecast by four-tenths of a percentage point to a 1.5% rate. 
Last month, spending on goods increased 0.5%, with outlays on long-lasting manufactured goods such as motor vehicles surging 1.7%. Spending on services gained 0.4%.
Consumer spending in May was supported by a 0.5% rise in personal income, which matched April's increase. Wages gained 0.2% after increasing 0.3% in April. Savings rose to $985.4 billion in May from $975.0 billion in the prior month.

""Decent income gains are supporting continued consumer spending, but weakness in wage increases remains a threat to growth,"" said Joel Naroff, chief economist at Naroff Economic Advisors in Holland, Pennsylvania.

1018,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jun 28, 2019 08:40AM ET</span>",U.S. Core Inflation Shows Signs of Life as Fed Weighs Rate Cut,"(Bloomberg) -- The Federal Reserve’s preferred measure of underlying U.S. inflation showed signs of picking up in May toward the central bank’s goal, potentially raising the bar for an interest-rate cut when policy makers meet at the end of next month.
The core personal consumption expenditures price gauge, which excludes food and energy, rose 0.2% from the prior month and 1.6% from a year earlier, according to a Commerce Department report Friday. The annual gain was just above the median estimate in a Bloomberg survey, and the three-month annualized increase advanced to about 2%, a five-month high.
Purchases, which make up the majority of the economy, rose 0.4% from April, slightly below estimates, following an upwardly revised 0.6% gain in April. Personal income increased 0.5% for a second month, topping forecasts, though wages and salaries climbed at the slowest pace in six months.
While Friday’s figures alone are unlikely to spur the Fed to act one way or another, a sustained flow of positive economic news in coming weeks could persuade policy makers to keep interest rates unchanged, despite pressure from financial markets and President Donald Trump. Stronger consumer spending and higher incomes should support future growth as the expansion becomes the longest in U.S. history in July.
Earlier this week, Powell said recent data show that the inflation undershoot “may be more persistent than we had hoped.” In May, he said officials viewed muted inflation as likely transitory.
The broader PCE price gauge, which the Fed officially targets for 2% inflation, rose 0.2% from the prior month and was up 1.5% from a year earlier, matching the median estimates in a Bloomberg survey. Policy makers view the core gauge as a better indicator of underlying price trends and have said they’re also aiming for it to rise 2%.
Fed officials in their quarterly forecasts last week lowered their outlook for headline PCE inflation to 1.5% this year and to 1.8% for core PCE prices.
Friday’s report showed inflation-adjusted spending rose 0.2% for a second month, which was less than estimated, though the April figure reflected an upward revision. The gain in May was driven by new motor vehicles as well as spending on food services and accommodations, according to the report.

1019,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 28, 2019 05:37AM ET</span>",Fresh inflation reading little comfort for ECB,"By Francesco Guarascio and Balazs Koranyi
BRUSSELS/FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Underlying inflation in the euro zone rebounded in June, offering some comfort to the European Central Bank but still falling short of the improvement policymakers are hoping for.
With growth and price pressures easing throughout the year, ECB President Mario Draghi has already said that more policy easing will come in the near future unless inflation and growth prospects improve.
Overall inflation held steady as expected at 1.2 percent, well short of the ECB's target of almost 2 percent, but a closely watched 'core' figure, excluding volatile food and energy prices, jumped to 1.2 percent from 1 percent in May.
While the core inflation rebound is impressive, it is in line with expectations and still below April's reading, suggesting that overall price pressures are modest despite years of extraordinary stimulus from the ECB.
The weak inflation has long puzzled policymakers. 
The 19-country currency bloc has created over 10 million jobs since the worst days of its debt crisis and employment is the highest on record. Wages are also rising relatively fast, creating the textbook environment for higher prices. 
Yet inflation remains weak as businesses would rather sacrifice their own margins than jack up prices. 
The problem is that if prices failed to rise during the boom times, they are unlikely to do so during an economic slowdown.
Euro zone growth is seen at just 1.2 percent this year, less than half the 2017 figure, and a recent string of dismal indicators suggest this may still be an optimistic estimate.
A key euro zone sentiment indicator published on Thursday underperformed expectations and Germany's widely watched IFO index also disappointed.
The figures only reinforced already widespread expectations that the ECB will cut interest rates either in July or September and lay the groundwork for restarting asset purchases. 
Such support is bound to push borrowing costs even lower but may fail to provide significant stimulus as bond yields are already near record highs.
Ten-year German bonds are yielding minus 0.30% and French yields are also negative. This indicates that the biggest support would come in the euro zone's periphery, particularly Italy, where yields are still relatively high, reflecting its large public debt.
The ECB will next meet on July 25 and investors are split on whether the bank will pull the trigger on stimulus then or wait until its Sept. 12 meeting.
While some investors are advocating an earlier move, changes at the top of the ECB may complicate the process.

Draghi is leaving at the end of October but European leaders have yet to appoint his successor and ECB policymakers may be hesitant to effectively tie the hands of their new president for most of the next year.

1020,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 28, 2019 04:45AM ET</span>",Gold imports inflate UK current account deficit to highest since 2016,"LONDON, (Reuters) - Britain's current account deficit with the rest of the world ballooned to its highest since late 2016 in the first three months of this year, though much of the increase was driven by hefty gold imports.
Figures from the Office for National Statistics on Friday confirmed that economic output grew a solid 0.5% in the first quarter of the year, as businesses rushed to stockpile raw materials in anticipation of a Brexit that was postponed.
""GDP grew solidly and was unrevised in the first quarter of 2019, with manufacturing seeing strong growth due to orders being brought forward ahead of the UK's original EU departure date,"" ONS statistician Rob Kent-Smith said.
Economists expect payback during the current quarter. The Bank of England predicts growth in the world's fifth-largest economy will grind to a halt as business investment remains on hold ahead of the new Brexit date of Oct. 31.
Both contenders to become Britain's next prime minister have said they are prepared to leave the EU without a transition deal if necessary, something that business groups warn would cause widespread disruption.
Friday's figures showed that Britain's current account deficit rose to 30.0 billion pounds in the first quarter of 2019 from 23.7 billion pounds in the last three months of 2018, a smaller increase than economists' average forecast of a deficit of 32 billion pounds in a Reuters poll.
This is equivalent to 5.6% of GDP and the highest since the third quarter of 2016.
However, the ONS said most of the increase reflected an jump 
in imports of unspecified goods including gold - something that regularly distorts British trade statistics due to London's role as a gold trading hub.
Excluding these imports, Britain's current account deficit would be 3.7% of GDP, the ONS said.
BoE Governor Mark Carney described Britain as dependent ""on the kindness of strangers"" before the 2016 Brexit referendum, and last month the BoE said the current account deficit still posed economic risks.
A drop-off in foreign investors' demand for British assets could trigger a further fall in sterling and make it harder for businesses and consumers to raise finance or borrow.
Britain's economy has slowed since the Brexit referendum, and now faces increased headwinds from trade tensions between the United States and China and a slowdown in Europe.
The economy grew by 1.8% in the year to the end of March, unchanged from an earlier estimate and the fastest growth since the third quarter of 2017. However, the BoE forecasts growth will slow to 1.5% this year.
Business investment showed an annual fall of 1.5%, a fraction bigger than earlier reported.
Consumer spending remained the mainstay of growth, up 1.9% on the year.

However, there are some signs this may be beginning to soften, despite a robust job market. The closely watched GfK consumer sentiment survey showed earlier on Friday that morale fell further into negative territory and consumers were less willing to make big purchases.

Home prices in May rose 1.4% from a month earlier compared with April's revised 3.2% increase, government data showed on Friday. April's pace of growth was the fastest since February 2013. 
The price index of 396.8 last month topped 394.8 in July last year to become the highest on record in one of the world's least affordable property markets. 
Market participants expect more volatility in the second half of the year.
""The property market has performed well in the first half...recording around 9% gains,"" said Thomas Lam, executive director of Knight Frank. ""But the recent social movement in Hong Kong and the China-U.S. relations will definitely affect prices in the second half.""
Lam expected a correction of 5% for the rest of 2019, registering a flat to small rise for the full year. He also revised down the valuation of land parcels to be sold by the government by 5%.
The former British colony is being rocked by a series of protests this month against an extradition bill that would allow people to be sent to mainland China for trial 
Millions of protesters have thronged the streets in the past three weeks to demand that the now-suspended bill be scrapped altogether, and more demonstrations are set to take place.
Some Hong Kong tycoons have started moving personal wealth offshore amid concerns over the legislation. 
Earlier this month, Hong Kong-based Goldin Financial Holdings Ltd (HK:0530) dropped out of a process to buy a commercial land parcel worth about $1.4 billion, citing ""recent social contradiction and economic instability"".
The protests have also prompted the government to delay the sale of a residential land parcel in the same district by one week. The parcel was sold on Wednesday for HK$12.9 billion ($1.65 billion), at the mid-to-lower end of expectations, to  China Resources Land  (HK:1109) and  Poly Property  Group (HK:0119), both Chinese developers. 
In May, a flat of 60 square meters (646 square ft) on Hong Kong Island cost an average of HK$11.3 million ($1.45 million), according to official data. 
Over the past decade, ultra low interest rates, limited housing supply and large capital flows from mainland Chinese buyers have pushed housing prices up more than 200 percent.

The GfK consumer sentiment index - which has been negative since shortly before the June 2016 Brexit referendum - fell to -13 in June from May's seven-month high of -10.
The reading was below the median forecast in a Reuters poll of economists of -11.
A measure of consumers' willingness to make major purchases was its weakest since November.

Power and LMC Automotive.
The consultancies estimate total U.S. vehicle sales of about 1.47 million units in June, with retail sales of new vehicles expected to drop 2.9% to 1.15 million units.
Demand for new vehicles was affected by higher prices, outweighing the strong economy and record-high consumer sentiment that otherwise should have boosted auto sales growth.
""Average transaction prices set a record during the first half which has big implications for manufacturer revenues,"" Thomas King, senior vice president of the data and analytics division at J.D. Power, said in a statement.
Despite lower volumes, net revenue of automakers is rising due to higher prices. New vehicle prices are on pace to reach $33,346 for the first six months and also the highest-ever for the first half of the year. The prices for the first half were up nearly 4% from a year earlier.
Average incentive spending per unit for the first six months, however, fell about $130 to $3,788, compared with a year earlier.
""A much more dovish Fed is under pressure and is now expected to make a series of interest rate cuts. This will provide support for auto sales in the second half of the year and help offset rising vehicle prices and the current level of incentives,"" Jeff Schuster, president of LMC Automotive's Americas operations and global vehicle forecasts, said in the statement.
The average number of days a new vehicle remain with dealers before being sold to a retail customer are 75 days through June 23, up six days from a year earlier.
But sales of used vehicles are getting a boost, offsetting challenges in new vehicle operations for many dealers.
Used vehicle sales at franchised dealers are expected to increase by nearly 9% in the first half, according to the consultancies.

LMC Automotive, however, maintained its forecast for total light-vehicle sales of 16.9 million units in 2019, a 2.1% fall from the previous year.

The Euler Hermes report, released on Thursday, found that European companies were stockpiling more than companies anywhere else in the world, highlighting the vulnerability of Europe's export-based economies to global trade tensions.
With storage space at a premium, companies are expected to cut prices and reduce production to shrink stockpiles as quickly as possible, Kai Gerdes, analysis director at Euler Hermes Rating, said, adding that the impact of this would be to lower inflation.
""We estimate that inventory levels in Europe are between 20% and 30% higher than normal,"" he said.
Over the euro zone as a whole, the average number of days of inventory outstanding at large companies rose to 52 in 2018, up by four days compared to the previous year. Growth was especially strong in Spain (up by 11 days), and Germany (six days).
""Next to the Spanish and the Italians, German companies have stocked up the most,"" Ron van het Hof, head of Euler Hermes in Germany, Austria and Switzerland, said.
""The reasons are rising global uncertainties, especially since the second half of 2018, weakening world trade, and demand, which has grown more slowly than expected in some sectors,"" he said.

Initial claims for state unemployment benefits increased 10,000 to a seasonally adjusted 227,000 for the week ended June 22, the Labor Department said on Thursday. Data for the prior week was revised to show 1,000 more applications received than previously reported.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast claims rising to 220,000 in the latest week. The Labor Department said claims for California and Mississippi were estimated. 
Claims could rise further in the coming weeks as auto manufacturers temporarily shut down assembly plants for summer retooling. Companies implement the plant closures at different times, which can throw off the model the government uses to remove seasonal fluctuations from the data.
Claims are being watched for signs of a rise in layoffs stemming from a recent escalation in trade tensions between the United States and China. Rising risks to economic growth from the trade war, and low inflation, resulted in the Federal Reserve last week signaling interest rate cuts as early as July.
The four-week moving average of initial claims, considered a better measure of labor market trends as it irons out week-to-week volatility, rose 2,250 to 221,250 last week. 
Despite the underlying strength in the labor market, the broader economy is slowing. Manufacturing is struggling, the trade deficit is widening again, consumer confidence is ebbing and the housing sector remains mired in a soft patch.
The Atlanta Fed is forecasting gross domestic product growth to rise at a 1.9% annualized rate in the April-June quarter. The economy grew at a 3.1% pace in the first quarter following a temporary boost from exports and an accumulation of inventory.
Thursday's claims report also showed the number of people receiving benefits after an initial week of aid increased 22,000 to 1.69 million for the week ended June 15. The four-week moving average of the so-called continuing claims gained 6,500 to 1.69 million.

The continuing claims data covered the week of the household survey, from which June's unemployment rate will be calculated. The four-week average of claims rose 13,000 between the May and June survey weeks, suggesting little change in the unemployment rate, which is hovering near a 50-year low of 3.6%.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. economic growth accelerated in the first quarter, the government confirmed on Thursday, but the export and inventory boost to activity masked weakness in domestic demand, some of which appears to have prevailed in the current quarter.
Gross domestic product increased at a 3.1% annualized rate, also driven by strong defense spending, the government said in its third reading of first-quarter GDP. That was unchanged from its estimate last month. The economy grew at a 2.2% pace in the October-December period.
Despite the unchanged reading, growth in consumer spending was revised lower and business investment in intellectual property products was stronger than previously estimated. There were also upward revisions to spending on nonresidential structures. Revisions to the trade deficit and inventory accumulation were minor.
Economists polled by Reuters had expected first-quarter GDP growth would be unrevised at a 3.1% rate. 
Excluding trade, inventories and government spending, the economy grew at only a 1.3% rate in the first quarter. That was the slowest rise in this measure of domestic demand since the second quarter of 2013. 
When measured from the income side, the economy grew at a tepid 1.0% rate in the last quarter. Gross domestic income (GDI) was previously reported to have increased at a rate of 1.4% in the first quarter. The average of GDP and GDI, also referred to as gross domestic output and considered a better measure of economic activity, increased at a 2.1% rate in the January-March period, down from the 2.2% growth pace estimated last month.
Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell last week acknowledged the temporary boost to economic growth from trade and inventories, which he described as ""components that are not generally reliable indicators of ongoing momentum."" 
The U.S. central bank last week signaled interest rate cuts as early as July, citing rising risks to the economy, especially from an escalation in the trade conflict between the United States and China, and low inflation. 
The economy will mark 10 years of expansion in July, the longest on record. But momentum is slowing, with manufacturing struggling, the trade deficit widening again and the housing sector still mired in a soft patch.
CONSUMER SPENDING REVISED DOWN 
While consumer spending appears to have regained speed in the second quarter, business spending on equipment is expected to have contracted further following Wednesday's weak report on durable goods orders in May. The trade war between Washington and Beijing is hurting both business and consumer confidence.
The Atlanta Fed is forecasting GDP growth to rise at a 1.9% annualized rate in the April-June quarter. 
The trade deficit narrowed to $905.0 billion in the first quarter, instead of $903.6 billion as reported last month. The trade gap contributed 0.94 percentage point to GDP rather than the 0.96 percentage point estimated last month.
The U.S.-China trade tensions have caused wild swings in the trade deficit, with exporters and importers trying to stay ahead of the tariff fight between the two economic giants. The standoff has also had an impact on inventories. Growth in inventories was revised down to a $122.8 billion rate in the first quarter from the previously estimated $125.5 billion pace.
Part of the inventory build was because of weak demand. Inventories contributed 0.55 percentage point to first-quarter GDP, rather than the 0.60 percentage point reported last month.
Growth in consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, was revised down to a 0.9% rate, the weakest in a year. Consumer spending was previously reported to have increased at a 1.3% pace in the first quarter.
Business spending on equipment declined at an unrevised rate of 1.0% rate, the weakest since the first quarter of 2016. Government investment increased at a 2.8% rate. It was previously reported to have risen at a 2.5% rate.

The government also reported on Thursday after-tax profits without inventory valuation and capital consumption adjustment, which correspond to S&P 500 profits, fell at a 0.2% rate in the first quarter. Profits were previously reported to have dropped at a 0.8% pace.

1029,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 27, 2019 05:35AM ET</span>","German inflation edges closer to ECB target in June, state data show","BERLIN (Reuters) - Inflation edged closer to the European Central Bank's target in German states in June, data showed on Thursday, but analysts said the figures are unlikely to prompt a reversal of its decision not to raise interest rates in the coming year.
The ECB aims to keep inflation in the euro zone close to, but just below, 2% a year. Earlier this month, it opened the door to cutting rates or buying more bonds, as risk factors such as trade wars dragged down the euro zone economy.
""The ECB is not going to focus on just one number, even if that number is from Germany,"" said Jack Allen-Reynolds of Capital Economics. ""Economic growth in the euro zone is pretty weak and underlying inflation remains subdued. The ECB has been preparing the markets for more stimulus and those numbers are not going to make it change its mind.""
A poll conducted before the release of the regional data suggested German consumer price inflation, harmonized to compare with data from other European Union countries, would remain unchanged at 1.3%.
The state data suggested that the nationwide preliminary inflation figures due at 1200 GMT might confound the forecast.
In North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany's most populous state, inflation accelerated to 1.7% from 1.6%. In Bavaria, consumer prices rose by 1.8% after a 1.6% increase in May.
The state inflation readings, which are not harmonized to compare with other countries, feed into nationwide figures.

Economists expect euro zone inflation -- due on June 28 -- remained at 1.2% in June.

The Commission said that its main indicator of economic confidence dropped to 103.3 points in June from 105.2 a month earlier, reaching its lowest level since August 2016.
June's large fall capped a semester in which sentiment dropped in each month, except May, sending another stark warning over the health of the 19-country bloc's economy which is grappling with weak growth and low inflation.
The fall was also bigger than market forecasts of a fall to 104.6.
The largest falls in confidence were recorded in Germany, the biggest economy of the bloc, and Italy, its third major economic power, the data showed.
The indicator in Germany fell by 2.9 points, and in Italy by 1.5 points. Confidence decreased also in France, the Netherlands and Spain.
Sentiment in the industry sector plunged by 2.7 points, the largest drop in about eight years, equaled only by a similar fall in April, the Commission said, as the export-driven sector suffers from global trade tensions.
Business managers were also pessimistic about the euro zone's services sector, which posted a drop of 1.1 points.
Consumer confidence went down by 0.7 points, but did not affect sentiment in the retail trade sector, which instead rose by 1.0 points.
In a separate release, the Commission said that its business climate indicator, which helps point to the phase of the business cycle, declined to 0.17 in June from 0.30 in May for its fourth consecutive monthly drop.
Economists polled by Reuters had predicted a more limited fall to 0.23.

The government and central bank are reviewing their growth projection range of 1.5% to 2.5% for this year, Menon said at the release of the Monetary Authority of Singapore’s annual report on Thursday.
“The outlook for the global economy has deteriorated in recent months,” particularly as “we are now indeed in a trade and technology war,” said Menon. However, “the global economy is not heading for a crash,” he said.
Inflation is likely to remain subdued and the monetary policy stance is still “appropriate,” Menon said.
As trade disagreements between the U.S. and China morphed over the past year into a full-blown trade war, “three engines have stalled” as MAS feared they would under this scenario, said Menon. Global manufacturing, trade volumes, and investments all have suffered amid weakening business confidence as a result of the tensions.
The central bank chief cited recent weakness in purchasing manager index and exports data, especially in Asia where some of the world’s most trade-reliant economies are. PMIs for Japan, Malaysia, Taiwan and South Korea all contracted last month alongside Singapore’s, and global manufacturing slumped to its worst performance since 2012.
Singapore’s non-oil domestic exports plunged in May by the most since February 2013, driven by an ongoing slump in the electronics sector that’s now the worst in more than a decade, Enterprise Singapore figures showed last week.
“At this point it’s too early to say where we’re going to end up” in revising the 2019 growth forecast, Menon said. MAS Chief Economist Edward Robinson noted that the MAS and Ministry of Trade and Industry would have to gather second-quarter data before a fresh announcement.
Menon said the MAS is in “active” discussions with the U.S. Treasury after Singapore was included in a list of countries that the U.S. is monitoring for possible currency manipulation. The MAS’s currency policy is solely directed at securing price stability, Menon said. Singapore’s inclusion in the report has no direct consequence for the economy or monetary policy, he added.
The MAS chief also made the following comments to reporters:

1032,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 27, 2019 12:42AM ET</span>",China's industrial profits rise 1.1% in May as sales quicken,"BEIJING (Reuters) - Bolstered by improving sales and better margins, profits for China's industrial companies rose in May, bucking a months-long downtrend.
But analysts are unsure if the modest gains can last. China's industrial profits have been faltering for over a year as the economy slows and the U.S.-Sino trade war escalates, weighing on manufacturing investment and output.
Profits rose 1.1% in May from a year earlier to 565.6 billion yuan ($82.21 billion), according to data released by the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) on Thursday, following a 3.7% fall in April. 
In the first five months, industrial firms earned profits of 2.38 trillion yuan, down 2.3% from a year earlier, compared with a 3.4% drop in January-April. 
The uptick in May was driven by quicker sales and slower increases in corporate costs, Zhu Hong of the statistics bureau said in a statement accompanying the data, adding that better margins in equipment manufacturing and the coal sector attributed to the bulk of the increase. 
Moreover, profits in high-tech manufacturing and emerging industries both turned positive in May after declining the month before. 
""The modest pick-up in high-tech industry might suggest the effect of value-added tax (VAT) cuts is kicking in,"" said Lu Ting, chief China economist at Nomura.
Ting noted, however, that the rebound was still relatively weak and was likely to be short-lived as the trade war drags on.
Leaders from both countries will meet in Japan on Saturday to see if they can get trade negotiations back on track after talks broke down in May.
U.S. President Donald Trump said on Wednesday that a trade deal with Chinese President Xi Jinping was possible this weekend but he is prepared to impose U.S. tariffs on virtually all remaining Chinese imports if the two countries continue to disagree.
TECH WAR
Even if further tariff action is suspended, worries are growing that the trade standoff with the United States is morphing into a technology war that will put more strain on China's higher-value manufacturing.
Washington last month effectively banned U.S. firms from doing business with Huawei Technologies, the world's largest telecoms network gear maker, citing national security concerns. Many governments and tech companies around the world have fallen in line with the U.S. curbs.
While China's overall tech industry profits rose last month, earnings for telecommunications and electronic equipment manufacturers, which are more vulnerable to U.S. tariffs than other product classes, declined 13.0% in Jan-May.
Producer price inflation, one gauge of industrial profitability, has been easing since early 2017. It slowed to 0.6% in May, while industrial output growth unexpectedly cooled to a 17-year low of 5%.
To support the economy and spur domestic demand, policymakers have stepped up approvals for big infrastructure projects, freed up more funds for lending and cut taxes. The People's Bank of China (PBOC) has slashed banks' reserve requirement ratios six times since early 2018, with further cuts expected in coming months. 
The biggest share of profits was still dominated by upstream sectors in January-May, seeing faster growth. 
China's crude steel output hit a record high in May, even as a jump in prices of raw materials, particularly iron ore, cut into mills' profit margins.
Steel demand from downstream sectors in China has turned ""very strong"", Singapore-based data analytics company Tivlon Technologies said this week.
But a continued crackdown on air pollution has weighed on smokestack industries. The country's top steelmaking city of Tangshan last week summoned 48 companies and ordered them to trim output to reduce smog.
Profits at China's state-owned industrial firms were down 9.7% on an annual basis for the first five months, according to the statistics bureau. 
Liabilities of industrial firms rose 5.3% year-on-year as of end-May versus a 5.5% increase by end-April.
Private sector profits rose 6.6% in Jan-May, from 4.1 percent in the first four months.

Vacancy rate was unchanged in the quarter at 4.7% from the year earlier.
Existing home sales have fluctuated a bit in 2019, but at higher levels than at the end of 2018, Reis said.
""With construction slowing as soon as later this year and throughout 2020 for many major markets, continuing robust demand for rentals will likely manifest in vacancy rates that stay well in the 4s, or at most, rise to the low 5s,"" the research firm added.

Both net absorption and new construction fell about 47% in the second quarter to 36,052 units and 38,693 units, respectively.

1035,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 26, 2019 12:43PM ET</span>",Boeing looms large over struggling U.S. manufacturing sector,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - New orders for long-lasting U.S.-made goods fell for a second straight month in May as troubles at Boeing (NYSE:BA) weighed on demand for aircraft, suggesting manufacturing could remain weak even as business spending on equipment appears to stabilize.
The report from the Commerce Department on Wednesday added to a raft of weak data on trade, consumer confidence, housing and employment growth that have indicated a sharp loss of momentum in economic activity in the second quarter. 
The economy, which will celebrate a record 10 years of expansion next month, is losing speed amid an ebb in both business and consumer confidence in the wake of an escalation in trade tensions between the United States and China. 
Momentum is also fizzling as the stimulus from last year's $1.5 trillion tax cut package and more government spending fades. The growing risks to the economy coupled with low inflation prompted the Federal Reserve to last week signal interest rate cuts starting as early as July. 
""We see the potential for further weakness as the factory sector continues to face a confluence of headwinds including sluggish global growth, rising trade uncertainty, an inventory glut and Boeing's travails,"" said Lydia Boussour, a senior U.S. economist at Oxford Economics in New York. 
Orders for durable goods, items ranging from toasters to aircraft that are meant to last three years or more, dropped 1.3% last month after declining 2.8% in April, the government said. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast durable goods orders would slip 0.1 percent in May. 
Orders for transportation equipment tumbled 4.6% after diving 7.6% in April. That reflected a 28.2% plunge in orders for non-defense aircraft. Civilian aircraft orders plummeted 39.3% in April. 
Boeing reported on its website that it had received no aircraft orders in May after getting orders for four planes in April. The world's largest plane maker has cut production of its fastest-selling MAX 737 jetliner, which was grounded in March following two fatal plane crashes in five months. 
Deliveries of the plane have also been suspended, leading to a 1.4% drop in aircraft shipments in May. Aircraft inventories surged 2.5% last month. The problems at Boeing also are contributing to an undercutting of production at factories.
Manufacturing, which accounts for about 12% of the economy, is also being undermined by an inventory overhang, especially in the automobile industry, which has resulted in fewer orders being placed with factories. Motor vehicles orders rebounded 0.6% in May, leaving the bulk of April's 3.2% drop intact. 
Slowing global growth and the lingering effects of the dollar's strength last year against the currencies of the United States' trade partners also are hobbling activity. 
Overall durable goods shipments rose 0.4% and inventories increased 0.5% in May. Unfilled durable goods orders fell 0.5 percent, the most since June 2016, pointing to continued weakness in manufacturing in the months ahead. Regional manufacturing surveys have also weakened in June.
The dollar was largely flat against a basket of currencies, while U.S. Treasury prices were trading lower. Stocks on Wall Street rose.
RAYS OF HOPE
There are some glimmers of hope for manufacturing. Orders for non-defense capital goods excluding aircraft, a closely watched proxy for business spending plans, increased 0.4% last month amid increases in demand for machinery, and computers and electronic products. These so-called core capital goods orders dropped 1.0% in April.
Shipments of core capital goods increased 0.7% last month after an upwardly revised 0.4% gain in the prior month. Core capital goods shipments are used to calculate equipment spending in the government's gross domestic product measurement.
They were previously reported to have been unchanged in April. Business spending on equipment contracted in the first quarter for the first time in three years. 
Fed Chairman Jerome Powell last Wednesday acknowledged the weak business spending and said many policymakers ""cited the investment picture and weaker business sentiment ... as supporting their judgment that the risk of less favorable outcomes has risen.""
""While core capital goods orders suggest businesses are not fully retrenching as they await clarity on trade and contend with slowing growth abroad, equipment spending still looks set to contract this quarter,"" said Sarah House, a senior economist at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) Securities in Charlotte, North Carolina. 
Slowing growth in the second quarter was also underscored by another report from the Commerce Department on Wednesday showing the goods trade deficit widened 5.1% to $74.5 billion in May as an increase in imports offset a rise in exports.
Following the reports, the Atlanta Fed trimmed its GDP growth estimate for the second quarter by one-tenth of a percentage point to a 1.9% annualized rate. The economy grew at a 3.1% rate in the first quarter, boosted by a spurt in exports and an accumulation of inventories.
Last month, imports of goods increased $7.8 billion to $214.7 billion, boosted by a surge in imports of motor vehicles, capital goods, industrial supplies and consumer goods. Exports of goods rose $4.1 billion to $140.2 billion last month. There were increases in exports of food, motor vehicles, consumer and capital goods.

The wider goods trade deficit will likely subtract from GDP growth in the second quarter. The government also said inventories rose 0.4% in May and stocks at retailers gained 0.5%. The pace of inventory accumulation is slowing from earlier this year. Inventories are expected to be a drag on second-quarter GDP growth.

Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell last week acknowledged the weak business spending and said many policymakers ""cited the investment picture and weaker business sentiment ... as supporting their judgment that the risk of less favorable outcomes has risen.""
As a result of these growing risks to the economy, especially related to the trade war between Washington and Beijing, and low inflation, the U.S. central bank last Wednesday signaled interest rate cuts starting as early as July.
The weak business spending is weighing on production at factories. Manufacturing, which accounts for about 12% of the economy, is also being undermined by an inventory overhang, especially in the automobile industry, which has resulted in fewer orders being placed with factories.
A slowing global economy and Boeing's move to cut production of its troubled 737 MAX aircraft is also hurting manufacturing.
In May, orders for machinery rose 0.7%. Orders for computers and electronic products increased 0.8%. There was also an increase in orders for primary metals. Orders for electrical equipment, appliances and components fell 0.4%.
Overall orders for durable goods, items ranging from toasters to aircraft that are meant to last three years or more, dropped 1.3% in May after declining 2.8% in the prior month.

WELLINGTON (Reuters) - New Zealand's central bank held interest rates steady on Wednesday but said further cuts to borrowing costs may be needed given growing economic risks at home and abroad.
The Reserve Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ) kept the official cash rate (OCR) at a record low of 1.50%, as expected, and in a strikingly dovish statement warned that a global slowdown is hurting the domestic economy amid intensifying trade risks. 
""The global economic outlook has weakened, and downside risks related to trade activity have intensified,"" the RBNZ said. 
""Given the downside risks around the employment and inflation outlook, a lower OCR may be needed,"" it said, having lowered the cash rate by 25 basis points at the last meeting in May.
The dovish statement mirrored a recent shift by global central banks to ease monetary policy to combat rising economic risks as a year-long Sino-U.S. tariff war dents trade, corporate profits and overall growth.
""Given the tone of this statement from the RBNZ, we remain of the view that the RBNZ will most likely cut the OCR in August,"" said Westpac Chief Economist Dominick Stephens.
""The repeated comment that a lower OCR may be needed is blunter than the language used in March, which was followed by a cut in May,"" he said.
Markets imply around a 63% chance of a reduction to 1.25% at the central bank's next meeting on August 7, and are wagering heavily on 1% by year end.
Minutes of the RBNZ review released along with the statement showed policymakers discussed whether to cut at the meeting and decided that more monetary easing was ""likely to be necessary"" over time.
Last week both the U.S. Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank reversed course and opened the door to new stimulus, while the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) has said it's likely to ease again to follow up from its cut earlier this month.
The New Zealand dollar was largely unchanged, rising just 0.2% to $0.6646 after the rates decision.
GLOBAL RISKS
In its statement the RBNZ said it expected inflation to rise to the 2 percent mid-point of its target range, and employment to remain near its maximum sustainable level, but didn't give a time frame. 
Sino-U.S. trade tensions as well as softening domestic housing and immigration growth have put pressure on New Zealand's economy.
A slowdown in China, New Zealand's biggest export market, is a key concern for policymakers, just as it is for many other nations whose economic fortunes are closely linked to the Asian giant. 
Dairy exports, particularly to China, helped push New Zealand's exports higher in May.
""The weaker global economy is affecting New Zealand through a range of trade, financial, and confidence channels,"" the central bank said. 
It said the softer house prices and subdued business sentiment continue to dampen domestic spending.
Indeed, while gross domestic product growth figures released last week topped expectations, the broad picture highlighted a soft underbelly. 
The Treasury department last month cut its GDP growth forecast to 2.1% for the 12-months ending June 30, from the 2.9% expansion predicted in December.

""Upside risks to inflation and employment are becoming few and far between,"" ANZ analysts said in a note to clients, tipping rate cuts in August and November.

A new Bankrate survey of more than 1,000 U.S. consumers found 39% believe the economy is “not so good” or “poor.” A sample of financial experts, in comparison, all rated the economy as “good” or “excellent.” The survey was conducted via telephone May 21-26, with a margin of error of less than 4%, according to Bankrate.
Lower-income Americans are simply not doing as well as macro indicators suggest, said Julia Coronado, an associate professor of finance at the University of Texas at Austin and one of the nine experts surveyed. “There’s growing inequality,” she said. “Even though the data show that low-wage earners are getting more raises recently, they’ve endured years of high unemployment and stagnant wages. So a couple of years with a few wage gains isn’t really changing their perception of their economic situation.”
Many Americans are ill-equipped for another recession, the survey found. Half said they’re not comfortable with their emergency funds, and 28% said they have no emergency savings at all. Only 18% said they have enough money to cover six months of expenses, the lowest number in the poll’s nine-year history.
“Saving is a luxury,” said Coronado. “It’s not that people who are at the lower end of the earnings spectrum are living extravagant lives or living irresponsibly, they are just simply constrained and paying their bills.”
It’s easy to understand why so many Americans are pessimistic, she said. “There’s a long shadow from the Great Recession. People are still fearful of going back to that kind of a downturn.”

1039,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jun 25, 2019 10:50PM ET</span>","In Southeast Asia, Trade War Is Curbing Imports as Well","(Bloomberg) -- A slump in Southeast Asian exports amid a worsening U.S.-China trade war is having a knock-on effect on imports.
Given the high import content of manufactured goods, purchases from abroad have slid along with the plunge in exports from four emerging Southeast Asian economies and South Korea. That in turn will cut investment and growth in those countries, Reza Siregar and Yuanliu Hu, economists at the Institute of International Finance, said in a research note.
The hardest-hit will be South Korea and Thailand, where capital imports have dropped the most. Growth in those economies is seen weakening this year to 2.1% and 3.4% respectively, the economists said.
Besides South Korea and Thailand, the IIF included Indonesia, Malaysia and the Philippines in its analysis. The Philippines was the only country in the group where both export and import volumes have increased.
Weaker import growth will also result in stronger current account positions this year, most notably in Thailand and Malaysia, the IIF said.
“The risks for further growth slowdowns remain amid escalating global trade uncertainties, especially if cutbacks in investment persist,” the IIF said.
Oxford Economics Ltd. has also lowered its growth forecast for Southeast Asia amid escalating trade tensions. The region’s economy is seen weakening to 4.8% this year and 4.7% in 2020 from 5.3% last year, Oxford’s lead Asia economist Sian Fenner said in a note. Singapore, Malaysia, and Thailand are most exposed to global trade in a region that has particularly high export orientation and strong trade integration with China, she said.
The economies will be partly helped by monetary policy easing and supportive domestic demand, though interest-rate accommodation will have to be only moderate due to high debt levels and vulnerability to international outflows, Fenner said.

1040,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 25, 2019 01:29PM ET</span>","U.S. consumer confidence dives, trade tensions hurting economy","By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. consumer confidence tumbled to a 21-month low in June as households grew a bit more pessimistic about business and labor market conditions amid concerns about a recent escalation in trade tensions between the United States and China.
The economy's prospects were further dimmed by other data on Tuesday showing sales of new single-family homes unexpectedly fell for a second straight month in May. Growing risks to the economy, especially related to the trade war between Washington and Beijing, and low inflation prompted the Federal Reserve last week to signal interest rate cuts beginning as early as July. 
""The headwinds from the ongoing trade war the economy faces are definitely growing stronger, and it will be a miracle if Fed officials can pull a rabbit out of their hats and keep the economy moving forward,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG in New York.
The Conference Board said its consumer confidence index dropped 9.8 points to a reading of 121.5 this month, the lowest since September 2017, from a downwardly revised 131.3 in May.
This month's drop in the index was the largest since July 2015. The index, which was previously reported at 134.1 in May, still remains at lofty levels, suggesting consumer spending remains supported. 
The Conference Board blamed the decline on the trade tensions and cautioned that continued uncertainty ""at some point, could even begin to diminish consumers' confidence in the expansion."" The economy will mark 10 years of growth next month, the longest expansion on record.
President Donald Trump last month imposed additional tariffs of up to 25% on $200 billion of Chinese goods, prompting retaliation by Beijing. Trump has threatened more duties on Chinese imports if no deal is reached at a Group of 20 nations summit this week in Japan.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the consumer confidence index at 131.1 in June.
The Conference Board survey showed a decrease in the share of consumers with a favorable assessment of business conditions this month. The survey's so-called labor market differential, derived from data about respondents who think jobs are hard to get and those who think jobs are plentiful, fell to a one-year low of 27.6% in June from 33.5% in May. 
That measure closely correlates to the unemployment rate in the Labor Department's employment report. 
""The rolling-over that we are seeing here in jobs plentiful is worryingly reminiscent of what we have seen late in prior cycles,"" said Tim Quinlan, a senior economist at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) Securities in Charlotte, North Carolina. ""If past patterns hold, without a turnaround in this series, job growth could slow in coming months.""
The economy created 75,000 jobs in May, a sharp step-down from 224,00 in April. Last month's tepid job gains were largely viewed as an anomaly, given that a key labor market indicator, weekly claims for unemployment benefits, remains low.
Job growth has averaged 164,000 per month this year compared to 223,000 in 2018. The pace of job gains, however, remains well above the roughly 100,000 needed per month to keep up with growth in the working age population. The unemployment rate is hovering near a 50-year low of 3.6%.
The dollar was trading higher against a basket of currencies, while U.S. Treasury prices were mixed. Stocks on Wall Street were trading lower.
WEAK HOME SALES
Gross domestic product growth estimates for the second quarter are ranging from a 1.5% to 2.4% annualized rate. The economy grew at a 3.1% rate in the first quarter. 
Slowing growth was underscored by a separate report from the Commerce Department on Tuesday showing new home sales dropped 7.8% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 626,000 units in May, the lowest in five months. April's sales pace was revised up to 679,000 units from the previously reported 673,000 units.
Economists had forecast new home sales, which account for about 10.5% of housing market sales, rising 1.9% to a pace of 680,000 units in May. New home sales are drawn from permits and tend to be volatile on a month-to-month basis. Sales fell 3.7% from a year ago.
The housing market has remained sluggish even as mortgage rates have dropped, with builders continuing to complain about land and labor shortages. Tariffs on Chinese imports are also worrying homebuilders. 
 Lennar  Corp (NYSE:LEN), the No.2 U.S. homebuilder, said on Tuesday the impact of tariffs on Chinese goods resulted in a headwind of about $500 per home on average during its second quarter, which ended on May 31. 
Overall, housing data have been mixed. Reports last week showed single-family starts dropped in May, but building permits for this market segment rebounded after five straight monthly declines and home resales rose solidly. Sentiment among builders dipped in June. 
A third report on Tuesday showed the S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller composite index of home prices in 20 metropolitan areas rose 2.5% in April on a year-over-year basis after increasing 2.6% in March. House price inflation has been slowing after last year's surge in mortgage rates dampened demand for housing.
""A slowing economy will constrain housing demand, and that implies house price growth will continue to ease to around 2% year-on-year by the end of this year,"" said Matthew Pointon, property economist at Capital Economics in New York.

""We doubt lower interest rates means housing demand will continue to climb. After all, home-buying sentiment is subdued and banks are no longer loosening lending standards.""

(Reuters) - U.S. June consumer confidence fell more than expected, hitting its lowest level since September 2017, according to a private sector report released on Tuesday.
The Conference Board, an industry group, said its index of consumer attitudes fell to 121.5, from a downwardly revised 131.3 the month before. The 58 economists polled by Reuters had expected a reading of 131.1.

The Commerce Department said on Tuesday new home sales dropped 7.8% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 626,000 units last month, the lowest level since December. April's sales pace was revised up to 679,000 units from the previously reported 673,000 units.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast new home sales, which account for about 10.5% of housing market sales, would rise 1.9% to a pace of 680,000 units in May. 
New home sales are drawn from permits and tend to be volatile on a month-to-month basis. Sales fell 3.7% from a year ago. 
The median new house price declined 2.7% from a year ago to $308,000 in May.
The housing market has remained sluggish even as mortgage rate have dropped, with builders continuing to complain about land and labor shortages. Housing data have been mixed.
Reports last week showed single-family starts dropped in May, but building permits for this market segment rose after five straight monthly declines and home resales rose solidly. Sentiment among builders dipped in June. 
The 30-year fixed mortgage rate has tumbled to around 3.84% from near an eight-year high of 4.94% in November. Further declines are likely after the Federal Reserve last week signaled interest rate cuts beginning as early as July because of growing risks to the economy and low inflation.
The housing market has been a drag on economic growth for five straight quarters.
New home sales in the South, which accounts for the bulk of transactions, jumped 4.9% in May to the highest level since July 2007. Sales in the Midwest rose 6.3%. But sales plunged 35.9% in the West and tumbled 17.6% in the Northeast.

There were 333,000 new homes on the market last month, up 0.3% from April. At May's sales pace it would take 6.4 months to clear the supply of houses on the market, up from 5.9 months in April. About two-thirds of the houses sold last month were either under construction or yet to be built.

The Confederation of British Industry's monthly retail sales balance fell to -42 from -27 in May, below all forecasts in a Reuters poll that had pointed to an improved reading of -10.
The CBI said the sharp fall should be taken with a pinch of salt, given the survey asked retailers to compare sales with a year ago when hot weather and England's unexpectedly strong showing in the men's soccer World Cup boosted sales.
Nonetheless, the survey echoed other data that have suggested the economy has slowed sharply in the second quarter after strong growth in early 2019 was fueled by companies stockpiling in advance of the original Brexit deadline in March.
Until now, consumers have largely taken Brexit in their stride, helped by stable inflation and stronger growth in wages. But official data last week showed cold weather in May prompted the biggest drop in retail sales this year.
""This looks to be a poor CBI distributive sales survey for June, it heightens belief that consumer spending has been markedly softer in the second quarter,"" economist Howard Archer from the EY ITEM Club consultancy said. ""Indeed, we suspect that GDP may well contract slightly in the second quarter.""
Other economists said the CBI survey has been volatile and this month's sample size of 45 retailers was smaller than usual.
""The decline in the reported sales balance to its lowest level since March 2009 is not a convincing sign of an emerging consumer downturn,"" Samuel Tombs from Pantheon Economics consultancy said.

Still, the survey's gauge of expected sales for July fell to -11 from +7 for June, marking its lowest level since August 2016.

Companies signed up for $9.1 billion in new loans, leases and lines of credit last month, up from $7.7 billion a year earlier. Borrowings rose 3% from the previous month.
""The continued low interest rate environment, coupled with solid fundamentals in the U.S. economy, provide incentive for U.S. businesses to expand and grow their operations,"" ELFA Chief Executive Officer Ralph Petta said.
""However, at the same time, we notice a slight deterioration in credit quality, which bears monitoring,"" Petta said, adding that the Federal Reserve and analysts have raised concerns over potential storm clouds on the economic horizon.
Washington-based ELFA, which reports economic activity for the $1 trillion equipment finance sector, said credit approvals totaled 75.9%, down from 76.8% in April.
ELFA's leasing and finance index measures the volume of commercial equipment financed in the United States. It is designed to complement the U.S. Commerce Department's durable goods orders report, which it typically precedes by a few days.

1046,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 24, 2019 07:36AM ET</span>",German business sentiment lowest since 2014: Ifo,"By Joseph Nasr
BERLIN (Reuters) - German business morale fell to its lowest level since November 2014 in June, a survey showed on Monday, adding weight to expectations that Europe's largest economy contracted in the second quarter.
The Ifo institute said its business climate index deteriorated for the third month in a row, to 97.4 in June from 97.9 in May. That was slightly above a consensus forecast for 97.2.
""The German economy is heading for the doldrums,"" Ifo President Clemens Fuest said, adding that the business climate in both the manufacturing and services sectors had worsened.
After nine successive years of growth, the German economy is struggling as trade disputes and a cooling world economy hurt its export-dependent manufacturers and as Britain's delayed exit from the European Union creates uncertainties. 
The Bundesbank said this month it expects the economy to contract slightly in the second quarter after an expansion of 0.4% between January and March. The government has halved its 2019 growth forecast to 0.5% after an expansion of 1.5% in 2018, the weakest rate in five years.
Ifo economist Klaus Wohlrabe said the trade conflict between the United States and China was the main source of uncertainty for German businesses, which rely on exports to the world's two largest economies for growth.
He said he did not expect a recession, a view also held by analysts.
""All told, we expect the German economy to slow to little more than a crawl in the second quarter,"" Christina Iacovides of Capital Economics wrote in a note.
'FEAR OF LOSING'
An index measuring managers' assessment of their current situation rose slightly while another gauging expectations fell to its lowest level since February.
That suggested the slump in the headline reading to levels not seen since the euro zone debt crisis was driven by concerns that trade conflicts between the United States and both China and the European Union could worsen and further dampen exports.
""Fear of losing. This is the best summary of the current state of Germany's businesses,"" Carsten Brzeski of ING wrote in a note. 
The services sector, buoyed by a solid domestic economy, has been providing impetus as industry shrinks, but some economists fear the recession in the manufacturing sector could spread.
The economy has been relying on private consumption for growth, a cycle supported by a robust labor market, low interest rates and rising wages. Separate data published on Monday showed that real wages rose at a slower pace in the first quarter, however, which could dampen Germans' appetite to spend. [L8N23V1W5]
Brzeski said he expected the services sector to continue providing impetus for the broader economy and that the slowdown in the manufacturing sector would bottom out.
The European Central Bank's decision not to raise interest rates in the next year and to open the door to cutting them or buying more bonds could cement the status of consumption as the main growth driver in Germany, he added.
""A bottoming-out is in sight for German industry,"" Brzeski said. ""The recent u-turn of the ECB toward more dovishness indicates that financing conditions for new domestic investments will remain favorable. However, let's be clear, a bottoming out is still far from being a strong rebound.""

1047,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 23, 2019 07:15PM ET</span>",UK consumer spending growth in 2019 to be slowest in six years: EY ITEM Club,"LONDON (Reuters) - Britain will see the slowest growth in consumer spending in 2019 in six years, piling even more pressure on retailers, EY ITEM Club forecast on Monday.
It said it expects spending to rise by 1.6% over last year, although that would be faster than an estimated 1.3% growth in the broader UK economy in 2019.
Consumer spending benefited from robust employment growth and a strong pick-up in real earnings growth in the second half of 2018 and early 2019 but the outlook was now weaker, the economic forecasting group said.
""The improvement in purchasing power has meant that consumers have been significantly less affected in their spending decisions than businesses by uncertainties over the economy and Brexit,"" said Howard Archer, chief economic advisor to the EY ITEM Club, which produces quarterly UK economic forecasts.
""While consumer confidence in late 2018/early 2019 weakened to the lowest level since mid-2013, perceptions of personal finances and a willingness to spend generally held up much better than views of the economy.""
The forecaster, which is sponsored by business consultancy EY, said it suspected earnings growth peaked in early 2019. It was likely to remain modestly below that level over the rest of 2019 and possibly beyond.
It said strength in the labor market would increasingly fray over the coming months as companies tailored their behavior to a lackluster domestic economy, prolonged Brexit uncertainties, an unsettled domestic political situation and a challenging global environment. 
As a result, it forecast employment growth would slow to 1.0% in 2019 and 0.6% in 2020, from 1.2% in 2018.
Slower growth in consumer spending will add to the pressures high street retailers face from changing shopping habits and more spending moving online.
Debenhams and Marks & Spencer have announced store closures, while Philip Green's Topshop-to-Dorothy Perkins fashion empire staved off a collapse into administration this month, as retailers struggle with rising labor costs, business property taxes and growing online competition.
EY head of UK retail Julie Carlyle said despite consumer spending comparing favorably to other parts of the economy, it was far weaker than it has been in previous years. 
""Retailers are therefore fighting for a shrinking piece of the pie and this is reflected in the recent turbulence on British high streets,"" she said.

""And, while the economy won't deliver retailers growth, they will have to find it from other areas and this means having a strong understanding of their customers.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. manufacturing activity barely grew in early June and the service sector cooled, signs that President Donald Trump's trade war with China could be weighing on the economy.
Other economic data released on Friday showed a rise in home resales during May, suggesting the Federal Reserve was seeing dividends from its efforts to avert a recession by keeping interest rates low.
While many indicators still point to a healthy economy, Fed policymakers are increasingly concerned that the 10-year economic expansion could be in danger.
Data firm IHS Markit said its U.S. manufacturing purchasing managers index (PMI) declined to a reading of 50.1 in early June, the lowest level since September 2009. A reading above 50 indicates growth in the manufacturing sector, which accounts for about 12% of the U.S. economy.
The data firm's PMI for the U.S. services sector dropped to 50.7, the lowest since February 2016. Both the manufacturing and the service sector readings were below expectations of analysts polled by Reuters.
""It is likely that the news on trade policy has weighed on business sentiment and activity,"" Daniel Silver, an economist at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM), said in a note to clients.
The U.S.-China trade war began last year and escalated last month after Trump, who has vowed to rebalance the global trading system in favor of the United States, raised tariffs on $200 billion in Chinese imports.
China, one of the top U.S. trading partners, responded by increasing its tariffs on a revised $60 billion list of U.S. goods.
Trump has threatened to slap tariffs on another $300 billion in Chinese imports if Beijing doesn't agree to a trade deal soon. He has said he plans to meet Chinese President Xi Jinping next week at a Group of 20 nations summit in Japan.
All three major U.S. stock indexes were trading in a tight range on Friday as investors focused on a report that U.S. Vice President Mike Pence had said there were signs of progress with China on trade.
The trade tensions are widely believed to have been a factor in the Fed's policy shift this week. Fresh projections released with the latest policy statement on Wednesday showed nearly half of Fed policymakers expect to cut interest rates this year. 
Fed Chairman Jerome Powell told reporters on Wednesday that business uncertainty had risen since May, and that the Fed would act promptly if needed to keep the economy growing.
In early June, some two-thirds of all manufacturers attributed some or all of their raw material cost increases to tariffs during the month, said IHS Markit economist Chris Williamson, referring to the details of his firm's surveys of purchasing managers.
The Fed already had made clear earlier this year that it was pausing the rate-hike campaign it began in 2015.
That led to a drop in mortgage interest rates.

Resales of U.S. homes rose 2.5% in May to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.34 million units, the National Association of Realtors reported on Friday.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. home sales rose in May, boosted by lower interest rates for mortgages, giving a positive signal for the health of the U.S. economy.
The National Association of Realtors said on Friday existing home sales increased 2.5% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.34 million units last month. April's sales pace was revised slightly higher to 5.21 million.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast existing home sales rising to a rate of 5.25 million units in May. Existing home sales, which make up about 90 percent of U.S. home sales, dropped 1.1% from a year ago. That was the 15th straight year-on-year decrease in home sales.
Demand this years is being fueled by lower mortgage rates, which have dropped since the Fed suspended its three-year monetary policy tightening campaign. The Fed said this week that nearly half of its policymakers expect rate cuts this year due to concerns about the economic outlook.
The 30-year fixed mortgage rate has dropped to an average of 3.84% from more than a seven-year peak of about 4.94% in November, according to data from mortgage finance agency Freddie Mac.

The NAR said last year's revamp of the U.S. tax code, which reduced the amount of mortgage-interest payments homeowners could deduct, was hurting sales of homes priced $1 million and above.

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain posted a larger-than-expected budget deficit last month as government spending rose, a reminder that the next finance minister may have limited options to cushion any Brexit blow to the economy.
The budget deficit widened to 5.115 billion pounds ($6.48 billion), the Office for National Statistics said on Friday, a 23% rise from May 2018 and above all forecasts in a Reuters poll of economists.
For the first two months of the 2019/20 financial year, the deficit was 18% larger than a year earlier at just under 12 billion pounds.
Britain's official budget forecasters have predicted an increase in government borrowing this year after a steady decline in the deficit from around 10% of economic output in 2010 to just above 1% last year.
""The higher than expected borrowing figures over the first two months of the financial year highlight the strain that a slowing economy could place on the UK's public finances in the months ahead,"" said Pablo Shah, senior economist at the Centre for Economics and Business research consultancy.
Other economists said the data may have been affected by one-off factors, such as a rise in government investment.
""May's public finance data are not a sign that the economy is losing momentum,"" economist Samuel Tombs from Pantheon Macroeconomics said.
The ONS raised its estimate for borrowing in the 2018/19 financial year to 24.0 billion pounds, up from a previous 23.5 billion-pound forecast, pushing further above finance minister Philip Hammond's missed target of 22.8 billion pounds.
Government spending in May rose 2.6% compared with a year ago, driven mostly by the purchase of goods and services. 
Growth in tax receipts was mostly solid, but corporation tax revenue edged down last month by 0.8% -- the first annual decline for any May since 2013.
Hammond this week ramped up his warnings to whoever becomes Britain's next prime minister that a no-deal Brexit would wipe out the money he has set aside for potential increases in public spending or tax cuts, which would represent an end to the austerity policies of much of the last decade.
Both candidates to replace Theresa May as prime minister -- former foreign secretary Boris Johnson and his successor, Jeremy Hunt -- have said they are prepared to take Britain out of the European Union without a transition agreement if necessary.

Most political commentators think Hammond would be replaced if Johnson, the frontrunner in the race to succeed May, wins.

1052,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 21, 2019 05:39AM ET</span>",Euro zone business growth stayed weak in June as optimism wanes,"By Jonathan Cable
LONDON (Reuters) - Euro zone business activity picked up a touch this month but worries about slowing global growth and the impact of spreading trade conflict meant firms were at their least optimistic in nearly five years, a survey showed.
Activity was at its strongest since November but it was unbalanced, with manufacturing activity contracting for a fifth month, overshadowing a small uptick in the services industry.
The downbeat showing comes just days after European Central Bank President Mario Draghi signaled one of the biggest policy reversals of his eight-year tenure and said the Bank would ease policy again if inflation failed to accelerate.
Despite years of ultra-loose monetary policy, prices have failed to rise as fast as the ECB wants, while a slew of recent data have suggested growth is slowing.
IHS Markit's Flash Composite Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI), which is considered a good guide to economic health, only nudged up to 52.1 this month from a final May reading of 51.8, beating the median expectation in a Reuters poll for 51.8.
Earlier figures from the bloc's two biggest economies, Germany and France, remained weak but surprised on the upside, offering a boost to European equities.
""The small improvement in the flash PMIs for June will not be enough to deflect the ECB from its new plan to ease policy within the coming months,"" said Andrew Kenningham, chief Europe economist at Capital Economics.
Kenningham reckons the ECB will formally strengthen its forward guidance next month and then cut the deposit rate by 10 basis points to -0.5% in September.
A Reuters poll last month, taken before Draghi's comments, found no prospect of the ECB raising interest rates through to the end of 2020 and that its next policy move would be to tweak its forward guidance towards more accommodation. 
MISMATCH
IHS Markit said the PMI pointed to GDP growth of just over 0.2% this quarter, below the 0.3% predicted in the Reuters poll. 
Firms in the bloc's dominant service industry staged a modest upturn, with that PMI rising to 53.4 from May's 52.9, ahead of expectations for no change.
But manufacturing activity contracted again. The factory PMI held well below the 50 mark separating growth from contraction, registering 47.8 compared to last month's 47.7 and missing expectations for 48.0.
An index measuring output, which feeds into the composite PMI, dipped to 48.8 from 48.9.
""The dichotomy between services and manufacturing is only getting larger. The big question remains for how long this can continue,"" said Bert Colijn, a senior economist at ING. 
Demand declined for a ninth month, and factories were running down backlogs of work to stay active, as they have since September. The new orders sub-index held steady at May's 46.6.
As demand also remained weak for services, firms there barely increased headcount this month. The employment index fell to 53.8 from 54.0.
With forward-looking indicators painting a downbeat picture, optimism waned. The composite future output PMI fell to 58.7 from 59.8, its lowest reading since October 2014.
Purchasing managers were concerned about weakening global growth, trade conflict, dampened demand conditions and rising geopolitical risks, IHS Markit said.

The United States has hit the European Union with tariffs and threatened more. On Tuesday, U.S. President Donald Trump criticized Draghi's comments that further monetary policy changes may be needed by the ECB, saying it would spark unfair European competition against the United States.

1054,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 20, 2019 07:55PM ET</span>","Japan's core consumer inflation slows in May, keeps pressure on BOJ","By Leika Kihara
TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's core consumer prices rose 0.8% in May from a year earlier, data showed on Friday, keeping the central bank under pressure to maintain or even expand its massive stimulus program to achieve its elusive 2 percent inflation target.
The increase in the core consumer price index, which includes oil products but excludes volatile fresh food costs, matched a median market forecast and slowed from a 0.9% gain in April.
The data highlights the challenge the Bank of Japan faces in spurring inflation toward its 2 percent target, as trade frictions and slowing global growth cloud the outlook for the world's third-largest economy.
The so-called core-core CPI, which strips away the effects of volatile food and energy costs and is closely watched by the BOJ to gauge how much the economy's strength has translated into price gains, was up 0.5% in May from a year earlier.
The central bank has already conceded that it will take time to achieve its price target, stressing that it will ease policy further only if risks threaten to derail Japan's recovery.
The economy is holding up for now, expanding by an annualized 2.1% in the first quarter as the non-manufacturing sector maintains its pace on investment, tempering the gloom in the export sector, which more vulnerable to external headwinds.
But many analysts predict growth to slow in coming quarters as the U.S.-China tariff row hurts global trade. A scheduled sales tax hike in October may also curb consumption, they warn.

A downturn in consumer and business spending could cast doubt on the BOJ's argument that a sustained economic recovery will gradually prod firms to boost prices and wages, helping inflation accelerate.

Britain attracted 112 foreign direct investment (FDI) projects in 2018 - with 27% from the United States - well ahead of Germany in second place with 81 projects, EY said, giving no monetary value to total investments.
London, Europe's biggest financial center, recorded 86 FDI projects, the most of any European city, and up from 47 in 2017.
Investor sentiment for the longer-term has fallen to an all-time low as continued uncertainty over Brexit takes its toll, EY said.
Nearly half of the 68 senior executives, chairs and presidents of financial firms in Britain and abroad polled by EY believe that Britain's attractiveness will fall over the next three years.
""The main concerns investors have over the UK's future prospects are loss of access to EU markets and restrictions on labor mobility,"" EY said.
Investments in Europe overall reached 421 projects in 2018, the highest in a decade, EY said.
""This is in part a reflection of the market's fragmentation as firms looked to set up a second EU headquarter in advance of Brexit,"" EY said.
This could also explain why British investment in overseas projects rose 15% in 2018 to 62, the highest in a decade, with France the leading recipient, followed by Germany and Ireland, EY said.
Banks, insurers and asset managers using London as a gateway to the EU have opened hubs in Paris, Frankfurt and Dublin to avoid disruption to customers from Brexit.

EY said that 76% of global financial services investors were not changing their investment plans in Britain following the UK vote to leave the EU.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The number of Americans filing applications for unemployment benefits fell more than expected last week, pointing to underlying labor market strength despite a sharp slowdown in job growth in May.
But the outlook for the economy continues to darken. Other data on Thursday showed factory activity in the mid-Atlantic region stalled in June, likely reflecting a recent escalation in trade tensions between the United States and China. 
The trade war has increased uncertainty over the U.S. economic outlook, prompting the Federal Reserve on Wednesday to signal it could cut interest rates by as much as half a percentage point over the rest of this year. The U.S. central bank kept rates unchanged on Wednesday.
""Solid labor market conditions supporting a strong consumer sector provides a solid base underneath the economy,"" said Jim Baird, chief investment officer at Plante Moran Financial Advisors in Kalamazoo, Michigan.
Initial claims for state unemployment benefits dropped 6,000 to a seasonally adjusted 216,000 for the week ended June 15, the Labor Department said. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast claims would decrease to 220,000 in the latest week. 
The Labor Department said no states were estimated. The drop in claims followed three straight weekly increases. Claims are being closely watched for signs of a rise in layoffs stemming from the trade dispute.
The four-week moving average of initial claims, considered a better measure of labor market trends as it irons out week-to-week volatility, rose 1,000 to 218,750 last week. 
The claims data covered the survey period for the nonfarm payrolls component of June's employment report. The four-week average of claims was little changed between the May and June survey periods. Still, economists expect payrolls to pick up in June after increasing by 75,000 jobs in May.
Fed Chairman Jerome Powell on Wednesday acknowledged the meager job gains in May and said ""in light of recent developments this bears watching,"" but also noted that ""many labor market indicators remain strong.""
The dollar was trading lower against a basket of currencies as investors digested the Fed's signal that it would ease monetary policy. Stocks on Wall Street rallied, with the S&P 500 index hitting a record intraday high. U.S. Treasury prices rose.
SLOWING ECONOMY
Claims have been roughly flat this year, indicating some easing in labor market conditions. Job growth has cooled from the brisk pace in 2018 in line with the economy, which is slowing as the stimulus from last year's massive tax cuts and increased government spending fades.
""The recent flattening out in the data could be viewed as a negative change in momentum,"" said Daniel Silver, an economist at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) in New York. ""But at least the recent trade developments haven't led to a noticeable increase in filings for unemployment insurance.""
The Atlanta Fed is forecasting gross domestic product will rise at a 2.0% annualized rate in the second quarter. The economy grew at a 3.1% pace in the January-March quarter, boosted by a temporary burst in exports and an accumulation of inventories.
The surge in exports, together with a decline in imports, helped to shrink the current account deficit in the first quarter to $130.4 billion from $143.9 billion in the fourth quarter, the Commerce Department said in a separate report on Thursday.
Exports, however, tumbled in April in response to softening global demand. Weak exports and an inventory overhang, especially in the automotive sector, are hobbling manufacturing.
Bottlenecks in the supply chain resulting from the U.S.-China trade war are also squeezing manufacturing, which accounts for about 12% of the economy.
A third report on Thursday from the Philadelphia Fed showed its business conditions index dropped to a reading of 0.3 in June from 16.6 in May. There were decreases in measures of new orders, employment and shipments. 
A gauge of prices received by manufacturers in the region tumbled to near a three-year low this month. A measure of prices paid by factories was also the lowest in nearly three years. These findings support expectations that inflation will remain muted this year. 
The sharp braking in manufacturing in the region that covers eastern Pennsylvania, southern New Jersey and Delaware was the latest indication that national factory activity continues to slow. A report from the New York Fed earlier this week showed a record plunge in its Empire State manufacturing index to more than a 2-1/2-year low in June.
But there are some rays of hope for manufacturing. The Philadelphia Fed survey's six-month business conditions index rose to a reading of 21.4 this month from 19.7 in May. Its six-month capital expenditures index increased to 28.0 from a reading of 23.3 in the prior month.

""We continue to expect manufacturing reacceleration,"" said Samuel Coffin, an economist at UBS in Stamford, Connecticut. ""Confidence has declined, but we saw signs of an upturn in the last industrial production report.""

The Commerce Department said on Thursday the current account deficit, which measures the flow of goods, services and investments into and out of the country, fell 9.4% to $130.4 billion. 
Data for the fourth quarter was revised to show the deficit widening to $143.9 billion, instead of the previously reported $134.4 billion. The government revised current account data from 2016 through the fourth quarter of 2018. 
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the current account deficit shrinking to $124.6 billion in the first quarter. The current account gap represented 2.5% of gross domestic product in the January-March quarter, down from 2.8% in the fourth quarter.
The deficit on the current account has shrunk from a peak of 6.2 percent of GDP in the fourth quarter of 2005, in part because of a significant increase in the volume of oil exports.
In the first quarter, exports of goods rose 0.6% to $419.3 billion, while imports dropped 2.1% to $635.9 billion.
The flow of foreign profits repatriated by U.S. companies slowed to $100.2 billion in the first quarter from an upwardly revised $146.6 billion in the prior period, reflecting a waning boost from the corporate tax overhaul in January 2018. 

That was still well above pre-tax cut levels, which were typically in the $30-$40 billion range. Earnings were previously reported to have increased by $85.9 billion in the fourth quarter. Earnings repatriation peaked at $294.7 billion in the first quarter of last year.

1061,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 20, 2019 08:02AM ET</span>",Bank of England chops second-quarter growth view as global and Brexit risks intensify,"By Andy Bruce and William Schomberg
LONDON (Reuters) - The Bank of England cut its growth forecast for Britain's economy to zero in the second quarter of 2019 on Thursday and highlighted risks from global trade tensions and growing fears of a no-deal Brexit.
BoE officials voted unanimously to hold interest rates at 0.75%, despite some recent suggestions from a couple of policymakers that borrowing costs should go up sooner rather than later.
The central bank stuck to its message that rates would need to rise in a limited and gradual fashion, assuming Britain can avoid a damaging no-deal Brexit.
But the BoE noted a darkening outlook for the world economy which prompted the European Central Bank, U.S. Federal Reserve and Bank of Japan to signal this week that more stimulus could be on the way.
""Globally, trade tensions have intensified. Domestically, the perceived likelihood of a no-deal Brexit has risen,"" the BoE said in its policy statement.
The central bank also highlighted a growing disconnect between the ""smooth"" Brexit that underpins its forecasts and the market pricing in a much more chaotic exit from the EU that would hurt Britain's economy and probably mean rate cuts.
Sterling dropped against the euro and the U.S. dollar as investors doubled down on bets that rates will not rise in the next couple of years. 
British government bond prices rallied, with September gilt futures jumping by more than 35 ticks to a session high and benchmark 10-year gilt yields falling to the day's low of 0.809%, down more than 5 basis points on the day.
""All things considered, it's slightly more dovish than one might have expected,"" ING economist James Smith said. 
He said the BoE had not stepped up its warnings that the market was underestimating the likelihood of rate rises, despite investors having pushed back their bets on the next BoE hike since May. 
""The fact they are saying the perceived risk of a no-deal Brexit is rising suggests that they ultimately might take a more cautious approach than the rhetoric implied,"" Smith said.
SECOND-QUARTER STAGNATION
The BoE said Britain's economy is now on track to stagnate in the second quarter, rather than grow 0.2% quarter-on-quarter as it predicted last month. It pointed to the likely hangover from rapid stockpiling by companies earlier this year as they scrambled to prepare for the original Brexit deadline in March.
Despite the gloomier outlook for the April-June period, the BoE still expects the British economy to grow in 2019.
But a damaging no-deal Brexit would lead to a big change in the message from the Monetary Policy Committee.
""If there is a no deal then the MPC will probably quickly change its tune and support the economy by cutting interest rates,"" Capital Economics economist Thomas Pugh said.
Former foreign secretary Boris Johnson is the front-runner in the race to succeed Prime Minister Theresa May. He and other contenders have said they are prepared to lead Britain out of the European Union without a deal, if necessary.
The BoE said financial conditions in Britain had loosened since May, which mechanically would feed through into stronger forecasts for economic growth, excess demand and inflation.

But it highlighted a mixed picture for inflation pressures. There are increasing signs that wage growth is leveling off, the BoE said, although the labor market remained tight.

1062,By Investing.com,"<span>Jun 20, 2019 07:00AM ET</span>",Bank of England Keeps Rates Unchanged; Pound Pares Gains,"Investing.com - The Bank of England kept interest rates on hold at 0.75% on Thursday, but stuck to its message that it plans to raise rates despite an ongoing lack of clarity on Brexit.
The vote was unanimous, with all nine policymakers in favor of keeping rates on hold, despite two officials talking recently of the need for higher borrowing costs sooner rather than later.
The bank reiterated its forward guidance that further rate increases were likely to be required “at a gradual pace and to a limited extent”, despite revising down its growth forecast.
The decision was widely expected with most economists forecasting that borrowing costs will remain on hold until it's clear whether and on what terms the U.K. will leave the European Union.
The bank cut its economic growth forecast for the second quarter of this year to zero from 0.2% in May, citing concerns over Brexit uncertainty, the unwinding of stockpiling and ongoing global trade tensions.
“Underlying growth in the U.K. appears to have weakened slightly in the first half of the year relative to 2018 to a rate a little below its potential”, the bank's statement said.
The decision came a day after data showing that the annual rate of inflation in the U.K. eased back to 2% in May from 2.1% in April, in line with the BoE’s target. Meanwhile, wages are growing at their fastest pace in a decade.
Last month, BoE Governor Mark Carney warned that investors were underestimating how much interest rates could rise.
BoE Chief Economist Andy Haldane said this month that the time was nearing for a rate increase to prevent inflation pressure building. Michael Saunders, another member of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), said Brexit uncertainty was not a reason to delay tighter policy.
The U.K. is due to exit the EU on Oct. 31, but with staunch Brexiteer Boris Johnson the current front runner to succeed U.K. Prime Minister Theresa May, the likelihood of a no-deal Brexit or even a general election has risen.
The BOE’s slightly hawkish tone sets it apart from many of the world’s biggest central banks. The Federal Reserve on Wednesday left rates on hold and signaled it could cut rates later this year.
Earlier this week, European Central Bank President Mario Draghi said the bank will need to ease policy again if inflation doesn't head back to its target.
The British pound pared gains against the dollar following the decision, to trade at 1.2700, off an earlier high of 1.2727.

1063,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 20, 2019 05:37AM ET</span>",Cool weather hits UK retail sales in May in gloomy sign for economy,"By Andy Bruce and William Schomberg
LONDON (Reuters) - Cold weather in May prompted the biggest drop in British retail sales this year as shoppers delayed buying summer clothes, adding to signs that the economy, struggling for momentum ahead of Brexit, is set for a weak second quarter. 
Monthly retail sales volumes contracted 0.5%, the Office for National Statistics said, as expected in a Reuters poll of economists and following a 0.1% fall in April.
Compared with May 2018, sales rose by the least since October last year, up 2.3%. The Reuters poll had pointed to growth of 2.7%.
The second consecutive monthly slide in retail sales does not bode well for overall growth in the second quarter for an economy which is struggling with Britain's Brexit crisis as well as a slowdown in growth globally. 
Official data has shown the economy contracted sharply in April, adding to reasons why the Bank of England is likely to keep interest rates on hold when it announces its June policy decision at 1100 GMT.
Sterling and British government bonds showed little reaction to the retail sales data.
""Although earnings continue to outstrip inflation, a second stutter in as many months will serve as a stark reminder that the retail sector's recent growth should not be taken for granted,"" Philipp Gutzwiller, head of retail at Lloyds (LON:LLOY) Bank Commercial Banking, said.
Until now, consumers have largely taken Brexit in their stride, helped by stable inflation and stronger growth in wages.
That has helped the world's fifth-biggest economy at a time when many companies have been cutting back on investment because of uncertainty about Brexit.
The ONS said unseasonably cold weather hit demand for clothing and footwear sales, which fell 4.5% on the month -- the biggest drop since July 2015.
""We see quite a mixed picture across the rest of the sector as the decline in department store sales continued (in the three months to May), with no growth since September of last year,"" ONS statistician Rhian Murphy said.
Underlining the squeeze on retailers' profit margins, sales in value terms rose only 2.7% in the year to May, the smallest rise in nearly three years. 
Retailers themselves have reported mixed fortunes of late.
Earlier on Thursday, Dixons Carphone (LON:DC), Britain's biggest seller of electricals and mobile phones, reported a 22% fall in full-year profit, reflecting falling mobile sales in a tough market, and warned of another big decline in the current year.

Fashion brand Ted Baker this month reported an ""extremely difficult"" start to the year, although online fashion group Boohoo bucked a tough retail market with robust sales growth.

1064,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jun 20, 2019 05:10AM ET</span>",Lone Hawk Norges Bank Stuns Markets With Signal on Rates,"(Bloomberg) -- Terms of Trade is a coming daily newsletter that untangles a world embroiled in trade wars. Sign up here. 
Norges Bank is busy building a reputation as one of the world’s most hawkish central banks as it delivers its third interest-rate hike since September and signals there’s more to come.
Governor Oystein Olsen said that, given the “balance of risks,” the key rate “will most likely be increased further in the course of 2019,” in a statement on Thursday. The deposit rate was raised by a quarter point to 1.25%, as expected.
The krone surged 1% against the euro, its strongest gain since March. Against the dollar, the krone was up about 1.5%.
The decision, and the forward guidance, makes Norges Bank “the sole hawk in town,” Kristoffer Lomholt, a senior analyst at Danske Bank, said in a tweet. Thursday’s announcement suggests that “the next hike more likely than not will come already in September,” while rates markets had priced Thursday’s increase “as the final hike in the cycle,” which explains the “big market reaction,” he said.
Norges Bank also said that its “policy rate forecast indicates a slightly faster rate rise in the coming year than projected in the March Report, but the policy rate path is little changed further out.”
Norway’s economy, which is backed by the world’s biggest sovereign wealth fund, is starting to show signs of overheating after a surge in oil investments. With the economy running at full speed, the central bank has made clear there’s no room for the kind of extreme monetary stimulus that’s dominated since the global crisis of 2008. The message is very different from that of the European Central Bank and the Federal Reserve, which have both embraced continued stimulus.
“While most other central bankers are discussing rate cuts or new quantitative easing programs amid weaker global growth and political uncertainty, Norway’s central bank is raising its rates for the third time within a year!” Frederik Engholm, chief strategist at Nykredit, wrote in a tweet.
ECB, Fed
On Tuesday, ECB President Mario Draghi sent bond yields plunging across Europe, as he told markets that additional stimulus will be needed “in the absence of any improvement” to the outlook for growth and inflation.
On Wednesday, the Federal Open Market Committee said that, in light of increased uncertainties and muted inflation pressures, it “will closely monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook and will act as appropriate to sustain the expansion.”
In Norway, meanwhile, unemployment has stabilized below 4% and inflation is running above target. And thanks to a weak krone, the central bank has room to raise rates without hurting exports.
“Growth in the Norwegian economy is solid, and capacity utilization is estimated to be somewhat above a normal level,” the bank said. “Underlying inflation is a little higher than the inflation target.”
“At the same time, trade tensions are a source of substantial global uncertainty,” it said. “Uncertainty surrounding the effects of monetary policy suggests a cautious approach to interest rate setting. The overall outlook and balance of risk suggest that the policy rate be increased somewhat further.”

TOKYO (Reuters) - The Bank of Japan kept monetary policy steady on Thursday, preferring to save its dwindling ammunition as a darkening global growth outlook prompts other major central banks to drop hints of additional stimulus.
But the BOJ stressed anew that global risks were increasing as trade tensions and uncertainty over U.S. economic policies jolt financial markets, signaling that it, too, is leaning more toward ramping up - not whittling down - monetary support.
As widely expected, the BOJ maintained its short-term rate target at -0.1% and a pledge to guide 10-year government bond yields around zero percent.
It also kept intact a loose pledge to keep buying government bonds so the balance of its holdings increase by roughly 80 trillion yen ($738 billion) per year.
""Downside risks regarding overseas economies are big, so we must carefully watch how they affect Japan's corporate and household sentiment,"" the BOJ said in a statement announcing the policy decision.
Central banks across the globe are tilting towards easing as the escalating U.S.-China trade war adds pressure on the slowing world economy.
The U.S. Federal Reserve kept interest rates steady on Wednesday but signaled it was ready to battle risks by cutting rates beginning as early as next month.
The more dovish outlook saw the yen strengthen against the weakened dollar.
Australia's top central banker on Thursday said it was not ""unrealistic"" to expect a further reduction in rates given ample slack in the labor market. It cut rates to a record low earlier this month.
Many Japanese policymakers, however, are wary of expanding stimulus any time soon, as years of heavy money printing have left them with little ammunition.
Some analysts say the BOJ could strengthen its forward guidance and pledge to keep current ultra-low rates longer than it promises to do so now, if future Fed rate cuts trigger an unwelcome yen spike that hurts Japan's exports.
""There's a good chance the Fed will cut rates in July. If that happens, the BOJ will strengthen its forward guidance to keep yen rises in check,"" said Izuru Kato, chief economist at Totan Research.
""The BOJ's next move will depend on how the U.S. economy performs and how Washington's trade war with China progresses.""
At its previous rate review in April, the BOJ adopted a forward guidance that pledges to keep current ultra-low rates at least until around spring of next year.
Japan's economy expanded by an annualized 2.1% in January-March but many analysts predict growth to slow in coming quarters as the U.S.-China trade row hurts global trade. A scheduled sales tax hike in October may also curb consumption.
Annual core consumer inflation hit 0.9% in April, remaining distant from the BOJ's 2% target, despite years of massive and radical stimulus.
A Reuters poll released this week showed expectations of the BOJ's next move have shifted amid growing concerns about the economic outlook.
For more than two years, a majority of economists surveyed have said its next policy change would be to tighten the money taps with an eye to ""normalising"" settings that have long been at crisis levels.
But now, half the analysts polled June 5-17 said the BOJ's next step would be to ease even further.

WELLINGTON (Reuters) - New Zealand's economy expanded at a steady pace in the first quarter, thanks to solid construction activity, but policymakers are expected to cut rates again before year-end to underpin growth in the face of a slowing housing market and global demand.
Central banks around the world have either cut rates or turned decisively dovish in recent months to prop up their economies as an escalating Sino-U.S. tariff war hurts trade, investment and corporate profits. Overnight, the Federal Reserve opened the door to rate cuts in the coming months to combat rising economic risks.
In New Zealand, gross domestic product (GDP) data released on Thursday showed growth for the quarter ended March at 0.6%, meeting analysts' expectations but beating the central bank forecast of 0.4%. The economy grew at a similar 0.6% pace in the fourth quarter.
Yet, analysts say the headline numbers masked underlying weakness, with a slowing housing market and immigration adding to the rising external pressure on the economy. 
The GDP data on its own may not prompt further action from the Reserve Bank of New Zealand at next week's meeting, said ASB Chief Economist Nick Tuffley.
""However, subdued business confidence and the continued deterioration in global economic conditions may still sway the RBNZ to cut the OCR at least once more,"" said Tuffley
Citing economic risks, the RBNZ cut its Official Cash Rate (OCR) for the first time in more than two years in May, taking it down 25 basis points to an all-time low of 1.50%. Analysts say given risks to the growth outlook, and with inflation moving further under the RBNZ's target midpoint of 2 percent, policymakers have enough room to ease again. 
SOFT UNDERBELLY
The data drove the New Zealand dollar 0.3% higher to $0.6561, as traders bet the RBNZ would hold rates next week. Domestic bond yields had already dived overnight in the wake of the Fed with the two-year yield hitting an all-time low of 1.14%, far below the cash rate.
Year-on-year GDP growth picked up to 2.5% from 2.3% in the previous quarter, Statistics New Zealand said, and faster than the median analyst forecast of 2.4%.
Construction was the main driver of GDP growth in the quarter, rising 3.7%, compared with a 2.2% increase in the fourth quarter. 
Yet, subdued service sector activity and household spending pointed to a ""soft underbelly"", ANZ Senior Economist Miles Workman said.
Private consumption grew just 0.4% quarter-on-quarter in a sign of weak momentum, with household expenditure on services up a measly 0.3%.
""Yes, today’s headline was a little stronger than we were expecting, but a softer underbelly remained,"" Workman said, adding that the weaker services sector activity was a better signal of underlying momentum given the industry accounts for two thirds of GDP.
Indeed, many analysts say slowing house price and population growth as well as global trade tensions pose risks to the economic outlook. 
Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern's budget released last month focused on social 'wellbeing' goals over GDP, but flagged a smaller surplus and economic slowdown.
The Treasury department last month cut its GDP growth forecast to 2.1% in the year ending June 30, 2019, from the 2.9% expansion predicted in December.

""While the RBNZ will take some reassurance from today’s stronger-than-expected data, we doubt that economic activity will sharply accelerate from here in line with their forecasts,"" said Ben Udy, the Australian and New Zealand economist for Capital Economics.

1067,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jun 19, 2019 01:30PM ET</span>",Huawei Iran-Sanctions Evidence Is Too Risky for China to See,"(Bloomberg) -- Some evidence used to charge Huawei Technologies Co. with bank fraud and violating U.S. sanctions on Iran was deemed so sensitive that the Chinese telecom giant’s lawyers must now take unusual steps to review the information -- and even then, the company may never see it.
While specific evidence wasn’t disclosed, prosecutors convinced a federal judge that releasing too much would pose a risk to national security and other governmental concerns. The U.S. already had banned the company’s technology and accused Huawei of aiding Beijing in espionage. Last week, the court imposed restrictions on when and how information in the criminal case gets shared, and who can see it.
“What underlies all of this is the allegation that there are deep and close connections between Huawei and the Chinese government,” said Ryan Fayhee, a former Justice Department national security lawyer. “That’s why this presents differently than a traditional fraud case.”
The Huawei prosecution has forced government lawyers to balance evidence rules and a defendant’s right to a fair trial, while safeguarding intelligence gathering. A similar dilemma has threatened to undermine a case brought by Special Counsel Robert Mueller against 16 individuals and companies in Russia over election meddling, because the government is refusing to disclose some sensitive evidence.
For now, the Huawei case is proceeding with disclosures to the company’s American defense lawyers under restrictions set June 10 by U.S. District Judge Ann Donnelly in Brooklyn, New York. On Wednesday, she scheduled a Sept. 4 hearing to decide whether one Huawei lawyer, James M. Cole, should be disqualified because he had access to classified data when he worked as a Deputy Attorney General of the U.S. from 2011 to 2015. Cole, now a partner at Sidley Austin LLP, has said he has no conflict.
Criminal Probe
As the criminal case against Huawei moves forward, the prosecution of its chief financial officer, Meng Wanzhou, remains on hold. She is fighting extradition from Vancouver, Canada, after being arrested at the request of the U.S. last year. She is accused of defrauding banks when she made a presentation to one of its major banking partners and lied about by lying Huawei’s business dealings in Iran, in violation of U.S. sanctions.
Prosecutor Alexander Solomon disclosed on Wednesday that the company’s defense lawyers, who have received at least 700,000 pages of evidence turned over by the U.S. in the New York case, want to share some of the information with Meng’s defense team. The U.S. has said that Meng wouldn’t be permitted to see evidence until a separate order is worked out with her lawyers.
Meng’s billionaire father, Huawei founder Ren Zhengfei, has rejected the U.S. accusations against the company and his daughter. On Monday, Ren said the U.S. sanctions against Huawei -- one of the world’s largest makers of smartphones and networking equipment -- could reduce revenue by about $30 billion over the next two years, wiping out any growth prospects by withholding critical American technology.
The indictment against Huawei and Meng also mentions Ren, a former engineer with the People’s Liberation Army before he founded the telecommunications company. Prosecutors say he lied to FBI agents in 2007 when he “falsely stated” it had no business dealings in Iran. He hasn’t been criminally charged. The same day Meng, Huawei and its U.S. subsidiaries where charged with violating sanctions, prosecutors filed a separate case in Seattle accusing the company with stealing trade secrets from American rival T-Mobile.
Under the restrictions imposed by Donnelly, some evidence labeled “sensitive” by the government can’t be distributed beyond Huawei’s legal team, can only be accessed by certain witnesses in the presence of American lawyers, and must remain in the U.S. If there are disputes over evidence handling, a separate group of government lawyers not involved in the prosecution can be consulted or the judge can get involved.
David Bitkower, a lawyer for Huawei, declined to comment on the case, as did John Marzulli, a spokesman for Brooklyn U.S. Attorney Richard Donoghue.
The rules are even tighter for classified information, and evidence gathered under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act will require a separate process to determine what the defense will be able to view, prosecutors said in a court filing Monday.
Unusual Restrictions
Donnelly’s order includes unusual restrictions, even for sanctions cases, legal experts said.
Some of the evidence can only be reviewed by defense lawyers who are U.S. citizens, because the information could identify potential witnesses or contains “national security” material, prosecutors say. Those documents must be stored on a computer that isn’t connected to the Internet and can’t be taken or transmitted outside the country or shared with Huawei.
If Huawei lawyers want to share sensitive material with anyone outside the U.S., they must notify the government. There are also provisions for allowing foreign nationals to view the evidence in the U.S., including with safe-passage guarantees against arrest. There also are options for reviewing information outside the country, but only in the presence of U.S. defense lawyers.
Without such provisions, Huawei could accuse the U.S. of hampering its ability to defend itself, said Henry Mazurek, a partner at law firm Meister Seelig and Fein LLP in New York.
Huawei’s close ties to the Chinese government have impacted the willingness of the U.S. to share evidence with the company, but prosecutors are obligated to turn over evidence, said Fayhee, the former federal prosecutor.
“The government has the view, as also substantiated by its recent blacklisting, that Huawei is an arm of the Chinese government,” Fayhee said. “The founder of the company served nearly a decade as an engineer with the People’s Liberation Army, and continued connections have been regularly alleged. But that’s what the government signed up for when it decided to bring this case.”
The case is U.S. v. Huawei Technologies Co., 18-cr-457, U.S. District Court, Eastern District of New York (Brooklyn).

1068,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 19, 2019 09:43AM ET</span>",U.S. mortgage applications fall from 33-month high,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. mortgage applications declined last week from about a 33-month peak as most home borrowing costs moved up from their lowest levels since September 2017, the Mortgage Bankers Association said on Wednesday.
The Washington-based group's seasonally adjusted index on loan requests, both to buy a home and to refinance one, fell to 511.8 in the week ended June 14. It fell 3.4% from the prior week's 529.8, which was the highest reading since September 2016.
Interest rates on 30-year fixed-rate ""conforming"" mortgages, or loans whose balances are $484,350 or less, averaged 4.14% last week. They were up 2 basis points from prior week's 4.12%, the lowest level since September 2017. 
Other 30-year mortgage rates MBA tracks were unchanged to 3 basis points higher from the week before.
Meanwhile, 15-year mortgage rates averaged 3 basis points lower at 3.50%, while the average borrowing costs on five-year adjustable home loans rose 2 basis points to 3.45%.
Mortgage rates generally increased in line with higher bond yields last week as traders pared their safe-haven bond holdings after U.S. President Donald Trump called off threatened tariffs on Mexico and encouraging data on retail sales and industrial output.
MBA's seasonally adjusted gauge on refinancing applications fell 3.5% to 1,888.8 from prior week's 1,956.5, which was the highest since November 2016.
The refinance share of mortgage activity grew to 50.2% of total applications from 49.8% the week before. 
“Borrowers were sensitive to rising rates, but the refinance share of applications was still at its highest level since January 2018, and refinance activity was at its second highest level this year,"" Joel Kan, MBA’s associate vice president of economic and industry forecasting, said in a statement.
The group's barometer on loan applications for home purchases, which is seen as proxy on future housing activity, slipped 3.5% to 268.6. The latest figure was up almost 4% from a year ago.
""Strong demand from first-time buyers and low unemployment continue to push this year’s purchase activity above a year ago,"" Kan said.

1069,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 19, 2019 08:25AM ET</span>",French spirits sales hit by 'yellow vest' protests last year,"PARIS (Reuters) - Sales of spirits in France fell last year, hurt by ""yellow vest"" anti-government protests that were at their peak during the end of the year period that accounts for a bulk of sales, French spirits association FFS said on Wednesday.
Protests late last year, which saw some of the worst street violence in Paris in decades and blocked access to shopping malls around the country, cost 0.1 percentage point of French growth in the fourth quarter last year, the INSEE statistics agency said in March.
The weekly protests gradually waned this year.
In 2018, spirits sales in French supermarkets fell 2.1% in volume to 275 million liters, and fell 1.34% in value to 4.72 billion euros compared to the year earlier, FFS said.
Not all spirits performed poorly. Sales of rum showed a 5.7% rise in value and 3.3% rise in volume, while sales of gin increased by 7.6% in value and 2.4% in volume, boosted by innovation and higher qualities.
Spirits exports hit a record high of 4.3 billion euros in 2018, up 1.8% on 2017, mainly boosted by Cognac, liqueurs and rum sales. The volume exported stood at 445 millions liters, or 53 million 12-bottle boxes, up 1.9% on the year.
This confirmed data from wine and spirits exporters group FEVS in February.

Looking ahead, FFS warned that a food law implemented in February raising the minimum price at which retailers can sell goods had added between 5% and 8% to spirit prices, but that only benefited retailers and not producers.

1070,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 19, 2019 08:09AM ET</span>",UK factory orders slide in June as Brexit uncertainty weighs: CBI,"By David Milliken
LONDON (Reuters) - British factory orders slid in June against a backdrop of Brexit uncertainty, and manufacturing output in the second quarter looks on course for its weakest performance in three years, the Confederation of British Industry said on Wednesday.
The CBI's monthly industrial orders index sank to -15 this month from -10 in May, its weakest since October 2016 and a steeper fall than a forecast of -12 in a Reuters poll.
The production index for the three months to June dropped to its lowest since the three months to April 2016, hit by sharp falls in car production this April. 
Many carmakers suspended production that month, expecting disruption around the March 29 date on which Britain had been due to leave the European Union.
""Brexit uncertainty is holding back growth in key industries,"" said Tom Crotty, group director of energy and chemicals group INEOS, who chairs a CBI manufacturers' panel. ""The first item in the new prime minister's in-tray must be to quickly resolve the Brexit deadlock.""
Britain is now due to leave the EU on Oct. 31, and former foreign secretary Boris Johnson -- the leading contender to succeed Prime Minister Theresa May -- says he is open to leaving without a deal if the EU will not renegotiate.
The CBI, which wanted Britain to remain in the EU, has repeatedly said a no-deal Brexit would cause major disruption to trade and supply chains.
Britain's economy performed better than expected in the first quarter of 2019, growing a robust 0.5% due to a bigger than expected boost from businesses stocking up ahead of the long-anticipated March Brexit date.
But this boost is expected to go into reverse during the current quarter, with the Bank of England estimating growth of just 0.2% and some forecasters predicting a contraction.
Pantheon Macroeconomics's Samuel Tombs said he expected industrial production would pick up in the third quarter as car plants operated through the summer holiday period -- and that even if factory output remained weak, the sector was too small to push Britain's economy as a whole into recession.

""The much larger services sector stands to benefit from robust growth in households' disposable incomes,"" Tombs said.

1072,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 18, 2019 11:32PM ET</span>",Trade tensions kick Asian business confidence to 10-year low: Thomson Reuters/INSEAD,"By Sachin Ravikumar
MUMBAI (Reuters) - Confidence among Asian companies in the June quarter fell to its lowest since the 2008-09 financial crisis, as a U.S.-China trade war disrupts global supply chains and shows little sign of easing soon, a Thomson Reuters/INSEAD survey found.
The Thomson Reuters/INSEAD Asian Business Sentiment Index tracking companies' six-month outlook worsened in the three months ended June to 53, versus 63 in the previous two quarters. 
A reading above 50 means optimistic respondents outnumbered pessimists, but worries about the threat of a prolonged trade war drove the index to its lowest since the June quarter of 2009, when the first edition of the survey was released.
""There was a big dip (in the index) three quarters ago, and we felt it was the uncertainty about the trade war and people were worried about the future,"" said Antonio Fatas, a Singapore-based economics professor at global business school INSEAD.
""We get a sense after four quarters of low numbers that now, it's not just uncertainty. This is a true slowdown in growth. We see activity declining — it's not just the expectation that activity will decline,"" Fatas added.
For a fourth straight quarter, survey participants cited the global trade war as the chief risk to business, followed by Brexit and a slowdown in the Chinese economy.
The survey interviewed 95 companies in 11 Asia-Pacific countries that together contribute about a third of global gross domestic product and are home to 45% of the world's population.
It was conducted from May 31 to June 14.
RISING CAUTION
The index staying above the neutral point of 50 suggests companies in the region are not expecting an imminent global recession, but the decade low indicates caution was rising as trade tensions mount.
The United States and China have been embroiled in a trade standoff since last year, marked by tit-for-tat import tariffs, as Washington looks to force Beijing to make changes to its business policies. Talks between the two to reach a detente ended last month without a deal.
Washington's move to put Huawei, the world's No.2 maker of smartphones, on an export blacklist that bars U.S. companies from doing business with the Chinese firm without special approval further ratcheted up tensions.
Still, U.S. President Donald Trump has said that a deal would ""eventually"" be struck.
 BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP), however, does not expect a resolution to the trade war this year, said Hong Kong-based Manishi Raychaudhuri, Asia-Pacific equity strategist at the banking group.
The trade tensions are hurting supply lines, especially that for higher-end smartphones, with many manufacturers looking to move production out of China and into countries such as Vietnam, Taiwan and Bangladesh, Raychaudhuri noted.
These changes, however, ""can't be made overnight"", he added.
U.S.-based Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) Inc, which makes radio-frequency chips used in Apple's iPhones and iPads, last week forecast a $2 billion hit to annual sales from the trade tensions and the U.S. ban on Huawei.
Huawei has acknowledged a harder-than-expected hit from the ban and slashed its revenue forecast for the year.
China's economy is also feeling the heat, with industrial output growth sliding to a 17-year low in May.
Respondents to the survey included Japan's Nikon Corp, South Korea's Samsung Electronics (KS:005930), India's Tata Consultancy Services and Reliance Industries Ltd, as well as Thailand's PTT PCL.

1073,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 18, 2019 11:11PM ET</span>","Japan exports slide for 6th month as trade troubles knock demand, weaken outlook","By Tetsushi Kajimoto and Daniel Leussink
TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's exports fell for a sixth straight month in May as China-bound shipments of semiconductor manufacturing equipment and car parts weakened, in a sign of a deteriorating outlook for growth as the trade-reliant economy faces persistent pressure from slowing external demand.
Sluggish exports have been a source of concern among Japanese policymakers, especially as a bruising U.S.-China tariff war has upended supply chains and hit global growth, trade and investment.
""The business sentiment of Japanese firms, and in particular exporters, is falling depending on the extent of U.S.-China trade tensions, and that will suppress exporters' capital expenditure,"" said Hiroshi Miyazaki, senior economist at Mitsubishi UFJ  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) Securities.
""I think that will be a negative for Japan's economy.""
Ministry of Finance (MOF) data showed on Wednesday that exports declined 7.8% in May from a year earlier, down for the sixth straight month.
The fall in shipments compared with a 7.7% annual decrease expected by economists in a Reuters poll, and followed a 2.4% year-on-year fall in April.
The trade data comes on the heels of a Reuters poll of Japanese companies showing the economy is likely to stop expanding this year and into next as the Sino-U.S. trade war and a planned sales tax hike are expected to crimp activity.
""Although export volumes are unlikely to be as weak as they were in the last quarter, a likely rebound in import volumes means that net trade should turn into a drag on GDP (gross domestic product) growth in Q2,"" said Darren Aw, Asia economist at Capital Economics in Singapore.
Indeed, Japan's first quarter GDP growth was partly boosted by a statistical quirk of imports falling more than exports, meaning overall trade provided a boost to the economy even as the underlying picture showed weakness. 
Earlier this month, Group of 20 finance leaders warned that intensifying trade and geopolitical tensions raised risks to global growth, but they stopped short of calling for a resolution of the deepening U.S.-China trade conflict.
The slowdown in exports in May was also likely caused by suspension of factory activity due to the 10-day break as the Golden Week holiday was extended this year to mark the enthronement of a new emperor, analysts say.
Overall, however, weak global demand poses risks for the world's third-biggest economy, and faltering earnings at Japan Inc. suggests little respite in the months ahead especially if domestic demand fails to offset frail exports.
At the two-day meeting that ends on Thursday, the Bank of Japan is expected to keep monetary policy steady but signal its readiness to ramp up stimulus if growing overseas risks threaten the economy's modest expansion.
Weak economic growth could prompt Prime Minister Shinzo Abe to postpone a planned sales tax hike to 10% for the third time. The previous sales tax hike to 8%, from 5%, in 2014 hit consumption and was blamed for a slump in the Japanese economy.
By region, U.S.-bound exports rose 3.3% in the year to May, driven by a 9.9% rise in car shipments, while imports fell 1.6%, led by crude oil. It marked the eight straight month of exports growth to the U.S. following a 9.6% increase in April. 
As a result, Japan's trade surplus with the United States grew 14.8% in May from a year earlier to 395 billion yen ($3.64 billion), rising for three months in a row - a worrying signal for bilateral trade talks as Tokyo is under pressure from Washington to fix what it says is an unfair trade imbalance.
Exports to China - Japan's biggest trading partner - fell 9.7% in the year to May, posting a third straight month of declines, the trade data showed.
Many Japanese firms, tapped into China's market and their supply chains, face growing pressure on margins as the world's second biggest economy slows.
""If the economic expansion in the United States and China comes under pressure, it will weaken growth of the world economy as a whole, and that will lead to a deceleration of the global economy, including Japan,"" said Mitsubishi UFJ's Miyazaki.
Shipments to Asia, which accounts for more than half of Japan's overall exports, fell 12.1% year-on-year in May.
Japan's overall imports fell 1.5% in the year to May, compared with the median estimate for a 0.2% annual increase.

The trade balance came to a deficit of 967.1 billion yen, versus the median estimate for a 979.2 billion yen shortfall and marked the fourth straight month in the red.

1074,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 18, 2019 12:49PM ET</span>",U.S. housing starts drop in May masks some signs of improvement,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. homebuilding fell in May, but groundbreaking activity in the prior two months was stronger than previously thought, pointing to some tentative signs of improvement in the struggling housing market.
Land and labor shortages are, however, making it difficult for builders, especially in the single-family housing segment, to fully take advantage of a sharp decline in mortgage rates. That has left the housing market continuing to grapple with tight inventory and sluggish sales growth. 
The report from the Commerce Department on Tuesday came as Federal Reserve officials started a two-day policy meeting.
Low inflation, a slowing economy and an escalation in the trade war between Washington and Beijing have led financial markets to fully price in an interest rate cut this year, pulling down mortgage rates. The U.S. central bank is, however, not expected to cut rates on Wednesday.
""Housing continues to wander along, not doing much better but not weakening a whole lot,"" said Joel Naroff, chief economist at Naroff Economic Advisors in Holland, Pennsylvania.
Housing starts dropped 0.9% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.269 million units last month amid a drop in the construction of single-family housing units, the government said. Data for April was revised up to show homebuilding rising to a pace of 1.281 million units, instead of increasing to a rate of 1.235 million units as previously reported. Housing starts in March were also stronger than initially estimated.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast housing starts edging up to a pace of 1.239 million units in May. 
Single-family homebuilding, which accounts for the largest share of the housing market, dropped 6.4% to a rate of 820,000 units in May. Single-family housing starts fell in the Northeast, the Midwest and West, but rose in the South, where the bulk of homebuilding occurs.
Some on the weakness in groundbreaking activity likely reflects heavy rain and flooding in some parts of the country.
The housing market hit a soft patch last year and has been a drag on economic growth for five straight quarters.
The PHLX housing index was trading higher, in line with a broadly firmer U.S. stock market. The dollar rose slightly against a basket of currencies, while U.S. Treasury yields fell.
GRADUAL IMPROVEMENT
Despite the recent signs of improvement in housing starts, there are concerns that renewed trade tensions between the United States and China could hurt future home building. 
A survey on Monday showed confidence among homebuilders ebbed in June, with builders continuing ""to report rising development and construction costs, with some additional concerns over trade issues.""
Builders said that despite lower mortgage rates, ""home prices remain somewhat high relative to incomes, which is particularly challenging for entry-level buyers.""
The 30-year fixed mortgage rate has decreased to 3.82% from a peak of about 4.94% in November, according to data from mortgage finance agency Freddie Mac. According to the latest data, house prices rose 3.7% in March from a year ago, outpacing wages, which increased 3.1% in May.
Building permits rose 0.3% to a rate of 1.294 million units in May. It was the second straight monthly increase in permits. Building permits have been weak this year, with much of the decline concentrated in the single-family housing segment.
Permits to build single-family homes increased 3.7% to a rate of 815,000 units in May, after five straight monthly declines. Permits were boosted by a 7.7% jump in the South, the largest gain since December 2016. But single-family housing permits fell in the Northeast, West and Midwest. 
""The gain in permits along with more favorable buying conditions points to gradually improving activity over the summer,"" said Mark Vitner, a senior economist at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) Securities in Charlotte, North Carolina. ""That said, lower mortgages rates will not likely be rocket fuel for residential construction, and a surge in activity is unlikely.""
Starts for the volatile multi-family housing segment surged 10.9% to a rate of 449,000 units last month. Permits for the construction of multi-family homes dropped 5.0% to a pace of 479,000 units.
Housing completions fell 9.5% to 1.213 million last month. Realtors estimate that housing starts and completion rates need to be in a range of 1.5 million to 1.6 million units per month to plug the inventory gap. The stock of housing under construction was little changed at 1.131 million units.

""If you were waiting for more construction to deal with the nation's growing housing shortage, you are going to have a longer wait,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG in New York.

The European Union's surplus with the United States grew to 48.2 billion euros ($54.0 billion) in Jan-Apr 2019 from 46.0 billion euros in the same period of 2018, EU statistics office Eurostat reported on Tuesday. 
With China, the EU's trade deficit expanded to 62.0 billion from 57.2 billion euros.
The United States has hit the European Union with tariffs and threatened more in complaint over the trade balance. Both Washington and Brussels have also complained that China wants free trade without playing fair.
Overall, the goods trade deficit of the 28-nation bloc increased to 21.7 billion euros in Jan-Apr 2019 from 10.3 billion a year earlier. 
Energy imports were the chief cause of the deficit, especially from Russia and Norway.
For the narrower 19-country euro zone, exports grew by 5.2% year-on-year in April and imports by 6.6%, leading to a narrowing of its trade surplus to 15.7 billion euros in April from 17.1 billion a year earlier.

1077,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 18, 2019 05:15AM ET</span>",Euro zone inflation confirmed slowing to one-year low in May: Eurostat,"BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Inflation in the euro zone slowed to 1.2% in May, the lowest rate in more than a year, as price growth in the energy and services sectors slackened, the European Union statistics agency said on Tuesday, confirming its earlier estimates.
The final data is bad news for the European Central Bank (ECB), which targets a rate below but close to 2% and has promised further action if inflation does not pick up.
Eurostat said prices in the 19-country currency bloc went up by 1.2% on the year, slowing from 1.7% in April. It was the lowest growth rate since April 2018 when inflation was also recorded at 1.2%.
On the month, prices were nearly stable, posting a 0.1% increase that was below market forecasts of a 0.2% rise, new data released on Tuesday by Eurostat showed.
Prices slowed despite a record increase in euro zone wage costs in the first quarter of the year. The apparent inconsistency could partly be explained by the fact that higher wage costs for firms do not always translate into more cash for consumers as payroll taxes remain high in the bloc.
The ECB will need to ease policy again, possibly through new rate cuts or asset purchases, if inflation does not head back to its target, ECB President Mario Draghi said on Tuesday.
Eurostat confirmed that the core inflation measure the ECB looks at in policy decisions, which excludes the volatile components of food and energy, was 1.0% in May on the year against 1.4% in April.
A narrower indicator, which also excludes alcohol and tobacco prices, slowed to 0.8% in May from 1.3% in the previous month, confirming earlier estimates.
Inflation was mostly dragged down by energy prices which increased 3.8% in May, after a 5.3% rise in April. Inflation in the services sector, the largest in the euro zone economy, nearly halved to 1.0% from 1.9% in April, data show.

1078,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 17, 2019 11:15PM ET</span>","China's home prices growth fastest in five months, raises policy challenge","BEIJING (Reuters) - New home prices in China rose at their fastest pace in five months in May, complicating government efforts to keep frothy housing markets under control as it rolls out more stimulus for the slowing economy. 
Average new home prices in China's 70 major cities rose 0.7% in May from the previous month, picking up from a 0.6% rise in April and the quickest pace since December, according to Reuters calculations based on National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) data on Tuesday. 
That marked the 49th straight month of price gains. Sixty-seven of the total 70 cities surveyed by the NBS reported higher prices in May, the same as April. 
On an annual basis, home prices increased 10.7% in May, unchanged from April's growth rate. 
Beijing has repeatedly urged local governments to keep runaway prices under control, but a recent easing in credit conditions, pent-up demand for housing, and an implicit government mandate to prevent a collapse have kept the market surprisingly resilient.
But further curbs on home buyers would risk adding to pressure on China's economy, which has seen sales slowing due to weaker domestic demand and an escalating trade war with the United States. 
Data last week showed the biggest drop in property sales in nearly two years in May, and markedly slower growth in investment and new construction starts, pointing to further economic weakness ahead and more government growth boosting measures.
""If the market becomes overheated policymakers will definitely rush to regulate it,"" Zhang Dawei, a Beijing-based analyst of property consultancy Centaline, wrote in a note. 
Top Chinese officials including Guo Shuqing, chairman of China's banking regulator, have warned in recent weeks that Beijing must remain vigilant about property bubble risks. 
""History has proven that countries and regions that are overly-reliant on real estate for economic development will ultimately have to pay a heavy price,"" Guo told a forum in Shanghai last week.
Some developers have sought to promote sales by cutting prices, which has raised alarm. The Chinese city of Enshi tried to stabilize house prices by urging developers to halt drastic price cuts, threatening punishing measures unless such ""wrong behaviors"" stopped.
RISKS OF POLICY EASING 
China's home price growth has slowed significantly since the second half of 2017 due to intensive local curbs on speculative investments.
But the trends have been uneven across the country, with recent signs of resurgent price pressures. Some smaller cities with rising inventories have quietly loosened restrictions on home buyers to prop up consumer confidence and demand.
Mortgage rates have also been coming down in some areas in response to regulators' calls on banks to ramp up lending to support the economy.
The average interest rate on first home loans continued to drop in May to the lowest level since 2018, according to a market report cited by state-backed Economic Information Daily.
New household loans - mainly mortgages - still remained elevated, totaling 662.5 billion yuan ($95.70 billion) in May, and accounting for 56.14% of total new loans last month.
Higher prices were mainly driven by the smaller tier-3 cities, up 0.8% on a monthly basis compared with a 0.5% gain in April, the statistics bureau said in a note accompanying the data.
Prices in China's four top-tier cities - Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou and Shenzhen - saw slower growth in May, increasing 0.3% versus 0.6% growth in the previous month. 
Tier-2 cities, which include most of larger provincial capitals, grew 0.6%, unchanged from the rate a month earlier.
Xian, the capital of Shaanxi Province in western China with a population of over 7 million, became the top market performer in May, with prices surging 2% on-month.
Centaline's Zhang estimates various Chinese government entities announced 41 tightening measures at the city level in May.
""It is still a whack-a-mole game and the intensity of policy tightening so far has not exceeded market expectations,"" 
""But to a certain extent, these policies will alleviate some upward pressure on the prices.""

1080,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 17, 2019 08:07PM ET</span>",China holdings of U.S. Treasuries in April skid to nearly two-year low,"By Gertrude Chavez-Dreyfuss
NEW YORK (Reuters) - China's holdings of U.S. Treasury bonds and notes for the month of April fell to the lowest level since May 2017, data from the U.S. Treasury department showed on Monday, highlighting an uncertain outlook on a trade deal between Beijing and Washington. 
Chinese holdings of U.S. government debt declined for a second straight month, to $1.113 trillion in April, from $1.120 trillion the previous month. Even so, the world's second-largest economy remains the largest non-U.S. holder of Treasuries.
(For a graphic on 'China, Japan Holdings of U.S. Treasuries' click http://tmsnrt.rs/2DJ1ckW)
Belgium, which analysts surmised is where China would typically keep some of its holdings, also fell to $179.8 billion in April, from $186.6 billion in March.
""This is a head-scratcher given that Chinese reserves during the month only declined by just under $4 billion,"" said Gennadiy Goldberg, senior rates strategist, at TD Securities in New York. ""So there's quite a bit more selling than would have been justified.""
He said it could have been profit-taking from the build-up of holdings in the first quarter of the year. ""If you look at the flow of funds, for example, there was notable buying of Treasuries in Q1. So this certainly suggests that foreigners are taking more profits off the table,"" Goldberg said, while saying he does not think the decline was related to the trade conflict.
""If this were trade-related, you would have seen either more pressure on the Chinese yuan and you would have seen a decline in foreign exchange reserves on a one-for-one basis,"" Goldberg said.
If Belgium's holdings were included, it was almost a $15 billion decline.
The data showed that Japan, the second-largest non-U.S. holder of Treasuries, also reduced its holdings of Treasuries in April, to $1.064 trillion, from $1.078 trillion the previous month.
Overall, foreign holdings of Treasuries dropped to $6.433 trillion in April, from $6.473 trillion in March.
Foreign flows of U.S. Treasuries, meanwhile, showed an inflow of $16.949 billion in April, from net selling of $12.526 billion in March. Offshore private investors purchased Treasuries, at $45.366 billion during the month, from only $91 million previously.

1081,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 17, 2019 07:15PM ET</span>",Darkening mood among Japanese manufacturers flags risks ahead: Reuters Tankan,"By Daniel Leussink
TOKYO - Japanese manufacturers' business confidence dropped to a more than 2-1/2-year low in June, a Reuters poll showed on Tuesday, re-igniting fears the economy could be hit by slowing external demand in the face of a global slowdown and trade risks.
The monthly poll, which tracks the Bank of Japan's (BOJ) tankan quarterly survey, found the service-sector mood slipping for the first time in four months, suggesting business confidence has fallen ahead of a planned nationwide sales tax increase in October.
Both manufacturers' and non-manufacturers' sentiment are expected to remain below last month's levels over the coming three months, boding ill for the central bank's closely-watched tankan survey due next in July.
Subdued business confidence - on top of weakness in exports and household spending - has clouded the outlook for the world's third-largest economy, though analysts widely expect the BOJ to keep policy steady at this week's rate review.
In a Reuters poll of 505 large- and mid-sized companies, in which 263 firms responded on condition of anonymity, exporters voiced concerns about China's economic slowdown and its trade war with the United States.
""Our clients are making cautious decisions in capital spending, as the international situation is unstable because of U.S.-China trade tensions and the UK's departure from the EU,"" a manager of a machinery maker wrote in the survey.
The Reuters Tankan sentiment index for manufacturers stood at 6 in June, down six points from May, weighed down by electricity, transport equipment machinery and steel companies, the June 4-13 survey showed.
The index hit the lowest reading since September 2016, falling for the first time in two months.
It is expected to rebound to 11 in September.
In the first quarter, Japan's economy managed a second straight quarter of growth after a third-quarter contraction, thanks to stronger capital spending, but analysts expect global trade tensions to remain a drag on growth.
The service-sector index dropped five points to 22 in June from 27 in the previous month, weighed by retailers, potentially setting off alarm bells for consumption, which makes up about 60% of the economy.
The index is seen falling further to 21 in September.
Fragile domestic demand could be a source of concern for policymakers who are taking steps to ensure the planned sales tax increase to 10% from the current 8% will go ahead in October, as the 2014 tax hike depressed consumer sentiment.
The BOJ's last quarterly tankan showed the business mood hit a two-year low in the March quarter, underlining the impact rising trade tensions and weakening overseas demand were having on Japan's export-reliant economy.

The Reuters Tankan indexes are calculated by subtracting the percentage of pessimistic respondents from optimistic ones. A positive figure means optimists outnumber pessimists.

The National Association of Home Builders and  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) said on Monday their index of builder confidence in newly built, single-family homes fell to 64 from 66 in May. Analysts polled by Reuters had forecast the reading to rise to 67.
“While demand for single-family homes remains sound, builders continue to report rising development and construction costs, with some additional concerns over trade issues,” NAHB Chairman Greg Ugalde said in a statement.
The NAHB index is seen as a proxy on domestic housing starts, which will be released on Tuesday at 8:30 a.m. EDT (1230 GMT). Analysts polled by Reuters forecast home builders likely broke ground at an annualized pace of 1.239 million units in May, compared with a 1.235 million pace in April.
The NAHB survey's components broadly weakened in June.
The gauge on current single-family home sales dipped to 71 from 72, while the barometer on prospective buyers decreased to 48 from 49.
The measure on expectations on home sales over the next six months fell to 70 from 72 in May.
“Despite lower mortgage rates, home prices remain somewhat high relative to incomes, which is particularly challenging for entry-level buyers,” NAHB Chief Economist Robert Dietz said in a statement. 

Last week, interest rates on U.S. 30-year fixed-rate mortgages remained at 3.82%, their lowest levels since September 2017, Freddie Mac said.

U.S. business sentiment has sagged on escalating trade tensions between China and the United States and signs of some softness in the labor market. Some of those concerns have been offset by hopes the Federal Reserve would lower short-term interest costs to boost borrowing and demand.
The regional Fed's ""Empire State"" index on current business conditions tumbled to -8.6 in June from 17.8 in May. This was the first negative reading since October 2016 when it was -9.2.
Analysts polled by Reuters had forecast a reading of 10.0 for March.
A reading below zero suggests a contraction in regional business activity. 
""Business activity took a sharp turn downward in New York State,"" the regional central bank said of the latest figures.
(Graphic: New York Fed Empire business survey interactive - https://tmsnrt.rs/2XYNy6E)
The sharp deterioration was led by a pullback in new orders and employment, which fell to -12.0 and -3.5 in June from 9.7 and 4.7 in May, respectively.
The new orders figure reached a three-year low last month.
The report's six-month outlook index fell to 25.7 from 30.6 in May.
The June reading on prices paid ticked up to 27.8 from 26.2.
""We're likely seeing a huge hit from rising trade war fears and financial market setbacks through May, as last month's survey was likely too-early in the month to capture the impact,"" Michael Englund, chief economist at Action Economics wrote in a research note.
""The drop will be problematic if mimicked by the other sentiment reports for June, though for now we will attribute the out-sized decline to volatility in this survey,"" he added.

The increase is a positive signal for the European Central Bank's plans to drive inflation up but has so far not translated into higher prices in the 19-country euro zone.
Eurostat said wages and salaries rose 2.5% in the first three months of the year compared to the same quarter of the previous year, posting the highest increase since 2010, when it started gathering data.
Salaries' increased 2.3% in both the previous two quarters.
Wages rose more than overall labor costs which in the first quarter increased by 2.4%, Eurostat said.
The non-wage component of labor costs went up by 2.2%, offsetting the increase in wage costs.
Although wages are rising and employment is at a record high, consumer prices have repeatedly disappointed and underlying inflation remains weak, baffling policymakers and putting in doubt the central bank's ability to control prices.
In the three-month period when wages reached their record growth, euro zone inflation was up by a maximum of 1.5% in February, and posted a 1.4% increase in January and March, still far from the ECB's target of a rate close but below 2%.
In May inflation slowed to 1.2%, the latest Eurostat figures show.

1085,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 14, 2019 01:43PM ET</span>",Strong U.S. retail sales improve economy's fortunes,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. retail sales increased in May and sales for the prior month were revised higher, suggesting a pick-up in consumer spending that eased fears the economy was slowing down sharply in the second quarter. 
The fairly upbeat report from the Commerce Department on Friday followed a raft of weak data, including a step-down in hiring in May and tame inflation readings, that have led economists to believe that the Federal Reserve will signal a rate cut later this year when policymakers meet next week.
Financial markets have priced in two rate cuts this year, driven primarily by a recent escalation in the trade war between the United States and China, which economists have warned could undercut economic growth. The economy will next month celebrate 10 years of expansion, the longest in history.
""Don't count this economy out yet, the consumer is saying, as they show the way by opening their wallets and purses to spend the money that makes the economy hum,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG in New York.
Retail sales rose 0.5% last month as households bought more motor vehicles and a variety of other goods, the government said. Data for April was revised up to show retail sales gaining 0.3%, instead of dropping 0.2% as previously reported.
There were also increases in purchases of building materials and garden equipment, furniture, and electronics and appliances. Americans also spent more on online and mail-order purchases, hobbies, music and books, as well as at bars and restaurants.
But sales at clothing stores were unchanged. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast retail sales increasing 0.6% in May. Compared to May last year, sales advanced 3.2%. 
Excluding automobiles, gasoline, building materials and food services, retail sales climbed 0.5% last month after an upwardly revised 0.4% rise in April. These so-called core retail sales correspond most closely with the consumer spending component of gross domestic product.
They were previously reported to have been unchanged in April. Consumer spending accounts for more than two-thirds of economic activity. The outlook for consumption is dimming a bit. Not only did hiring cool in May, wage growth retreated.
Concerns about the labor market have been uppermost in consumers' minds this month. A second report on Friday showed consumer sentiment ebbed in early June, with households worried the trade fight between Washington and Beijing would hurt the economy, particularly the labor market.
President Donald Trump in early May imposed additional tariffs of up to 25% on $200 billion of Chinese goods, prompting retaliation by Beijing. Trump on Monday threatened more duties on Chinese imports if no deal was reached with Chinese President Xi Jinping at a G20 summit later this month in Japan. 
The consumer sentiment survey from the University of Michigan also appeared to suggest consumers rushed to buy big-ticket household items on the tariffs list to beat anticipated price increases as a result of the duties. This suggests retail sales could remain strong in June.
The dollar firmed against a basket of currencies. Prices for longer-dated U.S. Treasuries rose. Stocks on Wall Street were trading lower.
GROWTH ESTIMATES RAISED
The solid gains in core retail sales in April and May suggested consumer spending was gaining speed in the second quarter after braking sharply in the January-March period. 
That together with a third report showing a utilities-led rebound in industrial production last month prompted the Atlanta Fed to raise its second-quarter GDP growth estimate by seven-tenths of a percentage point to a 2.1% annualized rate. 
The economy grew at a 3.1% pace in the January-March quarter after getting a temporary boost from exports and an accumulation of inventory. Exports dropped in April and inventories are expected to be a drag on growth. In addition, business investment softened and home sales fell in April. Overall, the economy is losing steam as the stimulus from last year's $1.5 trillion tax cut and increased government spending dissipates. 
May's 0.4% rise in industrial production was the first increase this year. The report from the Fed also showed manufacturing production rising by a moderate 0.2% last month, leaving output down this year. Production at factories slumped 0.5% in April. 
Manufacturing, which accounts for about 12% of the economy, is being constrained by an inventory overhang, especially in the automotive sector, that has left businesses placing fewer orders at factories. Motor vehicle inventories surged 0.8% in April, the Commerce Department said in another report.
The trade tensions between Washington and Beijing are also causing bottlenecks in the supply chain. Those disruptions are undermining domestic industries and overseas manufacturing. Chinese industrial output growth unexpectedly slowed to a more than 17-year low in May. 
""The outlook hinges on product demand and the ability of businesses to whittle down undesired inventories,"" said Roiana Reid, an economist at Berenberg Capital Markets in New York.
""This hinges on global economic performance and trade volumes as well as U.S. activity. Although we expect some kind of U.S.-China partial agreement to ease tensions on tariffs, any global rebound is likely to be modest in second half of 2019.""

But there were some encouraging signs on the inventory bloat in the retail sales report. Sales at auto dealerships accelerated 0.7% after dropping 0.5% in April.

The Commerce Department said on Friday that business inventories increased 0.5% after being unchanged in March.
Inventories are a key component of gross domestic product. April's reading was in line with economists' expectations.
Retail inventories increased 0.5% as estimated in an advance report published last month. Motor vehicle inventories surged 0.8% in April instead of advancing 0.6% as previously reported.
Retail inventories excluding autos, which go into the calculation of GDP, gained 0.4% as reported in May, suggesting inventory accumulation could subtract from GDP growth in the second quarter.
The government reported last month that inventory investment added 0.60 percentage point to the economy's 3.1% annualized growth rate in the first quarter. Much of the accumulation in inventories reflects tepid domestic demand in the first quarter.
A trade war between the United States and China has also contributed to the inventory glut as businesses stocked up in a bid to get ahead of the tariff fight.
Wholesale inventories jumped 0.8% in April. Stocks at manufacturers rose 0.3%. The manufacturing inventory glut, which is concentrated in the auto industry, is contributing to sluggish growth in production at factories.
Business sales fell 0.2% in April after accelerating 1.3% in the prior month. At April's sales pace, it would take 1.39 months for businesses to clear shelves, up from 1.38 months in March. The motor vehicle inventory-to-sales ratio increased to 2.32 months in April from 2.29 months in March.

WASHINGTON 14 (Reuters) - U.S. manufacturing output rose in May, the first monthly gain this year, as an increase in the production of motor vehicles and parts countered declines in the making of metals and aerospace equipment.
The Federal Reserve said on Friday manufacturing production rose 0.2% last month, which was slightly higher than analysts in a Reuters poll had expected but only a partial recovery from the prior month's sharp decline.
The data could give some respite to concerns that the U.S. factory sector is sagging under the weight of a slowing global economy. U.S. manufacturing output had contracted in January, February and April.
Economists worry a trade war between the United States and China is contributing to the global slowdown. Earlier on Friday, a report showed Chinese industrial output growth unexpectedly slowed to more than a 17-year low.
In May, U.S. motor vehicles and parts production rose 2.4 percent. Excluding motor vehicles and parts, manufacturing output was flat.
Primary metal production fell 1.9% last month, while output of fabricated metal products dipped 0.1%.
The outlook for the U.S. manufacturing sector, which accounts for about 12% of the economy, is also suffering as stimulus from last year's $1.5 trillion tax cut package diminishes.
Overall industrial output, which includes utilities and mining production, rose 0.4% in May. Utilities output rose 2.1% and mining production crept up 0.1%.
Capacity utilization for the manufacturing sector, a measure of how fully firms are using their resources, edged higher to 75.7 percent last month from 75.6 percent in April.
Overall capacity utilization rose to 78.1 percent last month, which was 1.7 percentage point below its 1972-2018 average. Officials at the Fed tend to look at capacity use measures for signals of how much ""slack"" remains in the economy — how far growth has room to run before it becomes inflationary.

(Bloomberg) -- The value of overall sales rose 0.5% from the previous month after a 0.3% increase in April that was revised from a decline, according to Commerce Department figures released Friday. The median forecast in Bloomberg's survey of economists was for a 0.6% gain.
Sales in the “control group” subset, which some analysts view as a more reliable gauge of underlying consumer demand, climbed 0.5%, topping projections, after an upwardly revised 0.4% gain. The measure excludes food services, car dealers, building- materials stores and fuel stations.
The pickup signals steady wage gains and the lowest unemployment in a half-century are supporting consumer spending, which accounts for most of the U.S. economy, amid signs of weakness in other indicators. Investors have been expecting the Fed to lower borrowing costs in July as President Donald Trump's trade war weighs on growth, though the central bank may wait for clearer evidence of a slowdown before making such a move.
Chairman Jerome Powell will give more insight into the Fed's thinking at a press conference Wednesday following a two-day meeting of policy makers.
Online Shopping
Eleven of 13 major retail categories increased, led by a 1.4% gain in nonstore retailers, the most since January. That includes online shopping destinations such as Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN). Electronics and appliance stores as well as sporting goods, hobby, musical instrument and book stores recorded 1.1% increases.
Filling-station receipts increased 0.3%, the report showed. The figures aren't adjusted for price changes, so the higher retail sales suggest increased demand as fuel prices fell. Consumer- price index data this week showed gasoline costs dropped 0.5% in May from the prior month.
Sales at automobile and parts dealers advanced 0.7% after decreasing 0.5% in the previous month, revised upward from a 1.1% drop. Industry data from Wards Automotive Group previously showed unit sales rebounded in May.
Excluding automobiles and gasoline, retail sales increased 0.5% after a 0.3% gain the previous month, which was revised from a decline.
The only sectors to show declines were food and beverage stores, with a 0.1% drop, and miscellaneous retailers, with a 1.3% decrease. At the same time, the April figure for miscellaneous stores was revised to a 1.7% increase from little changed.

1089,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 14, 2019 07:04AM ET</span>",China's May industrial output growth cools to 17-year low as trade war escalates,"By Stella Qiu and Kevin Yao
BEIJING (Reuters) - China's economy flashed more warning signs in May as the United States ramped up trade pressure, with industrial output growth unexpectedly slowing to a more than 17-year low and investment cooling, underlining a need for more stimulus.
Hours after the surprisingly weak data, China's central bank announced 300 billion yuan ($43 bln) in fresh support for smaller banks, though analysts expect more sweeping measures in coming months if the U.S.-Sino trade dispute intensifies.
Despite a slew of support steps since last year, China's economy is still struggling to get back on firmer footing, and investors fear a longer and costlier trade war between the world's two largest economies could trigger a global recession. 
Industrial output grew 5.0 percent in May from a year earlier, data from the National Bureau of Statistics showed on Friday, missing analysts' expectations of 5.5% and well below April's 5.4%.
The reading was the weakest since early 2002, and exports were a major drag, showing only marginal growth.
Fixed-asset investment also grew less than expected, reinforcing expectations that Beijing needs to roll out more growth measures soon.
""The weakness in May’s and April’s activity data suggests that economic growth is likely to slow this quarter and increases the likelihood of additional monetary easing in the coming months,"" Capital Economics said in a note.
Vice Premier Liu He stoked expectations of more action on Thursday , urging regulators to do more to boost the economy and saying Beijing has plenty of tools it can use. 
Analysts at Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) said in a note they expect authorities to further cut banks' reserve requirement ratios (RRRs) to free up more funds to lend and lower interbank interest rates. But they do not expect China to actively use currency depreciation to support the economy.
Real estate investment, a key economic driver, also showed signs of fatigue, with construction starts slowing markedly and property sales falling the most since October 2017.
""The slowdown in the real estate sector is concerning. We really need to keep an eye on its negative impact on growth,"" economists at ANZ said in a note to clients, trimming its 2019 growth forecast for China to 6.2% and 6% for 2020.
ANZ expects the Peoples' Bank of China (PBOC) to cut RRR by another 100 basis points (bps) this year, and lower the 7-day reverse repo rate by 5 bps in the third quarter.  
The PBOC has already slashed RRR six times since early 2018 in a bid to turnaround soft credit growth. It has also injected large amounts of liquidity into the financial system and guided short-term interest rates lower.
However, despite the worsening trade outlook, China watchers appear divided over whether the central bank will cut benchmark interest rates, as it repeatedly did in past downturns.
Analysts believe policymakers are concerned more aggressive easing could fuel debt risks and put more pressure on the yuan, which is weakening towards the psychologically important 7-per-dollar level, last seen in the global crisis.
Beijing has relied more on fiscal stimulus to weather the latest downturn, including hundreds of billions of dollars in infrastructure spending and tax cuts for companies.
But Friday's data suggested domestic demand remains sluggish, adding to weaker-than-expected import and bank lending data over the last week and gloomy May factory surveys. Power generation last month grew just 0.2%.
Analysts say China is readying itself for a prolonged trade dispute, after both sides raised tariffs on each other's goods last month and U.S. President Donald Trump threatened more.
But global policymakers remain cautious ahead of a meeting between Trump and Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping at a G20 summit later this month.
""Our baseline forecast assumes that U.S.-China relations will not improve much in the foreseeable future,"" Oxford Economics said. 
INVESTMENT DISAPPOINTS
Fixed-asset investment growth decelerated to 5.6% in January-May from the same period a year earlier. Analysts had expected it to remain unchanged from 6.1 percent in the first four months of the year. 
Private sector fixed-asset investment, which accounts for about 60 percent of total investment, also lost momentum. It rose 5.3%, down from 5.5%.
The PBOC has repeatedly urged state-controlled banks to keep lending to cash-strapped smaller, private firms at lower rates, even if they are facing short-term financial difficulty, but average rates edged back up in the first quarter.
The state takeover of troubled regional lender Baoshang Bank in May has added to concerns about liquidity and financial risks, ANZ said. While the PBOC said it was an isolated case, the move jarred China's credit markets amid worries that the lending push will lead to more bad loans.
The central bank said late on Friday that it will raise the re-discount quota by 200 billion yuan ($28.88 billion) and the standing lending facility quota by 100 billion yuan for small and medium-sized banks.
ROADS AND RAIL
Infrastructure investment grew 4.0% in the first five months on-year, moderating from 4.4%.
While construction has picked up as Beijing ramps up spending on road, rail and port projects, some analysts have been puzzled by the slower-than-expected response. On Monday, China announced steps to give local governments more financing flexibility so they can increase infrastructure spending.
Property investment rose 9.5% in May, according to Reuters calculations, the slowest pace so far this year.
Retail sales bucked the downbeat trend, rising 8.6% in May on-year and picking up from 7.2% in April, a 16-year low. 
Analysts surveyed by Reuters had expected a rebound to 8.1%, but some said it was likely due to higher inflation rather than a turnaround in weak consumer confidence. 
Earlier this week, China's auto association reported the worst-ever monthly drop in sales.
On a positive note, nationwide unemployment readings were steady from April at 5 percent, though analysts believe the actual jobless rate is likely much higher.

The bank, acting on a slowdown in inflation, cut the key rate to 7.50% from 7.75%, the level it was at before the previous rate increase in December.
""(The) annual inflation slowdown is continuing... Economic growth in the first half of 2019 is lower than the Bank of Russia's expectations,"" the central bank said in a statement, explaining the move.
The central bank said more rate cuts were likely in the next few months.
""If the situation develops in line with the baseline forecast, the Bank of Russia admits the possibility of further key rate reduction at one of the upcoming Board of Directors' meetings and a transition to neutral monetary policy until mid-2020.""
The bank, which hiked the key rate twice last year to rein in rising consumer prices, said inflation, its main remit, was on track to slow towards the 4% target quicker than previously expected.
The central bank acted in line with a recommendation of the International Monetary Fund which said in late May that it was time to cut rates.
The bank said annual inflation reached 5% as of June 10, down from 5.1% in May. The rouble firmed to 64.35 versus the U.S. dollar from a level of 64.42 seen shortly before the central bank's decision.

Consumer prices rose 0.1% compared to April to give a 12-month inflation rate of 0.9%. The final May figure was below forecast (1.1%) and below April's revised rate of 1.3%. 
The European Central Bank (ECB) has a target for inflation within the euro zone bloc at just below 2%, although faltering economic growth in the region has resulted in euro zone inflation consistently coming in below the ECB's target.

INSEE said service sector prices fell 0.2 percent on the month. On a year-on-year basis, a fall in air transport and communication prices left services-sector inflation at 0.6 percent compared to 1.0 percent in April.

1092,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jun 13, 2019 08:10PM ET</span>",Modi's Suspect GDP Numbers Have Done Real Damage,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- For four years, India has battled the suspicion that its new and improved GDP series is a rose-tinted view of reality. Now that Narendra Modi is prime minister for a second term, he must see that battle for what it is: a lost cause.
Unlike harmless advertising puffery around a toothpaste that kills 99.9% of germs, the narrative of 7% growth has done real damage.This week, a top former government adviser provided a statistical estimate. The actual GDP growth rate between 2012 and 2017, according to Arvind Subramanian’s working paper for Harvard University, may have been 2.5 percentage points lower than the official 7% rate.
India’s level of economic output may be overstated by anywhere between 9% and 21%. The issue isn’t whether Subramanian’s technique of looking at other countries’ performance to build a picture of India’s growth is robust. As my colleague Mihir Sharma argues, if senior officials who served Modi in his first term don’t believe the data, nobody else will trust them either.
Going by the early official response to the critique, especially the promise of a point-by-point rebuttal to come later, it’s clear that Team Modi wants to continue to brazen it out. The prime minister should see the economic cost of that approach, even if his advisers don’t.
Voters don’t care about abstract statistical artifacts like GDP. They care about jobs, state subsidies and programs, and the cost of living. It was India Inc. that bought into the claim of 7% growth, and found itself badly deceived when the expected operating profits to repay creditors never materialized. Investments had stalled even before Modi's first term, but the deleveraging that was badly needed to deal with a slowdown also got delayed.
Misleading GDP data is one of several reasons why most balance sheets in India are stressed today. It’s not surprising, therefore, that the most ardent supporters of the new GDP series are accountants by training. When 108 economists and social scientists wrote to the government asking it to restore sanity to the published figures, 131 accountants wrote their own letter, accusing the former group of running a politically motivated campaign.
India’s bean counters do have a dog in the GDP fight. Some of them, as fund managers, have given investors’ money to firms that are in deep trouble now. Others, as auditors, turned a blind eye to sharp corporate practices, related-party lending and self-dealing, perhaps thinking that all boats would be kept afloat by high growth. Now they’re scared.
Naturally, financial intermediaries in Mumbai don’t want Modi to tell creditors and debtors the truth about growth, especially since they can’t undo their previous bets on 7% expansion without career-limiting, wealth-destroying – and possibly even freedom-endangering – consequences. But if Modi doesn’t order a thorough revamp of the discredited data in his second five-year term, the danger is that every quarterly growth announcement from now on will be discounted by 2.5 percentage points – the Subramanian factor. That means asking investors to accept that the March quarter’s published 5.8% GDP expansion – a fourth straight quarter of cooling – may have been as low as 3.3%.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The number of Americans filing applications for unemployment benefits unexpectedly rose last week, which could add to concerns that the labor market was losing steam after job growth slowed sharply in May.
Other data on Thursday showed import prices fell by the most in five months in May amid a broad decline in the cost of goods, the latest indication of muted inflation pressures. The import deflation supports expectations that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates this year.
U.S. central bank policymakers are scheduled to meet on June 18-19 against the backdrop of rising trade tensions. Financial markets have priced in at least two rate cuts by the end of 2019. A rate cut is not expected next Wednesday.
""Combined with increased business uncertainty from rising trade tensions and slowing domestic growth, softer inflation should prompt the Fed to ease policy by year end,"" said Jake McRobie, a U.S. economist at Oxford Economics in New York.
Initial claims for state unemployment benefits rose 3,000 to a seasonally adjusted 222,000 for the week ended June 8. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast claims decreasing to 216,000 in the latest week. 
While layoffs remain relatively low, the third straight weekly increase in claims suggests some softening in labor market conditions. The four-week moving average of claims, considered a better measure of labor market trends as it irons out week-to-week volatility, rose 2,500 to 217,750 last week.
""Claims have been roughly flat over the past couple of months, a potential sign that job growth is slowing,"" said Maria Cosma, an economist at Moody's Analytics in West Chester, Pennsylvania. ""Nevertheless, jobless claims aren't sending any warning signals just yet.""
The dollar was little changed against a basket of currencies, while U.S. Treasury prices rose. Stocks on Wall Street were trading higher. 
The economy created only 75,000 jobs in May, with wages increasing at their slowest annual pace in eight months, the government reported last week. The slowdown in hiring occurred before a recent escalation in trade tensions between the United States and China, raising fears of a sharp deceleration in economic growth.
ECONOMY SLOWING 
President Donald Trump in early May imposed additional tariffs of up to 25% on $200 billion of Chinese goods, prompting retaliation by Beijing. Trump on Monday threatened more duties on Chinese imports if no deal was reached with Chinese President Xi Jinping by the conclusion of the G20 summit later this month in Japan.
A tariff on all goods from Mexico to force authorities in that country to stop immigrants from Central America from crossing the border into the United States was narrowly averted after the two nations struck an agreement late last Friday.
Data so far suggest a step-down in economic growth in the second quarter after a temporary boost from exports and an accumulation of inventory early in the year. In addition to the moderation in hiring last month, manufacturing output, home sales and exports fell in April, while consumer spending cooled.
The Atlanta Fed is forecasting gross domestic product increasing at a 1.4% annualized rate in the April-June quarter. The economy grew at a 3.1% pace in the first quarter.
In another report on Thursday, the Labor Department said import prices dropped 0.3% last month, the biggest decline since last December, after edging up 0.1% in April. In the 12 months through May, import prices fell 1.5% after decreasing 0.3% in April. The report came on the heels of data on Wednesday showing consumer prices remained tame in May.
Import prices exclude duties. In May, prices for imported fuels and lubricants declined 1.0% after rising 1.7% in the prior month. Imported food prices dropped 0.8% last month after surging 2.7% in April.
Excluding fuels and food, import prices slipped 0.2% in May after falling 0.3% in the prior month. So-called core import prices decreased 1.5% in the 12 months through May. Though the dollar has weakened a bit this year, its gains last year against the currencies of the United States' main trading partners continue to depress core import prices.
The cost of imported capital goods declined, but prices for imported consumer goods excluding automobiles were unchanged. The cost of goods imported from China edged down 0.1% last month after falling 0.2% in April. Prices fell 1.4% in the 12 months through May, the largest drop since February 2017.

""The impact of tariff hikes on Chinese goods continues to be primarily absorbed by the U.S. rather than China at this point probably more on profit margins than via higher consumer prices,"" said John Ryding, chief economist at RDQ Economics in New York.

Fears are mounting that German growth will slow or even stall in the second quarter. The economy grew 0.4 percent in the January to March period after just skirting recession in the last three months of 2018.
""After significant growth in gross domestic product in the first quarter, the prospects for the second quarter remain subdued,"" the ministry said in its monthly report. However, it struck a more positive note for later in the year.

German manufacturing has suffered from trade disputes between the United States and both China and the European Union, with German industrial output and exports falling sharply in April. 

The ministry said an improvement in the services sector was helping the economy and recent data pointed to a continuation of the contrasting developments in services and manufacturing.

1098,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jun 12, 2019 11:30PM ET</span>",Australia's Sticky Unemployment Rate Underscores RBA's Challenge,"(Bloomberg) -- Australia’s jobless rate held above 5% in May despite a surge in hiring, underscoring the Reserve Bank’s challenge to drive down unemployment and stoke inflation.
While the economy added 42,300 roles last month, new entrants were absorbed by a jobs market that swelled to a record, the statistics bureau said in Sydney Thursday. That left the jobless rate at 5.2%, which is well above the 4.5% level the RBA estimates is needed to revive price pressures.
The result was further diminished by most jobs being part-time -- potentially workers hired for the May 18 election -- and fewer hours worked, suggesting a less robust labor market and likely explaining the currency edging lower. RBA Governor Philip Lowe resumed cutting interest rates last week after a three-year hiatus as he bids to spur hiring and return inflation to target.
“The data confirm the RBA’s view that the economy needs to generate more jobs to reach full employment, and that policy loosening -- which will stimulate domestic and external demand -- is needed to achieve this,” said Sarah Hunter, head of macroeconomics at BIS Oxford Economics in Sydney. “We expect the RBA board to follow June’s interest rate cut with two more this year.”
Australia’s labor market has shown surprising resilience as hiring persisted despite weakness across much of the economy. One explanation is that much of the hiring is coming from government-related programs that are impervious to prevailing economic conditions.
Lowe has made clear that easing monetary policy isn’t the ideal path to boosting hiring and investment, and has urged the government to undertake structural reforms. Following its surprise re-election last month, the government is trying to pass tax cuts that Commonwealth Bank estimates could provide stimulus equivalent to two quarter-point rate cuts.
Other Details:
For much of the past year, Australia’s debt-laden households have hunkered down and cut spending as they grapple with stagnant wages and watch falling house prices erode their wealth. Consumption accounts for almost 60% of GDP and weaker spending has slowed economic growth.
Lowe signaled last week the RBA is likely to cut rates again, and two sentiment surveys Wednesday suggested this will be necessary as the first easing failed to shift the needle on confidence.
“The headline jobs increase was nearly entirely driven by growth in part-time employment and this is not the sustainable employment growth the RBA wants to see,” said Kerry Craig, global market strategist at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) Asset Management. “Meanwhile, the decline in hours worked is not great for the consumption outlook.”

1099,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 12, 2019 07:55PM ET</span>",Imports to busiest U.S. seaport complex fall 6% in May,"LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - The Los Angeles and Long Beach port complex - the No. 1 hub for U.S. ocean trade with China - processed 6.3% fewer inbound cargo containers in May, signaling that the escalating U.S.-China trade war is roiling business activity. 
Exports from the California seaport complex, the nation's busiest, fell 7.4% year-on-year, the two ports said. 
U.S. companies ranging from retailers to manufacturers stockpiled goods before Washington and Beijing began slapping tariffs on imports last year. The May decline comes at a time when importers are typically ramping up for the peak shipping season that brings in goods for the winter holidays.
""Escalating tariffs have pushed retailers to order goods early, warehouses are brimming with inventory as a result, and in response, ocean carriers are managing their vessels to deal with reduced demand,"" said Mario Cordero, executive director at the Port of Long Beach, where imports fell 19.5% versus May 2018, more than offsetting a 5.5% increase in imports at the larger Port of Los Angeles.
The Trump administration escalated the trade conflict in May, announcing a tariff hike on $200 billion of Chinese products. China retaliated with tariffs on $60 billion of U.S. goods. 
President Donald Trump has also threatened to hit China with tariffs on ""at least"" a further $300 billion worth of Chinese goods.
That threat may have spawned another trade bump.
China's exports unexpectedly returned to growth in May - rising 1.1% and prompting speculation that Chinese exporters rushed out shipments to avoid the new U.S. tariffs.

It typically takes about 10 to 14 days for cargo ships to make the trip directly from China to the U.S. West Coast. Many ships call at multiple ports before crossing the ocean, adding weeks to the trip.

The Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (RICS) house price measure - the difference between members reporting price rises and falls - improved to -10 from -22 in April.
That was its highest reading since October and was stronger than the median forecast of -21 in a Reuters poll of economists.
There were also signs of improvement in agreed sales and new instructions, but there was little sign of a pickup in transactions any time soon, RICS said.
""Much of the anecdotal insight provided by respondents is still quite cautious, reflecting concerns about both the underlying political and economic climate,"" said Simon Rubinsohn, RICS' chief economist.
EU leaders in April granted Britain a delay to its deadline for the leaving the bloc until the end of October. 
Britain's housing market has slowed sharply since the Brexit referendum in June 2016 when RICS' house price measure stood at +19. But there have been signs in recent months that the market might be bottoming out.

RICS, which said its price index typically has a six-month lead over other measures of house price inflation, said southeast England showed the weakest sentiment on price movements while London appeared to have bounced back a little.

The deficit was the highest ever for the month of May and wider than the average forecast of $185.5 billion in a Reuters poll of analysts.
Government spending rose to $440 billion, up 21% from May of 2018. Receipts increased to $232 billion, up 7% from the same month last year. 
Tariffs provided a modest boost to government coffers, with customs duties taking in $5 billion during the month, up from $3 billion in May 2018. The Trump administration has raised tariffs on several major trading partners - notably China.
Gross tax revenues from corporations fell to $6 billion in May from $7 billion a year earlier. Spending on the military rose to $62 billion.
Treasury officials who asked not to be identified said May's deficit would have been about $159 billion - smaller than the unadjusted results - when taking into account calendar differences including the timing of payments to Medicare.
The deficit for the fiscal year to date was $739 billion, compared with $532 billion in the comparable period the year earlier.
When adjusted for calendar effects, the deficit was $692 billion for the fiscal year to date versus $580 billion in the comparable prior period.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. consumer prices barely rose in May, pointing to moderate inflation that together with a slowing economy increased pressure on the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates this year.
But the report from the Labor Department on Wednesday will likely not shift Fed officials' views that temporary factors are behind the weak inflation readings. Airline fares, among the transitory factors identified by Fed Chairman Jerome Powell, rebounded and apparel prices stabilized after two straight monthly decreases.
U.S. central bank policymakers are scheduled to meet on June 18-19 against the backdrop of rising trade tensions, slowing growth and a sharp step-down in hiring in May that has led financial markets to price in at least two rate cuts by the end of 2019. A rate cut is not expected next Wednesday. 
""This soft inflation backdrop reinforces our call for two (rate) cuts later this year,"" said Michael Feroli, an economist at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) in New York. ""We think next week is probably too soon to expect that action, given that growth is still holding in and trade-related risks remain two-sided.""
The consumer price index edged up 0.1% last month as a rebound in the cost of food was offset by cheaper gasoline, the government said. The CPI gained 0.3% in April. 
In the 12 months through May, the CPI increased 1.8%, slowing from April's 1.9% gain. May's rise in the CPI was broadly in line with economists' expectations.
Excluding the volatile food and energy components, the CPI nudged up 0.1% for the fourth straight month, the longest such stretch since April 2017. The so-called core CPI was held down by a sharp decline in the prices of used cars and trucks as well as motor vehicle insurance. 
In the 12 months through May, the so-called core CPI rose 2.0% after advancing 2.1% in April. 
U.S. Treasury prices were trading mostly higher, while the dollar was little changed against a basket of currencies. Stocks on Wall Street slipped as the rate-cut hopes were overshadowed by investor anxiety over the U.S.-China trade war.
GROWTH SLOWING 
U.S. President Donald Trump in early May slapped additional tariffs of up to 25% on $200 billion of Chinese goods, prompting retaliation by Beijing. Trump on Monday threatened further duties on Chinese imports if no deal was reached when he meets Chinese President Xi Jinping at a G20 summit at the end of this month in Japan. 
Economists have warned that the tariffs will undercut the economy, which will celebrate 10 years of expansion in July, the longest in history. Powell said last week the Fed was closely monitoring the implications of the trade war on the economy and would ""act as appropriate to sustain the expansion.""
Data so far have suggested a sharp slowdown in U.S. economic growth in the second quarter after a temporary boost from exports and an accumulation of inventory early in the year. Job growth slowed sharply in May. Manufacturing production, exports and home sales dropped in April, while consumer spending cooled. 
The Atlanta Fed is forecasting gross domestic product to increase at a 1.4% annualized rate in the April-June quarter. The economy grew at a 3.1% pace in the first quarter.
A survey of chief executive officers published on Wednesday showed unease about trade policy negatively impacting sales expectations as well as capital spending and hiring plans over the next six months. 
The Fed's preferred inflation measure, the core personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index, increased 1.6 percent in the year to April after gaining 1.5% in March. Data for May will be released later this month. The core PCE price index has been running below the Fed's 2% target this year. 
Gasoline prices fell 0.5% in May after rising 5.7% in April. Food prices rebounded 0.3% in May after dipping 0.1% in the prior month. Owners' equivalent rent of primary residence, which is what a homeowner would pay to rent or receive from renting a home, increased 0.3% in May after rising 0.3% in April.
Healthcare costs increased 0.3%, matching April's rise. That mirrored an increase in healthcare costs at the producer level, suggesting a pickup in the core PCE price index in May. There were gains in hospital and doctor fees. But prices for prescription medication fell 0.2%. 
Apparel prices were unchanged in May after tumbling 0.8% in the prior month. They had declined for two months in a row after the government introduced a new method and data to calculate apparel prices. Economists expect the duties on Chinese goods to lift apparel prices in the coming months.
""That's going to change with new tariffs on the way unless apparel companies can teach other nations to knit sweaters as well as Chinese workers can do,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG in New York.
Prices for used motor vehicles and trucks tumbled 1.4%. That was the largest drop since last September and marked the fourth straight monthly decrease. The cost of motor vehicle insurance fell 0.4%, the most since May 2007. The cost of recreation also decreased.

But prices for airline tickets rebounded 2.0% after falling for two straight months. Prices for household furnishings and new vehicles rose in May. Household furnishings prices are likely to trend higher in the coming months because of the duties on Chinese imports.

(Reuters) - U.S. mortgage applications jumped to their highest level in more than 2-1/2 years last week, led by a surge in refinancing activity, as some home borrowing costs tumbled to their cheapest level since September 2017, the Mortgage Bankers Association said on Wednesday.
The Washington-based group's seasonally adjusted index on loan requests, both to buy a home and to refinance one, increased by 26.8% to 529.8 in the week ended June 7, which was the highest since September 2016.
Interest rates on 30-year fixed-rate ""conforming"" mortgages, or loans whose balances are $484,350 or less, decreased to 4.12%, the lowest level since September 2017. The previous week they averaged 4.23%.
Mortgage rates have fallen in step with declining bond yields as investors poured money into low-risk U.S. Treasuries due to signs of a softening jobs market and worries about trade tensions between China and other trading partners.
""Despite the less positive outlook, both purchase and refinance applications surged, driven mainly by these lower rates,"" Joel Kan, the MBA's associate vice president of economic and industry forecasting, said in a statement.
MBA's barometer on refinancing activity jumped 46.5% from the prior week to 1,956.5, a level not seen since November 2016.
The refinance share of total mortgage applications expanded to 49.8% from 42.2% the prior week.
The group's gauge on applications for home purchases, which is seen as a proxy on future housing activity, grew by 10% to 278.4, the highest level since the week of April 12.

Despite the increase, domestic home sales have been limited by tight supply and rising economic worries among potential home buyers, Kan said.

The share of lenders surveyed who said they expect their profits to increase in the next three months exceeded the share of those who expect a decrease by 29 percentage points.
The reading was the second most positive since the survey began in the first quarter of 2014.
The latest figure was a switch from the first quarter when the share of lenders who were pessimistic about future profits exceeded the share of those who were optimistic by 8 percentage point.
""This quarter, 'consumer demand' jumped significantly and is now the top reason cited by lenders who reported an increased profit margin outlook, reaching the highest reading since Q2 2016,"" the mortgage finance agency said in a statement.
Average 30-year interest rates on ""conforming"" mortgages fell to 4.23% last week, the lowest since January 2018, as home borrowing costs have fallen in step with U.S. bond yields on worries about weakening economic growth due to trade tensions between the United States and its trading partners, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association.
The drop in mortgage rates had spurred applications for home purchases and refinancing in late March and early April, but those application activities have tapered since, MBA data showed.
""A lift in lender sentiment from depressed levels is an encouraging sign; however, many challenges remain, including the continued shortage of entry-level housing,"" Fannie Mae's chief economist Doug Duncan said.
Meanwhile, the easing of lending standards among home lenders reached their lowest levels since 2014 in the second quarter, but it will unlikely ease much more, according to Duncan.

1105,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jun 12, 2019 08:30AM ET</span>","U.S. Core Inflation Cools, Bolstering Case for Fed Rate Cut","(Bloomberg) -- A closely-watched measure of U.S. inflation trailed forecasts in May as prices fell for used vehicles, reinforcing the case for the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates amid headwinds including trade and global growth.
The so-called core consumer price index, which removes energy and food costs, rose 2% from a year earlier, below forecasts, according to a Labor Department report Wednesday, while rising 0.1% from the prior month for a fourth-straight time and also missing estimates. The broader CPI increased an annual 1.8%, less than projected.
Below-forecast inflation follows signs of slower economic growth in the U.S. that would only bolster investor expectations for Fed rate cuts this year. Weighing even heavier are signs of lackluster expansions at home and abroad, along with President Donald Trump’s tariffs on Chinese goods.
Lower gasoline prices played a role in keeping broader inflation tame. Energy prices fell 0.6% from the prior month and 0.5% from a year earlier as all major components in the category fell on an annual basis.
Apparel prices were unchanged after two steep declines. Readings have trended lower after the Commerce Department changed its data collection methodology.
Fed Target
At the same time, inflation is showing signs of firming by another measure that the Fed prefers. That core price gauge -- linked to spending and excluding food and energy -- firmed in April for the first time this year, though remained below the Fed’s 2% target. It tends to run slightly below the Labor Department’s CPI.
Powell, in a speech last week, opened the door to interest-rate cuts after holding in May that below-target inflation was due to transitory factors. Bond-market investors expect the central bank to lower rates as it tries to brace the economy for slowing global growth, lower corporate spending and a weaker consumer outlook.
Trump has maintained public pressure on the Fed to cut interest rates, lamenting Monday that he didn’t have China-style control over monetary policy. Fed officials will next meet June 18-19.
While Trump raised tariffs on some Chinese goods early in May, the impact wouldn’t apply broadly until imports reach their final destination and may not filter through into consumer prices for some time.

1106,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jun 12, 2019 07:10AM ET</span>",Turkey Holds Rates Again as Lira Wobbles Before Election Do-Over,"(Bloomberg) -- Turkey’s central bank extended its interest-rate pause to nine months as it waits for a more stable lira before a controversial rerun of Istanbul elections.
The Monetary Policy Committee kept its benchmark at 24% on Wednesday, in line with the forecasts of all but three of the 25 economists surveyed by Bloomberg. The rest predicted a cut. The MPC has stood pat since an increase of 625 basis points in September.
“It is too early to expect the central bank to ease monetary policy,” Piotr Matys, a London-based strategist at Rabobank, said before the announcement. “The main reason is insufficient stability of the Turkish lira as observed since the end of March.”
Having laid the groundwork for a softer stance in April, Governor Murat Cetinkaya now has to contend with risks far outside his control. A looming ballot in Istanbul in less than two weeks, compounded by tensions with the U.S., could plunge Turkey into renewed turmoil as the economy struggles to heal after a currency crash last summer.
Investors already anticipate the Turkish currency will remain among the world’s most unstable, with its three-month implied volatility the highest globally. The lira traded stronger against the dollar after the rate decision, extending the best performance in emerging markets over the past month.
If sustained, gains in the lira may eventually be enough to prompt policy makers to cut rates in the coming months, especially now that a slowdown in inflation is becoming entrenched. Adjusted for prices, rates in Turkey are about double the level among peers such as Russia and South Africa.
The case for monetary easing in Turkey is also improving thanks to the dovish turn by global central banks. The Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank are sounding more open to stimulus, while their counterparts in India and Australia already cut rates.
For now, inflation remains more than triple the official target of 5%, limiting the central bank’s options as the lira faces a choppy outlook. Treasury and Finance Minister Berat Albayrak is more upbeat, predicting price growth will be in single digits in September to October after slowing for a second month in May.
A rate cut this week would have been premature, according to Kubilay Ozturk, an economist at  Deutsche Bank  AG (DE:DBKGn) who’s ranked by Bloomberg as the most accurate forecaster of Turkish rate decisions.
Monetary easing is more likely in the second half “as further disinflation in the pipeline would make them less concerned about the impact of their policy actions on the lira,” he said before the rate announcement.

1107,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 12, 2019 02:29AM ET</span>",China's factory inflation slows as manufacturing stumbles; food prices soar,"By Stella Qiu and Ryan Woo
BEIJING (Reuters) - China's factory inflation slowed in May as faltering manufacturing hit demand, reinforcing worries about cooling growth in the world's second-largest economy, while a surge in food prices could add to consumer grievances about living costs.
The slowdown was driven by declines in industrial commodities prices and was in line with the downbeat factory activity seen in May. It also comes amid China's worsening trade dispute with Washington, which analysts fear could trigger a global recession.
China's producer price index (PPI) in May rose 0.6% year-on-year, the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) said in a statement on Wednesday, in line with analyst expectations and lower than a 0.9% uptick in April.
In contrast to the softer upstream prices, consumer inflation accelerated, driven by soaring food prices, which rose at their fastest pace in seven years, as bad weather hit fruit production and African swine fever wiped out pork supply.
However, while analysts expect some upside risks to the headline consumer price index in coming months, most do not expect retail inflation to constrain the central bank's hand in easing monetary policy to prop up slowing growth.
""With economic growth unlikely to stage a strong recovery and industrial commodity prices likely to remain subdued, we don't see much upside to PPI and non-food CPI,"" said Capital Economics in a note on Wednesday. 
Producer inflation gauges in China, closely tracked by analysts and investors, are seen as bellwethers of industrial demand in the economy.
As the trade war between Washington and Beijing heats up, investors and analysts are increasingly concerned the dispute could erode global demand for production.
China's exports unexpectedly returned to modest growth in May but imports fell at the sharpest rate in nearly three years.

Despite Beijing's effort to step up big-ticket infrastructure projects, sluggish demand has dragged growth in the prices of construction materials.

SOARING FOOD PRICES
The consumer price index (CPI) in May rose 2.7 % from a year earlier, NBS data showed on Wednesday, in line with expectations and the fastest rise since February 2018.
The headline jump was driven by a 7.7% year-on-year increase in the food price index, the fastest pace since January 2010 and higher than April's reading of 6.1%.
Fresh fruit prices soared 26.7% in May from a year earlier and hovered around historical highs, according to NBS, after bad weather hit major producing regions, while the escalating China-U.S. trade war made it difficult for fruit traders to find alternatives to fill the shortage.
However, Chen Changsheng, a researcher with China's State Council, said the government should look past these short-term disturbances in their deliberations over macroeconomic policy. 
""Even though the headline CPI figure will face some upward risks...but from the macro perspective, we advise looking at the core CPI,"" Chen said at a forum in Beijing at the end of last month.
The core inflation that strips out volatile food and energy prices eased to 1.6% in May from a year earlier, from 1.7% a month earlier. 
On a month-on-month basis, the CPI remain unchanged, compared with a 0.1% gain in April.

Westpac Banking Corp.’s consumer sentiment index fell 0.6% in June, while Australia & New Zealand Banking Group Ltd.’s weekly report showed a 2% drop, the lenders said Wednesday. Westpac noted that confidence was showing signs of strength in the lead up to the policy easing, but that fell away in the following days -- suggesting respondents were impacted by last week’s GDP data showing the weakest annual expansion in 10 years.
“This is a disappointing result,” said Matthew Hassan, Westpac’s senior economist. It “suggests deepening concerns about the economy have outweighed the initial boost from lower rates.”
The biggest decline in Westpac’s sub-indexes was the one tracking economic expectations for the next year, which slid 4.7%.
RBA Governor Philip Lowe ended an almost three-year pause to cut the cash rate to a new record low of 1.25% last Tuesday as he tries to encourage firms to hire and invest and revive a slowing economy and tepid inflation. His decision was validated in a separate survey of businesses released yesterday that showed a continued deterioration in conditions.
Lowe is aiming to drive down unemployment to help return inflation to its 2-3% target. But the Westpac report showed consumer confidence in the labor market is faltering, with an expectations index for unemployment jumping 5.1%.
Australians are struggling under record-high household debt and a period of prolonged weak wages growth. Their financial position has been further hurt by falling house prices. All that has weighed on consumer spending that accounts for 60% of GDP, and prompted the RBA’s decision to lower borrowing costs to try to put more cash in people’s pockets.
Underscoring policy makers’ concerns, the Sydney Morning Herald reported Tuesday that Lowe met with key members of parliament’s upper house and urged them to pass the government’s proposed tax cuts to inject more disposable income into the economy.
Traders are pricing in a better than 70% chance of another RBA rate cut in August.

1110,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 11, 2019 08:55PM ET</span>","Australian consumers fret on economy, more upbeat on housing: survey","SYDNEY (Reuters) - A measure of Australian consumer confidence dipped in June as a run of disappointing data on the economy overshadowed a cut in interest rates and a hint of stability in falling house prices.
Wednesday's survey showed the Melbourne Institute and Westpac Bank index of consumer sentiment fell 0.6% in June, following gains the previous two months.
The index was down 1.4% from a year earlier at 100.7, meaning optimists just outnumbered pessimists.
The survey of 1,200 people was conducted as data showed the Australian economy grew at its slowest pace in a decade in the March quarter.
The weakness led the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) to cut interest rates to a record low of 1.25%, and to leave the door open to further easing in coming months.
""This is a disappointing result given the cut in official interest rates this month and suggests deepening concerns about the economy have outweighed the initial boost from lower rates,"" said Westpac senior economist Matthew Hassan.
As a result, the survey's measure of economic conditions for the next 12 months dropped 4.7%, while family finances compared to a year ago fell 2.4%.
There was a little more optimism on the future, with the economic outlook for the next five years bouncing 1.0% and family finances over the year ahead up 3.1%.
The impact of the rate cut showed in respondents who held a mortgage where confidence improved by 2.8%, while it fell among renters and those who owned a home outright.
A measure of whether it was a good time to buy a major household item eased 0.2%, but the mood on housing picked up with the index of whether it was a good time to buy rising 1.8%.
Indeed, Westpac's index of house price expectations surged 22.7% in June to its highest since August 2018.

""Overall, the mix suggests consumers see policy shifts as a clear positive for the price outlook but a much more mixed result for buyers in terms of affordability,"" said Hassan.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's machinery orders unexpectedly rose for a third straight month in April, in a sign business investment is holding up even as an intensifying Sino-U.S. trade war and global slowdown pile pressure on the country's export sector.
Cabinet Office data released on Wednesday showed core machinery orders, a highly volatile data series regarded as an indicator of capital spending in the coming six to nine months, increased 5.2% in April from the previous month.
The reading compared with economists' median estimate of a 0.8% decline in a Reuters poll, and a 3.8% rise in March.
Capital spending has been a bright spot in the world's third largest economy, driven by investment in high-tech and labour-saving technology to cope with a labour crunch in the ageing society and refurbishing demand for upgrading old plants and equipment.
Although capital spending has so far been resilient to external headwinds, Japanese firms may turn cautious about boosting investment if uncertainty over the global economy and the bruising U.S.-China trade dispute persist, analysts say.
Washington and Beijing have been locked in a tit-for-tat tariff war for nearly a year, which has curbed global trade and upended supply chains ranging from Asia to Europe, undermining Japan's exports and factory output.
Solid domestic demand could dampen speculation that Prime Minister Shinzo Abe may once again postpone a twice-delayed sales tax hike to 10% from the current 8% in October.
The Cabinet Office raised its assessment of machinery orders, saying they are showing a pick-up. 

Compared with a year earlier, core orders, which exclude ships and generators, rose 2.5% in April, versus a 5.3% drop seen by economists, the Cabinet Office data showed.

1113,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 11, 2019 12:10PM ET</span>","French central bank trims outlook on weaker trade, consumer spending","PARIS (Reuters) - The French central bank trimmed its economic growth outlook on Tuesday as demand from trading partners for exports weakens and consumers save extra income rather than spending it.
The Bank of France forecast the euro zone's second-biggest economy would grow 1.3% this year and 1.4% next year, down from estimates in March of 1.4% and 1.5%, respectively. It kept its 2021 forecast at 1.4%.
Slowing global trade growth had darkened the outlook since the central bank's last forecasts with demand for French products and services notably weaker from China, Germany and Italy.
Meanwhile, consumers were saving more than expected as they benefit from extra income coming from government measures aimed at boosting household purchasing power, the central bank said. [nL8N23521Y]
Facing weekly waves of protests against economic policies viewed as overly pro-business, President Emmanuel Macron announced in December concessions worth more than 10 billion euros ($11.3 billion) to lift the earnings of the poorest workers and pensioners.
He followed up in April with a promise cut income tax by 5 billion euros from next year, which the Bank of France has not yet taken into account in its forecasts.
The central bank said households had squirreled away about two-thirds of the income gains already reaching them because the measures targeted specifically the poor, who it said had less of an inclination to spend than the rich.
However, over time households were expected to ease back on their savings and the income gains were expected to fuel higher spending from next year.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Underlying U.S. producer prices increased solidly for a second straight month in May, boosted by a surge in the cost of hotel accommodation and gains in portfolio management service fees.
The report from the Labor Department on Tuesday likely will support the Federal Reserve's view that recent weak price readings are probably transitory, and that inflation will gradually move toward the U.S. central bank's 2 percent target.
""There is no evidence of falling inflation in this report,"" said John Ryding, chief economist at RDQ Economics in New York. 
Producer prices excluding food, energy and trade services rose 0.4% last month, matching April's gain, the government said. The so-called core PPI increased 2.3% in the 12 months through May after rising 2.2% in April.
Weaker energy and food prices, however, partially offset the increase in prices of services last month. That led the producer price index for final demand to edge up 0.1% in May after gaining 0.2% in April. In the 12 months through May, the PPI climbed 1.8%, slowing from April's 2.2% advance.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the PPI would nudge up 0.1% in May and rise 2.0% on a year-on-year basis.
Fed policymakers are scheduled to meet on June 18-19 against the backdrop of rising trade tensions, slowing growth and a sharp step-down in hiring in May that has led financial markets to price in at least two interest rate cuts by the end of 2019.
President Donald Trump in early May slapped additional tariffs of up to 25% on $200 billion of Chinese goods, prompting retaliation by Beijing. Trump on Monday threatened further duties on Chinese imports if no deal was reached when he meets Chinese President Xi Jinping at a G20 summit later this month in Japan. 
A tariff on all goods from Mexico to force authorities in that country to curb migrants, mostly from Central America, from crossing the border into the United States was narrowly averted after the two nations struck an agreement late on Friday.
Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said last week that the U.S. central bank was closely monitoring the implications of the trade tensions on the economy and would ""act as appropriate to sustain the expansion."" A rate cut is not expected next Wednesday. Trump on Tuesday renewed his attack on the Fed and described low inflation as ""a beautiful thing.""
The Fed's preferred inflation measure, the core personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index, increased 1.6 percent in the year to April after gaining 1.5% in March. Data for May will be released later this month. 
The dollar was flat against a basket of currencies, while U.S. Treasury prices fell. Stocks on Wall Street were trading higher.
STRONG HOTEL, PORTFOLIO FEES
The services-led increase in the core PPI last month is likely to translate into a slightly higher reading for other underlying inflation measures in May. According to a Reuters survey of economists, core consumer prices probably increased 0.2% last month after nudging up 0.1% in April. The consumer price data will be published on Wednesday.
Prices for hotel accommodation surged 10.1% in May, the most since April 2009. That accounted for nearly 80 percent of the rise in services prices in May. Services prices rose 0.3% after gaining 0.1% in April.
The cost of healthcare services increased 0.2% last month after increasing 0.3% in April. There were increases in the prices for both inpatient and outpatient care last month. Those healthcare costs feed into the core PCE price index. 
Portfolio management service fees, identified by the Fed's Powell as one of the transitory factors restraining inflation, rose 1.8% in May after surging 5.3% in April. These prices, which are being supported by a rebound in the stock market, are likely to lift the core PCE price index in May. The cost of passenger transportation services also increased last month.
""We continue to expect that core PCE inflation will not fall too much further from here and should return closer towards the 2% target later in the year and into 2020,"" said Veronica Clark, an economist at  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) in New York. 
Last month, wholesale energy prices fell 1.0% after rising 1.8% in the prior month. Goods prices slipped 0.2% last month after gaining 0.3% in April. Wholesale food prices fell 0.3% in May, led by a 32.1% tumble in the cost of eggs. 

Core goods prices were unchanged for a second straight month. Upcoming data will be closely watched for the effects of the latest tariff on Chinese goods. Previous duties impacted prices for machinery, equipment and some household furniture goods.

The seasonally adjusted rise in output was the third monthly increase in four months, and offset a decline in industrial production of 1.2% during March, according to data published by statistics institute INEGI.
Latin America's second biggest economy contracted by 0.2% during the first quarter, stirring fears that Mexico could enter a recession if activity did not pick up.
The rise in output was driven by a 0.6% monthly increase in manufacturing, a 2.2% rise in construction activity and a 1.6% increase in production by energy providers and utilities, the data showed. Mining output was down 0.6%.
Compared with the previous year, Mexican industrial output declined by 2.9%, more than the 2.5% drop forecast in a Reuters poll of analysts.
Recession fears were fanned last month when U.S. President Donald Trump vowed to impose punitive tariffs on Mexican exports to the United States if the government did not do more to contain illegal immigration from Central America.
Mexico and the United States struck a deal last Friday to avert the tariffs, but the Trump administration said it may still introduce the duties if migration is not curbed.

Total earnings growth, including bonuses, rose by an annual 3.1% in the three months to April, official data showed, slowing from 3.3% in March but beating the median forecast of 3.0% in a Reuters poll of economists, the Office for National Statistics said.
Excluding bonuses, which smooths out some volatility, pay growth picked up to 3.4% from 3.3%, beating all forecasts and boosted by a 3.8% annual jump in pay for April alone, the largest single-month rise since May 2008.
""Overall, the labour market continues to be strong,"" ONS statistician Matt Hughes said.
Britain's labour market has performed robustly since Britain voted to leave the European Union in June 2016, in contrast to other parts of the economy which have suffered from uncertainty about the timing and terms on which Britain will leave.
Official figures on Monday showed the economy shrank by 0.4% in April, its biggest monthly drop since 2016.
The unemployment rate remained at 3.8% as expected, its joint-lowest since the three months to January 1975, and the absolute number of people out of work dropped by 34,000 to 1.304 million.
The number of people in employment rose by 32,000 to 32.746 million, the smallest increase since the three months to August last year, as employers increasingly say it is hard to find staff.
The BoE last month said it expected wage growth of 3% at the end of this year. 

But it sees Britain's hiring spree as a reflection of how many firms have opted to take on workers rather than commit to longer-term investments.

Sentiment jumped 7 points in May from 0 the previous month, the biggest gain since the center-right government came to power almost six years ago, National Australia Bank Ltd.’s survey showed Tuesday. The conditions index -- measuring hiring, sales and profits -- slumped to 1 from 3.
“Trading conditions and profits are particularly weak,” said Alan Oster, chief economist at NAB. “The employment index which we are watching closely, partially reversed some of its decline last month, but is only around average.”
Reserve Bank Governor Philip Lowe cut rates last week for the first time since he took the helm in 2016 to encourage firms to hire and invest in an economy that’s sharply decelerated in the past nine months. Confidence was bolstered by Morrison’s come-from-behind win on May 18, which was bracketed by the NAB survey that ran from the 14th-24th.
Conditions “are now well below average -- the key message remains that the private sector continues to lose momentum,” Oster said. “The goods distribution industries, especially retail -- which is clearly in recession -- remain particularly weak, and manufacturing” is not far behind.
“Worryingly, forward orders declined further, and capacity utilization is now a touch below average,” he said. “With activity continuing to lose momentum, and capacity utilization declining, the survey continues to show weak price pressure across inputs and final products.”
Australia’s economy expanded in the first three months of the year at the slowest annual pace in a decade and inflation barely registered in the period. Growth is almost entirely supported by government spending currently and the RBA is urging Morrison and his ministers to address policies that will boost productivity and living standards.

LONDON (Reuters) - British construction firms report having almost a third less work in the pipeline than a year ago, with Brexit and the collapse of larger contractors a major worry, an annual survey of subcontractors showed on Tuesday.
Subcontractors reported having 19 weeks of work to fall back on, down from 27 weeks a year earlier, according to the survey by trade finance provider Bibby Financial Services, an advance copy of which was provided to Reuters.
The subdued mood echoes official construction data released on Monday, which showed a sharp slowdown in annual growth to 2.4% in April, while May's IHS Markit/CIPS construction purchasing managers' index (PMI) dropped to its lowest since March 2018.
""It's been a tough year for the subcontracting sector, with the industry reeling from the collapse of two large high-profile contractors - and further impacted by the recent announcements regarding British Steel, Bibby's managing director for construction, Helen Wheeler, said.
Brexit was the most commonly cited threat on the horizon, named by a quarter of firms, but two thirds of the subcontractors said they had not prepared for it.
Britain is due to leave the European Union on Oct. 31. An earlier planned departure date on March 29 prompted many manufacturers to stockpile raw materials in case of border disruption, only to be wrongfooted when Brexit was delayed.
""Brexit, the dominance of large contractors and late payment problems are all acting as brakes on the sector,"" Wheeler said.

Many smaller British construction firms have been left out of pocket by the collapse of by major contractors Interserve in March and Carillion just over a year earlier.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. job openings fell slightly in April, but a surge in hiring to a record high suggested strong demand for labor before a recent escalation in trade tensions that was partly blamed for a sharp slowdown in employment growth last month.
The Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey, or JOLTS report from the Labor Department on Monday also showed an uptick in layoffs, though they remained at historically low levels.
Trade tensions between the United States and China worsened following a move by President Donald Trump in early May to impose additional tariffs of up to 25% on $200 billion of Chinese goods, prompting retaliation by Beijing. 
A tariff on all goods from Mexico to force authorities in that country to stop immigrants from Central America from crossing the border into the United States was averted after the two nations struck an 11th hour agreement late on Friday.
""The April JOLTS report probably is not the most useful indicator about current labor market conditions,"" said Daniel Silver, an economist at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) in New York. ""But for what it's worth, the JOLTS data show that conditions in the labor market generally remained favorable as of April.""
Job openings, a measure of labor demand, slipped to a seasonally adjusted 7.4 million from 7.5 million in March, the government said. The job openings rate was unchanged at 4.7%. Hiring jumped by 240,000 jobs in April to 5.9 million, the highest level since the government started tracking the series in 2000. The hiring rate increased to 3.9% from 3.8% in March.
The economy created only 75,000 jobs in May after adding 224,000 positions in April, the government reported last Friday. The unemployment rate was unchanged near a 50-year low of 3.6%.
QUITS RATE STEADY
Job openings have been trending sideways since hitting an all-time high of 7.6 million in November. Some economists viewed this as a sign that the labor market was slowing, regardless of the impact of the trade fights on hiring decisions by companies.
""The lack of improvement in job openings points to demand for labor leveling off and suggests that the slowdown in hiring evidenced in Friday’s payroll report was not a blip,"" said Sarah House, a senior economist at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) Securities in Charlotte, North Carolina. 
""While today’s report is consistent with some cooling in hiring, the labor market is hardly falling off the rails.""
Vacancies in the federal government increased by 22,000 jobs in April. But job openings decreased by 172,000 in the professional and business services sector. The increase in hiring was concentrated in the private sector, with employers in the real estate and rental and leasing industries filling 34,000 vacancies in April. 
The number of workers voluntarily quitting their jobs was little changed at 3.5 million in April, keeping the quits rate at 2.3% for 11 consecutive months. The quits rate is viewed by policymakers and economists as a measure of job market confidence.
Layoffs edged up in April, lifting the layoffs rate to 1.2% from 1.1% in the prior month. Layoffs increased in the real estate and rental and leasing industry.

""While these data obviously precede the May payroll report, they do show that there was no signs of labor market demand beginning to fade,"" said John Ryding, chief economist at RDQ Economics in New York. ""We think payroll growth will bounce back in June.""

Early in 2019, many motor manufacturers had announced temporary shutdowns in Britain for April, anticipating trade disruption around the time Britain was due to leave the European Union on March 29.
In the event, Prime Minister Theresa May delayed departure with just days to go and subsequently set a new date of Oct. 31 -- but that was too late for businesses to change their plans.
Britain's economy overall contracted by 0.4% in April after a 0.1% decline in March, the Office for National Statistics said on Monday, a bigger drop than any economist had forecast in a Reuters poll last week.
Growth in the three months to April slowed to 0.3% from 0.5% in the first quarter of 2019, also a sharper deceleration than most economists had expected. Annual growth slowed to 1.3%.
But this masked a far bigger impact for manufacturing, which shrank by 3.9% for the month in April, the biggest fall since June 2002.
Car production in April fell 24% on the month, the biggest drop since records began in 1995, and the broader category of ""transport equipment"" showed its largest drop since 1974.
""GDP growth showed some weakening across the latest three months with the economy shrinking in the month of April, mainly due to a dramatic fall in car production, with uncertainty ahead of the UK's original EU departure date leading to planned shutdowns,"" ONS statistician Rob Kent-Smith said.
BMW shut its UK Mini and Rolls-Royce (LON:RR) plants for all of April. Peugeot's Vauxhall car factory and Jaguar Land Rover also brought forward planned summer shutdowns to April.
Monday's data confirm the economy is slowing after getting a bigger-than-expected boost in the first three months of 2019 from businesses stockpiling before a Brexit that never came.
The Bank of England forecast last month that GDP growth would slow to 0.2% during the three months to June from 0.5% in the first quarter of the year, though on Saturday its chief economist Andy Haldane wrote that he still expected ""solid"" growth of 1.5% for 2019 overall.
May's purchasing managers' index surveys pointed to the economy being close to stagnation, although they were similarly gloomy in the first quarter when official data turned out strong, despite business concerns about Brexit.
""April’s dip in GDP and apparent ongoing softness in May reinforces our belief that the economy is headed for a markedly weakened performance in the second quarter,"" Howard Archer, chief economist at consultants EY ITEM Club, said in a note.
""We had expecting GDP growth to be no more than 0.2% quarter-on-quarter in the second quarter, but even this muted performance is now looking somewhat optimistic.""
Britain's economy has lost momentum since 2016's Brexit referendum - before which growth would typically exceed 2% a year - but the job market has strengthened and Haldane said the time for another rate rise was approaching.
This stance contrasts with the view in markets, where concern about the trade conflict between the United States and China has intensified, alongside the risk that Britain could still face a disruptive departure from the EU on Oct. 31.
The impact of the twin concerns of trade tensions and Brexit could also be seen in trade data, also released on Monday.
Britain saw its biggest monthly fall in goods imports since records began in 1998, down 14.4% in April. Exports also slid on a monthly basis, down 10.9% in April, the biggest fall since July 2006.
The trade deficit narrowed as elevated levels of imports by businesses to prepare for Brexit before the March 29 deadline fell back. 

The trade balance for goods narrowed to 12.1 billion pounds ($15.36 billion) from 15.4 billion pounds in March.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's economy grew slightly faster than initially estimated in the first quarter, thanks to stronger capital spending, but analysts say global trade tensions remain a drag on growth and raise risks to the outlook for the export-reliant nation. 
The world's third-largest economy is facing growing downward pressure as the U.S.-China trade war intensifies and global demand wanes, while at home consumers are reluctant to spend. 
""Although capital spending was revised up, it is expected to deteriorate as foreign demand continues to weaken due to the U.S.-China trade tensions,"" said Hiroaki Mutou, chief economist at Tokai Tokyo Research Institute.
""Consumer spending remains weak as wages have not risen as previously expected. If external demand worsens further, it could dampen both corporate and consumer sentiment and rein in their spending."" 
The economy grew an annualized 2.2% in January-March, stronger than economists' forecast for 2.1% annualized growth and the preliminary reading of the same rate of expansion, Cabinet Office data showed on Monday. In the fourth quarter, gross domestic product (GDP) rose an annualized 1.8%.
The annualized growth rate translates into quarter-on-quarter expansion of 0.6% from the previous quarter, compared with a 0.5% growth in the initial reading and the median forecast.
The capital spending component of GDP rose 0.3% from the previous quarter, versus the median forecast for a 0.5% increase and the preliminary 0.3% fall.
Private consumption, which accounts for some 60% of GDP fell 0.1% in the first quarter from the previous three months, unchanged from the preliminary reading.
The revised GDP confirmed imports fell faster than exports in the first quarter, underlining the broadening pressure across the economy as consumers grow more cautious. 
That may explain why a separate Cabinet Office survey showed a worsening in sentiment in a key group of employees. The called ""economy watchers"" sentiment index, which measures business confidence among workers such as taxi drivers, hotel workers and restaurant staff worsened to about a three year low in May. 
Group of 20 finance leaders on Sunday said that trade and geopolitical tensions have ""intensified"", raising risks to improving global growth, but they stopped short of calling for a resolution of the deepening U.S.-China trade conflict. 
The Bank of Japan is among major central banks that could come under pressure to ramp up its already massive stimulus program, as the trade dispute raises fears of a global recession. BOJ Governor Haruhiko Kuroda has said rates could be kept ultra-low for at least one more year to support the economy. 
Net exports - or exports minus imports - added 0.4 percentage point to growth, while domestic demand contributed 0.1 percentage point to GDP - both were unchanged from the initial reading.
Japanese exports contracted for the fifth month in April due to a slump in shipments of chip-making equipment to China, while a private survey last week showed the nation's manufacturing activity swung back into contraction in May as export orders fell at the fastest pace in four months.
The data underlined the growing threat to the economy from the bruising Sino-U.S. trade war, and has stoked speculation that Prime Minister Shinzo Abe may delay a sales tax hike for a third time to avoid a further blow to consumer spending.
However, the government has indicated it will go ahead with the sales tax hike to 10% from 8% in October, barring a big economic shock on the scale of the collapse of Lehman Brothers in 2008. 
Mutou at Tokai Tokyo Research expects the government to raise the tax, saying its plans for a host of stimulus steps would help ease its effects on households.

BEIJING (Reuters) - China's exports unexpectedly returned to growth in May despite higher U.S. tariffs, but imports fell the most in nearly three years in a further sign of weak domestic demand that could prompt Beijing to step up stimulus measures. 
Some analysts suspected Chinese exporters may have rushed out shipments to the United States to avoid new tariffs on $300 billion of goods that President Donald Trump is threatening to impose in a rapidly escalating trade dispute.
(GRAPHIC: China's economic trends - http://tmsnrt.rs/2iO9Q6a) 
But Monday's better-than-expected export data is unlikely to ease fears that a longer and costlier U.S.-China trade war may no longer be avoidable, pushing the global economy towards recession.
China's May exports rose 1.1% from a year earlier, compared with market expectations for a modest decline, customs data showed.
""We expect export growth to remain positive in June, likely supported by continued front-loading of U.S.-bound exports, but it should then tumble in the third quarter, when we expect the threatened tariffs to be imposed,"" economists at Nomura said in a note to clients. 
""Therefore, we believe Beijing will likely step up its stimulus measures to stabilize financial markets and growth.""
Business distortions related to April's cut in the value-added tax (VAT) may also have eased, helping export readings, Nomura added. 
Analysts polled by Reuters had expected May shipments from the world's largest exporter to have fallen 3.8% from a year earlier, after a contraction of 2.7% percent in April.
While China is not as dependent on exports as in the past, they still account for nearly a fifth of its gross domestic product.
Trade tensions between Washington and Beijing escalated sharply last month after the Trump administration accused China of having ""reneged"" on promises to make structural changes to its economic practices.
Trump on May 10 slapped higher tariffs of up to 25% on $200 billion of Chinese goods and then took steps to levy duties on all remaining $300 billion Chinese imports. Beijing retaliated with tariff hikes on U.S. goods.
Trump has said he expects to hold a meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping at a G20 leaders' summit late this month, but analysts such as Capital Economics believe the chances of a lasting trade deal are receding as both sides appear to be digging in for a long battle.
Trade sanctions are spreading from goods to services, Capital Economics noted last week, with China issuing a warning to citizens about risks of traveling in the United States and U.S. lawmakers pushing to tighten visas for Chinese students.
Damage from the trade war along with a broader softening in global demand will make 2019 the worst year for trade since the financial crisis a decade ago, with only 0.2% growth, according to economists at ING. 
China's trade surplus with the United States, a major irritant for Washington, widened to a four-month high of $26.89 billion in May, from $21.01 billion in April, Monday's data showed.
Exports to the U.S. fell at a more moderate pace of 4.2 percent after dropping 13.2 percent in April, while China's imports of U.S. goods declined 26.8% from a year earlier. 
IMPORTS FALL WORST IN ALMOST 3 YEARS
China's May imports were much weaker than expected, falling 8.5 percent, the sharpest drop since July 2016. That left the country with a trade surplus of $41.65 billion for the month.
Analysts had forecast imports would fall 3.8%, reversing an expansion of 4% in April, which some had suspected was related to the reduction in the VAT.
Highlighting sluggish demand, imports of copper fell. The red metal is widely used in construction, electrical goods and manufacturing and is considered a bellwether for the health of an economy.
For January-May, China's total exports rose just 0.4% from a year earlier, while imports declined 3.7%.
MORE SUPPORT MEASURES EXPECTED
As trade pressures intensify, analysts believe China will loosen policy further in months ahead to shore up economic growth.
Investors are also watching to see how much Beijing allows the yuan to weaken to offset higher U.S. tariffs. The tightly-managed currency has depreciated nearly 3 percent against the dollar since trade tensions flared in early May and is nearing a closely watched support level.[CNY/]
Analysts do not expect a surprise devaluation from China like one in 2015, which could risk capital outflows and further angering Washington, but some believe more yuan weakness is inevitable if the trade war drags on.
Separate data on Monday showed China's foreign exchange reserves rose unexpectedly in May, suggesting the central bank has intervened only lightly to cushion the recent fall in the yuan.
The central bank has cut banks' reserve requirements (RRR) six times since early 2018 and guided some interest rates lower, while urging banks to lend more and keeping ample amounts of liquidity in the banking system.
A growing number of analysts believe it could cut benchmark interest rates in the event of a full-blown trade war, especially if the U.S. Federal Reserve eases policy first.
Beijing also has leaned more heavily on fiscal stimulus than in past downturns, possibly due to high levels of debt left over from past credit sprees. It has fast-tracked infrastructure projects, cut taxes for companies and raised export tax rebates.
The economy has yet to get back on firm footing, however. Factory activity in May contracted more than expected amid weak demand at home and abroad, an official survey showed.

Citing heightened trade uncertainties, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) last week cut its 2019 economic growth forecast for China to 6.2%, which would mark the country's weakest expansion in 29 years.

The Commerce Department said on Friday wholesale inventories rebounded 0.8%, instead of increasing 0.7% as reported last month. Wholesale inventories were unchanged in March. They rose 7.6% on a year-on-year basis in April.
The component of wholesale inventories that goes into the calculation of gross domestic product advanced 0.5% in April.
An accumulation in inventories contributed to the 3.1% annualized increase in GDP growth in the first quarter. Inventories are expected to be a drag on economic growth in the second quarter. Growth estimates for the second quarter are below a 2% pace.
The inventory overhang is concentrated in the automobile industry, which is experiencing a slowdown in sales. In April, wholesale auto inventories increased 3.8%, the largest gain since August 2018, after falling 0.3% in the prior month.
Sales at wholesalers dropped 0.4% in April after gaining 1.8% in March. At April's sales pace it would take wholesalers 1.34 months to clear shelves, up from 1.33 months in March.

Nonfarm payrolls (NFP) rose by just 75,000 in May, far below consensus expectations for 185,000, while wage inflation unexpectedly eased.
The weak reading comes amid concerns over a potential global recession due to Washington’s escalation of a trade dispute with China, and its use of tariffs to coerce Mexico into doing more to stop illegal immigration into the U.S.
Fed Chair Jerome Powell this week indicated a willingness to “act as appropriate to sustain the economic expansion” in face of recent developments involving trade negotiations.
Marc Chandler, chief market strategist at Bannockburn Global Forex indicated that the “disappointing” U.S. jobs data “can only fuel rate cut speculation and more technical evidence of a U.S. dollar top”.
Market reaction seemed to support Chandler’s opinion with the U.S. dollar index extending losses following the release. Bond yields also tumbled, with the benchmark 10-year Treasury hitting 2.07%, its lowest in nearly two years, and the more Fed-sensitive two-year note falling eight basis points to 1.80%, its lowest in 18 months.
“The Federal Reserve now has a domestic economic component to add to its decision matrix around the path of rate policy to what is a narrative around deteriorating global economic and financial conditions, an inverted yield curve and falling yields,” said Joseph Brusuelas, chief economist at consulting agency RSM US LLP.
Anthony Kurukgy, senior sales trader at Foenix Partners, also highlighted the miss in both job creation and earnings growth. “A continued downtrend in the jobs market may force the U.S. central bank to unwind some of 2018’s rate hikes in the second half of 2019,” he said.
Although a start to those rate cuts at the upcoming June 18-19 meeting seems unlikely without some unexpected meltdown in trade talks, markets still doubled their bets for a quarter-point reduction to above a 30% chance following the release.
With no further scheduled appearances from Fed officials as the blackout period kicks off on Saturday, markets will have no further input from policymakers until the June decision is announced.
The meeting will include updated economic forecasts on both the American economy and rate expectations, allowing the Fed the opportunity to guide markets on policy prospects.
Implied forward rates for fed funds now reflect a 78% chance of the first rate cut arriving in July, compared to 67% ahead of the report. Odds for a similar move in September jumped a similar amount to 64%, while the probability of a final 25 basis point cut in December jumped across the halfway mark to 60%."

Analysts in a Reuters poll had predicted a gain of 8,000 positions from April and a jobless rate of 5.7%. The 5.4% rate is the lowest since comparable data became available in 1976.
While on the surface the May data looked strong, Statscan said 33,800 public and private sector employees lost their jobs, while the number of self-employed rose by 61,500.
Employment in the services sector rose by a net 22,800 jobs on gains in healthcare and professional services. The goods-producing sector added a more modest 4,900 positions, thanks to strength in manufacturing.

The Bank of Canada held interest rates steady as expected on May 31, citing evidence that recent economic weakness was temporary and signaling it would remain on the sidelines as it kept a close eye on major data.

Nonfarm payrolls (NFP) rose by 75,000 in May, below consensus expectations for 185,000, according to official government data released on Friday. That was down from an average of over 200,000 in March and April.
The jobless rate held steady as expected at 3.6%, the lowest level since December 1969 when it was 3.5%.

A Reuters poll of 17 economists forecast Japan's gross domestic product (GDP) expanded an annualized 2.1 percent in January-March, unchanged from the preliminary reading last month. GDP grew an annualized 1.6% in the fourth quarter. 
The revised GDP data, to be released by the Cabinet Office on June 10 at 8:50 a.m. Japan time (2350 GMT, June 9), is also expected to show capital spending rose 0.5%, which if realized will provide some cheer given the initial release showed a 0.3% contraction from the fourth quarter.
Partially offsetting that were a downgrade in the contribution of pubic investment and factory inventories from the preliminary reading, analysts predicted.
Kentaro Arita, senior economist at Mizuho Research Institute, said the final GDP data will continue to point to slackening economic momentum with rising risks of a slump. 
""If the U.S.-China trade friction intensifies further, the economy may contract as business investment and exports could weaken."" 
The international trade tensions have weighed on Japan's exports and factory output, raising doubts about whether the government will go ahead with a twice-delayed plan to hike a sales tax to 10 percent from 8 percent in October.
There have been growing calls from some former policymakers to delay the tax hike in the face of worsening domestic and external conditions. However, authorities have said a delay is unlikely unless there is an economic shock on the scale of the collapse of Lehman Brothers in 2008.
The initial GDP had showed imports fell faster than exports in the first quarter, underlining the broadening pressure across the economy as consumers have also been reluctant to spend.
The annualized increase in the growth would translate into a 0.5 percent quarter-on-quarter expansion, also steady from the initial estimate, the poll found.
Other data on tap is unlikely to offer much encouragement to policymakers.
Core machinery orders, which will be issued on June 12, are forecast to have slipped 0.8% in April from the previous month, the poll found, the first fall in three months. 
Compared with a year earlier, core orders, a highly volatile data series regarded as a leading indicator of capital spending, likely dropped 5.3% in April, down for four straight month.
""Corporations, especially manufacturers, will continue to be cautious about capital spending on uncertainty over the global economy and the prospect for the U.S.-China trade conflicts,"" said Yutaro Suzuki, economist at Daiwa Institute of Research.

Halifax said house prices in the three months to May were 5.2% higher than in 2018, up from 5.0% annual growth in the three months to April, their highest since January 2017 and beating a forecast in a Reuters poll of economists.
Britain's housing market has slowed since 2016's Brexit referendum, driven by price falls in London and neighboring areas, exacerbated by higher purchase taxes on homes costing over 1 million pounds ($1.27 million) and on second homes and small landlords.
Halifax said prices rose 0.5% on the month in May, in contrast to predictions of a fall, and April's monthly house price growth was revised up to 1.2% from 1.1%.
""The overall message is one of stability,"" Halifax managing director Russell Galley said. 
""Despite the ongoing political and economic uncertainty, underlying conditions in the broader economy continue to underpin the housing market, particularly the twin factors of high employment and low interest rates,"" he added.
Since the start of this year, Halifax house price data have been consistently stronger than figures from rival mortgage lender Nationwide, which reported annual price growth of just 0.6% in April.
The most recent official data showed house price inflation of 1.4% in the year to March, and Pantheon Macroeconomics economist Samuel Tombs said he expected price growth to remain around this level for the rest of this year..

BERLIN (Reuters) - German industrial output and exports fell sharply in April, highlighting the continued vulnerability of Europe's largest economy to trade frictions and Brexit uncertainty, a day after the European Central Bank signaled concerns about euro zone growth.
Friday's figures from the Statistics Office suggested German GDP growth would slow or even stall in the current quarter, and the Bundesbank slashed its growth forecast for all of 2019, which as recently as December stood at 1.6%, to just 0.6%.
Industrial output dropped 1.9% on the month, the sharpest decline since August 2015, after a steep fall in the production of investment and intermediate goods. Economists had forecast a 0.4% fall. 
Exports fell 3.7 percent, also the biggest drop since August 2015.
The German economy had only narrowly avoided recession in the last three months of 2018, stagnating after a contraction in the third quarter, and grew a moderate 0.4% in January-March. 
""The weak underlying cyclical trend is likely to continue in the second and third quarters of 2019,"" the Bundesbank said in a statement. ""After a slight decrease in the second quarter, real GDP is likely to pick up again somewhat in the third quarter.""
German manufacturing has been in recession for much of this year as unresolved trade disputes between the United States and both China and the European Union as well as the effect of Britain's delayed departure from the European Union hit exports.
The ECB on Thursday ruled out raising interest rates in the next year and even opened the door to cutting them or buying more bonds, citing the damaging effect of trade conflicts and Brexit on the euro zone. 
'ECB DOVISHNESS JUSTIFIED'
Euro zone weakness is also feeding back to Germany, while pressures on the crucial German automotive sector are now spreading to the chemicals industry.
The services sector, which is more dependent on the local economy, has kept humming, helped by the impetus of a solid labor market and low interest rates for private spending.
But the slowdown in manufacturing is starting to hurt the labor market, with unemployment in May up for the first time in nearly two years, and there are concerns that this could now weigh on services.
""There is no doubt that the German economy had a disappointing start to the second quarter, justifying the European Central Bank's new dovishness,"" Carsten Brzeski of ING wrote in a note to clients. ""It now needs even stronger domestic demand and a bounceback in May and June to avoid a return to recessionary territory.""
Andrew Kenningham of Capital Economics told clients: ""The fall in industrial production in April adds to the evidence that Germany has not shaken off the problems which hit it nearly a year ago, and suggests that the economy slowed sharply in the second quarter of the year ...

""German industry is still struggling with both domestic and external headwinds, including the weakness of global trade, slowdown in household consumption growth and regulatory confusion in the auto sector,"" he added. ""We don't expect a sustained improvement anytime soon.""

1137,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jun 07, 2019 03:46AM ET</span>","Bank of Japan to Cut Negative Rate in September, JPMorgan says","(Bloomberg) -- The Bank of Japan will lower its short-term interest rate to -0.3% from -0.1% in September to head off risks posed by an expected Federal Reserve rate cut, JPMorgan. said in a research note.
Fed cuts are now expected in September and December after escalating U.S.-China trade tensions and President Donald Trump’s threat of tariffs on Mexico have raised the risk that global growth will deteriorate, said Hiroshi Ugai, chief Japan economist at JPMorgan.
That will pressure the BOJ to act to prevent a narrowing of the rate spread with the Fed at a time when the yen will be strengthening and economic growth and inflationary pressures deteriorating, Ugai says. JPMorgan will revise down its economic growth outlook next week after Japan releases revised gross domestic product figures for the first quarter, he said.
The BOJ would risk a sharp strengthening of the yen if it didn’t respond to the Fed’s move, Ugai said.
Even before the recent U.S.-China flareup, a growing number of economists had begun to predict the BOJ would undertake additional monetary easing in the face of sagging growth and inflation. But relatively few thought that easing would take the form of a cut to the negative rate, which has been broadly unpopular in Japan.
The BOJ is likely to offer some compensation to banks to alleviate the squeeze on their profits from the lower rate, Ugai said.
JPMorgan had previously expected the next BOJ policy change would be to extend its pledge to keep interest rates extremely low, Ugai said.
The bank doesn’t expect the BOJ to cut its target for the yield on 10-year Japanese government bonds or to increase its purchases of exchange-traded funds in September, but if the U.S.-China trade talks completely fall apart and trigger a plunge in stock prices, the BOJ may expand its purchases of ETFs in July from 6 trillion yen to 8 trillion yen annually, he said.
""When cutting the short-term policy rate, the BOJ might allow the 10yr yield to be lowered to around -0.2% at max, the lowest bound of the range around the 0% target,"" Ugai wrote."

Retail and construction saw the biggest fall in demand for staff while nursing and computing remained strong, the Recruitment and Employment Confederation (REC) said in its monthly report on Britain's jobs market on Friday.
""Recruiters are reporting that demand for staff is slowing and their clients are reducing business activity on average,"" REC chief executive Neil Carberry said.
Accountants KPMG, who sponsor the report, blamed Brexit uncertainty.
Unlike the rest of Britain's economy, the job market has performed strongly since the Brexit referendum in 2016. 
Unemployment fell to its lowest rate since 1975 at 3.8% in the first quarter of 2019, official data has shown.
The Bank of England has attributed some of the jobs growth to nervousness among businesses about making long-term investment when Britain's future trading ties with the European Union are so uncertain.
Official wage growth data has also been strong, with average earnings growing at the fastest rate in a decade.
REC - whose wage data has only a weak correlation with official numbers - said starting salaries for new permanent staff grew at the weakest pace in just over two years, but temporary staff's pay growth was the strongest in six months.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. trade deficit unexpectedly narrowed in April as imports and exports tumbled, leading economists to warn that the Trump administration's ""America First"" agenda was curbing trade between the United States and the rest of the world.
The report from the Commerce Department on Thursday does not capture a recent escalation in trade tensions between the U.S. and China, as well as with Mexico. President Donald Trump in early May slapped additional tariffs of up to 25% on $200 billion of Chinese goods, which prompted retaliation by Beijing.
Last week, Trump announced he would impose a tariff on all goods from Mexico in a bid to stem the tide of illegal immigration across the U.S.-Mexican border. Negotiations are ongoing to prevent the duties from kicking in at 5% on June 10. 
""U.S. trade with the world is slowing dramatically and the odds are rising that the economy is going to take a big hit,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG in New York.
""Globalization and expanded trade between nations benefited everyone and now the reductions in trade volumes between nations are going to subtract those benefits worldwide from everyone.""The U.S. trade deficit fell 2.1% to $50.8 billion in April. Data for March was revised up to show the trade gap increasing to $51.9 billion instead of the previously reported $50.0 billion. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the trade gap would widen to $50.7 billion in April. 
The politically sensitive goods trade deficit with China surged 29.7% to $26.9 billion. The gap with Mexico fell 14.1% to $8.2 billion in April. Washington has secured a trade pact with Mexico and Canada, but there are fears it could be scuttled by Trump's intention to impose duties on Mexican goods.
Economists said waging trade wars with China and Mexico, both major U.S. trading partners, would exert more pressure on the economy, which is already slowing after being temporarily boosted by exports, an accumulation of inventories and defense spending in the first quarter.
""The president seems intent on imposing them (duties on Mexican goods),"" said Joel Naroff, chief economist at Naroff Economic Advisors in Holland, Pennsylvania. ""That would mean we would be fighting a two-front trade war and, if that lasts long, it is almost certainly going to sap the energy out of both consumers and businesses.""
Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said on Tuesday the central bank was closely monitoring the implications of the trade tensions on the economy and would ""act as appropriate to sustain the expansion."" 
The dollar fell against a basket of currencies, while U.S. Treasury prices were mostly trading higher. Stocks on Wall Street edged up.
BROAD WEAKNESS
Goods imports fell 2.5% to $208.7 billion in April, the lowest level since January 2018. The decline was broad, with imports of consumer goods dropping $1.1 billion. Imports of motor vehicles and capital goods also fell.
While the decline in imports would be a positive in the calculation of gross domestic product, weak imports suggest domestic demand was struggling to regain speed after slowing sharply in the first quarter. The drop in imports mirrors ongoing declines in manufacturing sentiment and production.
Goods exports tumbled 3.1% to $136.9 billion in April. The largest drop since January 2015 was led by a $2.3 billion plunge in civilian aircraft exports. Boeing (NYSE:BA) in March suspended deliveries of its 737 MAX jet after the aircraft was grounded indefinitely following two deadly crashes in five months. Production of the troubled plane has been cut.
There were also decreases in exports of consumer goods and motor vehicles in April. Exports of soybeans fell and further declines are likely following the escalation in trade tensions between Washington and Beijing. 
China, the world's biggest buyer of soybeans, has previously targeted the crop in the trade war, only relenting when negotiations appeared to be progressing.
When adjusted for inflation, the goods trade deficit fell to $81.9 billion in April from $83.00 billion in the prior month. The drop in the so-called real goods trade deficit suggested that trade could add to economic growth this quarter. 
""The trade deficit narrowed, but only because imports are falling more than exports,"" said Tim Quinlan, a senior economist at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) Securities in Charlotte, North Carolina. ""That is not a sustainable way for trade to lift a nation's economy.""
The Atlanta Fed is forecasting GDP will rise at a 1.3% annualized rate in the second quarter. The economy grew at a 3.1% pace in the first quarter. Growth is cooling as the massive stimulus from last year's tax cuts and spending increases fades.
Despite the ebb in activity, the labor market is resilient.
A separate report on Thursday from the Labor Department showed initial claims for state unemployment benefits were unchanged at a seasonally adjusted 218,000 for the week ended June 1. The government's May employment report due on Friday is likely to show that nonfarm payrolls increased by 185,000 jobs in May after surging by 263,000 in April, according to a Reuters survey of economists.

But the tightening labor market is not generating a lot of wage inflation. Another report from the Labor Department showed unit labor costs, the price of labor per single unit of output, dropped at a 1.6% annualized rate in the first quarter, instead of falling at a 0.9% rate as reported last month.

OTTAWA (Reuters) - Rising exports and falling imports helped shrink Canada's trade deficit in goods in April to C$966 million ($721 million), Statistics Canada said on Thursday, in the latest sign the economy is recovering from a slowdown.
Analysts polled by Reuters had forecast a shortfall of C$2.80 billion. Statscan revised March's deficit sharply down to C$2.34 billion from an initial C$3.21 billion.
The Bank of Canada held interest rates steady as expected on May 31, saying there was evidence that economic weakness was temporary but signaling it would remain on the sidelines as it monitored developments.
""The good news for the Canadian economy keeps rolling in,"" said Royce Mendes of CIBC Economics, predicting second-quarter growth would be greater than expected.
Canada created a record number of jobs in April while March growth rebounded.
The Canadian dollar edged higher, touching C$1.3392 against the U.S. dollar, or 74.67 U.S. cents.
April's trade deficit was the smallest in six months. Exports rose by 1.3% as shipments of metal and non-metallic mineral products jumped by 15% on higher sales of gold to Britain and Hong Kong. 
""We think it's an encouraging start to the second quarter. Exports seem to be getting past what was a rough point earlier in the year,"" Stephen Tapp, deputy chief economist at Export Development Canada, said in a phone interview.
Canada, a major crude exporter, has been hit hard in recent years by lower oil prices and higher U.S. energy output. It has posted just two trade surpluses since October 2014.
Exports of canola fell by C$47 million, or 14.7%, as shipments to China stopped amid a diplomatic dispute, and Tapp said he expected shipments would continue to be depressed. Exports of wheat, though, jumped C$136 million, or 21.7%.
Total imports fell by 1.4% as deliveries of U.S. airliners plunged by 82.7% in April after a 50.7% drop in March.
Canada sent 74.5% of all its goods exports to the United States in April. Exports to the United States rose by 0.9% while imports grew by 1.9% and as a result, Canada's bilateral trade surplus fell to C$4.20 billion from C$4.49 billion in March.

Separately, the U.S. Commerce Department said the U.S. trade deficit unexpectedly narrowed in April as imports of goods dropped to a 15-month low.

Initial claims for state unemployment benefits were unchanged at a seasonally adjusted 218,000 for the week ended June 1, the Labor Department said on Thursday. Data for the prior week was revised to show 3,000 more applications received than previously reported.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast claims would be unchanged at 215,000 in the latest week. The Labor Department said no states were estimated.
The four-week moving average of initial claims, considered a better measure of labor market trends as it irons out week-to-week volatility, fell 2,500 to 215,000 last week.
The claims data has no bearing on May's employment report, which is scheduled for release on Friday. According to a Reuters survey of economists, nonfarm payrolls likely increased by 185,000 jobs in May after surging by 263,000 in April. 
The pace of job growth is well above the roughly 100,000 needed per month to keep up with growth in the working age population. The unemployment rate is forecast to be unchanged near a 50-year low of 3.6 percent.
Sustained labor market strength is seen supporting growth amid signs that economic activity is slowing after a temporary boost from volatile exports and inventory accumulation in the first quarter. Manufacturing production and home sales slumped in April, and consumer spending increased moderately.
The Atlanta Federal Reserve is forecasting gross domestic product rising at a 1.3% pace in the second quarter. The economy grew at a 3.1% annualized rate in the January-March quarter.
Thursday's claims report also showed the number of people receiving benefits after an initial week of aid rose 20,000 to 1.68 million for the week ended May 25. The four-week moving average of the so-called continuing claims slipped 1,000 to 1.67 million.

MUMBAI (Reuters) - The Reserve Bank of India cut its policy interest rate by 25 basis points in a widely expected move on Thursday, while also changing its policy stance to ""accommodative,"" after latest data showed the economy growing at its slowest in over four years.
""A sharp slowdown in investment activity along with a continuing moderation in private consumption growth is a matter of concern,"" the bank's monetary policy committee (MPC) said in a statement after making its third cut since February.
Entering its second term following a landslide election victory last month, Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government is expected to launch a fresh wave of economic reforms to unlock the growth after the unemployment rate rose to a multi-year-high of 6.1% in the 2017/18 fiscal year.
Asia's third largest economy grew at a much slower-than-expected 5.8% in the last quarter, far below the pace needed to generate jobs for the millions of young Indian's entering the labour market each month. 
The reduction in the repo rate to 5.75 percent matched predictions by 44 of 66 analysts polled by Reuters. The reverse repo rate was reduced to 5.50 percent. The MPC cut rates by the same amount at its last two meetings.
All six of the panel voted for a 25 basis points cut, and for the stance to be changed to ""accommodative"" from ""neutral"".
The MPC said it had factored in global economic conditions, noting that leading indicators point to slowing growth in the United States, Europe and China.
""Going by the macro undercurrents, the rate-cutting cycle will continue in the coming quarters as well,"" said Rupa Rege Nitsure, chief economist at L&T Financial. ""Today's policy actions ... give a clear signal that the RBI will continue with easy monetary conditions until it sees a definite improvement in growth-inflation mix.""
Markets reacted to the rate cut and change in stance as the 10-year benchmark bond yield fell to 6.89% from 7% before the policy announcement, while the rupee strengthened to 69.28 per dollar from 69.36 earlier.
RBI EXPECTS BETTER POLICY TRANSMISSION
Two new cabinet committees were announced on Thursday to find ways to spur job creation and investment.
New Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman could propose tax cuts to boost demand when she presents her maiden budget on July 5.
Addressing a press conference after the MPC meeting, RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das said the government had broadly followed the fiscal consolidation roadmap over the last five years, and he expected it to remain fiscally prudent.
The RBI lowered its growth forecast for the 2019/20 April-March fiscal year to 7%, having previously forecast 7.2% growth.
The outlook for retail inflation in the six months to end-September was raised to 3.0-3.1%, just up from the outlook of 2.9-3.0% given in April. The inflation outlook for the back half of the fiscal year in March was put at 3.4-3.7%, down from an earlier projection of 3.5-3.8%.
""The headline inflation trajectory remains below the target mandated to the MPC even after taking into account the expected transmission of the past two policy rate cuts,"" the MPC said. 
While subdued inflation gave the RBI leeway to lower rates, persuading commercial banks to cut lending rates by a similar scale has been a struggle, as many are hobbled by bad loans, and also fear losing customers if they cut deposit rates too far. 
A series of defaults by Infrastructure Leasing and Financial Services (IL&FS) last year, has also stirred major unease over the health of Indian's non-banking finance companies, raising fears of a contagion and pushing up their borrowing costs.
Still, the RBI chief said he was confident that changes in policy rates would be transmitted more strongly and more quickly to market rates, with the MPC noting that yields on longer-tenor bonds have begun to reflect recent rate cuts. 

""Our expectation is that as we go forward there will be higher transmission and then there will be faster transmission also,"" Das said.

1147,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 06, 2019 04:15AM ET</span>","World food prices rise in May, cereal output forecast falls: U.N. FAO","ROME (Reuters) - World food prices rose for a fifth consecutive month in May after bad weather pushed up the prices of cheese and maize, the United Nations food agency said on Thursday.
The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) also warned that a sharp fall in the expected maize crop in the flood-hit United States had dampened its previous forecast of bumper global cereal production in 2019.
FAO's food price index, which measures monthly changes for a basket of cereals, oilseeds, dairy products, meat and sugar, averaged 172.4. points last month against 170.3 points in April -- its highest level since last June.
The FAO dairy price index jumped 5.2% from April's value, nearing a five-year high, with cheese helping to drive up the index thanks to strong global demand for the product as drought in Oceania limited that region's export prospects. 
The FAO cereal price index rose 1.4% because of a sudden surge in maize price quotations after planting of the crop got off to the slowest pace ever recorded in the United States due to widespread flooding and rain.
By contrast, the sugar index fell 3.2% for the month, and the vegetable price index dropped 1.1%. 
In its second forecast for 2019, FAO predicted world cereal production would come in at 2.685 billion tonnes, down from its previous forecast of 2.722 billion tonnes but still up 1.2% on 2018 levels, when output declined.
""The year-on-year increase in global cereal production reflects expansions of wheat and barley production, while global rice output is likely to remain close to last year's record level,"" FAO said.
""Worldwide maize output, however, is now seen to fall, with U.S. production expected to shrink by 10% from the previous year amid a much reduced pace of plantings due to unfavorable weather conditions.""

The U.N. agency said new estimates for production and utilization suggested world cereal stocks could decline by as much as 3% in the new season, hitting a four-year low of 830 million tonnes.

1149,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 05, 2019 03:18PM ET</span>","U.S. services sector activity strengthens, eases gloom over economy","By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. services sector activity expanded at a brisk pace in May and industries hired more workers, offering some respite for an economy that is slowing following a temporary boost from exports and an accumulation of inventories in the first quarter. 
The survey from the Institute for Supply Management (ISM) on Wednesday followed a raft of weak reports on consumer spending, housing and manufacturing that suggested a sharp loss of momentum in economic growth early in the second quarter. 
Slowing growth, worsening trade tensions between the United States and China, and looming U.S. tariffs on goods imported from Mexico have led some economists to expect the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates this year.
The U.S. central bank early this year suspended its three-year monetary policy tightening campaign. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell on Tuesday said the central bank was closely monitoring the implications of the trade tensions on the economy and would ""act as appropriate to sustain the expansion.""
""Though this won't completely dismiss the rate-cut-this-year speculation, the much better-than-expected non-manufacturing ISM print helps,"" said Jennifer Lee, a senior economist at BMO Capital Markets in Toronto.  
The ISM said its non-manufacturing activity index rose 1.4 points to a reading of 56.9 in May. A reading above 50 indicates expansion in the sector, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the index would be unchanged at 55.5 last month. 
The May increase in services industry activity reflected a jump of 1.7 points in the production subindex. Activity was also boosted by gains in the new orders measure. 
A gauge of services industry employment surged 4.4 points to a seven-month high. The ISM said while businesses in the services sector were mostly optimistic about overall business conditions, ""concerns remain about tariffs and employment resources.""
President Donald Trump in early May slapped additional tariffs of up to 25% on $200 billion of Chinese goods, which prompted retaliation by Beijing. Trump announced last week that he would impose a tariff on all goods from Mexico in a bid to stem the tide of illegal immigration across the U.S.-Mexican border. The tariff would start at 5% on June 10.
The ISM said 16 industries, including utilities, real estate, finance and insurance, healthcare and social assistance, information, and professional, scientific and technical services reported growth last month. The only industry reporting contraction was agriculture, forestry, fishing and hunting.
Businesses in the utilities industry said they were ""waiting to see the impact of Chinese import tariff,"" while their counterparts in the mining sector said because of the trade war, ""it has been very difficult to plan in a long term ahead.""
Stocks on Wall Street were trading higher. The dollar firmed against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices rose. 
FADING STIMULUS
The trade tensions and fading stimulus from the White House's tax cuts and spending increases are slamming the brakes on the economy. The Atlanta Fed is forecasting gross domestic product to rise at a 1.3% annualized rate in the second quarter.
The economy grew at a 3.1% pace in the first quarter, lifted by increases in exports, inventories and defense spending. Goods exports fell sharply in April and the inventory overhang, which is mostly concentrated in the auto sector, is weighing on production at factories.
A separate report from the Fed on Wednesday showed tariffs continued to cause anxiety among businesses. In its Beige Book report of anecdotal information on business activity collected from contacts nationwide, the central bank described economic activity as expanding at a ""modest"" pace from April through mid-May. It said the outlook for the months ahead was ""solidly positive but modest.""
Last month's jump in hiring by services sector businesses suggested that a sharp slowdown in private payrolls growth in May shown in another report on Wednesday was probably a fluke.
The ADP (NASDAQ:ADP) National Employment Report showed private employers added only 27,000 jobs in May, the fewest since March 2010, after creating 271,000 positions in April. 
The ADP figures came ahead of the Labor Department's more comprehensive non-farm payrolls report on Friday, which includes both public- and private-sector employment. The ADP report, which is jointly developed with Moody's Analytics, has a poor record predicting the private payrolls component of the government's employment report. 
Economists polled by Reuters are forecasting non-farm payrolls to have increased 185,000 in May. The unemployment rate is seen unchanged at 3.6 percent. 
""Our hunch is that the drop-off in ADP's estimate of private payrolls growth is likely a blip,"" said Roiana Reid, an economist at Berenberg Capital Markets in New York. ""If the May employment report also exhibits similar weakness, that would provide a more forceful indication that companies are scaling back hiring because of concerns about the economic outlook.""
According to the ADP report, employment in the goods-producing sector fell by 43,000 jobs in May, the first drop in nearly 2-1/2 years. Manufacturing payrolls decreased 3,000 and construction shed 36,000 positions, the most since 2010.

The services sector added 71,000 jobs last month, concentrated in professional and education and health services.

The central bank’s Beige Book economic report, based on anecdotal information collected by the Fed’s 12 reserve banks on or before May 24, 2019, noted that economic activity expanded at a modest pace overall from April through mid-May, with almost all Districts reporting some growth, while a few saw ""moderate"" gains in activity.
Consumer spending, the backbone of the U.S. economy, was generally positive but tempered, according to the Fed survey.
On inflation, which has remained well below the Fed's 2% target, the central bank survey highlighted that prices continued to increase at a modest pace in most Districts since the previous report.
The modest pace of inflation comes even as wage growth has continued to increase, with ""most Districts reporting modest or moderate job growth and others reporting slight growth,"" according to the survey.
Areas of the economy like manufacturing, more acute to the escalating U.S.-China trade war, remained ""relatively upbeat,"" with stable backlogs despite uncertainty about trade negotiations and slowing global growth, the survey indicated. ""Many noted that there is usually an uptick in activity during the summer months.""
Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell on Tuesday said the central bank is willing to take ""appropriate"" action to sustain economic growth, stoking expectations that a rate cut would be delivered sooner rather than later.
Traders are increasingly pricing in the prospect of a rate cut, according to Investing.com's Fed Rate Monitor Tool, with 57% expecting the central bank to cut rates as soon as July."

The Washington-based group's seasonally adjusted index on loan requests to buy a home and to refinance one rose 1.5% to 417.8 in the week ended May 31.
Interest rates on 30-year fixed-rate ""conforming"" mortgages or loans whose balances are $484,350 or less decreased to 4.23%, which was the lowest since January 2018. A week ago, they averaged 4.33%.
“Mortgage rates dropped to their lowest level since the first week of 2018, driven by increasing concerns regarding the ongoing trade tensions with China and Mexico,” MBA's chief economist Mike Fratantoni said in a statement.
Most U.S. mortgage rates are based on Treasury yields.
Last week, benchmark 10-year yields tumbled nearly 19 basis points, marking their steepest weekly decline since December 2014 according to Refinitiv data, as investors dumped stocks in favor of bonds on trade worries.
Other mortgage rates MBA track fell on average by 8 basis points to 12 basis points from the prior week.
Cheaper borrowing costs revived interest to refinance among homeowners.
MBA's seasonally adjusted gauge on refinancing activity rose 6.4% to 1,335.6 last week.
The refinance share of overall mortgage applications grew to 42.2% from 39.7% the week before.
On the other hand, borrowers filed 2.4% fewer loan requests for home purchases than the prior week, amid concerns about the economy due to rising trade tensions, MBA said.

""Potential homebuyers may be more cautious given the heightened economic uncertainty,” Fratantoni said.

Markit's final Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) for services fell slightly, to 55.4 from April's seven-month high reading of 55.7. The figure was higher than a flash reading of 55.0 and was well above the 50.0 mark that separates growth from contraction.
But business expectations among services providers fell to a five-month low, reflecting growing concerns about a slowdown.
A sister survey on Monday showed that activity in the export-dependent manufacturing sector decreased slightly in May on declining new orders and a sharp fall in employment.
The fall to 44.3 brought the manufacturing PMI close to its lowest level since 2012.
This resulted in the composite index rising to a three-month high of 52.6, a reading which Markit economist Phil Smith said pointed to the German economy growing at a modest pace.
""The German labor market continues to lose momentum. While the service sector employment picture still looks bright, increasing efforts by manufacturers to trim capacity means the surveys together show jobs growth running at its weakest in three years,"" said Smith.
In its 10th year of growth, the German economy is expected to expand by a modest 0.5% this year, the government projects, after calendar-adjusted growth rates of 2.5% in 2017 and 1.5% in 2018.
The slowdown has started leave its mark on an otherwise solid labor market that has been providing impetus to a consumption-driven growth cycle.
German unemployment rose for the first time in nearly two years in May. If the trend continues, the signs of stress seen among manufacturers could replicate themselves in the services sector, which is more dependent on the local economy.
""Services is a key pillar of growth for Germany's economy at present, so it's of some concern to see firms in the sector reporting greater worries about a slowdown,"" said Smith.

Data compiler IHS Markit said its Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) for services rose to 51.5 in May from 50.5 in April, which it said was the fastest expansion in the sector in six months. 
The index rose further away from the 50-point threshold dividing an expansion in activity from a contraction.
IHS Markit's overall composite PMI index, which includes the services and manufacturing sectors, also rose to 51.2 points from 50.1 in April.
An initial flash forecast had given a reading of 51.7 for the May services PMI and 51.3 for the composite PMI.
The numbers of people turning up to the weekend ""yellow vests"" protests have been steadily falling, with President Emmanuel Macron having cut income taxes to appease public anger.
""May's PMI results pointed to the strongest private sector activity growth since protests began last November, highlighting the dwindling impact of the 'gilets jaunes' movement,"" said IHS Markit economist Eliot Kerr.
""The improved performance was primarily driven by the service sector, where the pace of both output and new order expansion accelerated. However, downward pressure from the manufacturing sector also eased, with production falling at the softest rate since a rise in February,"" added Kerr.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia's economic growth slowed to a decade low last quarter, underlining the need for aggressive monetary and fiscal stimulus to stop the resource-rich nation from sliding into recession after 28 straight years of expansion.
Gross domestic product (GDP) figures on Wednesday showed the A$1.9 trillion ($1.3 trillion) economy grew 0.4% in the three months ended March, double the 0.2% clocked in the fourth quarter but below expectations for a 0.5% increase.
However, the 1.8% annual expansion fell far short of the long-term average of 3.5% and was the weakest since the global financial crisis.
""The Aussie economy has lost momentum. And soft consumer spending is the main culprit,"" said CommSec chief economist Craig James.
""Both monetary and fiscal stimulus are needed to reduce unemployment and revive inflation. But businesses also need to respond through increased investment.""
Wednesday's data means GDP will have to pick up remarkably in the current quarter to achieve the Reserve Bank of Australia's (RBA) downgraded forecast of 1.7% for the 12-months to June 30.
Worried about a slowing economy, rising unemployment and lukewarm inflation the country's central bank on Tuesday cut rates to an all-time low 1.25% on Tuesday, marking its first easing in nearly three years.
Rates futures imply a 50-50 chance of another cut to 1.00% next month. A majority of 44 economists polled by Reuters predict a second cut in August with some also expecting a third move.
In a speech late on Tuesday, RBA Governor Philip Lowe said it was ""not unreasonable"" to expect a lower cash rate from here, signaling the door was wide open for further easing.
STARK DIVIDE
A major setback in Wednesday's data came from private consumption, which contributed just 0.1% to overall growth. The consumer sector accounts for about 56% of Australia's GDP.
A decline in Sydney and Melbourne home prices has eaten into consumer wealth at a time when the household debt to income ratio is at a record high. A long stretch of unusually slow wages growth has also throttled household incomes, further hitting demand. 
Output per person has been struggling badly in this latest slowdown, which began in mid-2018, inching up a paltry 0.1% for the year.
One bright spot in the quarter was higher government spending on disability, health and aged care services.
""Notably, there is a stark divide between private demand and public demand,"" Westpac economist Andrew Hanlan said in a note.
""Public demand is a source of strength."" 
Also helping growth is an export bonanza thanks to high prices for some of Australia's resources. That helped nominal GDP expand at a solid 4.9% pace for the year, even though domestic inflation remained very subdued.
Indeed, the main measure of domestic prices slowed to 1.4% for the year, well below the RBA's target band of 2-3%.
In a bid to revive growth, Australian authorities have already taken some measures, including easing lending standards for mortgage borrowers, tax rebates for millions of households and a 3% increase in minimum wage for low-income earners.
Still, ""the risk is that Governor Lowe will need take policy below 1.00% before mid-2020 to meet the RBA's central economic labor market and underlying inflation forecasts,"" Citi economist Josh Williamson said.

1155,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jun 04, 2019 11:20PM ET</span>",Australia's Economy Expands at Slowest Pace in Decade on Housing,"(Bloomberg) -- Australia’s economy expanded at the slowest pace in almost a decade as a prolonged housing downturn weighed on consumer spending, underscoring the central bank’s decision to lower interest rates.
Gross domestic product advanced 0.4% in the first three months of the year from the prior quarter, statistics bureau data showed in Sydney. The economy grew just 1.8% from a year earlier, the weakest reading since the global financial crisis, as households boosted their savings and cut spending in a classic response to wealth erosion.
“The data confirm that the economy started 2019 very softly,” said Sarah Hunter, head of macroeconomics at BIS Oxford Economics in Sydney. “Consumers continue to be battered by weak income growth, and this was added to by the drag from sharply falling house prices.”
The currency was little changed after the GDP release.
The report comes a day after the Reserve Bank cut rates for the first time in almost three years to revive consumption that accounts for almost 60% of GDP, and spur economic growth. Governor Philip Lowe says the easing should encourage hiring and investment and help lower unemployment. The wild card is the escalating trade war between the U.S. and China.
The rise in protectionism has prompted Lowe’s (NYSE:LOW) U.S. counterparts to consider reversing some of last year’s tightening. Federal Reserve chief Jerome Powell signaled overnight an openness to cut if necessary, pledging to closely watch the fallout from disputes between the U.S. and its largest trading partners.
Lowe is expected to ease again this year -- with a better than 60% chance of an August cut -- to bring the cash rate to a new record-low 1%. Such a level, together with an easing of lending restrictions, should help put a floor under tumbling property prices that have prompting consumers to rein in spending. In Sydney, housing has fallen 15%.
Wednesday’s report showed government spending and exports were key drivers of the expansion, adding 0.2 percentage point apiece. Dwelling investment fell 2.5% and home ownership transfer costs slumped 13% amid the property downturn, collectively shaving 0.3 percentage point from economic growth.
The household savings ratio advanced to 2.8% from a revised 2.6% in the final three months of the year.
Australia’s economy is on the cusp of 28 years of expansion, a developed world record; but growth drivers are thinning with the end of the mining and property booms. Government investment in infrastructure has become an important source of growth and hiring and Lowe, in a speech Tuesday night, encouraged it to keep stoking the economy.
Unemployment Focus
The RBA needs the economy expanding at 3% or more to drive the jobless rate down to 4.5%, the level at which Lowe now believes will stoke consumer prices sufficiently to return inflation to the central bank’s 2-3% target. But outside government spending and high resource prices -- reflected in the terms of trade jumping 3.1% in the quarter -- the economy looks moribund.
“For the RBA, today’s data are slightly below its May forecast profile for growth, but recent comments indicate that it remains more focused on the unemployment rate,” said Kaixin Owyong, markets economist at National Australia Bank Ltd. “The RBA will likely be relieved not to make another major change to its growth outlook, although the governor has emphasized that its outlook is conditioned on the cash rate falling to 1%.”
Unemployment climbed to 5.2% in April and job advertisements slumped 8.4% in May, a potential harbinger to further weakness in the labor market.
What Bloomberg’s Economists Say
“Several factors may boost household spending and investment in the second half. The government has promised tax cuts and the housing market is showing signs of stabilization. Additional easing may also be in the pipeline.”
-- Tamara Mast Henderson, EconomistClick here for the full report
The RBA had incorporated a softening of the economy in the first half of the year in its most recent forecasts, predicting 1.75% growth in the 12 months through June before accelerating to 2.75% at the end of the year.
The slowdown, together with the escalating trade war, has prompted economists like Westpac Banking Corp.’s Bill Evans to forecast a further two rate cuts by November, and JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM).’s Sally Auld to predict another three by mid-2020, taking the cash rate down to 0.5%. Lowe suggested in a speech Tuesday night that this wasn’t his take.
Asked after the address where he saw the lower bound of the RBA’s cash rate, he said: “If you look at what happened in the U.K., the U.S. and Canada, rates got to 0.25-0.5% there, so I think for many economies that’s judged to be the effective lower bound. I’m not anticipating to get to those levels.”

The Caixin/Markit services purchasing managers' index (PMI) fell to 52.7 in May, the lowest since February and down from April's 54.5. The 50-mark separates growth from contraction.
New export orders placed with Chinese services firms pulled back significantly from April's multi-year high of 55.6 to 51.1, with a vast majority of companies surveyed reporting no change to export sales in May, the survey showed. 
That knocked total new orders growth to a 3-month low.
""Overall, China's economic growth showed some signs of slowing in May. Employment and business confidence in particular merit policymakers' attention,"" said Zhengsheng Zhong, Director of macroeconomic analysis at CEBM Group, in a statement accompanying the data release. 
The broad survey results and a run of recent data from China suggest Beijing might need to roll out more stimulus to stave off a sharper economic deceleration. 
While an official gauge released last week was more upbeat on the services sector, both surveys indicated the industry is facing slackening global demand. New export orders in the official survey showed the steepest contraction since October last year. 
China has been banking on the services sector to cushion the slowdown in manufacturing, which is being hit by rising labor costs and the year-long U.S.-China trade war. However, with sentiment deteriorating amid a broad-based economic slowdown, consumers are tightening their belts on everything from clothes, cosmetics and cars. 
Trade tensions between Washington and Beijing escalated sharply earlier last month after the Trump administration accused China of having ""reneged"" on its previous promises to make structural changes to its economic practices.
The U.S. then put Chinese telecom equipment Huawei Technologies Co Ltd on a trade blacklist, prompting retaliation from Beijing to target foreign companies that have harmed Chinese firms' interests.
With the standoff widening beyond trade, financial markets took a hit on fears of a global recession. 
That anxiety was underscored in Wednesday's private survey, which showed confidence for the year ahead among Chinese service providers fell to the weakest since July 2018, with some respondents citing concerns over subdued economic conditions. 
Job creation in the services sector also eased off to grow at only a marginal pace, with the index for employment pulling back to 50.4 last month from 51.4 in April. 
Caixin's composite manufacturing and services PMI, also released on Wednesday, slipped to 51.5 in May from 52.7 in April. 
Analysts say the PMI signals bad news for global growth. 
""The continued escalation in trade tensions and broad-based fall in manufacturing PMIs suggest that the downside risks to growth are becoming more prominent,"" said  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) analysts in a note to clients this week.

1157,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 04, 2019 08:35PM ET</span>",Japan May services PMI shows slight slowdown in expansion,"TOKYO, June 5 (Reuters) - Activity in Japan's services sector expanded at a slightly slower pace in May than the previous month as the rate of job creation weakened and businesses turned less optimistic about the future, a survey showed on Wednesday.
The Markit/Nikkei Japan Services Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) edged lower to a seasonally adjusted 51.7 in May from 51.8 in April.
The index stayed above the 50 threshold that separates contraction from expansion for the 32nd straight month.
Japan's manufacturing activity swung back into contraction in May as exports tumbled, a separate survey showed on Monday.
This, combined with the slight decline in services sector activity, could add to concerns that Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's plan to raise the sales tax will hurt an already weakened economy.
""The current underlying trend in Japan's economy is disappointing and will certainly warrant concern from Abe amid the upcoming upper house elections in July and the scheduled consumption tax hike later this year,"" said Joe Hayes, economist at IHS Markit, which compiles the survey.
""Indeed, service sector panelists indicated a degree of concern towards the sales tax increase.""
The subindex measuring employment fell to 53.2 from 54.7 in the previous month.
The composite PMI, which includes both manufacturing and services, fell to 50.7 from 50.8 in the previous month.
A bruising trade war between the United States and China shows no sign of ending soon as Washington raises tariffs on Chinese goods to address trade practices it considers unfair.
China has retaliated in kind, and the slowdown in trade between the world's two-largest economies is having a knock-on effect on global growth.
Japan is exposed to the dispute as it ships big volumes of electronics items and heavy machinery to China, which are used to make finished goods destined for the United States.
Some economists worry that trade frictions could weaken Japanese consumer sentiment, making shoppers less likely to spend money, which would impact the service sector.

The worsening global trade environment comes as Japan prepares to raise the nationwide sales tax to 10% from 8% in October. The government needs the extra revenue to pay for rising welfare costs, but some politicians worry that the tax hike will cause a big decline in consumer spending and slow the economy.

1158,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 04, 2019 01:14PM ET</span>","U.S. manufacturing mired in soft patch as orders, shipments fall","By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - New orders for U.S.-made goods fell in April and shipments dropped by the most in two years, indicating continuing weakness in manufacturing activity that could hurt the broader economy.
The report from the Commerce Department on Tuesday added to moderate consumer spending as well as weak home sales, construction and equipment outlays in April in suggesting that economic growth was slowing sharply after a temporary boost from trade, inventories and defense spending in the first quarter. 
Some economists believe the dimming economic outlook, which also reflects an escalating trade war between the United States and China, could force the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates this year. The U.S. central bank early this year suspended its three-year rate hiking campaign.
Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said on Tuesday the central bank was closely monitoring the implications of the trade tensions on the economy and would ""act as appropriate to sustain the expansion.""
""Powell may have opened the door a crack wider to the possibility that the Fed will ratify one or two of the rate cuts the markets have discounted this year,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG in New York.
Factory goods orders declined 0.8%, pulled down by softening demand for transportation equipment, computers and electronic orders, and primary metals. Orders increased 1.3% in March. 
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast factory orders would fall 0.9% in April. Factory orders rose 1.6% compared to April 2018. Manufacturing, which accounts for about 12% of the economy, is being squeezed by businesses placing fewer orders while working off stockpiles of unsold goods in warehouses.
The sector could see more disruptions to the supply chain after President Donald Trump announced last week that he would impose a tariff on all goods from Mexico in a bid to stem the tide of illegal immigration across the U.S.-Mexican border. The tariff would start at 5% on June 10.
Manufacturers are still digesting the White House's decision in early May to slap additional tariffs of up to 25% on $200 billion of Chinese goods, which prompted retaliation by Beijing.
The trade war, together with the inventory bloat that is concentrated in the automotive sector, could keep manufacturing on the backfoot. A survey on Monday showed a measure of national factory activity dropped to a 31-month low in May, with manufacturers worried mostly about the trade tensions.
BUMPY ROAD AHEAD
""We expect further bumps along the road for manufacturing as a slowing global economy and escalating tariffs on major U.S. trading partners pose headwinds,"" said Stephen Ciccarella, a senior economist at Moody's Analytics in West Chester, Pennsylvania. 
""The supply chains with the U.S. and Mexico are more intertwined than those between the U.S. and China, which would make the spillover effects on the U.S. economy more significant than the 5% tariff would otherwise suggest."" 
Stocks on Wall Street were trading higher, boosted by Powell's comments. The dollar rose marginally against a basket of currencies, while U.S. Treasury prices fell. 
Inventories at factories rose 0.3% in April. The stock of unsold goods has increased in seven of the last eight months. Shipments of manufactured goods fell 0.5% in April, the largest drop since April 2017, after rising 0.2% in March.
The inventories-to-shipments ratio increased to 1.37 from 1.36 in March. Pointing to further weakness in manufacturing activity, unfilled orders at factories slipped 0.1% in April, reversing March's 0.1% rise. 
Boeing's move to cut production of its troubled 737 MAX aircraft is also hurting manufacturing. 
The economy is broadly slowing despite the lowest unemployment rate in nearly 50 years. The Atlanta Federal Reserve is forecasting GDP rising at a 1.3% annualized rate in the second quarter. The economy grew at a 3.1% rate in the January-March period. 
In April, orders for computers and electronic products fell 0.5%, while those for primary metals dropped 1.1%. Machinery orders rose 0.3%. Orders for electrical equipment, appliances and components increased 0.9%. 
Transportation equipment orders tumbled 5.9% after rising 6.0% in March. Orders for civilian aircraft and parts plunged 25.2%. Motor vehicles and parts orders fell 1.7%, the biggest drop since July 2017. 
The Commerce Department also said April orders for non-defense capital goods excluding aircraft, which are seen as a measure of business spending plans on equipment, declined 1.0% instead of the 0.9% drop reported last month.
Orders for these so-called core capital goods rose 0.3% in March. Shipments of core capital goods, which are used to calculate business equipment spending in the gross domestic product report, were unchanged as previously reported.
Core capital goods shipments fell 0.6% in March. Business spending on equipment contracted in the first quarter for the first time in three years.

""It is likely that real equipment spending will decline again in the second quarter,"" said Daniel Silver, an economist at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) in New York.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The number of foreign direct investment (FDI) projects dropped last year in Britain and the rest of Europe amid rising concern about the uncertainty caused by Brexit, an industry report showed on Tuesday.
The number of completed FDI projects fell across Europe by 4% last year, the first fall since 2012. The number in Britain, still the top destination for FDI in Europe, fell by 13%. Germany's figure saw a similar decline, while France was flat and Italy and Ireland saw sharp increases.
The survey of 506 businesses was carried out by Ernst & Young, an accounting firm. It looked at the number of completed foreign investment projects, rather than the value of the investments.
The percentage of businesses planning to establish or grow operations in Europe this year also dropped.
More than a third of the businesses surveyed cited uncertainty caused by Brexit as the primary risk to Europe's attractiveness. That was followed by concern over political instability in the EU, the rise of populism and protectionism and global political uncertainty.
""Prolonged uncertainty about the UK's future relationship with the EU following the Brexit vote is undoubtedly denting FDI in the country,"" the report said.
France saw stalled growth in the number of FDI projects, mostly because of concerns over the impact of weekly ""yellow vest"" protests, though Paris remained the most attractive European city for investment.
Despite political turmoil and a slowing economy, Italy saw the number of FDI projects grow by 63% last year.
Ireland also recorded a 52% increase in FDI projects, intercepting capital fleeing from Britain.

""Brexit is undoubtedly boosting Ireland's attractiveness as an alternative to the UK,"" the report said.

Year-on-year growth in Africa's most industrialized economy was zero compared with forecasts of growth of 0.7%.
""This was the largest economic contraction in almost a decade, ... It was largely driven by manufacturing, then mining,"" Statistician General Risenga Maluleke told a news conference.
At 0950 GMT, the rand was around 1.2 percent weaker against the dollar at 14.61.
The data will come as a shock to President Cyril Ramaphosa, returned to office after national elections in May with a pledge to revive growth and attract foreign investment.
Ramaphosa's reform drive faces formidable obstacles, including factional fighting within his governing African National Congress party, struggling state firms and weak consumer demand.
For 2019 as a whole the economy is expected to expand around 1%, versus growth of 0.8% last year, according to a Reuters poll.
That level of growth is insufficient to make a meaningful dent in poverty or reduce severe inequality, which persists in South Africa more than two decades after the end of white minority rule.

1161,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 04, 2019 05:50AM ET</span>",Inflation tumble adds to ECB's growing list of worries,"By Jan Strupczewski and Balazs Koranyi
BRUSSELS/FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Euro zone inflation slowed more than expected last month, a growing headache for European Central Bank policymakers who already worry that price growth is 'uncomfortably below' their target.
Inflation in the 19 countries sharing the euro fell to 1.2% in May from 1.7% in April, missing expectations for 1.3% and more than reversing a one-off surge related to the timing of Easter.
In a potentially more worrisome sign, underlying inflation or prices excluding volatile food and energy prices, the ECB's preferred measure, fell to 1.0% from 1.4% a month earlier. 
The ECB targets inflation at just below 2% but has undershot this since 2013, raising fears that such a persistent miss could permanently lower inflation expectations, making weak price growth self perpetuating.
Indeed, the minutes of the bank's last meeting already showed growing concerns about weakening inflation expectations, which then raises pressure on policymakers to provide further stimulus. 
But the bank has already exhausted much of its firepower and while it still has plenty of tools left, they lack the potency of earlier measures, such as massive asset purchases or rapid rate cuts.
""Despite decent domestic demand, it appears that companies continue to find it difficult to pass on their higher labor costs to consumers,"" Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) said in a note to clients. ""The ECB is also beginning to doubt that the higher wage increase will increase underlying inflation in a sustainable way."" 
The ECB's next move, expected at a regular policy meeting on Thursday, will be to provide banks with new loans so they can maintain the flow of credit to the real economy.
While lending data suggests that the availability of funding is not an issue for now, the weak inflation reading and the growth slowdown will likely persuade policymakers to price the loans under generous terms, with a negative interest rate that provides banks with rebates.
But the ECB may hold off on other easing measures for now as growth is holding up, wages are rising, credit growth remains robust and the unemployment rate hit a 10-year-low with a 7.6% reading in April. 
Still, more support may be needed before the summer is over given what the ECB has called ""pervasive uncertainty"".
A global trade war is sapping confidence, Italy is once again in conflict with the European Commission, German industry is continuing to post dismal figures, stocks are tumbling and the threat of a hard Brexit looms large.
Markets have already pushed out expectations for a rate hike into 2021 and some are even pricing in a rate cut, a still unlikely move given that the ECB's key rate is already at a record low of minus 0.4%

To maintain the credibility of its guidance, the ECB's next move then may be to formally delay any rate hike, adjusting its so-called forward guidance, which sees steady rates until next year.

The IHS Markit/CIPS construction Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) fell to 48.6, the lowest reading since March 2018, when the country was in the grip of an unusually cold winter.
Economists polled by Reuters had expected the index to remain at 50.5.
""Commercial building remained hardest-hit by Brexit uncertainty, with construction firms reporting the steepest fall in this category of activity since September 2017,"" Tim Moore, associate director at IHS Markit, said.
Civil engineering work fell for a fourth straight month -- the longest such run since the first half of 2013, when Britain was still in the shadow of the financial crisis -- and growth in house-building remained softer than on average in 2018.
""Reduced workloads led to more cautious recruitment strategies and the non-replacement of departing staff in May,"" IHS Markit said.
Construction accounts for 6% of Britain's economy, which has relied heavily on spending by consumers to offset the drag on corporate activity caused by the lack of clarity over the country's delayed departure from the European Union.
Figures published earlier on Tuesday showed the biggest annual fall in retail sales since at least 1995, however, excluding distortions caused by the timing of Easter.

Adding to signs of a loss of momentum in the economy, a PMI published on Monday for Britain's manufacturing sector was the weakest in almost three years.

1164,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 04, 2019 12:45AM ET</span>",India's moribund housing market stuck in low gear: Reuters poll,"By Hari Kishan and Vivek Mishra
BENGALURU (Reuters) - The outlook for India's moribund property market has brightened somewhat, with house prices this year expected to rise more than predicted three months ago, but those increases will still be the weakest in at least a decade, a Reuters poll found.
Until 2015, India's annual property price growth had typically been in the double digits. However, more recently a ban on high value currency notes and a liquidity shortage driven by bad debts on banks' balance sheets have led to a cooling in lending and a housing inventory pile-up.
The latest poll of 18 property analysts taken May 10-June 3 showed home prices are expected to rise 2.3% nationally this year, up from 1.3% predicted in March but well below overall inflation.
That is much slower than last year, when house prices rose at an average rate of 5.6%, already its weakest since at least 2010, when the Reserve Bank of India started tracking changes in house prices.
House prices are expected to rise 2.5% next year and 3.8% in 2021, well below the projected pace of consumer price inflation for those periods. 
But those modest rates might not even be realized as over 80% of analysts who answered an additional question said their outlook for the housing market was skewed more to the downside.
That comes despite two RBI rate cuts this year and strong chances of another one this week, although analysts are split on whether an easing would be a good idea or not. 
""Five years are too short a time to undo decades of damage. The industry stakeholders have given this government the benefit of the doubt. However, with a fresh term in hand, this government will have to deliver on a lot of initiatives,"" said Anuj Puri, chairman at ANAROCK Property Consultants.
The National Democratic Alliance (NDA) government, led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, introduced a host of incentives to shore up the struggling real-estate market last year. 
Modi's party gained a huge parliamentary majority in an election last month.
""The residential sector has endured significant pain over the last few years, but the NDA government's return to power will reassure investors of stability and continued focus on growth,"" said Aashish Agarwal, head of consulting services at Colliers International India.
""While recovery will be slow and led by reputed developers in select micro-markets, a large part of the market will continue to suffer from construction delays caused by the liquidity crunch.""
What started as a bad loan problem in the banking sector last year slowly morphed into a full-blown liquidity crisis, which forced one of the largest infrastructure lending companies, IL&FS, to default on its interest payments.
""When funding becomes scarce, as a developer you become really pressurized to hive off your inventory as fast as possible,"" said Rohan Sharma, head of research at Cushman & Wakefield India. 
""This creates a barrier for a price run to happen even if there is demand.""
A regional breakdown of the latest Reuters poll data showed Delhi and Mumbai, India's two most populous cities, will not contribute much to property price growth.
House prices in Delhi, including National Capital Region, were forecast to fall 2.5% this year and stagnate next year. In Mumbai they were expected to rise 0.5% and 1.0%, respectively.
""Delhi (including NCR) and Mumbai witnessed spiraling housing prices which often didn't match with the affordability of the larger consumer base,"" said Anshuman Magazine, regional chairman and CEO at CBRE.
A majority of analysts rated Delhi and Mumbai average house prices either ""extremely overvalued"" or ""overvalued"".

However, two-thirds of the same pool of analysts said houses were fairly valued in the southern cities of Bengaluru and Chennai. Property prices in both cities were forecast to rise 2.0-3.5% over the next two years.

Ireland's fast-growing economy has weathered the uncertainty created by the June 2016 vote, with the impact mainly showing itself in a ramping up of pre-production inventories ahead of the original end-March date for Britain's departure.
But the AIB manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) slipped for the third time in three months, to 50.4 in May from 52.5 in April, on the unwinding of stockpiling and weaker global demand.
That is the lowest growth rate since the 50.2 reported for July 2016. The new orders sub-index fell below 50, the point which separates growth from contraction, for the first time since July 2016.
The index ""showed a further loss of momentum in the sector as the boost to activity from Brexit stockpiling earlier in the year continued to unwind,"" AIB Chief Economist Oliver Mangan said in a statement.
Anecdotal evidence from panelists indicated that many firms had reached their contingency stock levels for Brexit and due to weaker demand had decided to run-down supplies rather than purchasing additional inputs, he said.
Weaker global demand is also weighing on the sector, Mangan said, contributing to a fall in the employment growth sub-index to its slowest growth rate in almost three years.
The survey showed that business sentiment amongst Irish manufacturers had risen to its highest level in five months, however, with around 52% of firms confident of a rise in output from present levels in 12 months' time.
Panelists cited new product releases, a recovery in overseas markets and investments in new machinery as reasons to be confident, the authors said.

The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) is widely expected to cut rates on Tuesday to a record low of 1.25% from 1.5% in what would mark the first rate change in nearly three years. 
Treasurer Josh Frydenberg met with the bosses of Commonwealth Bank of Australia, Westpac Banking Corp, Australia and New Zealand Banking Group and National Australia Bank to discuss interest rates, Australia's housing slump, regulatory supervision and a securitization fund, the Australian Financial Review said.
""With the economy facing significant headwinds domestically and internationally, it is important that the banks are continuing to keep their lending book open and that they pass on in full to the public any benefits of reduced funding costs,"" the newspaper quoted Frydenberg as saying.
Growth in Australia's $1.3 trillion economy is sputtering, with signs that domestic activity likely slowed in the three months ended March to an annual 1.7%, the weakest since the 2008 global financial crisis.
Inflation has remained under the RBA's 2.3% target band and unemployment has ticked up to an eight-month high of 5.2% from a low of 4.9% in February.
RBA Governor Philip Lowe said last month the central bank would consider cutting interest rates in June to boost the economy, as inflation and wage growth are lagging its expectations.
Economists also widely expect the central bank to cut rates again in August to 1.00%, a Reuters poll showed.
The country's big four banks have all recently cut fixed-rate mortgages to lure new borrowers ahead of the RBA's anticipated cut in the benchmark rate.
But the big four, which control about 80 percent of Australia's mortgage market, have not cut variable rates, as that would dent profits more. Their mortgage books are mostly tied to variable rates rather than fixed rates.
The banks will also be under pressure to pass on any rate cut in full as they battle to win back the market's trust following a landmark misconduct inquiry that severely damaged their standing in the community.

The KBC Bank consumer sentiment index rose to 89.9 in May from 87.7 in April, an increase that the authors said was too small to suggest any significant mood change and kept the series hovering not far above February's 51-month low of 86.5.
While consumer sentiment and business surveys have indicated some nervousness over neighboring Britain's protracted exit from the European Union, data last week showed jobs being added at the quickest pace since Ireland became the fastest growing economy in the EU five years ago.
The May survey showed a clear improvement in views on the jobs market, KBC Bank Ireland Chief Economist Austin Hughes said. But there was only limited relief that Britain avoided a no-deal Brexit when the deadline for its departure was extended until the end of October.
""As risks in this regard were seen to be delayed rather than dispelled, there was no marked jump in confidence, particularly in circumstances where global economic prospects remain challenged,"" Hughes said.
Respondents were asked for the first time how they felt Brexit might impact them personally, with 69% fearing it would lead to an increase in the price of goods but just 18% afraid it could have a negative impact on their job prospects.
Hughes also noted that after data on Friday showed consumer sentiment at an eight-month high in Britain, concerns about the economic consequences Brexit cast a greater shadow over Irish consumers than elsewhere, including Britain.
""The absence to this point of a widely predicted collapse in UK economic conditions appears to have closed British consumers' eyes as to the prospective damage Brexit could cause in the future,"" he said.
""In contrast, our reading of the Irish survey results suggests no appetite among Irish consumers to 'get on with it'. In part, this may reflect a more realistic sense of the potential dislocation that Brexit may bring but it may also be that the scars of the recent crisis make Irish consumers particularly sensitive to any form of downside risk.""

LONDON (Reuters) - British shoppers cut back on their spending last month by the most in more than 20 years, a retailers' group said, raising questions about how long consumers can keep on cushioning the economy from the impact of Brexit.
Retail sales sank by an annual 2.7%, the biggest fall - excluding distortions caused by the timing of Easter - since the British Retail Consortium's records began in 1995.
The BRC said May's fall should be seen in the context of an unusually strong jump of 4.1% in May 2018, when sales were boosted by sunny weather and the marriage of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle which encouraged consumers to hit the shops.
""But even the three-month average - which softens the monthly volatility - demonstrates that achieving growth in retail remains a real struggle,"" said Paul Martin, head of UK retail at accountancy firm KPMG which sponsors the figures.
Sales rose by 0.2% in the three months to May, the weakest growth since the three months to March 2017.
In like-for-like terms, which smoothes out changes in the amount of retail space, sales fell by 3.0% in May, the biggest fall since the end of 2008, excluding Easter periods.
Retailers have reported mixed fortunes recently. Morrisons, Britain's fourth-largest grocer, missed quarterly growth forecasts, blaming political and economic uncertainty and the third-largest player, Asda, warned of an ""increasingly challenging backdrop"".
B&M, a small, fast-growing discount chain, reported its best ever Easter. 
Overall, consumers have so far largely taken Brexit in their stride, helped by weaker inflation and stronger growth in wages.
That has helped the world's fifth-biggest economy at a time when many companies have been cutting back on investment because of uncertainty about Brexit.
Separately on Tuesday, Barclaycard said 44% of respondents in a poll it commissioned expected Brexit would hurt their household finances and 30% said they were less likely to holiday abroad this year.
But 70% remained confident in their finances.
""Despite ongoing concerns about Brexit and the economy, household confidence is holding up as consumers continue to be savvy with their spending,"" Esme Harwood, a director at Barclaycard, said. 

Barclaycard did not publish monthly spending figures for May because it was adjusting its reporting process.

(Reuters) - Major automakers on Monday reported better-than-expected U.S. new vehicle sales for May, posting the first monthly increase for 2019 as a strong economy and upbeat consumer sentiment boosted demand.
U.S. new vehicle sales through April had fallen 3 percent, fueling expectations of a weaker year for automakers in 2019 than last year, and May sales were expected to remain weak. 
Concerns of a downturn have been further heightened by recent threats from U.S. President Donald Trump that he will impose new tariffs on all Mexican imports.
Cox Automotive analyst Charlie Chesbrough said the May sales figures were a ""complete reversal from a slow April,"" adding that ""there's no denying many of the economic indicators we follow support strong sales,"" including high consumer confidence, stabilizing interest rates and low unemployment.
Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV (FCA), reported a 2.1% rise in sales as demand for both light- and heavy-duty pickup trucks remained strong. The Ram pickup, a major profit-driver for FCA, had a 33 percent gain in sales versus May 2018. 
FCA and General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) have both launched redesigned pickup trucks. Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co has for decades built the single best-selling truck brand with its F-Series trucks, with the Chevy brand a solid No. 2 and Ram a distant third. But in the first quarter of this year, Ram brand trucks outsold Chevrolet-brand trucks.
Both GM and Ford report sales quarterly instead of on a monthly basis.
Japanese automaker Toyota Motor Corp posted a 3.2% sales increase, boosted by strong demand for its Camry sedans.
Nissan Motor Co Ltd said its sales rose 0.1%, driven by SUV and truck sales. The Japanese automaker's sales in the first fourth months of the year had fallen more than the industry average. Nissan has been heavily reliant on consumer discounts and low-margin fleet sales to boost U.S. demand, but its market share has dropped since 2016.
Hyundai Motor Co reported a 2% increase in sales, driven by strong results for its SUV models.
Honda Motor Co Ltd reported a 4.9% drop in sales for May, driven by declining sedan sales. 
Passenger car sales have fallen steadily as Americans abandon sedans in favor of larger, more comfortable pickup trucks and SUVs, which are also far more profitable for automakers.

U.S. auto sales are expected to be about 16.9 million units in 2019, a 2.5% fall from 2018, according to industry consultants J.D. Power and LMC Automotive.

1172,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 03, 2019 12:11PM ET</span>",U.S. factory activity growing at weakest pace since 2016,"By Dan Burns and Jason Lange
NEW YORK/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Growth in U.S. manufacturing activity slowed in May to its weakest pace in over two years as factory managers raised concerns about a trade war between the United States and China, a national survey showed on Monday.
The Institute for Supply Management said its U.S. Manufacturing Purchasing Managers Index declined to 52.1 from 52.8 in April, hitting the lowest level since October 2016. 
A reading above 50 indicates growth. Wall Street economists polled by Reuters expected the index to rise to 53. 
A separate survey on U.S. purchasing manager sentiment by IHS Markit also pointed to slowing growth in U.S. factory activity in May.
The reports suggest that risks to the U.S. economy are rising due to a slowing global economy and U.S. President Donald Trump's efforts to overhaul America's relationship with its major trading partners. 
Trump has ordered sharp tariff increases on a host of Chinese imports in 2018 and this year, while on Friday he threatened to hike tariffs on all Mexican imports unless Mexico stems the flow of unauthorized immigrants into the United States. Many U.S. factories depend on Mexican suppliers for goods assembled in America.
U.S. trading partners including China and Mexico have retaliated against Trump's tariffs with higher taxes on U.S. exports. This is also putting pressure on U.S. factories. 
""The sector can't thrive when it's being hit by new taxes at random every few weeks,"" said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics. ""This isn't about macro, it's about the whims of a president who understands very little about how the economy actually works.""
Trump says he wants to bring more manufacturing jobs to America and says trading partners have been taking advantage of the country.
ISM's factory employment index ticked higher to 53.7 after April's reading of 52.4. The index has fallen by 11% since October 2017.
Economists generally expect rising tariffs will hit corporate profits and lead to higher prices for U.S. consumers.
The ISM survey was taken before Trump threatened new tariffs on Mexico starting next month. The threat prompted a broad outcry from U.S. businesses.
Global trade tensions ratcheted higher throughout May after Trump ordered tariffs on billions of dollars of imported goods from China to rise to 25% from 10%, and progress toward a trade deal between the world's two largest economies ground to a halt.
""Respondents expressed concern with the escalation in the U.S.-China trade standoff,"" said Timothy Fiore, who chairs the ISM's Manufacturing Business Survey Committee.
Factories reported the weakest output growth last month since August 2016 with a production index reading of 51.3, down from 52.3 in April. New orders recovered modestly, but the backlog of orders contracted for the first time since January 2017. 

Separately, U.S. construction spending, which has suffered from a slowdown in the housing market, was flat in April, the Commerce Department said. A fall in spending on private residential projects balanced with a jump in public construction outlays.
 
"
1173,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 03, 2019 10:10AM ET</span>","U.S. construction spending unchanged, residential spending stays soft","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. construction spending was unchanged in April on a sharp jump in public construction outlays, while spending on private residential projects fell for the fourth straight month. 
Data for March was revised to show construction spending rising 0.1% instead of declining 0.9% as previously reported. 
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast construction spending rising 0.4% in April. Construction spending was down 1.2% on a year-on-year basis in April.
In April, spending on public construction projects rose 4.8% after increasing 0.5% in March. It was the fourth consecutive monthly rise. Federal construction spending soared 7.4%, the biggest jump in 1-1/2 years. 
Private construction outlays fell 1.7% to the lowest level since January 2017 after being unchanged in March.
Investment in private residential projects slipped 0.6% to the lowest level since December 2016, after a 1.2% drop in March. The outlook for the housing market has improved recently as mortgage rates ease from last year's lofty levels, but building remains constrained by labor and land shortages. 

Spending on private nonresidential structures, which include manufacturing and power plants slumped 2.9% in April, the biggest drop in more than six years, after rising 1.3% in March

1174,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 03, 2019 05:57AM ET</span>",Global recession fears grow as factory activity shrinks,"By Jonathan Cable and Marius Zaharia
LONDON/HONG KONG (Reuters) - Factory activity contracted across Asia and Europe last month as an escalating trade war between Washington and Beijing raised fears of a global economic downturn and heaped pressure on policymakers to roll out more stimulus.
Such growth indicators are likely to deteriorate further in coming months as higher trade tariffs take their toll on global commerce and further dent business and consumer sentiment, leading to job losses and delays in investment decisions. 
Some economists predict a world recession and a renewed race to the bottom on interest rates if trade tensions fail to ease at a Group of 20 summit in Osaka, Japan at the end of June, when presidents Donald Trump and Xi Jinping could meet. 
The U.S.-China trade war, slumping automotive demand, Brexit and wider geopolitical uncertainty took their toll on manufacturing activity in the euro zone last month. It contracted for a fourth month in May - and at a faster pace.
""The additional shock from the escalated trade tensions is not going to be good for global trade. In terms of the monetary policy response, almost everywhere the race is going to be to the downside,"" said Aidan Yao, senior emerging markets economist at AXA Investment Managers.
IHS Markit's May final manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index for the euro zone was 47.7, below April's level and only just above a six-year low in March.
In Britain, the Brexit stockpiling boom of early 2019 gave way last month to the steepest downturn in British manufacturing in almost three years as new orders dried up, boding ill for economic growth in the second quarter.
After an official gauge on Friday showed contraction in China, Asia's economic heartbeat, the Caixin/IHS Markit Manufacturing PMI showed modest expansion, offering investors some near-term relief. 
The outlook, however, remained grim as output growth slipped, factory prices stalled and businesses were the least optimistic on production since the survey series began in April 2012.
Central banks in Australia and India are expected to cut rates this week, with others around the world are seen following suit in coming weeks and months.
While U.S. manufacturing is expected to grow steadily, economists expect the global malaise to eventually feed back into the U.S. economy. Fed funds rate futures are now almost fully pricing in a rate cut by September, with about 50 percent chance of a move by end-July.
J.P. Morgan now expects the Federal Reserve to cut rates twice this year, a major change from its previous forecast that rates would stay on hold until the end of 2020.
Meanwhile, Monday's survey adds to evidence that the euro zone economy is under pressure and will likely be of concern to policymakers at the European Central Bank, who have already raised the prospect of further support.
There is little likelihood of them hiking interest rates before 2021, according to economists in a Reuters poll last week. They said the bank's next policy move would be to tweak its forward guidance toward more accommodation. 
RECESSION FEARS
The trade conflict between China and the United States escalated last month when Trump raised tariffs on some Chinese imports to 25% from 10% and threatened levies on all Chinese goods.
If that were to happen, and China were to retaliate, ""we could end up in a (global) recession in three quarters"", said Chetan Ahya, global head of economics at  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS).
Washington's new tariff threats against Mexico last week also contributed to global recession fears, with stock markets tumbling around the world. The 10-year U.S. Treasuries yield fell to 2.121%, a nadir last seen in September 2017.
Tensions flared again between the United States and China at the weekend over trade, technology and security. 
China's Defence Minister Wei Fenghe warned the United States not to meddle in security disputes over Taiwan and the South China Sea, while acting U.S. Defence Secretary Patrick Shanahan said Washington would no longer ""tiptoe"" around Chinese behavior in Asia.

""We take this seriously. It means that the trade war has not only become a technology war but also a broad-based business war. There will be more retaliation actions from China, especially for the technology sector,"" said Iris Pang, Greater China economist at ING.

LONDON, (Reuters) - The Brexit stockpiling boom of early 2019 gave way in May to the steepest downturn in British manufacturing in almost three years as new orders dried up, boding poorly for economic growth in the second quarter, a survey showed on Monday.
The IHS Markit/CIPS UK Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) fell to 49.4 from 53.1 in April, its lowest level since July 2016 and worse than all forecasts in a Reuters poll of economists that had pointed to a fall to 52.0. 
Export orders dropped at the fastest pace since October 2014, the survey showed, reflecting global trade tensions and European businesses diverting supply chains away from Britain because of Brexit uncertainty, the PMI showed.
A separate survey from the 'Make UK' manufacturing organization published on earlier Monday also suggested EU customers are turning their backs on Britain.
Britain's economy picked up in early 2019, helped by the biggest rise in factory output in 20 years as companies raced to stockpile goods to avoid disruption to supply chains in the run-up to the original March 29 Brexit deadline.
But with Britain's departure from the European Union postponed until Oct. 31, the boost from stockpiling has evaporated -- putting manufacturing on course for a renewed downturn, data company IHS Markit said.
""New order inflows declined from both domestic and overseas markets, as already high stock levels at manufacturers and their clients led to difficulties in sustaining output levels and getting agreement on new contracts,"" IHS Markit economist Rob Dobson said.
British factories cut jobs for a second month running in May and ran down backlogs of work at the fastest rate in six years, a poor omen for manufacturing output, the survey showed.
""The current manufacturing downturn may have further to run and will have negative ramifications for growth in the broader economy in the months ahead,"" Dobson said.
Still, manufacturers struck a more optimistic tone for the longer term as expectations for future output struck an eight-month high, based on hope that worries around Brexit and global trade will eventually subside.

IHS Markit's Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) for manufacturing, which accounts for about a fifth of the economy, fell to 44.3, close to its lowest level since 2012. That matched a flash reading and below the 44.4 reading recorded in April.
The slight drop as well as a slower decline in new orders for the second month running suggested that the manufacturing sector - which has been contracting since January on unresolved trade disputes and a slowing world economy - was stabilizing.
Another sign that stabilization could come in the months ahead was reflected in future expectations being less pessimistic than in April.
Still, the slump is prompting manufacturers to trim staffing levels. The survey showed employment had fallen the most in almost six and a half years.
""After only modest falls in employment in March and April, manufacturers showed an increased willingness to trim staffing capacity,"" said Phil Smith, Principal Economist at IHS Markit.
In its 10th year of growth, the German economy is expected to grow by a modest 0.5% this year, the government projects, after calendar-adjusted growth rates of 2.5% in 2017 and 1.5% in 2018.
The slowdown has started to spill over into an otherwise solid labor market that has been providing impetus to a consumption-driven growth cycle.
German unemployment rose for the first time in nearly two years in May. If the trend continues, the signs of stress seen among manufacturers could replicate themselves in the services sector, which is more dependent on the local economy.

LONDON, (Reuters) - Manufacturing activity in the euro zone contracted for a fourth month in May, and at a faster pace, as the U.S.-China trade war, slumping automotive demand, Brexit and wider geopolitical uncertainty took their toll, a survey showed.
IHS Markit's May final manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index was 47.7, matching an earlier flash reading but below April's 47.9 and only just above March's six-year low.
An index measuring output change, which feeds into a composite PMI due on Wednesday that is seen as a good gauge of economic health, also held below the 50-mark separating growth from contraction, coming in at 48.9. It was 48.0 in April.
""Euro area manufacturing remained in contraction during May, suggesting the sector will act as a drag on the wider economy in the second quarter,"" said Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit.
""A fourth successive monthly drop in output and further steep decline in new orders underscored how the sector remains in its toughest spell since 2013.""
Indicating there will be no turnaround anytime soon, the index measuring new orders held below the breakeven mark for an eighth month - although it rose to 46.6 from April's 45.8.
Monday's survey adds to evidence the bloc's economy is under pressure and will likely be of concern to policymakers at the European Central Bank who have already raised the prospect of further support.
There is little likelihood of them raising interest rates before 2021, according to economists in a Reuters poll last week, who said the bank's next policy move will be to tweak its forward guidance toward more accommodation. 
Forward-looking PMI survey indicators suggest more support will be needed as the slowdown will continue this month. Purchasing of raw materials was reduced, headcount fell for the first time in nearly five years and backlogs of orders were run down.

""Companies are tightening their belts, cutting back on spending and hiring. Input buying, inventories and employment are all now in decline as manufacturers worry about being exposed to a further downturn in demand,"" Williamson said.

The index's headline reading fell to 49.8 from 51.8 in the previous month, sliding below the 50.0 mark that separates expansion from contraction for the first time since August 2018.
""The decline was only fractional, but driven by slower growth in output and new orders, and a faster fall in employment,"" said Sian Jones, an economist at IHS Markit, which compiles the survey.
Employment in the Russian manufacturing sector fell for a second consecutive month in May, IHS Markit said. Production across the sector only slightly increased this month, softening significantly after having peaked in March. 
Jones also said that IHS Markit had forecast a weaker expansion in industrial production in the second quarter of 2019.
Despite falling employment and slowing output, Russian manufacturers remained optimistic this month regarding output growth for the coming year, the survey showed.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australian businesses reported a decent increase in profits for the first three months of the year, supported by surging iron ore prices while higher wages and inventories may have also helped prop up momentum in the slowing economy.
Data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) showed first-quarter gross company profits climbed 1.7% while business inventories surprisingly rose 0.7% when economists were expecting a flat outcome.
The wages bill was also robust, gaining 1.1% in the quarter - almost double the employment growth in the period, an indication of the rapid job creation lately.
""So on balance, we're lifting our GDP forecast from 0.4% to 0.6%,"" Citi economist Josh Williamson said.
First-quarter gross domestic product (GDP) data is due on Wednesday.
A stronger number will be welcomed by the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA), although it is still tipped to cut the benchmark cash rate to an all-time low of 1.25% on Tuesday to revive demand in the economy.
The median forecast in a Reuters poll of analysts showed GDP likely grew a pedestrian 0.4% last quarter while the annual pace slowed to 1.7%, the weakest since the global financial crisis.
""The prospect of stronger Q1 GDP...could even keep the RBA's 1.75% June (annual) GDP growth estimate within reach. This could dent market expectations for more than 50 basis points of cuts (this year),"" Williamson added.
National Australia Bank economists also see upside risks to their 0.4% forecast as a result of Monday's data.
But not everyone was so optimistic. The increase in gross profits, which undershot expectations, was almost entirely led by miners with non-mining profits excluding finance ticking up a meager 0.2%.
More so, ""rising inventories and disappointing sales are not a good combination for the outlook,"" ANZ said in a note. ""Together these numbers suggest some downside risk to our forecast for a (quarterly) rise of 0.6%.""
THREE TIMES?
A slowing economy and tepid inflation have led financial markets to fully price in two rate cuts this year, including one on Tuesday, and a 50-50 chance of a third move to 0.75% by Christmas.
In contrast to seemingly upbeat first-quarter figures, a batch of monthly indicators also out on Monday showed an economy that is losing traction.
One of the biggest areas of concern is a slowdown in Australia's property market. Home prices slid 7.3% in May, from a year ago, a report from consultancy CoreLogic on showed on Monday, having fallen consistently since late-2017.
The losses have hurt household wealth given the housing stock is valued at A$6.8 trillion ($4.83 trillion), or almost four times Australia's annual economic output.
""The housing downturn will remain a drag on the economy throughout 2019 and into 2020,"" said Ben Udy, a Singapore-based economist at Capital Economics, who expects prices to reach their trough by year-end.
""To combat that economic slowdown we think the RBA will need to cut rates three times this year, starting at its meeting tomorrow.""
Policymakers are holding out hope for the job market to stay strong but an indicator of labor market demand out on Monday pointed to a loss in momentum.
ANZ job advertisements slumped 8.4% in May from April, their biggest monthly decline in more than nine years.
That follows official figures that showed the unemployment rate hit an eight-month high of 5.2% in April from a decade low of 4.9% just in February.
However, ANZ's head of Australian economics took comfort from a pick-up in advertisements in the last week of May, following a national election in which the business-friendly coalition stayed in power.
""If the last week of May is indicative, then job ads will rebound strongly in June,"" said ANZ's David Plank.

1180,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 03, 2019 01:15AM ET</span>",India factory activity grows at fastest pace in three months in May: PMI,"BENGALURU, (Reuters) - India's manufacturing sector expanded at its quickest pace in three months in May on improved output and new orders, according to a private business survey which also showed a pick up in hiring.
The survey found increased optimism about manufacturing activity over the coming year, probably helped as Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi scored a dramatic election victory on a mandate of business-friendly policies and a tough stand on national security.
Almost 70% of responses were collected after exit polls showed Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party would return to power for a second term. 
The Nikkei Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index increased to 52.7 in May from April's eight-month low of 51.8, remaining above the 50-mark threshold that separates growth from contraction for a 22nd straight month.
""A revival in new order growth promoted a faster upturn in manufacturing production, as Indian firms sought to replenish inventories utilized in May to fulfill strengthening demand,"" Pollyanna De Lima, principal economist at IHS Markit, said in a release.
The new business orders sub-index, which tracks overall demand, rose as foreign demand increased at the fastest pace in three months. Output also grew at the strongest rate since February.
That led firms to increase the pace of hiring from the previous month when headcount was barely changed.
""To assist with higher output needs, and benefit from relatively muted cost inflation, companies stepped up hiring and input purchasing,"" De Lima said.
""Goods producers were also able to charge competitive prices due to negligible increases in their cost burdens, meaning not only higher sales in the domestic market, but also greater overseas demand.""
Although input costs increased at a stronger pace in May, manufacturers did not pass on those pressures to customers and instead trimmed prices for the first time since December. The output prices sub index dropped to 49.9 from 50.8.
That will help keep retail inflation muted and well below the Reserve Bank of India's 4% target, increasing the likelihood of an interest rate cut at the next policy review on June 6.

If the central bank cuts rates this week, as expected, it would mark the third consecutive easing in as many meetings.

1182,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 03, 2019 12:51AM ET</span>",China May factory activity shows recovery still patchy: Caixin PMI,"BEIJING (Reuters) - China's factory activity expanded at a steady but modest pace in May, a private survey showed, but analysts say front-loading of exports by firms to the United States to avoid higher tariffs masked underlying weakness in the economy. 
Manufacturers in the world's second-biggest economy have come under severe pressure recently from an escalating trade dispute with the United States. An official gauge on factory activity last week showed conditions deteriorating as both domestic and external demand slackened.
Monday's Caixin/Markit Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) also showed only modest expansion at 50.2, unchanged from April, and above economists' expectations of 50.0. 
While it marked the third-month the index has stayed above the neutral 50-mark dividing expansion from contraction, output growth slipped and businesses were the least optimistic on production since the survey series began in April 2012.
Growth of new orders picked up in May, although the rate of expansion remained marginal. Survey respondents attributed increased sales to stronger foreign demand and new product launches, with new export orders rising at its fastest pace since January after contracting in April.
But some also cited tough competition and more challenging trading conditions. 
Unlike China's larger, official factory survey, the private gauge is mainly focused on small to mid-sized firms which are more export-oriented, exposing them to both disruptions from the months-long U.S.-China trade war and softening demand globally. 
The increase in new export orders point to possible front-loading of U.S.-bound shipments by some firms to avoid potential tariff hikes that U.S. President Donald Trump had threatened to slap on another $300 billion of Chinese goods, analysts at Nomura wrote in a note.
However, the front-loading is likely to be ""a short-lived distortion and more severe payback effects may follow,"" they said. 
The Caixin survey showed factory output expanded at the slowest pace since January, and while some firms raised production due to higher new orders, others commented on relatively subdued demand conditions. 
A considerable part of China's economic support program has been aimed at keeping struggling smaller firms afloat, with Beijing particularly sensitive to any large-scale layoffs that could stoke social angst.
The survey showed companies continued to shed jobs in May for the second straight month to curb operating costs, following the first increase in hiring in nearly 5-1/2 years in March.
Most economists say Beijing will need to roll out more stimulus to support growth, with expectations centering on further cuts in the amount of cash banks hold as reserves and fiscal spending. 
Last month's sudden escalation of China's trade dispute with the United States has further heightened fears of a steeper downturn for the world's second-largest economy. With Washington slapping additional tariffs of up to 25% on $200 billion of Chinese goods, prompting Beijing to retaliate, financial markets have had a torrid time in the past month.
Over a one-year horizon, businesses were the least optimistic on production since the survey series began in April 2012 in May.
""The ongoing China-US trade dispute, restrictive state policies, a weak automotive market and generally subdued global demand conditions were all cited as key factors likely to weigh on production over the next year,"" a statement accompanying the Caixin survey said.
In a note to clients, Jingyang Chen, an economist with HSBC Global Research, said the trade war remains a key risk for manufacturers.

""Beijing will likely double down on easing for the private sector.""

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japanese business investment rose in January-March, continuing the run of growth seen over the past two years although signs of slowing momentum have raised concerns about the strength of business activity amid mounting global economic risks.
Ministry of Finance (MOF) data out on Monday showed capital expenditure grew 6.1% in January-March from the same period last year, led by chemicals, production machinery and leasing of goods. It followed a 5.7% gain in the previous quarter.
Excluding software, capital expenditure rose 1.1% in January-March from the previous quarter on a seasonally-adjusted basis, up for a second straight quarter. But it slowed from the previous quarter's 3.9% gain.
The data will be used to calculate revised gross domestic product figures due on June 10.
A preliminary estimate out last month showed Japan's economy grew at an annualized 2.1% in the first quarter as imports fell faster than exports, while business and household spending slipped in a sign of weak domestic demand.
A downward revision could fuel speculation that Prime Minister Shinzo Abe may again postpone a twice-delayed sales tax hike scheduled for October, although the premier has repeatedly vowed to go ahead with the hike barring a big economic shock. 
Capital expenditure has been a bright spot in the world's third-largest economy, as companies refurbish their old equipment and boost investment in automation and labor-saving technology to cope with labor shortages in an aging society.
However, business investment has recently shown some signs of slowdown as the intensifying Sino-U.S. trade war and slowing external demand hit global trade and supply chains, hurting Japan's export-reliant economy.
Economists expect Japan's growth to slow in the current quarter reflecting weak demand both at home and abroad.
Monday's MOF data showed corporate recurring profits rose 10.3% in January-March from a year earlier, reversing from the previous quarter's 7.0% decline.

Corporate sales rose 3.0% year-on-year in January-March, up for a 10th straight quarter.

The headline Nikkei/Markit purchasing managers' index (PMI) on the country's manufacturing sector fell to 48.4, from 50.2 in April.
The overall index dropped below the 50-point level that separates growth from contraction, with major sub-components remaining weak.
New export orders from the world's sixth-largest exporting nation shrank at a faster pace, extending the contraction for a 10th straight month, the longest decline since 2015.
New orders also contracted for a seventh straight month with the sub-index at 47.1, a sign of further deterioration in domestic demand.
""Given the recent re-escalation of trade tensions between the United States and China, as well as no real signs of the downturn in the global trade cycle bottoming out, South Korean manufacturers are facing extreme difficulties,"" said Joe Hayes, an economist at IHS Markit.
The PMI survey also showed manufacturers cutting headcount as production fell on weak demand, both at home and abroad.
South Korea's unemployment rate rose to a three-month high in April to 4.1%, close to a nine-year high of 4.4% reached in January, as jobs were shed in the manufacturing and construction sectors.
The PMI shows South Korean firms are scaling back their future output plans amid the increasing economic challenges.
""Subsequently, firms moderated their expectations, leading business confidence to dip to its lowest since August 2016,"" Hayes said.
On Friday, South Korea's central bank kept its monetary policy unchanged but a split vote in the decision provided a firm signal the bank was shifting to a dovish footing as the trade war bolstered calls for more stimulus.

The May PMI provides another sign South Korea's economy could continue cooling in the second quarter, having already contracted at its fastest pace since the global financial crisis in the first quarter.

The Make UK manufacturing organization and accountants BDO said output and orders continued to grow but at a slower rate than in the early months of 2019.
Britain's economy picked up early this year, helped by the biggest rise in factory output in 20 years as companies raced to stockpile goods to avoid disruption to supply chains in the run-up to the original March 29 Brexit deadline.
But the latest quarterly Make UK survey showed a weakening of hiring and investment intentions.
""Earlier this year there was clear evidence that industry was on steroids as companies stockpiled. Underneath, however, there is now growing evidence of European companies abandoning UK supply chains,"" Make UK chief executive Stephen Phipson said.
He added that Asian customers were also balking at the discord surrounding the outlook for British trade terms.
Make UK expects British factory output to grow just 0.2% this year and 0.8% in 2020, weaker than the rest of the economy.
The Make UK/BDO survey covered 344 companies between May 1 and May 22.

The closely-watched IHS Markit/CIPS monthly survey of British factories is due at 0830 GMT. Economists polled by Reuters expect it to show manufacturing growth cooled somewhat in May.

Britain's economy grew solidly in the first three months of this year, according to official data, boosted in part by factories stockpiling raw materials ahead of a Brexit that failed to come as planned on March 29. 
But some business surveys have pointed to weakness since, and the Bank of England has forecast a second-quarter slowdown as the boost from stockpiling fades. 
The CBI said its monthly growth indicator sank to -1 for May from zero in April.
""Private sector activity remains stuck in neutral, with conditions in the service sector notably weak,"" said CBI economist Alpesh Paleja. ""Businesses continue to cite the ongoing drag from Brexit uncertainty, which is holding back key projects, pipelines of work and investment.""

Last week, the CBI wrote to Conservative lawmakers competing to succeed Theresa May as prime minister, urging them to avoid a no-deal Brexit, for which it said the ""vast majority"" of businesses were unable to prepare.

SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea's exports in May fell more than expected and for a sixth consecutive month from a year earlier, official data showed on Saturday, as expanding trade friction between the major economies darkened the prospects.
Overseas sales dropped 9.4% in May from a year earlier, trade ministry data showed, worse than a median 5.6% loss tipped in a Reuters poll. Imports edged down 1.9% in May against a 0.4 percent rise seen in the poll.
The bleak May trade data from South Korea, the world's sixth-largest exporter, was the latest evidence of cooling global economy amid the prolonged trade friction between the United States and China.
""If there's no concrete deal during the G20 summit period in late June, there will be additional tariff raises kicking in and it will give an additional huge impact globally,"" said Park Sang-hyun, chief economist at Hi Investment & Securities.
The data came just hours after U.S. President Donald Trump's unexpected threat of tariffs on Mexican goods fed fears of recession in the major economies and sent global equity markets tumbling to their lowest in months.
South Korea's trade ministry said the poor May exports were led by a 30.5% drop in memory chip sales, while exports to China fell 20.1% for their worst performance in more than three years with the giant neighboring market.
The sluggish May exports, following a loss of 2.0% in April, dash the South Korean government's hopes that overseas shipments will begin recovering soon and pile pressure on the central bank to cut interest rates.
In April, the Bank of Korea trimmed its forecast for economic growth this year to 2.5% from the previous 2.6%, but economists now expect the central bank to deliver another downgrade when it reviews the projection in July.
On Friday, its monetary policy committee held the policy interest rate steady at 1.75%, but a split vote in the decision gave a firm signal the central bank was shifting to a dovish stance to help support the economy.

1188,By Reuters,"<span>May 31, 2019 12:17PM ET</span>",U.S. inflation perks ups; slowing economy may limit gains,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. consumer prices increased by the most in 15 months in April, but a cooling in spending pointed to a slowdown in economic growth that could keep inflation pressures moderate.
The report from the Commerce Department on Friday supported Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell's view that a recent disinflationary trend ""may wind up being transient."" 
Inflation remains below the U.S. central bank's 2.0% target. That, together with the slowing economy, has increased calls, including from President Donald Trump, for the Fed to cut interest rates. The Fed this month kept rates unchanged and signaled little desire to adjust monetary policy anytime soon.
""The Fed is in a good place when it comes to its current policy, but it won't be for long if the market's forecasts for rate cuts are to be believed,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG in New York. ""The market and the president want rate cuts and they might just get them if this slowdown persists and the Fed caves to the mob of public opinion."" 
Consumer prices as measured by the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index increased 0.3% last month, the biggest gain since January 2018, after rising 0.2% in March.
That lifted the annual increase in the PCE price index to 1.5% from 1.4% in March. Inflation was boosted by higher prices for gasoline and services, which offset a 0.3% drop in the cost of food. 
Excluding the volatile food and energy components, the PCE price index gained 0.2% last month after edging up 0.1% in March. In the 12 months through April, the so-called core PCE price index increased 1.6% after rising 1.5% in March. 
The core PCE index is the Fed's preferred inflation measure. It hit the U.S. central bank's 2% inflation target in March 2018 for the first time since April 2012. 
A much weaker inflation pulse than initially thought in the first quarter had led economists to anticipate that the annual core PCE price index would remain at 1.5% in April.
TRADE DISPUTES CLOUD OUTLOOK
Economists said it was unclear what the impact on inflation would be from Trump's announcement late on Thursday that he would impose a tariff on all goods from Mexico in a bid to stem the tide of illegal immigration across the U.S.-Mexican border.
But the duties, which Trump said would start at 5% on June 10 and increase monthly until reaching 25% on Oct. 1 unless Mexico takes immediate action, were expected to undercut growth. 
Washington is already waging a trade war with China that has recently escalated and led consumers to anticipate higher prices. A survey by the University of Michigan on Friday showed its measure of consumers' inflation expectations over the next 12 months rose to 2.9% in May from 2.5% in April. 
""There is little doubt that economic growth will suffer each day these tariffs stay in place,"" said Kevin Giddis, head of fixed income capital markets at Raymond James in Memphis, Tennessee. ""What we aren't sure of is whether it will be inflationary. If it is, there aren't many places to hide.""
Stocks on Wall Street were trading lower as the tariffs on Mexican goods rattled investors. 
The dollar slipped against a basket of currencies, while benchmark U.S. Treasury yields dropped to a 20-month low.
Consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, rose 0.3% as consumers cut back purchases of long-lasting manufactured goods such as motor vehicles. They also spent less on services, including household electricity and gas.
Consumer spending jumped 1.1% in March, the biggest increase since August 2009. When adjusted for inflation, consumer spending was unchanged in April. This so-called real consumer spending rose 0.9% in March. 
The weak real consumer spending in April added to soft reports on industrial production, orders for long-lasting manufactured goods and home sales in suggesting slower economic growth in the second quarter.
As a result, the Atlanta Fed cut its GDP estimate for the second quarter by one-tenth of a percentage point to a 1.2% annualized rate. The economy grew at a 3.1% pace last quarter, flattered by the volatile exports, inventory and defense components. 
But consumer spending remains supported by a strong labor market. The lowest unemployment rate in nearly 50 years is steadily pushing up wages. 

Last month, personal income rose 0.5% in April, with wages gaining 0.3%. Income ticked up 0.1% in March. Savings increased to $990.3 billion in April from $963.7 billion in March.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India's economy grew at a much-lower-than-expected 5.8% in the January-March period, its slowest pace in 17 quarters, and falling behind China's pace for the first time in nearly two years, data showed on Friday.
The slowdown will put pressure on Prime Minister Narendra Modi's re-elected government and the central bank to provide stimulus through fiscal measures and interest rate cuts.
Nirmala Sitharaman, who assumed charge as the finance minister on Friday, is expected to deliver some tax cuts in her first full-year budget in early July while keeping the budget deficit close to target. The Reserve Bank of India is expected to reduce interest rates at its June meeting. 
A Reuters poll of economists had forecast a growth rate of 6.3 percent for the March quarter, compared with a 6.6% rise in the October-December period in 2018.
Weaker consumer demand and slower growth in investments were blamed for the slowdown. Private investment grew 7.2 percent in the March quarter, down from 8.4 percent in the previous quarter, while investment growth slowed to 3.6 percent from 10.6 percent, the data showed. 
Economists said growth could slow further in the current quarter, the first of the fiscal year, citing weakening global growth as a depressing factor.
The slowdown would ""lead to pressures"" for fiscal stimulus, including tax cuts on fuel products to boost consumption, said N.R. Bhanumurthy, an economist at the National Institute of Public Finance and Policy, a Delhi-based think-tank.
The Statistics Ministry also revised its estimate for growth in the fiscal year ending March 31 to 6.8% from a previously projected 7%.
The government is already considering rolling out a slew of 'big-bang' economic reforms in the first 100 days of Modi's second term, with a focus on privatization of state assets and relaxation of labor and land rules for businesses, a top official at the government's main think tank told Reuters.
Several indicators – automobile sales, rail freight, petroleum product consumption, domestic air traffic and imports - indicate a slowdown in domestic consumption. 
The farm sector contracted 0.1% in the March quarter compared with 2.7% growth in the previous quarter, while manufacturing grew 3.1%, slower than 6.7% in the previous quarter.

Corporate earnings hit a six-quarter low growth rate of 10.7% during January-March on weakening consumer sentiment and softening commodity prices, ICRA, the Indian arm of the ratings agency Moody's, said on Tuesday, citing a sample of more than 300 companies.

Analysts in a Reuters poll had predicted annualized first quarter growth of 0.7% as the economy battles low oil prices and global trade tensions. The Bank of Canada is not predicting a recovery until the second half of 2019.
Although household spending and business investment in machinery and equipment grew in the first quarter from the fourth quarter of 2018, this was moderated by a decline in exports and investment in housing.
Gross domestic product in March grew by 0.5% from February - the largest increase since the 0.5% gain seen in May 2018 - on widespread improvement across both the goods- and service-producing sectors.

The Bank of Canada forecast on April 24 that annualized first quarter GDP would be 0.3%. The central bank held interest rates steady as expected on Wednesday, saying there was evidence that the economic slowdown was temporary.

ISTANBUL (Reuters) - The Turkish economy shrank sharply year on year for the second straight quarter in early 2019, laying bare the impact of a punishing currency crisis and soaring inflation and interest rates against a tense political backdrop.
The major emerging market economy contracted 2.6% in the first quarter after a 3% percent decline in the previous three months, rocked by a fall of more than a third in the value of the lira since the end of 2017. 
A burst of government spending before local elections on March 31 helped contain the slump, though a subsequent further selloff in the lira and worsening sentiment could drag on gross domestic product (GDP) again toward the middle of 2019.
""The tightening of financial conditions over the past couple of months has probably resulted in a renewed downturn,"" said Capital Economics senior EM economist Jason Tuvey, pointing to a broad market sell-off since late March.
""This reinforces our view that the recovery will be slow and bumpy.""
Last year's currency crisis, brought on by concerns over a diplomatic row with Washington and doubts about the independence of the central bank, ended years of a construction-fuelled boom driven by cheap foreign capital and characterized by growth rates above 5 percent.
Inflation shot up as the central bank hiked borrowing costs to support the ailing lira. 
The lira has come under renewed pressure in recent months as investors fretted about the threat of new U.S. sanctions, uncertainty over local election results, declining central bank reserves and a trend of Turks ramping up foreign holdings. 
The lira firmed to 5.85 against the dollar from 5.8825 after Friday's Statistical Institute data, which compared with a Reuters poll forecast for a first quarter shrinkage of 2.5%.
RECESSION DEBATE
Quarter-on-quarter, the economy returned to growth in the first quarter after a contraction in the second half of 2018, with GDP expanding a seasonally and calendar-adjusted 1.3%.
While some economists said this marked the end of a technical recession and others said two straight quarters of year-on-year contraction showed it had just begun, there was a consensus that Turkey's economy may well slump again in the current quarter. 
The biggest drag in the first quarter was construction activity, down 10.9% year on year, while the industrial and services sectors also shrank.
Agriculture expanded 2.5% while government spending jumped 7.2%, reflecting stimulus ahead of the March vote that handed President Tayyip Erdogan's AK Party a defeat in Istanbul. 
That result however was later annulled, with a re-run vote set for June 23. The prospect of a second election campaign has hit investor sentiment and weighed on second-quarter data. 
""The breakdown of the (GDP) data revealed that, unsurprisingly, the expansion was driven by pre-election stimulus measures,"" said Tuvey. 
In April, the Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) for manufacturing fell to 46.8 from 47.2 in March, while consumer confidence tumbled to 55.3 points in May, its lowest level since the data was first published in 2004.
Separate data on Friday showed the foreign trade deficit narrowed 55.6 percent year-on-year in April to $2.982 billion, with exports rising 4.6% while imports slid 15.1%.

In a Reuters survey of 19 institutions before the data was released, GDP was predicted to contract 0.1% this year. The International Monetary Fund and the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development see it shrinking 2.5%-2.6%.

BEIJING (Reuters) - China's consumers are fretting over soaring fruit prices as poor domestic harvests and higher tariffs on U.S. imports take a bite out of supplies.
The rising cost of apples, pears and water melons has fueled consumer fears of inflation at a time when income growth is slowing in a cooling economy. 
""How on earth are fruits more expensive than meat these days?"" said college student Rachel Zhou as she shopped for lychees in Beijing.
The average national wholesale price of Fuji apples - the most popular variety in China - rose more than 75% this week from a year ago, data from the Ministry of Agriculture showed. 
Aksu apples and Korla pears sold at Jiangnan market – one of China's biggest fruit and vegetable wholesale markets - jumped 90% and 60%, respectively, in May, according to Reuters calculations based on data from the market in Guangzhou city.
In April, the price of fresh fruits pushed the Consumer Price Index up by 0.22 percentage points.
(GRAPHIC: Measuring China's ""fruit freedom""; png, https://tmsnrt.rs/2Kg97eE)
Extreme frost and hail hit major fruit producing regions last year, slashing stocks of staple fruits like apples, growers and traders said.
Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and pear production fell 25% and 20%, respectively, in 2018 from a year earlier, the Commerce Ministry said. 
The shortage was compounded by the China-U.S. trade war, with oranges, cherries and apples among the U.S. goods that China slapped with higher import tariffs last year.
Importers scrambling to find alternative supplies have pushed up prices for fruits from Europe and Africa, said Loren Zhao, co-founder of the Shanghai-based, e-commerce firm Fruitday that specializes in high-end produce.
""Every type of fruit is now more or less several U.S. dollars more expensive,"" Zhao said.
""FRUIT FREEDOM""
Consumers are going online to vent their frustration. The phrase ""fruit freedom"" was among the most searched topics on Chinese social media platform Weibo this month. 
In a Beijing produce market, an elderly woman stood in front of a fruit stand, stared at the price tags for several minutes and walked away empty handed.
""I'm a big fan of apples and I've been eating at least one apple a day for a few decades. But the price surge this time forced me to quit my habit,"" she told Reuters.
The price spike has caught the attention of Premier Li Keqiang, who visited a fruit shop last week in eastern Shandong province where he called for ""appropriate measures"" to ensure sufficient supply and stable prices. 
Some analysts worry about the impact on inflation.
High fruit prices are expected to persist through the summer months, fruit traders said, and African swine fever outbreaks are driving up pork prices, which added 0.31 percentage points to April CPI.
That could constrain Beijing's ability to further ease credit conditions to support a slowing economy, analysts say.
The Commerce Ministry said on Thursday pork prices were expected to stabilize and prices for vegetables and fruits would fall as supplies improved.
For now, fruit lovers like Zhou Xiaoyu are avoiding that particular aisle in their supermarket. 
""This year my feeling is that fruits are super expensive, and if you can have 'fruit freedom', you are really rich,"" said the 26-year-old office clerk in the eastern city of Nanjing.

""I used to eat fruits, but now I basically don't buy anything,"" Zhou said.

Stocks fluctuated and the yuan pared a drop as many observers interpreted weakness in the economy as a sign the government will roll out some stimulus. Data released Friday morning by the National Bureau of Statistics showed that China’s manufacturing purchasing managers’ index dropped to 49.4, worse than the 49.9 forecast in a Bloomberg survey of economists.
Citic Securities Co. and Bank of America Merrill Lynch (NYSE:BAC) have already flagged the possibility that China could cut the reserve requirement ratio as liquidity tightens. The People’s Bank of China added a net 430 billion yuan ($62 billion) into the banking system this week, the most since mid-January. Those injections were seen as a response to market jitters resulting from the government’s takeover of a Chinese lender -- the first in 20 years.
Sentiment has also been damped by the China-U.S. trade dispute, which doesn’t appear to be headed toward a resolution anytime soon. That has sent the yuan toward its worst month since July, and the benchmark Shanghai Composite Index toward a 5.7% monthly drop. Foreign investors are in line to sell about 53 billion yuan of Chinese equities this month, smashing last month’s record of 18 billion yuan.

1195,By Investing.com,"<span>May 30, 2019 11:35PM ET</span>",China’s Official Manufacturing PMI for May Contracts More Than Expected,"Investing.com - China’s factory activity in May contracted more than expected amid the ongoing trade dispute with the U.S.
The official manufacturing PMI fell to 49.4 from 50.1 in April, the National Bureau of Statistics showed. Analysts previously expected the figure to drop to 49.9 in May.
A reading below 50 indicates contraction.
The non-manufacturing PMI for May was 54.3, in line with expectation and unchanged from April.
The PMI is closely watched by investors who are paying close attention for signs of slowing growth amid the ongoing trade war between the U.S. and China.
Former governor of the People’s Bank of China Dai Xianglong said on Friday that he expected no major trade breakthrough when Chinese President Xi Jinping meets with his U.S. counterpart Donald Trump next month at the G-20 meeting.
“The fall in the headline index was mostly driven by weaker new orders. Export orders dropped back particularly sharply, which suggests that [US President Donald] Trump’s latest tariff hike may already be undermining foreign demand,” said Julian Evans-Pritchard, senior China economist at Capital Economics, in a Bloomberg report.
The Caixin manufacturing PMI, which features a bigger mix of small- and medium-sized firms, is due on June 3."
1196,By Reuters,"<span>May 30, 2019 09:59PM ET</span>",China May factory activity shrinks more than expected as exports falter,"BEIJING (Reuters) - China's factory activity in May slumped into a deeper contraction than markets had expected, heaping pressure on Beijing to roll out more stimulus to support an economy hit hard by a bruising trade war with the United States.
Friday's weak manufacturing readings, which follow a recent raft of soft data across the retail, export and construction sectors, could inflame concerns about the risk of a global recession and push more central banks to adopt an accommodative monetary stance. 
The official Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) fell to 49.4 in May from 50.1 in April, data from the statistics bureau showed. Analysts surveyed by Reuters had forecast the PMI to be down a notch at 49.9, below the 50-point mark separates expansion from contraction on a monthly basis.
Factory output expanded at a slower pace as new orders fell for the first time in four months. Export orders extended their decline for the twelfth straight month with the sub-index pulling back significantly to 46.5 from April's 49.2, suggesting a further weakening in global demand.
""Export orders dropped back particularly sharply, which suggests that Trump’s latest tariff hike may already be undermining foreign demand,"" said Julian Evans-Pritchard, senior China economist at Capital Economics.
While China's exporters are feeling the pinch, Friday's data showed import orders also contracted at a quicker pace, reflecting softening demand at home despite a flurry of growth-supporting measures that were rolled out earlier this year. 
Trade tensions between Washington and Beijing escalated sharply earlier this month after the Trump administration accused China of having ""reneged"" on its previous promises to make structural changes to its economic practices.
Washington later slapped additional tariffs of up to 25% on $200 billion of Chinese goods, prompting Beijing to retaliate. 
The tariff standoff has already taken a toll on global growth, trade and business investment. Further inflaming tensions between the economic giants, the Trump administration blacklisted Huawei Technologies Co Ltd, the world's second-largest seller of smartphones, a blow that has rippled through global supply chains and battered technology shares.
Both sides appeared to be digging in as President Donald Trump threatens to increase taxes on all China imports while Beijing ramped up its criticism against Washington, saying provoking trade disputes is ""naked economic terrorism"".
China's exports unexpectedly fell in April on a sharp drop in shipments to the United States, while industrial output and retail sales also showed surprisingly weak growth last month. Data this week showed profits for industrial firms also contracted in April.
While most analysts believe more stimulus are needed to cushion the economy as external uncertainties cloud the outlook, a senior central bank official said on Thursday a relatively slower rate of monetary expansion would be enough to sustain economic activity.

Despite the weakness in the manufacturing sector, another survey released by the statistics bureau on Friday showed growth in China's services industry remained in solid expansion territory. The official non-manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) held steady at 54.3 in May, unchanged from April.

Solid demand from British households has kept the economy ticking over during a period when many businesses have called a halt to major investment until the terms of Britain's departure from the European Union become clearer.
The GfK consumer sentiment index rose to -10 in May from April's increase of -13, its highest since September 2018 and beating all forecasts in a Reuters poll of economist.
However, GfK said it expected further gains to be limited while it remained uncertain how Britain would leave the European Union on the newly set Brexit date of Oct. 31.
""Consumers will need to be convinced in heart, head and wallet that Brexit's murkiness has finally come to an end,"" GfK executive Joe Staton said.
GfK's data showed a big split between households' relatively upbeat assessment of their own financial situation - reflecting high levels of employment and rising wage growth - and a far bleaker assessment of the broader prospects for the economy.
Separately, figures from Lloyds (LON:LLOY) Bank showed that last month's news of a six-month delay to Brexit had only offered a fleeting boost to business morale.
Lloyds's monthly business barometer sank back to +10 in May from +14 in April, its first fall in three months.

""A slight dip in confidence this month appears largely to reflect companies' assessment of their own trading prospects for the coming year, and the anticipated impact of the UK leaving the EU,"" Lloyds Bank economist Hann-Ju Ho said.

1202,By Reuters,"<span>May 30, 2019 01:03PM ET</span>",U.S. inflation much softer in first quarter; puts spotlight on Fed,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. inflation was much weaker than initially thought in the first quarter amid a sharp slowdown in domestic demand, which could cast doubts on the Federal Reserve's view that the benign price pressures were largely because of temporary factors.
The weak inflation pulse reported by the Commerce Department on Thursday could also pile pressure on the U.S. central bank to cut interest rates, especially as the economy appeared to slow in the second quarter. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said recently he believed the soft inflation ""may wind up being transient."" 
The personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index excluding the volatile food and energy components increased at a 1.0% rate last quarter, the government said. The so-called core PCE price index, which is the Fed's preferred inflation measure, was previously reported to have risen at a 1.3% pace. 
The increase last quarter was the smallest in four years and pushed inflation further below the Fed's 2% target. Inflation has been running below its target this year and President Donald Trump has urged the Fed to cut rates. 
""The low inflation readings are likely to be persistent,"" said Sung Won Sohn, an economics professor at Loyola Marymount University in Los Angeles. ""With both inflation and economic growth going in the wrong direction, the Fed is likely to cut rates later this year.""
The Fed early this month kept rates unchanged and signaled little inclination to adjust monetary policy anytime soon. Inflation has been restrained in part by weaker prices for portfolio management services, apparel, and airfares. 
Economists said the sharp downward revision to the first-quarter inflation rate raised the risk of a lower core PCE price index number in April. 
With healthcare costs rising at both the producer and consumer levels in April, economists had expected the core PCE price index reading to remain unchanged at 1.6% year-on-year in April.
The government will publish the April core PCE price index data on Friday. Inflation hit the Fed's 2% target in March last year for the first time since April 2012. 
""This raises the chances that tomorrow's core PCE inflation rate prints at 1.5% on a year-over-year basis, which would potentially give the Fed more ammunition to worry about a low inflation rate,"" said John Ryding, chief economist at RDQ Economics in New York.
The dollar was little changed against a basket of currencies, while U.S. Treasury prices rose. Stocks on Wall Street were trading higher. 
SLOWING GROWTH
The government also reported on Thursday that gross domestic product increased at a 3.1% annualized rate in the first quarter, pared from the 3.2% pace it estimated last month. The economy grew at a 2.2% pace in the October-December period. 
The economy will mark 10 years of expansion in July, the longest on record. Growth last quarter was, however, flattered by the volatile export, inventory and defense components.
Excluding trade, inventories and government spending, the economy grew at a 1.3% rate, the slowest since the second quarter of 2013. This measure of domestic demand increased at a 2.6% pace in the fourth quarter.
When measured from the income side, the economy grew at a rate of 1.4% in the first quarter. Gross domestic income (GDI), increased at a 0.5% pace in the fourth quarter. 
The average of GDP and GDI, also referred to as gross domestic output and considered a better measure of economic activity, increased at a 2.2% rate in the January-March period, up from a 1.3% growth pace in the fourth quarter. 
The inventory-and-export-driven growth spurt appears to have fizzled early in the second quarter. The slowdown largely reflects the fading stimulus from the Trump administration's hefty tax cuts and spending increases last year. A trade war between the United States and China is also hurting the economy. 
In another report on Thursday, the Commerce Department said exports fell 4.2% in April. The report added to weak April data on industrial production, orders for long-lasting manufactured goods, retail and home sales. 
The growth drag from inventories is, however, likely to be small. The government reported that wholesale inventories increased 0.7% last month, while stocks at retailers rose 0.5%.
The Atlanta Fed is forecasting GDP rising at a 1.3% rate in the second quarter.
""A recession is not in our baseline, but we note the dangers from the recession bias leading to self-fulfilling prophecies,"" said Lydia Boussour, a senior U.S. economist at Oxford Economics in New York. 

The economy is seen supported by a strong labor market, which is boasting the lowest unemployment rate in nearly 50 years. In a separate report on Thursday, the Labor Department said initial claims for state unemployment benefits rose 3,000 to a seasonally adjusted 215,000 for the week ended May 25.

The NAR's pending home sales index dropped to a reading of 104.3, down 1.5% from the prior month. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast pending home sales would rise 0.9% last month.
March's index was revised slightly higher to 105.9, the highest reading since July 2018.

Pending home contracts are seen as a forward-looking indicator of the health of the housing market because they become sales one to two months later.Compared to one year ago, pending home sales were down 2.0%, marking the 16th straight month of annual decreases.

1205,By Reuters,"<span>May 30, 2019 09:15AM ET</span>","Brazil's GDP shrinks, economy flirts with another recession","By Jamie McGeever
BRASILIA (Reuters) - Brazil's economy shrank in the first quarter for the first time since 2016, data showed on Thursday, underscoring a deepening malaise in Latin America's largest economy and pushing it closer to a double-dip recession.
The contraction piled pressure on President Jair Bolsonaro, who was swept into office in January in part on his market-friendly pledges to boost growth and lift the gloom hanging over the economy since a brutal 2015-16 recession.
Brazil's gross domestic product (GDP) shrank 0.2% from the prior quarter, statistics agency IBGE said, in line with the median estimate in a Reuters poll. The economy grew 0.5% from a year earlier, in line with economists' forecasts.
Leading indicators from April and May, such as consumer confidence, bank lending and export data, suggest the economy is still in a funk, raising the risk of another recession.
""The signs so far in the second quarter are that the economy is not recovering,"" said Isabela Guarino, chief economist at XP Asset Management in Sao Paulo, who forecast growth of just 0.1% in the April-June quarter.
""But there is a very real risk of contraction, which would take the country into a technical recession. It's not our base case, but it's a rising risk,"" she said.
The government, central bank and private sector economists have all warned that the economy's weakness in recent months is likely to color its performance for the rest of the year. 
The central bank's weekly survey of around 100 financial institutions showed the average estimate for 2019 GDP growth has fallen for 13 consecutive weeks and now stands at just 1.2%. It was 2.5% at the start of the year. 
Fixed investment fell 1.7% in the first quarter, industrial and agricultural output fell 0.7% and 0.5%, respectively, while a 1.9% slump in exports and 0.5% rise in imports meant net trade was a drag on growth, IBGE figures showed.
On the other hand, services activity grew 0.2%, household spending rose 0.3% and government expenditure increased 0.4%.

""The economy is stagnating, but the bias is downward. Growth will be near zero this year,"" said Jose Francisco Goncalves, chief economist at Banco Fator in Sao Paulo.

1206,By Reuters,"<span>May 30, 2019 08:40AM ET</span>",U.S. weekly jobless claims increase slightly,"WASHINGTON, May 30 (Reuters) - The number of Americans filing applications for unemployment benefits increased moderately last week, suggesting the labor market remains on solid footing even as the economy is slowing.
Initial claims for state unemployment benefits rose 3,000 to a seasonally adjusted 215,000 for the week ended May 25, the Labor Department said on Thursday. Data for the prior week was revised to show 1,000 more applications received than previously reported.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast claims rising to 215,000 in the latest week. The Labor Department said claims for California, Delaware, Kansas, Virginia and Puerto Rico were estimated last week because of Monday's Memorial Day holiday.
The four-week moving average of initial claims, considered a better measure of labor market trends as it irons out week-to-week volatility, fell 3,750 to 216,750 last week.
Continuing strength in labor market conditions is seen supporting growth amid signs that economic activity is slowing after a temporary boost from volatile exports and inventory accumulation in the first quarter. Industrial production, durable goods orders, retail and homes sales all fell in April.
The Atlanta Federal Reserve is forecasting gross domestic product rising at a 1.3% pace in the second quarter. The economy grew at a 3.1% annualized rate in the January-March quarter.
Thursday's claims report also showed the number of people receiving benefits after an initial week of aid fell 26,000 to 1.66 million for the week ended May 18. The four-week moving average of the so-called continuing claims declined 3,500 to 1.67 million.

The continuing claims data covered the period that households were surveyed for May's unemployment rate. The four-week average of continuing claims fell 15,000 between the April and May household survey periods suggesting little change in the unemployment rate. 
The jobless rate fell two-tenths of a percentage point to 3.6% in April, the lowest level in nearly 50 years.
 
"
1207,By Bloomberg,"<span>May 30, 2019 08:40AM ET</span>",U.S. First-Quarter Growth Revised Down to 3.1% Pace From 3.2%,"(Bloomberg) -- U.S. economic growth last quarter was revised down by less than expected amid stronger consumption and exports than initially reported, suggesting the expansion was on relatively firm footing before President Donald Trump’s escalation of the trade war with China.
Inflation-adjusted gross domestic product increased at a 3.1% annualized rate in the January-March period, compared with an initially reported 3.2% and analyst estimates for a revision to 3%, Commerce Department data showed Thursday. Consumer spending, which accounts for the majority of the economy, grew 1.3%, topping projections for an unrevised 1.2% though still the slowest in a year.
The figures may alleviate some investor concern that the economy is losing momentum -- highlighted by an inversion in part of the Treasury yield curve -- and potentially help Trump as he starts his reelection campaign. At the same time, recent reports suggesting a dimmer outlook this quarter, along with the intensifying tariff conflict, are casting a shadow over an expansion poised to become the nation’s longest on record in July.
Excluding the trade and inventories components that gave a boost to GDP, final sales to domestic purchasers increased at a 1.5% pace -- the slowest since 2015, though revised from 1.4%. This measure, often looked to by economists as a gauge of underlying demand, suggests growth in the quarter was weaker than the headline number indicates.
In addition, the report gave the first read on business earnings for the period, suggesting corporate America is facing headwinds from the trade war and the effects of Republican tax cuts may be waning. Pretax corporate profits fell 2.8% from the prior quarter, the biggest drop since 2015, and were up 3.1% from a year earlier, the least since 2017.
Subdued Inflation
Also, inflation was even more subdued than initially reported, which could bolster some calls for a Federal Reserve interest- rate cut. The personal consumption expenditures price index, excluding food and energy, rose at a 1% pace -- the slowest in three years and revised from 1.3%. The Fed targets 2% annual gains for the broader PCE price index.
The combined 1.56 percentage-point boost from inventories and trade was only slightly below the originally-reported 1.68-point lift. This surge could ultimately weigh on growth in coming quarters, adding to the need for consumers to become the main growth driver again.
Trade added 0.96 percentage point to GDP growth, revised down from 1.03 point, as the upward revision to imports outstripped higher exports. The inventory contribution was revised to 0.6 point from 0.65 point, as retail and wholesale estimates were lowered and manufacturing was higher, according to the report.
The report showed upward revisions to investment in structures, along with downward revisions to private equipment investment, particularly industrial gear, as well as software. The higher consumer spending reflected data on motor vehicle registrations, the Commerce Department said.
A separate report from the Labor Department Thursday showed filings for unemployment benefits stayed relatively low, as the job market remains a bright spot. Jobless claims rose 3,000 to 215,000 in the week ended May 25, close to the median estimate of economists for 214,000.

Only 50% of European business leaders said they were confident about the ability of their firms to grow and prosper, compared with 70% in November 2018, the survey by insurer CNA Hardy found.
Only 36% of British business leaders were confident, down slightly from 39% in the previous survey. 
""Hard Brexit is becoming more of a reality,"" for continental European as well as British business leaders, Dave Brosnan, CEO of CNA Hardy, told Reuters.
Weaker economic conditions and a rise in populism in Europe are also dampening business confidence, he added.
Meanwhile, confidence among North American business leaders fell to 59% from 64% previously, a drop Brosnan said was linked to uncertainty over upcoming elections in Canada and the United States. 
In the Asia-Pacific region, however, 65% of business leaders were confident, up from 53% in the last survey, despite the ongoing trade war between the United States and China.
Brosnan said that was due to the region's strong natural resources, agriculture and ""people resources"", which are helping to insulate it from the trade spat.

The survey of 1,500 business leaders of multinational firms with operations in Europe was carried out in February and March 2019.

The Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) said car production fell 44.5% year-on-year to 70,971 units in April, the sharpest fall since exactly 10 years ago, when Britain was mired in recession.
Car factories shut down last month to sidestep the risk of supply chain disruption from a potentially chaotic ""no-deal"" Brexit on March 29, the original date for Britain's departure from the European Union.
While this was pushed back to Oct. 31, the postponement came too late for carmakers to change plans, prompting a ""dismal"" collapse in output, the SMMT said.
Global trade tensions exacerbated the decline.
""Today's figures are evidence of the vast cost and upheaval Brexit uncertainty has already wrought on UK automotive manufacturing businesses and workers,"" SMMT Chief Executive Mike Hawes said.
""Prolonged instability has done untold damage, with the fear of 'no deal' holding back progress, causing investment to stall, jobs to be lost and undermining our global reputation.""
Official data show business investment in Britain fell in every quarter of 2018 and grew only weakly early this year, leaving Britain's economy reliant on consumer spending to drive growth.
Earlier this month Bank of England Governor Mark Carney said business investment was likely to continue to be weak, but that there should be an improvement - and reduced reliance on consumers - if Brexit took place smoothly.

The manufacture of motor vehicles accounts for about 9 percent of overall manufacturing output in Britain, the world's fifth largest economy.

1210,By Reuters,"<span>May 29, 2019 02:35PM ET</span>",Trade worries seen pushing U.S. mortgage activity to one-month low,"(Reuters) - The number of U.S. borrowers seeking a home loan fell to a one-month low amid concerns about the growing trade tension between China and the United States and its impact on the economy, the Mortgage Bankers Association said on Wednesday.
Those worries have put downward pressure on home borrowing costs, which were not enough to rekindle interest for potential home buyers and current homeowners to shop for loans, the group said.
The Washington-based group's seasonally adjusted measure on mortgage applications for home purchase and refinancing declined by 3.3% to 411.5 in the week ended May 24. This was the lowest level since the week of April 26.
""Concerns over European economic growth and ongoing uncertainty about a trade war with China were some of the main factors that kept mortgage rates low last week,"" Joel Kan, MBA's associate vice president of economic and industry forecasting, said in a statement.
Interest rates on 30-year ""conforming"" mortgages, whose loan balance is $484,350 or less, averaged 4.33%, unchanged from the week before.
Borrowing costs for other fixed-rate loans MBA tracks fell by between 1 basis point to 6 basis points last week, while average interest rates on five-year adjustable-rate mortgages increased to 3.74% from 3.57% the previous week.
The drop in interest rates on fixed-rate mortgages was in step with bond yields which have declined on safe-haven demand tied to worries about weakening economic growth due partly on the trade spat between Beijing and Washington.
""It is possible that the trade dispute is causing potential homeowners to hold off on buying, with the fear that further escalation – or the lack of resolution – may have adverse impacts on the economy and housing market,” Kan said.
MBA's seasonally adjusted measure on mortgage activity to buy a home fell for a third straight week to 259.4, which was down 1.4% from the week before.
The group's gauge on mortgage refinancing on a seasonally adjusted basis declined by 6% to 1,255.4 last week, reversing the prior week's 8% increase.

1212,By Reuters,"<span>May 29, 2019 11:28AM ET</span>","Bank of Canada holds rates, says economic slowdown likely temporary","By Kelsey Johnson and Steve Scherer
OTTAWA (Reuters) - The Bank of Canada held interest rates steady as expected on Wednesday, saying there was evidence that the slowdown was temporary but signaling it would remain on the sidelines as it monitors economic developments. 
The central bank left its overnight rate at 1.75% and repeated language that current rates remain ""appropriate"". Inflation is expected to remain around the bank's 2% target in coming months, it said.
On April 24, the bank cut its growth forecast for the first half of 2019 to 1.2% from 1.7% and removed wording about the need for future hikes. 
""Recent data have reinforced Governing Council's view that the slowdown in late 2018 and early 2019 was temporary, although global trade risks have increased,"" the central bank said in a statement. 
The Canadian dollar fell to a five-month low of 1.3547 against the greenback before paring its decline.
""It certainly seems like the Bank of Canada is happy to remain on the sidelines for now, and wait to see if the economy does rebound as it expects,"" said Royce Mendes, a senior economist at CIBC Capital Markets
Earlier this month, Statistics Canada said the economy added a record 106,500 jobs in April. 
""Continued strong job growth suggests that businesses see the weakness in the past two quarters as temporary,"" the statement said.
The Bank of Canada raised rates five times between July 2017 and October 2018. It has since stayed on the sidelines citing the economic challenges posed by high levels of household debt, low oil prices and trade tensions between the United States and China.
Though the bank was more optimistic on growth, it cited increasing global trade risks.
""The recent escalation of trade conflicts is heightening uncertainty about economic prospects,"" the central bank said. ""Trade restrictions introduced by China are having direct effects on Canadian exports."" 
Since March, Chinese importers have stopped buying Canadian canola seed exports. 
Canadian relations with China have chilled since Canada detained a senior Chinese telecommunications executive in December at the request of the United States. The United States is in the middle of difficult trade negotiations with the Asian powerhouse. 
""The Bank seems increasingly worried about trade policies, in particular, the U.S.-China trade talks breaking down,"" said Sal Guatieri, a senior economist at BMO Markets.
However, the bank said the easing of trade tensions with the United States should have a positive effect. 
The United States this month lifted tariffs on Canadian steel and aluminum products, clearing the way for ratification of a new North American trade agreement.
Both of these developments will have ""positive implications for Canadian exports and investment,"" the bank said. 

Furthermore, the Bank of Canada said the oil sector ""is beginning to recover as production increases and prices remain above recent lows,"" while the country's housing market appears more stable nationally ""albeit with continued weakness in some regions"".

1213,By Bloomberg,"<span>May 29, 2019 10:20AM ET</span>",Bank of Canada Optimistic About Rebound Even as It Stays Neutral,"(Bloomberg) -- The Bank of Canada left interest rates unchanged for a fifth straight decision and continued to signal it sees no need to move borrowing costs anytime soon, even as it expressed growing confidence the economy is rebounding.
At a rate decision Wednesday, policy makers in Ottawa said recent data have “reinforced” their view a recent slowdown at the end of 2018 and early 2019 was temporary. However, they said mounting global trade risks are “heightening uncertainty” around the outlook.
“In this context, the degree of accommodation being provided by the current policy interest rate remains appropriate,” the central bank said in its statement, reiterating it will remain data dependent and closely monitor developments in household spending, oil markets and global trade.
No mention was made of any need for rate changes -- either up or down.
The recent policy pause -- after five rate increases since 2017 -- is a reflection of an economy only just emerging from a serious slowdown, and which remains too fragile to cope with higher rates. Even without global trade uncertainties, the recent weakness has opened up enough slack to warrant the need for stimulative rates, at least for now.
The Bank of Canada’s 1.75% benchmark rate remains below what it believes would be the “neutral rate” if no headwinds were present in the economy.
No Cuts
Still, the central bank has certainly shown no inclination to consider looser policy, though investors are betting on a cut over the next 12 months.
Governor Stephen Poloz has been reluctant to fully discard the idea that his next step is likely higher, which makes him one of the more hawkish central bankers globally. That position will only be reinforced by the positive tone of Wednesday’s statement.
Recent Canadian economic data are in line with the central bank’s projections last month, while evidence is “accumulating” that growth has begun to pick up in the second quarter, the statement said. It cited indicators that “point to” stabilization in housing, recovering production in the oil sector, stronger consumer spending and exports and a firming of business investment, along with employment gains.
“Continued strong job growth suggests that businesses see the weakness in the past two quarters as temporary,” policy makers said.
Inflation, meanwhile, has also been in line with expectations, and is expected to remain around the central bank’s 2% target, the Bank of Canada said, adding the lifting of U.S. metals tariffs and better prospects the new North American trade pact will be ratified have “positive implications for Canadian exports and investments.” The global economy is also evolving as expected, it said.
Negatives
The negatives were largely confined to three things: worries about the recent escalation of trade conflicts between China and the U.S., the impact of Chinese restrictions on Canadian canola exports and a reference to a sharp rise in inventories in the first quarter that may damp production in coming months.
Most analysts predict the Bank of Canada will resume raising interest rates again sometime next year -- in line with the central bank’s forecasts the economy will return to growth of around 2 percent in 2020, after it stalled at the end of last year and the beginning of 2019.
Investors are more pessimistic than analysts, betting on cuts rather than hikes. They see about an 80% chance of one rate cut over the next 12 months. In the U.S., conviction on lower rates is even stronger, with at least two rate cuts priced in over that period, fueled by escalating trade tensions between the U.S. and China, faltering global growth and soft inflation readings in the U.S."
1214,By Reuters,"<span>May 29, 2019 04:35AM ET</span>",German labor market feels effect of slowing growth,"By Michael Nienaber
BERLIN (Reuters) - German unemployment rose unexpectedly for the first time in nearly two years in May, data showed on Wednesday, in a sign that a growth slowdown in Europe's largest economy is spilling over into the labor market.
The number of people out of work rose by 60,000 to 2.279 million in seasonally adjusted terms, according to data from the Federal Labour Office. That compared with a Reuters consensus forecast for a fall of 8,000.
Ominously, Germany's solid labor market has been the backbone of a domestically driven upswing in recent years. Several months of rising unemployment could weaken household spending and knock out one of the most important growth drivers.
Though the unexpected rise was mainly due to the effect of an audit of the status of some unemployment benefit recipients, but the slowing economy also played a role, Labour Office head Detlef Scheele said.
""On the labor market, we can see first spill-over effects of the recently somewhat weaker economic development,"" Scheele said. ""The demand of companies for new employees is weakening sharply while remaining on a high level.""
The seasonally adjusted jobless rate rose to 5.0%, the data showed. In unadjusted terms, unemployment increased by 7,000 to 2.236 million in May.

Germany's export-reliant industrial sector is already facing headwinds from trade disputes and business uncertainty linked to Britain's chaotic departure from the European Union.

The INSEE statistics agency said the euro zone's second-biggest economy grew 0.3% in the three months to end March, down from a revised 0.4% in the fourth quarter.
Households disposable income rose 0.9% after President Emmanuel Macron's government presented a package of measures in December worth more than 10 billion euros ($11.2 billion) aimed at increasing the poorest workers and pensioners' incomes.
Consumer spending, traditionally the motor of French growth, grew only 0.4% in the first quarter despite the efforts to boost incomes, up marginally from 0.3% in the previous quarter.
Instead of rushing to spend the extra cash, the GDP report suggests that households are instead setting it aside as the savings rate rose to 15.3% from 14.9% at the end of last year.
Macron rolled out the package in concessions to protestors who led a series of violent street demonstrations in Paris that saw some of the worst clashes with police and vandalism in decades.

1216,By Bloomberg,"<span>May 28, 2019 10:50PM ET</span>","China’s Economy Weakened in May, Early Data Show","(Bloomberg) -- China’s economic outlook deteriorated this month, after April’s weaker-than-expected performance combined with the renewed trade dispute to hit confidence.
That’s according to a Bloomberg Economics gauge aggregating the earliest available indicators of business conditions and market sentiment. Copper prices dropped as hopes faded for a quick resolution to the trade dispute, and South Korean exports fell for a fifth month. Sentiment among stock investors and small businesses also declined.
The official Purchasing Managers’ Index, which shows sentiment in industrial companies, is due for release on May 31. With the reading forecast to have fallen back below the 50 mark that signals contraction, policy makers may soon face greater pressure to roll out further stimulus measures to support the economy.
“The economy will see a broad weakening in May” with the big external shock of trade war escalation, said Wan Qian, an economist at Bloomberg Economics in Hong Kong. Exports and market sentiment have both been influenced by the rise in tariffs and containment of technology companies, she said, referring to moves to block Huawei Technologies Co. and other Chinese hi-tech companies from purchasing U.S. products or doing business there.
Chinese policy makers have this week emphasized that the nation can withstand the impact of the worsening trade war. However, small businesses already began to grow more cautious as soon as the higher tariffs were announced in early May, according to an index released by  Standard Chartered  (LON:STAN) Plc.
“The negative impact of the escalation of the U.S.-China trade conflict started to be felt soon after tariffs were raised,” Beijing-based Standard Chartered economist Shen Lan wrote in a note. “Exporters expect the tariff increase to materially affect their sales and production plans, as well as squeeze their profit margins.”
Conditions reported by sales managers also pointed to worrying signs in jobs and profitability, although the headline index edged up, according to London-based World Economics Ltd.

1218,By Reuters,"<span>May 28, 2019 07:10PM ET</span>","UK services firms toil in May, investment weak: CBI survey","By Andy Bruce
LONDON (Reuters) - The services companies that make up the bulk of Britain's economy struggled in the three months to May and remain loathe to invest because of uncertainty around Brexit, a business survey showed on Wednesday.
Business and professional services companies reported the biggest fall in the volume of work since August 2012 and were ""extremely negative"" about the outlook for the year ahead, the Confederation of British Industry (CBI) said.
They expected to cut investment in land and businesses at the fastest pace since 2010, the survey showed.
The CBI said the volume of work also declined in the consumer services industry, albeit at a slower pace than in the business and professional sector.
Business investment fell throughout 2018 as companies waited for clarity on the terms of Brexit, and grew only slightly early this year. Consumer spending, meanwhile, has been the main driver of economic growth.
The CBI's survey of 129 companies was conducted between April 29 and May 14 -- after the EU allowed Britain to delay Brexit until late October to give lawmakers in London more time to approve a deal.
""Brexit paralysis continues to take a toll on the UK's services firms. Profits, optimism and investment spending are falling sharply amidst a torrid operating environment,"" CBI economist Anna Leach said.
On the upside, the CBI said services companies remained keen to hire staff -- a finding broadly mirrored by a survey published on Wednesday by the Recruitment and Employment Confederation.
""The jobs market is robust, but more businesses remain negative about the future than positive,"" REC chief executive Neil Carberry said.
Another survey from the British Retail Consortium showed shop prices rose 0.8% year-on-year in May, up from 0.4% in April and marking the second-highest rate in six years.

""Rising costs associated with currency depreciation, stockpiling, rising minimum wage and the Apprenticeship Levy, have all put upwards pressure on prices for a while, and it now appears that retailers cannot absorb them any longer,"" BRC chief executive Helen Dickinson said.

1219,By Reuters,"<span>May 28, 2019 06:39PM ET</span>",Strong labor market boosts U.S. consumer confidence,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Consumer confidence jumped in May as households grew more upbeat about the labor market, suggesting the economy remained on solid ground despite signs that activity was slowing after being temporarily boosted by exports and a build-up of inventories.
The surge in confidence reported by the Conference Board on Tuesday came despite an escalation in tensions in the 10-month trade war between the United States and China, which sparked a sharp sell-off on Wall Street. It mirrors strength exhibited by another sentiment surveys in the middle of this month.
Economists said the strong readings likely did not fully capture the impact of the trade standoff between Washington and Beijing. The cut off date for the Conference Board survey was on May 16. The U.S. raised existing tariffs on $200 billion in Chinese goods to 25% from 10% on May 10, prompting Beijing to retaliate with its own levies on American imports.
""So there was at least some time for the recent escalation in the trade spat with China to factor in,"" said Tim Quinlan, a senior economist at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) Securities in Charlotte, North Carolina. ""But at this stage, consumers are nonplussed.""
The Conference Board said its index of consumer attitudes increased 4.9 points to a reading of 134.1 this month, climbing up to levels seen last November when the index was hovering near 18-year highs. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the index rising to 130.0 this month. 
The survey's expectations index, based on consumers' short-term outlook for income, business and labor market conditions, increased to a reading of 106.6 this month from 102.7 in April. 
The Conference Board survey's so-called labor market differential, derived from data on respondents' views on whether jobs are plentiful or hard to get, increased to 36.3% from 33.2% in April. That measure closely correlates to the unemployment rate in the Labor Department's employment report.
The labor market is tight, with the unemployment rate at 3.6 percent, a level last seen almost 50 years ago.
While the sentiment surveys have been upbeat, the so-called hard economic data have weakened in recent months. Industrial production, durable goods orders, retail and home sales fell in April, suggesting the economy lost considerable momentum early in the second quarter after getting a lift from exports and an accumulation of unsold goods in warehouses in the first quarter.
The Atlanta Federal Reserve is forecasting gross domestic product increasing at a 1.3% annualized rate in the second quarter. The economy grew at a 3.2% pace in the January-March quarter. Growth is mostly slowing as last year's massive stimulus from the Trump administration's tax cuts and spending increases fades.
The dollar was trading higher on Tuesday. U.S. Treasury prices rose, with the yield on the benchmark 10-year note dropping to its lowest level since October 2017. Stocks on Wall Street eked out modest gains.
HOUSE PRICES SLOWING
""As long as job growth is strong, that is the green light we need to keep consumers moving along,"" said Jennifer Lee, a senior economist at BMO Capital Markets in Toronto.
Consumers anticipated inflation would remain muted over the next 12 months. The survey's one-year inflation expectations fell to 4.4% in May from 4.6% in April. 
Inflation has been benign despite the tight labor market, prompting calls from President Donald Trump for the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates. The U.S. central bank recently suspended its three-year interest rate hiking campaign and last month showed little desire to alter its monetary policy stance.
Other data on Tuesday showed a further moderation in house price inflation, which could help support the struggling housing market. But a chronic shortage of lower-priced homes remains an obstacle amid strong demand that has been stoked by declining mortgage rates.
The S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller composite index of home prices in 20 metropolitan areas increased 2.7% in the 12 months to March after rising 3.0% the prior month. In another report the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) said its house price index rose a seasonally adjusted 4.9% in March from a year ago. That followed a 5.1% gain in February. 
The FHFA's index is calculated by using purchase prices of houses financed with mortgages sold to or guaranteed by mortgage finance companies Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.

""A variety of different measures of housing activity have been soft in recent months despite the recent decline in mortgage rates and if affordability issues are weighing on the housing market, house prices could continue to soften moving forward,"" said Daniel Silver, an economist at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) in New York.

1220,By Reuters,"<span>May 28, 2019 02:15PM ET</span>",Bahrain misses key fiscal adjustment goals with 2019-2020 budget,"By Davide Barbuscia
DUBAI (Reuters) - Bahrain does not expect to meet some of the key goals it set out last year as part of a fiscal adjustment program linked to a $10 billion bailout received from its Gulf allies, a final draft of its state budget for the next two years shows. 
Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates last year pledged $10 billion in financial aid for the small Gulf oil producer as it headed for a credit crunch after piling up debt to offset the impact on revenues of lower oil prices.
The aid, however, was linked to a series of reforms aimed at eliminating Bahrain's budget deficit by 2022.
Bahrain earlier this month revised upwards its budget deficit forecasts for the next two years, signaling it might take longer than expected to balance the budget.
The final budget draft, published on Monday, shows other items such as non-oil revenues and government expenditure are also expected to miss earlier estimates.
However, a finance ministry spokesman said in a statement sent to Reuters the deficit reduction program was ahead of schedule having fallen to 6.2% of GDP in 2018 compared with a projected 9.8%.
He said the Fiscal Balance Program estimates were ""expressed as ranges, not specific year-on-year targets"", and that the state budget projected deficit, non-oil revenue and expenditure that ""sit at the more ambitious end of the forecasted ranges"".
BUDGET SURPLUS 
The budget for 2019 and 2020 that was approved by parliament forecasts a primary budget surplus in 2020, the spokesman added. 
""They’re trying to make progress on the reforms but this is unlikely to reach the pace that was in the initial targets,"" said Monica Malik, chief economist at Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank. 
Based on GDP forecasts by the IMF, Bahrain's non-oil revenues – a measure of its success in diversifying the economy away from oil – will correspond to 5.4% and 5.7% of GDP in 2019 and 2020, respectively, according to the budget.
That is below expectations of 6.2% and 6.6% set out in the fiscal adjustment program last year.
The finance ministry spokesman said estimated non-oil revenues set out in the program were based against non-oil GDP, not overall GDP. He did not provide a figure for non-oil GDP projections.
Another important item of the program was a reduction in state spending. But according to the budget, expenditure is expected to account for 24% of GDP in 2019 and 23.1% of GDP in 2020 – short of targets of 22.6% and 21.6%.
Without the program, expenditure would have accounted for 25.5% and 25.2% of GDP in 2019 and 2020, Bahrain had said.

The planned reforms included the introduction of a 5% value-added tax, subsidy cuts and a voluntary retirement plan for state workers. The budget showed government subsidies will remain practically unchanged through 2019 and 2020.

Banks approved 42,989 mortgages in April, up from 40,564 in March and 11.5% higher than a year ago, marking the biggest annual increase since March 2016, according to seasonally-adjusted figures from industry body UK Finance.
Net mortgage lending rose by 1.795 billion pounds last month, a smaller increase than March's 2.440 billion pound rise which was the largest in 15 months.
Britain's housing market slowed sharply in the run-up to the original March Brexit deadline but consumer spending has remained solid, driving economic growth just as businesses have cut investment spending due to Brexit uncertainty.
UK Finance said consumer lending increased 3.8% year-on-year in April, slowing a little from March's growth rate of 4.1% which was the highest in nine months.

Lending figures from the Bank of England, which cover a broader section of Britain's finance industry, are due on Friday.

Corporate lending growth picked up to 3.9% in April from 3.6% in March, a big pick-up, even if it remains below its post-crisis peak of 4.3% hit in September, the ECB said.
Credit growth to households meanwhile accelerated to 3.4% in April from 3.3% in March, its highest since early 2009, the ECB data showed.
With economic growth slowing sharply on weak export demand for manufactured goods, the ECB has already put plans to normalize policy on hold, announcing instead further stimulus measures to aid bank lending and prop up a still limping economy.
Fearing that banks may shut the flow of credit to firms amid a slowdown, it plans to give lenders a new line of ultra cheap loans with the ultimate aim of getting cash to firms so they continue to invest.

1225,By Reuters,"<span>May 28, 2019 02:10AM ET</span>",German consumer morale cools slightly to hit two-year low: GfK,"BERLIN (Reuters) - German consumer morale cooled slightly heading into June to hit its lowest level in more than two years as shoppers became less willing to buy and more downbeat about the growth outlook of Europe's largest economy, a survey showed on Tuesday.
The GfK consumer sentiment indicator, based on a survey of around 2,000 Germans, fell to 10.1 points from a downwardly revised 10.2 in the previous month.
This was the lowest reading since May 2017 and undershot a forecast of 10.4 points.
The data suggests that household spending could weaken at the end of the second quarter after Ifo's business sentiment survey showed that a recession in manufacturing is spilling over to parts of the services sector.
Domestic demand has become a key pillar of economic support in Germany, providing a buffer against external shocks such as U.S. President Donald Trump's 'America First' trade policies and Britain's chaotic departure from the European Union.
In the first three months of 2019, consumers were the main driver of a growth rebound of 0.4% quarter-on-quarter as shoppers are reveling in record-high employment, inflation-busting pay hike and low borrowing costs.
GfK said the gap between consumers' income expectations and their view on the economy as a whole continued to widen.
The sub-index for income expectations rose to 57.7 points while the indicator measuring expectations for the wider economy fell to 1.7, the survey showed.
The government last month slashed its 2019 growth forecast to 0.5% which would mark a sharp slowdown following calendar-adjusted growth rates of 2.5% in 2017 and 1.5% in 2018. 
Despite the drop in GfK's headline figure, researchers are still expecting consumer spending to increase by roughly 1.5% this year. ""Domestic demand will be an important pillar of economic growth,"" GfK researcher Rolf Bürkl said.

NOTE - The consumer climate indicator forecasts the development of real private consumption in the following month. An indicator reading above zero signals year-on-year growth in private consumption. A value below zero indicates a drop in comparison with the same period a year ago. According to GfK, a one-point change in the indicator corresponds to a year-on-year change of 0.1 percent in private consumption. The ""willingness to buy"" indicator represents the balance between positive and negative responses to the question: ""Do you think now is a good time to buy major items?"" The income expectations sub-index reflects expectations about the development of household finances in the coming 12 months. The additional business cycle expectations index reflects the assessment of those questioned of the general economic situation in the next 12 months.

1226,By Reuters,"<span>May 27, 2019 12:39AM ET</span>","China's industrial profits shrink in April, add to pressure on economy","BEIJING (Reuters) - Profits for China's industrial firms shrank in April as slowing manufacturing activity halted the previous month's surge, putting more pressure on policymakers to step up support for an economy hit by a bitter trade war with the United States. 
Earnings at China's key manufacturing sector have been declining since November last year, with the exception of March, as both domestic and global demand slackened.
Industrial profits dropped 3.7% year-on-year to 515.4 billion yuan ($74.80 billion) in April, partly due to a high base of comparison in the previous year, according to data published by the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) on Monday. That compared with a 13.9% surge in March, which was the biggest gain in eight months. 
Zhu Hong of the statistics bureau said in a statement the March results benefited from companies buying industrial goods ahead of a value added tax (VAT) cut. The firms then scaled back on purchases in April in a blow to profits.
For the first four months, industrial firms notched up profits of 1.81 trillion yuan, down 3.4% from a year earlier, compared with a 3.3% drop in the first quarter this year.
The contraction in profits was in line with the weak growth in industrial output in the January-April period. Weak fixed-asset investment has also stoked worries about demand as have new factory orders, which remained sluggish in April, while exports have fallen on a sharp drop in shipments to the United States.
China's trade frictions with the United States escalated suddenly this month, reversing the apparent progress in dialogue seen earlier this year, as U.S. President Donald Trump raised tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods and threatened to slap tariffs of up to 25% on another $300 billion Chinese imports. 
The U.S. has also put the Chinese telecom equipment giant Huawei Technologies Co Ltd to a blacklist, effectively banning the company to do business with U.S. firms.
Profits in telecommunications and electronic equipment manufacturing, which are more vulnerable to U.S. tariffs than other product classes, declined 15.3% in Jan-April, worsening from a 7.0% drop in the first three months. 
Iris Pang, Greater China Economist at ING, said the broadening rift between China and the United States over Huawei along with increasing concerns in other countries about the security of Huawei's products will hit China's exports as well as earnings of its telecom sector. 
""As the technology war continues, China's industrial profits starting from May will likely deteriorate faster (than January-April),"" she said, adding that a 5.0% year-on-year contraction in January-May profits is possible as a downturn in earnings for the telecom industry deepens.
In response to a slowing economy and higher U.S. import tariffs on Chinese goods, Beijing has stepped up support for cash-strapped manufacturing firms. China has pledged billions of dollars in additional tax cuts and infrastructure spending, while its central bank has also announced a cut in three phases in the reserve requirement ratio for regional banks to reduce small companies' financing costs.
Upstream sectors like oil extraction still saw the lion's share of profit gains with faster growth in January-April. The decline in profits earned by steel mills and chemical plants moderated from the first three months. 
Liabilities of industrial firms rose 5.5% year-on-year as of end-April, the NBS said. 
The data includes companies with annual revenues of more than 20 million yuan from their main operations.

1228,By Reuters,"<span>May 26, 2019 11:05AM ET</span>","Australia property sees ray of hope on looser mortgage rules, rate cut bets","By Swati Pandey
SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia’s crumbling housing market looks set to stabilize over coming months as hopes of interest rate cuts and loosening of mortgage rules have boosted buyer inquiries, property and mortgage brokers say.
Home prices across Australia have fallen rapidly since late-2017, heightening worries among policymakers that a prolonged decline would deal a severe blow to the country's already slowing economy.
While industry watchers say a return to boom times is unlikely anytime soon, they point to signs suggesting a bottoming-out for the sector is imminent.
Economists, including those at AMP and Citibank, last week re-jigged their forecasts to pencil in a less steeper decline in home prices than previously predicted. Several property and mortgage brokers who spoke to Reuters on Friday also said they have seen a noticeable jump in customer inquiries, including from those buying a home for investment. 
""The sun is shining all over again now,"" said mortgage broker Tony Bice at Sydney-based Finance Made Easy.
Bice cited the unexpected re-election of the country's pro-business coalition government a little over a week ago and predictions of an Australia rate cut as soon as next month for the improvement in sentiment.
The Australian  Prudential  (LON:PRU) Regulation Authority’s (APRA) proposal to ease stress test on mortgages was the ""most interesting"" policy change, Bice said. Analysts expect the regulator’s move would boost customers' borrowing capacity.
""My inquiries since the last week has risen dramatically. I have written 11 loans in the last 4 days. In the past, you'd be lucky to write 11 loans in two weeks."" Bice told Reuters.
""A lot of my clients are holding off until June to see what the Reserve Bank does. If they drop the cash rate, I expect banks to follow suit. That will finally revive the market.""
With growth sputtering and inflation at a low ebb, Philip Lowe, the governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) last week gave the strongest signal yet that rates were about to move lower soon. And an overwhelming majority of economists are now predicting a cut in the cash rate to 1.25% from a record-low of 1.5% at the RBA's June 4 policy meeting.
UNDER THE HAMMER
Auction activity - a closely-watched measure of demand in Australia – over the weekend provided the first major test for the market following the policy changes. 
There were 1,933 capital city auctions on Saturday, double the amount from the previous week, and preliminary data showed a modest pick-up in demand. Clearance rates nudged above 60% for the two biggest cities of Sydney and Melbourne, compared to 50%-57% over the past year. 
The promise of lower rates and easy credit led economists to predict a less steeper drop in home prices. Citi now sees a peak-to-trough fall of 7.5% by June 2019 from 10% previously. AMP's Shane Oliver predicts a 12% top-to-bottom decline, from an earlier forecast of 15%.
Yet, few expect the boom days to return in a hurry.
""We see broadly flat house prices for 2020,"" Oliver said.
""Given still high house prices and poor affordability, still very high debt levels, tighter lending standards and rising unemployment a quick return to boom time conditions is most unlikely.""

1229,By Reuters,"<span>May 24, 2019 12:24PM ET</span>",Weak U.S. manufacturing underscores slowing economic growth,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - New orders for U.S.-made capital goods fell more than expected in April, further evidence that the economy was slowing after a growth spurt in the first quarter that was driven by exports and a buildup of inventories.
The report from the Commerce Department on Friday also showed orders for these goods were not as strong as previously thought in March and shipments were weak over the last two months, indicating that manufacturing was fast losing ground. 
The sector, which accounts for about 12% of the economy, is being squeezed by businesses placing fewer orders while working off stockpiles of unsold goods in warehouses. The inventory overhang is concentrated in the automotive sector, which is experiencing slow sales. Boeing's move to cut production of its troubled 737 MAX aircraft is also hurting manufacturing. 
The loss of momentum came even before a recent escalation in the trade war between the United States and China, leading economists to expect demand for capital goods to remain soft. 
The renewed trade tensions between Washington and Beijing have roiled the U.S. stock market. Data on Thursday showed a measure of factory activity hit an almost 10-year low in May.
""We can't sugar-coat today's news,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG in New York. ""Business investment is absolutely critical for the economy to move forward and investment is normally the swing factor that pumps up growth or pulls out the support from the economy.""
Orders for non-defense capital goods excluding aircraft, a closely watched proxy for business spending plans, dropped 0.9% last month as demand softened almost across the board. These so-called core capital goods orders rose 0.3% in March instead of 1.0% as previously reported. 
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast core capital goods orders falling 0.3% in April. 
Shipments of core capital goods were unchanged last month after a downwardly revised 0.6% decline in the prior month. Core capital goods shipments are used to calculate equipment spending in the government's gross domestic product measurement.
They were previously reported to have slipped 0.1% in March. Friday's report followed data this month showing weak retail sales, industrial production and home sales that prompted economists to slash GDP growth forecasts for the second quarter.
The economy grew at a 3.2% annualized rate in the first quarter, but the downward revision to March core capital goods shipments suggests business spending on equipment was even weaker than initially estimated during the quarter. That could result in the January-March GDP growth estimate being trimmed when the government publishes its revision next week. 
JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) on Friday cut its second-quarter growth estimate to a 1.0% rate from a 2.25% pace. Growth is mostly slowing as last year's massive stimulus from the Trump administration's tax cuts and spending increases fades.
The dollar slipped against a basket on currencies in thin pre-holiday trade. U.S. Treasury prices dipped, while stocks on Wall Street were trading higher. U.S. markets are closed on Monday for the Memorial Day holiday.
WEAK DATA
Economists said the raft of weak data, uncertainty over the trade war and sluggish global growth could force the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates. The U.S. central bank recently suspended its three-year interest rate hiking campaign and last month showed little desire to alter its monetary policy stance.
""We had previously expected the next move from the Fed would be a hike, albeit at the very end of our forecast horizon in late 2020,"" said Michael Feroli, an economist at JPMorgan in New York. ""We now see the risks of the next move as about evenly distributed between a hike and a cut."" 
Overall orders for durable goods, items ranging from toasters to aircraft that are meant to last three years or more, tumbled 2.1% in April after increasing 1.7% in the prior month. Orders for transportation equipment dropped 5.9% after rising 5.9% in March. Orders for motor vehicles and parts decreased 3.4% last month, the most since May 2018. 
Orders for non-defense aircraft plunged 25.1% after rising 7.8% in March. Boeing (NYSE:BA) reported receiving only four aircraft orders in April, down from 44 in March.
All of the orders last month were for the company's fastest-selling MAX 737 jetliner, which was grounded in March after two fatal plane crashes in five months. Boeing has also suspended deliveries of the aircraft.
Overall durable goods shipments fell 1.6% in April, the most since December 2015, with civilian aircraft shipments tumbling 16.0% last month. Motor vehicle shipments dropped 3.4%.
Durable goods inventories rose 0.4% last month, boosted by stocks of motor vehicle and aircraft. Order books at factories also slipped in April.

""That does not bode well for future production,"" said Joel Naroff, chief economist at Naroff Economic Advisors in Holland, Pennsylvania. ""It is becoming clear that whatever boom the tax cuts may have created, if they did much at all, is largely gone.""

President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador took office in December pledging to ramp up lackluster economic growth and to improve job creation.
The economy shrunk 0.2% compared with the October-December period, according to data from national statistics agency INEGI.
In annual terms, however, the economy expanded 1.2% compared with a year earlier, slightly lower than the 1.3% growth preliminary data published last month showed.
Lopez Obrador is targeting average annual economic growth of 4% during his six-year term.

The CBI distributive trades survey's retail sales balance slumped to -27 in May from +13 in April, below all forecasts in a Reuters poll and the lowest since October 2017. 
Adjusted for the time of year, sales were the weakest since March 2009, the CBI said.
""This month's survey paints a dismal picture of business conditions for retailers, who face a grim combination of tough trading conditions, Brexit uncertainty and a burdensome outdated business rates regime,"" CBI economist Anna Leach said.
A quarterly measure of retailers' investment intentions sank to its lowest since the survey began in 1983.
Official data earlier on Friday showed British shoppers paused for breath in April after months of strong buying, according to official data that showed continued underlying strength of consumer spending during the Brexit crisis.

1232,By Reuters,"<span>May 23, 2019 09:19PM ET</span>","Japan's key inflation gauge hits three-year high, offers little respite for BOJ","By Leika Kihara
TOKYO (Reuters) - An inflation gauge closely watched by the Bank of Japan accelerated at its fastest pace in almost three years as some retailers passed on rising costs to households, a positive sign for the central bank as it seeks to stoke consumer prices.
But the big part of the increase came from a spike in package tour fees ahead of Japan's 10-day holiday in May, casting doubt over the long-term sustainability of the improvement as escalating trade tensions weigh on the outlook for the export-reliant economy.
Core consumer prices rose 0.9% in April from a year earlier, matching a median market forecast and accelerating slightly from the previous month's 0.8% gain, government data showed on Friday.
The so-called core-core CPI, which strips away the effects of volatile food and energy costs and is the main policy focus for the BOJ, rose 0.6% in April, marking the biggest increase since June 2016, the data showed.
""Some companies appear to have translated rising costs to households. But wage growth is slow and consumers remain sensitive to price hikes, so it's doubtful whether such a move will broaden,"" said Takeshi Minami, chief economist at Norinchukin Research Institute.
""There's not much the BOJ could do to fire up inflation, so it will probably maintain its current ultra-easy policy for some time,"" he said. Minami predicted that core consumer inflation will slow to around zero-0.5% in the second half of the current fiscal year ending in March 2020.
Japanese companies typically revise prices of their goods and services at the April start of a new fiscal year. Prices rose for nearly 57 percent of items making up the core CPI index in April, up from 54 percent in March.
Product classes that saw prices rise include processed food, television sets and air conditioners. Package tour fees for overseas travel jumped 15 percent, helping push up core-core inflation, the data showed.
The BOJ hopes that continued strength in the economy will prompt companies to raise wages and give consumers more purchasing power, thereby helping accelerate inflation.
The outlook, however, is murky.
Japan's economy grew at an annualized 2.1% in the first quarter, defying forecasts for a contraction due to net contributions from exports.
But the expansion was overshadowed by weaknesses in capital expenditure and private consumption, casting doubt over the BOJ's argument that robust domestic demand will moderate the pain from slowing global demand.

Years of heavy money printing have failed to drive up inflation to the BOJ's elusive 2% target, forcing the central bank to sustain a massive stimulus despite the damage ultra-low interest rates is inflicting on financial institutions' profits.

1233,By Reuters,"<span>May 23, 2019 01:35PM ET</span>","U.S. home sales, manufacturing stumble; job market resilient","By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Sales of new U.S. single-family homes fell from near an 11-1/2-year high in April as prices rebounded and manufacturing activity hit its lowest level in almost a decade in May, suggesting a sharp slowdown in economic growth was underway. 
But other data on Thursday showed the number of Americans filing claims for unemployment benefits unexpectedly fell last week. Labor market strength should support the economy, which is cooling as last year's massive stimulus from the Trump administration's tax cuts and spending increases fades.
Some of the loss of momentum is the result of the escalating U.S.-China trade war, which economists say is undermining business confidence, as well as sluggish growth overseas. 
The mixed reports followed data last week showing a decline in retail sales and industrial production in April, which prompted economists to cut second-quarter growth estimates.
Slowing growth supports the Federal Reserve's recent decision to suspend its three-year campaign to hike interest rates, but could renew calls from President Donald Trump for the U.S. central bank to ease monetary policy.
""With the downside risks to the economy rising again, particularly with the escalation of the trade war, the case for Fed rate cuts is building,"" said Michael Pearce, a senior economist at Capital Economics in New York. 
The Commerce Department said new home sales dropped 6.9% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 673,000 units last month. That followed March's sales pace of 723,000 units, which was the highest level since October 2007. April's decline came after three straight monthly increases.
Sales dropped in the South, the Midwest and West, but surged in the Northeast. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast new home sales, which account for about 11.5% of housing market sales, would decrease 2.8% to a pace of 675,000 units in April. Sales increased 7.0% from a year ago. 
The median new house price increased 8.8% from a year ago to $342,200 in April, the highest level since December 2017. New house prices had mostly declined this year as builders put more affordable homes on the market. The drop in sales last month was concentrated in the market segment for homes below $300,000. 
Lower prices earlier this year and declining mortgage rates have helped the new housing market, which has not been severely constrained by an inventory shortage.
Tight supply has crippled sales of previously owned homes. A report on Tuesday showed existing home sales fell for a second straight month in April, weighed down by a chronic shortage of more affordable houses. 
The overall housing market hit a soft patch year and has contracted for five straight quarters. Another decline is likely in the second quarter as weak sales cut brokers' commissions.
U.S. Treasury prices were trading higher, while the dollar slipped against a basket of currencies. Major U.S. stock indexes were down more than 1.6%.
INVENTORY OVERHANG
Separately on Thursday, data firm IHS Markit said its U.S. manufacturing PMI declined to a reading of 50.6 in early May, marking the lowest level since September 2009, from 52.6 in April. A reading above 50 indicates growth in the manufacturing sector, which accounts for about 12% of the U.S. economy.
The survey showed broad weakness, with a measure of new orders received by factories dropping for the first time since August 2009. Hiring at factories also slowed early this month. The weakness in manufacturing largely reflects an inventory overhang, which has resulted in businesses placing fewer orders.
The softness in manufacturing appears to be spilling over to the services sector. IHS Markit's services PMI dropped to a 39-month low of 50.9 in early May from a reading of 53.0 in April.
""The slowdown spreading to the service sector from the manufacturing sector represents a downside risk to overall U.S. economic growth outlook,"" said Scott Anderson, chief economist at Bank of the West in San Francisco.
The Atlanta Federal Reserve is forecasting gross domestic product rising at a 1.2 percent annualized rate in the second quarter. The economy grew at a 3.2 percent pace in the January-March quarter after a temporary boost from volatile exports and inventory accumulation.
But with the labor market showing resilience, a recession is unlikely. In a third report on Thursday, the Labor Department said initial claims for state unemployment benefits slipped 1,000 to a seasonally adjusted 211,000 for the week ended May 18. It was the third straight weekly drop in claims.
Economists had forecast claims would rise to 215,000 in the latest week. The four-week moving average of initial claims, considered a better measure of labor market trends as it irons out week-to-week volatility, dropped 4,750 to 220,250 last week.
Last week's claims data covered the survey period for the nonfarm payrolls component of May's employment report. 

The four-week average of claims increased 18,750 between the April and May survey periods, suggesting some moderation in employment gains after payrolls surged by 263,000 jobs last month. The unemployment rate is 3.6%, near a 50-year low.

The Commerce Department said on Thursday new home sales dropped 6.9% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 673,000 units last month. March's sales pace was revised up to 723,000 units, the highest level since October 2007, from the previously reported 692,000 units. 
April's decline followed three straight monthly increases
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast new home sales, which account for about 10% of housing market sales, would decrease 2.8% to a pace of 675,000 units in April. 
Sales increased 7.0% from a year ago. The median new house price increased 8.8% from a year ago to $342,200 in April, the highest level since December 2017. 
New home sales had in recent months outperformed other housing market indicators, including building permits, which had dropped for five straight months in April. New home sales are drawn from permits. 
Economists attributed the recent strength in new home sales to declining mortgage rates. The new housing market has not been severely constrained by an inventory shortage, which has crippled sales of previously owned homes. 
A report on Tuesday showed existing home sales fell for a second straight month in April, weighed down by a chronic shortage of more affordable houses. 
The overall housing market hit a soft patch year and has contracted for five straight quarters. With the 30-year fixed mortgage rate dropping to around 4.07% from near an eight-year high of 4.94% in November, there is reason to be cautiously optimistic about the housing market.
New home sales in the South, which accounts for the bulk of transactions, declined 7.3% in April. Sales in the Midwest dropped 7.4% and those in the West tumbled 8.3%. But sales in the Northeast jumped 11.5%.
There were 332,000 new homes on the market last month, down 0.9% from March. While builders have stepped up construction of more affordable homes to meet strong demand in this market segment, land and labor shortages remain a challenge.
At April's sales pace it would take 5.9 months to clear the supply of houses on the market, up from 5.6 months in March.
About two-thirds of the houses sold last month were either under construction or yet to be built.

LONDON (Reuters) - A recovery in euro zone business activity was weaker than expected this month as a deepening contraction in the bloc's manufacturing industry is increasingly holding back services firms, a survey showed.
Last month, European Central Bank President Mario Draghi raised the prospect of more support for the struggling euro zone economy if its slowdown persists and Thursday's survey is likely to add to the concerns of policymakers.
IHS Markit's Flash Composite Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI), which is considered a good guide to economic health, only nudged up to 51.6 this month from a final April reading of 51.5, below the median expectation in a Reuters poll for 51.7.
""It's not only that current growth is brittle, as the surveys suggest. There are also downside risks to the outlook going forward,""  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) economists wrote to clients.
""We expect a dovish message at the central bank's June meeting.""
Earlier figures from Germany showed activity contracted for a fifth consecutive month in May, reflecting the toll unresolved trade disputes are having on Europe's largest economy.
German business morale deteriorated more than expected this month due mainly to a plunge in services sector confidence, an Ifo Institute survey showed on Thursday, also suggesting the economy is losing steam after solid growth at the start of 2019.
In France, the bloc's second-largest economy and the only other euro zone member to report a preliminary PMI, activity reached a six-month high but again trade disputes looked set to ensure growth would remain modest at best.
Traders took Europe's bourses lower as Brexit worries and the gloomy euro zone data played on their nerves.
SLOW GROWTH
IHS Markit said the data pointed to euro zone GDP growth of 0.2 percent this quarter, weaker than the 0.3 percent predicted in a Reuters poll last month.
In part due to factories completing old orders, the small increase in the key composite number was because an index measuring factory output, which feeds into the composite PMI, rose to 49.0 from 48.0.
But the flash manufacturing PMI spent its fourth month below the 50 mark separating growth from contraction, falling to 47.7 from 47.9 and disappointing expectations for a rise to 48.1.
Suggesting factory managers are growing increasingly pessimistic, they cut staffing levels for the first time since August 2014. The employment index dropped to 49.0 from 50.7.
The manufacturing PMI means the sector would have a 0.1-0.2 percentage point drag on an economy currently being supported by a struggling services industry, IHS Markit said.
""Concerns about manufacturing persist. The service sector continues to keep the economy afloat but at a slightly slower pace,"" said Bert Colijn at ING.
Growth in the bloc's dominant services sector slowed and its flash PMI fell to 52.5 from 52.8, confounding expectations in a Reuters poll which predicted a modest rise to 53.0.
New export business -- which also includes trade between member countries in the bloc -- among services firms was hurt by weaker global growth, trade tensions and Brexit. The sub-index fell to 48.1 from 48.7, one of the weakest readings since IHS Markit began collecting the data in late 2014.
With forward-looking indicators painting a disappointing picture -- overall new orders were flat, hiring slowed and backlogs of work were run down -- optimism was at its lowest since October 2014.
The composite future output index fell to 58.8 from April's 60.4.

The Ifo institute said on Thursday its closely-watched business climate index fell to 97.9 from a confirmed 99.2 in the previous month. The May reading compared with a consensus forecast for 99.1.
""The German economy is still lacking in momentum,"" Ifo President Clemens Fuest said, adding that a fall in managers' assessment of current business conditions was the main reason for the overall decline.
""In the services (sector), the business climate took a substantial hit,"" Fuest said, with Ifo's sub indicator of current sentiment in services posting its biggest monthly drop since April 2013.
In construction, the business climate improved for the third time in a row as already upbeat assessments of the current business situation improved further. ""The construction boom continues,"" Fuest said.
The survey followed gross domestic product data released earlier on Thursday that showed household spending rose at its strongest pace in eight years, driving a rebound of 0.4% quarter-on-quarter growth in the first quarter.
A pick-up in construction activity and surprisingly solid exports also helped Europe's largest economy to get back on track in the first three months of the year, the figures from the Federal Statistics Office showed.

IHS Markit's flash Purchasing Managers' Index for manufacturing fell to 44.3 from 44.4 in April, the fifth monthly reading in a row below the 50 mark that separates growth from contraction.
Markit economist Chris Williamson said the slight fall suggested that a recession in the sector, which is more vulnerable to trade frictions than services, was bottoming out.
Markit's flash services PMI fell to 55.0 from 55.7 in the previous month. The first fall after four straight rises indicates that the sector, which has been providing the economy with growth impetus as manufacturing cools, was showing signs of stress.
""It looks like the manufacturing downturn has passed its peak and is moving toward a period of stabilization but there is still a long way before we return to growth in the manufacturing economy,"" Williamson said.
Signs that the worst may be over for German manufacturers were evident in a slower contraction in output, new orders and export sales, the survey showed.
As a result, IHS Markit's flash composite Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI), measuring activity in the services and manufacturing sectors that together account for more than two-thirds of the economy, rebounded to 52.4, a three-month high.
After nine successive years of growth, the German economy is facing headwinds from trade disputes between major trading blocks that manufacturers rely on for export growth.
This has prompted the German government to slash its growth forecast for this year for the second time in three months. It has halved its 2019 growth estimate to 0.5 percent.
The economy grew by 0.4 percent in the first quarter after stagnating in the last three month of last year. Private spending and construction were the main drivers of growth.
Williamson said the PMI data pointed to a growth rate of 0.2 percent in the second quarter.
But the survey showed that both manufacturers and services providers were pessimistic about their business outlook.

""It is manufacturers who remain the most downbeat about the outlook amid lingering global trade tensions, though the survey highlights that fears of a slowdown may have started to spread to services, where confidence is now at its joint-lowest since 2014,"" said Phil Smith, principal economist at IHS Markit.

The Federal Statistics Office on Thursday confirmed preliminary gross domestic product growth of 0.4% quarter-on-quarter and 0.7% year-on-year seasonally adjusted.
Private consumption rose 1.2% on the quarter, which was the biggest increase since 2011, contributing 0.6 percentage points to the expansion.
Investments in construction increased 1.9% on the quarter which resulted in a contribution of 0.2 percentage points.
Despite increased trade tensions and business uncertainty, exports rose more strongly than imports in the first three months of the year which meant that net trade contributed 0.2 percentage points to the overall expansion.
The German economy avoided a technical recession by a whisker at the end of last year after a 0.2% contraction in the third quarter and a stagnation in the fourth.
The growth outlook for the German economy remains clouded, however, by rising trade barriers such as tariffs and business uncertainty linked to Britain's chaotic departure from the European Union.

The government has slashed its growth forecast to 0.5% this year.

The Markit/Nikkei Japan Manufacturing Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) fell to a seasonally adjusted 49.6 in May from a final 50.2 in the previous month.
The 50 mark separates contraction from expansion, and the latest result dashed expectations that Japan's crucial manufacturing sector had started to bottom out after shrinking in both February and March.
""The re-escalation of US-China trade frictions has heightened concern among Japanese goods producers,"" said Joe Hayes, economist at IHS Markit, which compiles the survey.
""Underlying growth weakness across much of Asia led to struggling exports, which fell at the sharpest rate in four months.""
The index for new export orders fell to a preliminary 47.1 from a final 47.8 in the previous month for the sixth consecutive month of contraction. Furthermore, companies' expectations for future output showed contraction for the first time since November 2012.
On Wednesday, official data showed Japan's exports shrank for the fifth consecutive month in April, with shipments to China falling again.
The gloomy readings for the world's third-biggest economy come as the dispute between the United States and China over trade and industrial policy has taken a nasty turn. The U.S. government this month sharply increased tariffs on Chinese goods and blacklisted Chinese telecom equipment company Huawei Technologies Co Ltd from buying U.S. technology.
Japan is also negotiating with the United States over trade. U.S. President Donald Trump has made it clear he is unhappy with Japan's trade surplus with the United States, much of it from auto exports, and wants a two-way deal to tackle it.

Japanese policymakers worry Trump could target Japanese autos with tariffs or quotas to lower the U.S. trade deficit.

Human resources data firm XpertHR said pay settlements had hovered around the same for the past four months, despite a small pick-up in inflation.
""Many of the current pay awards are lower than employees received in 2018, suggesting that there is little scope for higher rises this year,"" XpertHR analyst Sheila Attwood said.
After years of real-terms falls in pay, Britain's workers have had some of the biggest pay rises in a decade in recent months due to a tight labor market, though they are modest compared to pre-financial crisis rates of pay growth.
The risk of a disruptive Brexit has made some employers keener to hire new staff, who can be sacked if the economy sours, than to make long-term labor-saving investments.
Pay settlement data is typically lower than the headline measure of wage growth, as it does not include pay increases gained through changing jobs or promotions.
Official data last week showed average annual wage growth was 3.2% in the first quarter of 2019, down from a 10-year high of 3.5% earlier in the year.

The Bank of England forecast this month that pay growth would ease to 3% this year. Nonetheless, the central bank is concerned inflation will stick above its 2% target unless it raises interest rates slightly over the next couple of years.

Companies signed up for $8.8 billion in new loans, leases and lines of credit last month, up from $7.9 billion a year earlier.
Borrowings jumped 7% in April from the previous month.

""However, going into May with the looming trade war and rippling effects into various sectors in the economy, we expect that companies will defer asset acquisitions until stability returns,"" Petta said, adding the overall economic conditions and low interest rates should provide some cushion.
Washington-based ELFA, which reports economic activity for the $1 trillion equipment finance sector, said credit approvals totaled 76.8%, up from 75.3% in March.
ELFA's leasing and finance index measures the volume of commercial equipment financed in the United States. It is designed to complement the U.S. Commerce Department's durable goods orders report, which it typically precedes by a few days.

1243,By Reuters,"<span>May 22, 2019 06:14AM ET</span>",UK inflation rises less than Bank of England expected in April,"LONDON (Reuters) - British inflation rose last month by less than investors and the Bank of England had expected but still hit its highest level this year, pushed up by a rise in energy bills. 
Consumer prices rose at an annual rate of 2.1% in April after a 1.9% increase in March, the Office for National Statistics said on Wednesday. A Reuters poll of economists had pointed to a rate of 2.2%, the same as the BoE's forecast.
A recent weakening of inflation, combined with the lowest unemployment rate in 44 years and rising wages, has taken the edge off the uncertainty about Brexit for many households whose spending drives Britain's economy.
But starting in April Britain's energy regulator increased a price cap on energy providers by 10% and all big six suppliers raised their standard prices by the same amount -- something the BoE said would push inflation above target briefly.
Electricity and gas prices were the biggest driver of inflation last month, the ONS said. Computer game and package holiday prices helped to offset the impact of the higher bills.
Britain's modest rate of underlying inflation is helping the BoE to hold off on fresh interest rate hikes while it waits for the outcome of Britain's Brexit impasse.
The ONS figures also suggested less short-term pressure in the pipeline for consumer prices than expected.
Among manufacturers, the cost of raw materials - many of them imported - was 3.8% higher than in April 2018, much less than the 4.5% rise predicted by the Reuters poll.
Manufacturers increased the prices they charged by 2.1% last month compared with 2.2% in March, slightly less than forecast.

The ONS said house prices in March rose by an annual 1.4% across the United Kingdom as a whole compared with 1.0% in February, marking the first increase in house price inflation since September. Prices in London alone fell by 1.9 percent, a smaller drop than in February.

No clear winner emerged from the March 24 election, the first since a military coup in 2014, and the country is still waiting for a new government to be formed. 
Whichever party ends up taking the reins, it is likely to be leading a fragile coalition. 
Central bank policy makers alluded to potential hazards for the economy in minutes of their May 8 meeting that left the benchmark interest rate unchanged at 1.75%.
""The Thai economy was subject to heightened political uncertainties, which could have implications for economic growth, including a direct effect on government spending in the period ahead and an indirect effect on private consumption and investor confidence,"" minutes of the bank's monetary policy committee (MPC) meeting said.
Continuing on that theme, another entry said: ""Investors remained cautious to invest in Thai assets partly due to domestic political uncertainties.""
The minutes also referred to a ""rate adjustment"", marking a change in wording from the previous policy meeting, held on March 20, which had said ""a policy rate increase would be gradual"" and follow a data-dependent approach.
Data released on Tuesday showed the Thai economy grew 2.8% in the first quarter from a year ago - the weakest in over four years - and the central bank said earlier this month that this year's growth would be lower than its last forecast of 3.8 percent.
According to the minutes, the committee would need to wait for more clarity due to global economic and domestic political uncertainties. 
""Therefore, current accommodative policy would remain appropriate. Going forward, further policy rate adjustment would be gradual and follow a data-dependent approach,"" they said. 
The central bank raised its policy rate in December for the first time since 2011 to help curb financial risks, but has held the rate steady at the three subsequent meetings of its MPC. 
The MPC will next review monetary policy on June 19, when it will also give updated economic forecasts. Most economists expect no policy rate change throughout 2019.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japanese exports contracted for the fifth month in April due to a slump in shipments of chip-making equipment to China, underlining the growing threat to the world's third-biggest economy from a bruising Sino-U.S. trade war. 
Data also showed Japan's trade surplus with the United States rose for a second month as auto exports accelerated, which could draw U.S. President Donald Trump's ire before U.S.-Japan trade negotiations begin this week followed by a leaders' summit a few days later. 
Trump's government is trying to renegotiate trade agreements with major economies to lower the U.S. trade deficit and address what it considers to be unfair trade practices.
That approach has set-off an intensifying tariff dispute between the United States and China - two major trading partners of Japan - in a blow to global businesses, trade and overall growth. 
Washington's stance is doubly harmful to Japan because it has slammed the breaks on exports to neighboring China and exposes the trade-reliant economy to curbs on its shipments of cars to the United States.
""Some Japanese companies are still optimistic about a resolution to recent trade friction, but the implications are quite serious,"" said Hiroshi Miyazaki, senior economist at Mitsubishi UFJ  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) Securities.
""On one hand, we may reach a point where Japanese companies shift production from China or other places. On the other hand, Japanese policymakers need to make sure U.S.-Japan trade stays out of the spotlight.""
Ministry of Finance (MOF) data showed on Wednesday Japan's exports fell 2.4% in April from a year earlier, down for a fifth straight month. That compared with a 1.8% drop seen by analysts in a Reuters poll, and a similar 2.4% decline in March.
Exports to China fell 6.3% in April from a year earlier, down for the second consecutive month.
The data also showed Japan's trade surplus with the United States rose 17.7% in April from a year earlier to 723.2 billion yen ($6.55 billion), partly led by an 8.3% increase in auto exports.
U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer will visit Japan on May 24 to meet Economy Minister Toshimitsu Motegi to accelerate trade talks ahead of a leaders' summit a few days later, according to two sources with direct knowledge of the plan. 
TRUMP THREAT, AUTO EXPORT RISK
Trump angered foreign automakers by declaring that some imported vehicles and parts posed a national security threat, and Tokyo fears the U.S. government could attempt to set a quota on Japanese car imports. 
The specter of a drawn-out trade war comes at a delicate time for Japan's economy.
Gross domestic product (GDP) data out Monday showed Japan's growth unexpectedly accelerated in January-March because imports fell more than exports, suggesting domestic consumption was weakening at the same time external demand had turned down. 
Indeed, the GDP data showed declines in consumer and business spending, a bigger source of concern as companies worried about the future.
Last month, imports rose 6.4% on-year from a 1.2% gain in March, thanks to increases in oil and related purchases. 
Faltering overseas demand and weak consumer spending could keep policymakers under pressure to forego a twice-delayed tax hike in October, although a rebound in manufacturers' confidence may ease some fears of a recession in the world's third-largest economy.
Japanese manufacturers' morale improved in May for the first time in seven months, a Reuters poll showed on Wednesday.
However, two-thirds of companies surveyed expect economic growth to remain flat in the second quarter, while 82% of firms believe Japan's economy is not fully prepared for a planned tax hike, a Reuters monthly poll showed.
Investors are closely watching the government's monthly report due later this week for a possible downgrading of its view that the economy is in a gradual recovery, which would rekindle speculation about a tax hike delay.
To be sure, there are some positive signs for Japan's economy.
Core machinery orders, a highly volatile data series regarded as an indicator of capital spending in the coming six to nine months, rose 3.8% in March, separate data on Wednesday showed. That confounded expectations for a 0.7 percent decline.
Furthermore, manufacturers surveyed by the Cabinet Office forecast core orders to jump 15.7% in April-June after a 3.2% decline in the previous quarter.
In Japan, a sales tax increase to 8% from 5% in April 2014 hit consumers hard and triggered a sharp economic slump.
Since then Abe has delayed the planned tax hike to 10% twice as he prioritized economic growth over fiscal reforms, despite the industrial world's heaviest public debt burden, which sits at twice the size of Japan's $5 trillion economy.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japanese manufacturers' morale improved in May for the first time in seven months, a Reuters poll showed, as recession worries eased, although companies were concerned about the impact of a planned tax hike on the economy.
The monthly poll, which tracks the Bank of Japan's (BOJ) closely-watched tankan quarterly survey, found manufacturers' mood expected to rise further over the coming three months.
The Reuters Tankan results came after data showed Japan's growth surprisingly accelerated in January-March, driven by net contributions from exports, although declines in consumer and business spending underscored a fragile recovery.
Highlighting uncertainties, nearly two-thirds of companies saw growth remaining flat in the second quarter, nearly two-fifth saw it slowing and just 17 percent saw it accelerating, the Reuters monthly poll showed.
The mixed batch of data could keep alive speculation that Prime Minister Shinzo Abe may postpone a twice-delayed sales tax hike with 82 percent of firms in a Reuters poll seeing the world's third largest economy as not fully prepared for the higher levy.
In the poll of 477 large- and mid-sized companies, many manufacturers voiced worry about the Sino-U.S. trade war, which has disrupted supply chains and hit Japan's export-led economy. 
""China's market is on track for a recovery after slumping in the latter half of last year,"" an electric machinery maker wrote in the survey.
""Uncertainty exists over the outlook on global economy, but I don't think demand will fall sharply,"" a transport equipment maker's manager wrote.
Around 230 firms in the poll responded on condition of anonymity. 
The sentiment index for manufacturers stood at 12 in May, up four points from the previous month, led by oil refiners, food processing firms, autos and precision machinery, according to the poll conducted May 8-17.
The index is expected to rise further to 15 in August.
The service-sector index grew to 27 in May from 24 in the previous month, led by information/communications, transport/utility and other service firms.
The index is expected to slip to 26 in August.
The BOJ's tankan in April showed the business mood hit a two-year low in the March quarter, highlighting worries that global trade tensions and weakening world demand were taking a toll on confidence in the export-reliant economy.

The Reuters Tankan indexes are calculated by subtracting the percentage of pessimistic respondents from optimistic ones. A positive figure means optimists outnumber pessimists.

1248,By Reuters,"<span>May 21, 2019 08:25PM ET</span>","UK housing market weathers Brexit clouds, but sharp gains unlikely: Reuters poll","By Jonathan Cable
LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's expensive housing market has so far weathered the uncertainty swirling around the country's planned departure from the European Union, but average prices are unlikely to rise sharply and will fall in London this year, a Reuters poll found.
Nearly three years ago Britons surprised most of the world when they voted to split from the EU, yet it is still unclear how, when or even if the two sides will part ways. 
Prime Minister Theresa May said on Sunday she would make a final attempt to get her Brexit divorce deal through parliament before she leaves office, something she has failed to manage three times already.
With no resolution in sight, Brexit uncertainty has affected property prices in the capital - long a magnet for foreign speculators - as people have shied away from investing, despite a fall in sterling since the referendum making UK housing a relatively cheaper investment.
Real estate agent Foxtons, which focuses on the London market, said on Monday UK property sales were running at record lows due to the impact of Brexit on consumer confidence.
According to the May 10-21 Reuters poll, prices will drop 2.0% in London this year, the same median forecast given in a February survey.
But that might not be a bad thing for buyers. When asked to describe the level of London house prices on a scale of 1 to 10 from extremely cheap to extremely expensive, the median response was 8.5, higher than in previous surveys. Nationally they were rated 6.0.
""It's the same old story - housing is cheap for those with some capital behind them, given low funding costs, but very expensive in terms of the income multiple,"" said Peter Dixon at Commerzbank (DE:CBKG).
The average annual British salary is about 30,000 pounds ($38,100) and yet the average asking price for a home in Britain was 308,290 pounds this month, and more than double that in London, property website Rightmove said.
For those already on the property ladder, borrowing money is cheap. The Bank of England has set Bank Rate at 0.75 percent and is not expected to raise it any time soon. [ECILT/GB]
YOU AIN'T SEEN NOTHING YET
Looking nationally, over 80% of respondents to an extra question in the poll said the housing market had so far weathered the Brexit uncertainty and price rises are expected to prove fairly robust.
Home values will gain 1.2% nationally this year - lagging expectations for general inflation - 2.0% next year and 2.5% in 2021, the poll of 23 housing market watchers said.
""The UK market has remained remarkably resilient,"" said Russell Quirk at property website Vyomm.com. ""So, just imagine the enormity of the 'happy-ending' that will prevail when the current political paralysis ends.""
Economists in another Reuters poll conducted earlier this month said Britain would eventually agree a free trade deal with the EU and London home prices are expected to rise 1.0% next year and 2.5% in 2021. 
However, as negotiations to leave the club Britain joined in 1973 have proved protracted it does not bode well for when talks over future deals with global partners need to be agreed. Over three-quarters of respondents to an additional question said the risks to their forecasts were to the downside.

""Whilst everyone is conscious of Brexit we face a further 2-3 years after the Brexit Agreement to deal with the so-called implementation phase,"" said independent buying agent Henry Pryor. ""If you think getting the Withdrawal Agreement done was hard work, I expect you ain't seen nothing yet!""

1249,By Reuters,"<span>May 21, 2019 02:01PM ET</span>",Shortage of cheaper houses stifles U.S. homes sales,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. home sales fell for a second straight month in April, weighed down by a chronic shortage of more affordable houses, the latest sign the economy was slowing after a temporary boost from exports and an inventory overhang in the first quarter.
The unexpected drop in sales reported by the National Association of Realtors on Tuesday came on the heels of data last week showing retail sales and industrial production dropped in April, which prompted economists to cut growth forecasts for the second quarter. 
Falling mortgage rates and the lowest unemployment rate in nearly 50 years are boosting demand for lower-priced homes.
""A mismatch between strengthening entry level demand and scarce entry level supply is likely playing a role in the underwhelming sales pace,"" said Charlie Dougherty, an economist at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) Securities in Charlotte, North Carolina. 
""A significant breakout in existing home sales is unlikely this year.""
Existing home sales fell 0.4% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.19 million units last month. March's sales pace was unrevised at 5.21 million units. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast existing home sales rising 2.7% to a rate of 5.35 million units in April. 
Existing home sales, which make up about 90% of U.S. home sales, dropped 4.4% from a year ago, the 14th straight annual decrease. According to the NAR, there was a 10% drop from a year earlier in sales of houses priced $100,000 and below. 
The Realtors group said there was strong demand in this market segment, but not enough homes for sale. The inventory of housing in this price bracket dropped 17.3% from a year ago.
The NAR also said last year's revamp of the U.S. tax code, which reduced the amount of mortgage interest payments homeowners could deduct, was crimping demand for homes priced $1 million and above. There has been a marked drop in sales in high tax states such as New Jersey and Connecticut.
The tight housing supply, especially in the lower end of the market is likely because of land and labor shortages. 
A survey last week also showed that while single-family home builders were the most optimistic in seven months in May, they complained that they ""continue to deal with ongoing labor and lot shortages and rising material costs that are holding back supply and harming affordability.""
The government reported last week that permits to build single-family homes fell for a fifth straight month in April, touching their lowest level since November 2016.
SOLID FUNDAMENTALS
April's drop in existing homes sales means less brokers' commissions, which suggests that housing could remain a drag on gross domestic product in the second quarter. 
As a result, Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) lowered its GDP growth estimates for the April-June quarter by a tenth of a percentage point to a 1.6 percent annualized rate. The economy grew at a 3.2 percent pace in the first quarter. Spending on homebuilding contracted in the first quarter, the fifth straight quarterly decline.
""With the soft housing market and manufacturing faltering, it is imperative that the service side of the economy holds up if growth is to remain solid,"" said Joel Naroff, chief economist at Naroff Economic Advisors in Holland, Pennsylvania.
The PHLX housing index was trading higher, tracking a broadly firmer U.S. stock market. The dollar rose slightly against a basket of currencies. Prices of U.S. Treasuries fell.
Despite the persistently weak sales, housing market fundamentals are strong. The 30-year fixed mortgage rate has dropped to an average of 4.07% from a more than seven-year peak of about 4.94% in November, according to data from mortgage finance agency Freddie Mac. 
This follows a recent decision by the Federal Reserve to suspend its three-year monetary policy tightening campaign. The robust labor market is steadily pushing up paychecks, which is narrowing the gap between house prices and wages. 
Last month, existing home sales fell in the Northeast and South. They were unchanged in the Midwest and rose in the West.
There were 1.83 million previously owned homes on the market in April, up from 1.67 million in March and 1.8 million a year ago. At April's sales pace, it would take 4.2 months to exhaust the current inventory, up from 3.8 months in March.
A six-to-seven-month supply is viewed as a healthy balance between supply and demand. The median existing house price increased 3.6% from a year ago to $267,300 in April.
Last month, houses for sale typically stayed on the market for 24 days, the shortest since May 2011 when the NAR started tracking the series, down from 36 days in March and 26 days a year ago. About 53% of homes sold in April were on the market for less than a month.

First-time buyers accounted for 32% of sales last month, down from 33% in March and a year ago. Economists and realtors say a 40% share of first-time buyers is needed for a robust housing market.

The Confederation of British Industry's (CBI) monthly order book balance fell to -10 from -5 in April, its lowest level since October 2016 and below all forecasts in a Reuters poll of economists.
The fall represents a disappointing reading as the CBI's order gauge, which is not seasonally adjusted, usually rises in May.
Overall, the survey suggested the boost to manufacturing from the rush to stockpile ahead of the original March 2019 deadline is subsiding quickly, with factories now lumbered with the greatest stocks of finished goods since 2009.
Export orders fell at the fastest rate since July 2016, the CBI said.
""These results provide further evidence that manufacturers have been stockpiling at a rapid pace as part of their Brexit contingency plans,"" CBI economist Anna Leach said.
""When combined with a sharp decline in order books, it's clear why manufacturing firms are so keen to see a swift end to the current Brexit impasse."""
1251,By Bloomberg,"<span>May 20, 2019 11:30PM ET</span>",Soggy Australia House Market Boosted as Lending Rules Eased,"(Bloomberg) -- Australia’s soggy housing market just got another shot in the arm.
The banking regulator Tuesday proposed easing lending rules that will allow home-buyers to borrow more, and central bank Governor Philip Lowe said policymakers will consider the case for cutting interest rates at its next meeting in two weeks’ time. The one-two combo could help reverse a credit crunch that has weighed on home prices.
The news is another win for the property market in recent days after Scott Morrison’s center-right government pulled off a shock election win on the weekend, killing off the opposition Labor party’s plans to wind back tax breaks for property investors. Bank shares gained for a second day on speculation the hat-trick of good news will help stem, or reverse, the slide in property prices.
The announcement from the banking regulator “represents a material easing in the credit constraint facing households,” David Plank, head of Australian economics at Australia & New Zealand Banking Group Ltd. said in a note. “This is an effective easing in policy settings, in our view.”
There are already signs the slide in the housing market is easing. The drop in housing values slowed last month, according to CoreLogic Inc. data, suggesting the worst of the slump may have passed. Nonetheless, house prices in Sydney have slumped 14.5% from their mid-2017 peak, and Melbourne property values are down 11%.
“There’s a chance that the market will hit its bottom earlier than most are expecting if these changes come to fruition,” said Cameron Kusher, head of Australian research at CoreLogic. “It’ll bring into the market people that previously weren’t able to take out a mortgage.”
Westpac Banking Corp. rose 2.4% at 1:15 p.m. in Sydney trading, after Monday surging the most in 31 years; National Australia Bank Ltd. added 1.3% and ANZ Bank gained 1.7%. Commonwealth Bank of Australia rose 1.5%.
Currently, the Australian  Prudential  (LON:PRU) Regulation Authority requires lenders to use a minimum interest rate floor of 7% to assess whether a borrower can meet repayments. Most banks have set it at 7.25%, even though many mortgage rates are 4% or less.
Under the new proposals, lenders would be permitted to review and set their own floor as long as it builds in a 2.5% buffer above the borrower’s mortgage rate.
Rate Cut
“With interest rates at record lows, and likely to remain at historically low levels for some time, the gap between the 7% floor and actual rates paid has become quite wide, in some cases possibly unnecessarily so,” APRA Chairman Wayne Byres said in a statement Tuesday.
The central bank has held official interest rates at a record low 1.5% since August 2016, and Lowe today set the groundwork for a potential cut as soon as next month.
“A lower cash rate would support employment growth and bring forward the time when inflation is consistent with the target,” Lowe said in the text of a speech in Brisbane Tuesday. “Given this assessment, at our meeting in two weeks’ time, we will consider the case for lower interest rates.”
According to ANZ Bank, household borrowing capacity has been cut by about 30% in recent years because of tighter lending rules imposed by the regulator, with the higher rate buffer accounting for almost a third of the reduction.
“APRA’s proposal will help support credit growth and could stem the fall in house prices,” Frank Mirenzi, senior credit officer, financial institutions groups at Moody’s Investors Service said in a note. “The proposal will likely increase borrowing capacity and potentially allow households to increase leverage.”

Capasa urged the Italian government not to raise the sales tax on fashion goods.

IHS Markit, a data firm, said on Monday its Household Finance Index (HFI) fell to 42.5 from 43.8, its lowest level since September 2017 as worries grew about job security, particularly in retail and manufacturing.
Britain's labor market has remained resilient in the face of Brexit, helping households whose spending has driven an otherwise fragile economy.
However, the jobs boom may reflect how employers have hired workers - who can be laid off in a downturn - rather than commit to longer-term investments while they wait for uncertainty over Britain's departure from the European Union to lift.
""Despite the latest labor market data showing historically-low unemployment and reasonably robust wage growth, weak confidence has acted to undermine these trends and led to belt-tightening at UK households,"" said Joe Hayes, an economist at survey compiler IHS Markit.

1255,By Reuters,"<span>May 19, 2019 10:56PM ET</span>",Weak spending overshadows Japan's surprise first quarter economic expansion,"By Tetsushi Kajimoto and Leika Kihara
TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's economic growth unexpectedly accelerated in January- March, driven by net contributions from exports and defying forecasts for a contraction in the world's third-largest economy.
However, the surprise expansion was mostly caused by imports declining faster than exports, likely reflecting weak domestic demand, a point of concern for policymakers with a planned sales tax hike scheduled to take effect in October.
Underscoring this challenge were private consumption and capital expenditure readings, which both fell in the first quarter, while exports suffered the biggest fall since 2015.
Japan's economy grew at an annualized 2.1% in the first quarter, gross domestic product (GDP) data showed on Monday, beating market expectations for a 0.2% contraction. It followed a revised 1.6% expansion in October-December.
The soft patches behind the headline GDP number could keep alive speculation that Prime Minister Shinzo Abe may postpone a twice-delayed increase in the sales tax in October.
""All of the most important components of GDP are negative,"" said Hiroaki Muto, chief economist at Tokai Tokyo Research Center.
""The economy has already peaked out, so we are likely to have a mild recession,"" he said. ""No one would object to delaying the sales tax hike.""
The headline GDP expansion was caused largely by a 4.6% slump in imports, the biggest drop in a decade and more than a 2.4% fall in exports.
As imports fell more than exports, net exports - or shipments minus imports - added 0.4 percentage point to GDP growth, the data showed.
Private consumption slid 0.1% and capital expenditure dropped 0.3%, casting doubt on policymakers' view that solid domestic demand will offset the pain from slowing exports.
There have been growing calls from some former policymakers to delay the sales tax hike in the face of worsening domestic and external conditions.
However, Economy Minister Toshimitsu Motegi put a brave face on Monday, saying that there was no change to the government's plan to raise the sales tax to 10% from 8% in October.
""There's no change to our view that the fundamentals supporting domestic demand remain solid,"" Motegi told reporters after the data's release.
But some analysts warn that Japan's economy will continue to face headwinds that could dent growth in coming quarters.
""Consumer spending is likely to remain weak, because wages are not rising that much,"" said Kentaro Arita, senior economist at Mizuho Research Institute.
""In the second quarter, GDP could be zero or slightly negative because exports will remain weak. This, combined with weakening capital expenditure, means there is a risk of a recession.""

The GDP data comes as the government's coincident economic indicator flagged the possibility Japan may be in a recession as exports and factory output were hit by China's slowdown and the Sino-U.S. trade war.

The cities of Suzhou, Foshan, Dalian and Nanning have been told by the Ministry of Housing and Urban-Rural Development to stabilize land and housing prices as well as market expectations, the official Xinhua news agency reported late on Saturday.
Six other cities were warned by the ministry last month to monitor the growth of home prices in their markets, after some cities, including, Foshan quietly started to relax some curbs since December to spur demand.
China's home property market is a key plank of the economy, influencing tens of related sectors such as construction and financial services. 
The sector has held up well despite a slowdown in growth in the world's second-biggest economy, with policymakers walking a fine line between preserving stability and hurting market sentiment. 
Renewed tensions between China and the United States over trade have also added pressure on Chinese policymakers to keep the domestic economy on a stable footing, while continuing to fend off risks such as housing bubbles. 
Average new home prices in China's 70 major cities rose 0.6% in April, unchanged from the pace of growth in March, according to a monthly official survey.
Most of the 70 cities surveyed by the National Bureau of Statistics still reported monthly price gains for new homes. The number increased to 67 in April from 65 in March, signaling a slight strengthening in the market.
The housing ministry reiterated that ""houses are for living in, not for speculation"", according to the Xinhua news agency on Saturday.
Even before the ministry's latest warning, the prosperous city of Suzhou, just northwest of Shanghai, had already rolled out new property curbs. 

On May 11, Suzhou said it would restrict buyers of new homes in some districts from selling their property within three years.

The findings of the Commerce Department's quarterly services survey, or QSS, come on the heels of data this week showing growth in manufacturing inventories in the first quarter was not as robust as initially estimated.
Before the QSS data, economists had expected that GDP growth for the January-March quarter would be trimmed to an annualized pace of 3.0 percent from a 3.2 percent rate.
Based on the QSS data, economists at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) and Action Economics estimated an additional one-tenth of a percentage point would be subtracted from the GDP estimate. 
That suggests first-quarter GDP could be trimmed to a 2.9 percent rate when the Commerce Department's Bureau of Economics Analysis publishes its revision later this month.

""Data from the QSS point to modest downward revisions to the BEA's first-quarter estimates of consumer spending and investment in intellectual property products, which combined subtracted 0.1% percentage point from our growth tracking estimate,"" said Daniel Silver, an economist at JPMorgan in New York.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. consumer sentiment jumped to a 15-year high in early May amid growing confidence over the economy's outlook, but much of the surge was recorded before an escalation in the trade war between the United States and China, which could hurt activity. 
The University of Michigan said its consumer sentiment index increased 5.3% to 102.4, the highest reading since 2004. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast a reading of 97.5.
President Donald Trump last week raised tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods to 25% from 10%. China retaliated on Monday with higher tariffs on a revised list of $60 billion worth of U.S. products. 
Economists have warned the bruising trade fight could weigh on consumer and business confidence, and undercut spending. 
The University of Michigan said ""negative references to tariffs rose in the past week and are likely to rise further in late May and June."" 
""So the recent improvement in sentiment may turn out to be short-lived,"" said Daniel Silver, an economist at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) in New York. ""While the ultimate response to tariffs is still unclear, the survey results suggest that consumer sentiment was upbeat before the developments on trade policy from the past couple of weeks.""
Still, some economists viewed the surge in sentiment, which also came despite higher gasoline prices, as a hopeful sign for a pickup in consumer spending after it slowed sharply in the first quarter. Consumer confidence accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity.
The University of Michigan consumer sentiment survey's expectations index also rose to its highest since 2004.
The survey showed consumers expecting higher inflation over the next 12 months and five years. The survey's five-year inflation expectations measure rose to 2.6% early this month from 2.3% in April. Federal Reserve officials are keeping a close eye on survey-based measures of inflation expectations.
Inflation measures have retreated, contributing to the U.S. central bank's recent decision to suspend its three-year monetary policy tightening campaign. 
A key inflation measure tracked by the Fed has slowed below its 2 percent target, prompting calls from Trump for the central bank to cut interest rates.

""This is the kind of rebound the Fed would welcome and it adds to the case that the Fed will not make an insurance cut in interest rates,"" said John Ryding, chief economist at RDQ Economics in New York.

Eurostat said consumer prices in the 19-nation euro zone were 1.7 percent higher year-on-year, the same level as the flash estimate published on May 3, from 1.4 percent in March.
The acceleration offers some mild relief to the European Central Bank, which targets inflation of just below 2 percent, although the jump was likely related to the later timing of Easter this year.
Month-on-month, euro zone prices increased by 0.7 percent, as markets had expected, from 1.0 percent in March.
The core indicator watched closely by the ECB for its monetary policy decisions, which excludes volatile energy and food prices, rose to 1.4 percent in April on the year from 1.0 percent in March.

A narrower inflation indicator that excludes energy, food, alcohol and tobacco was also confirmed increasing to 1.3 percent from 0.8 percent in March. For this, the flash estimate had been 1.2 percent.

Inflation as a whole rose because of a 5.3 percent increase in energy prices, a 1.9 percent rise in the prices of services and a 1.5 percent hike of food, alcohol and tobacco prices.

ZHENGZHOU, China (Reuters) - Dressed in a smart black pantsuit behind the wheel of her pearl-white Audi, Zhao Na has come a long way from her roots in rural Henan province, in central China.
The 29-year-old real estate agent cheerfully admits to having shopaholic ways and a love of Louis Vuitton and Prada handbags, typifying a wave of free-spending consumers who have had the world's top brands scrambling for a piece of China's $5 trillion-plus retail market.
""When I am flush, I am happy to part with money,"" said Zhao, who once splurged around 60,000 yuan ($9,000) on a clutch of handbags during a trip to Paris in 2017. ""Spending makes me happy.""
But with China's economy slowing, Zhao's business has hit a wall and her income has plummeted, forcing her to shelve that source of happiness.
She has scrapped the European shopping trips and weaned herself off buying binges at her favorite mall, David Plaza, where giant digital screens flash advertisements for brands like Gucci, Lancome and Ermenegildo Zegna in the center of Zhengzhou, Henan's capital.
""Not being able to spend money as I like makes me feel lousy, but I cannot do much about it,"" Zhao said.
REALITY CHECK
An economic slowdown in China, after three decades of unbridled growth, is being felt especially keenly by consumers like Zhao in Henan. The province, with its 100 million people, is a key pillar of China's aspirations to transform its economy by boosting domestic spending and raising living standards in the country's interior.
But according to dozens of interviews with consumers and merchants across Henan, as well as trade group data, people in the province are spending less on everything from cars and household appliances to clothing and cosmetics.
(Map of Henan province: https://tmsnrt.rs/2WK6CVv)
Scaled-back consumption by inland urbanites like Zhao could have serious repercussions for China's economic growth, already imperiled by an escalating trade war with the United States.
It could also be a reality check for global retailers.
The Italian suit-maker Ermenegildo Zegna, the American luxury jeweler Tiffany, and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) have all warned that consumers across China are paring back spending. 
On Wednesday, China reported weak growth in retail sales, and a drop in spending on clothing for the first time in a decade. 
Slowing spending in inland cities such as Zhengzhou could dent the ambitions of global retailers that have pinned their hopes on future growth in regions like Henan, the largest provincial economy beyond China's prosperous coastal regions.
A PROVINCE TRANSFORMED 
Long a dusty provincial capital, Zhengzhou's transformation in recent years into a metropolis with a glittering skyline and fashionable malls has been staggering. 
The city of 10 million is a key transportation hub on China's Belt and Road network, linked by rail to Central Asia and Europe beyond, with high-speed connections to Beijing and Shanghai. The Taiwan contract manufacturer Foxconn has built an enormous iPhone factory in the city that employs 230,000 people.
Ambitious young people once typically fled Henan to seek better lives elsewhere. But Zhengzhou now gives them a place to pursue their middle-class dreams: earning more and being able to afford their own modern homes and an array of consumer goods.
For Zhao, the city was a beacon of hope.
Born into a family of farmers in rural Henan, the youngest of three children, Zhao dreamed from an early age of escaping her impoverished village. She did well in school, which allowed her to attend university in Zhengzhou, where she discovered a talent for sales.
She joined a property developer, working for rich clients sporting designer clothes and fancy handbags. Soon, she was able to taste that lifestyle herself as she began racking up lucrative commissions on sales of top-end apartments in Zhengdong New Area, a commercial district where luxury hotels and office towers have sprouted from farmland.
She became a regular at the high-end shops of David Plaza and bought a car and two homes, letting one of them out on Airbnb. 
Supplementing the commissions, Zhao also piled up debt on her half-dozen credit cards. She says she owes about 200,000 yuan in credit card debt, on top of monthly mortgage and car payments totaling 15,000 yuan. 
But as Zhengzhou's frenzied property market cooled last year, sales plummeted, along with her commissions. And that put an end to her shopping trips to David Plaza.
Zhao is not alone in cutting back. Consumer confidence in provincial cities such as Zhengzhou fell slightly last year after hitting its highest level in at least nine years in 2017, according to Nielsen, a research firm. Retail sales growth in Zhengzhou fell to single-digits last year for the first time in nearly two decades.
At two malls in Zhengzhou's downtown shopping district, retailers selling cosmetic brands like Kiehl's and Clinique said customers were becoming more careful. 
""They used to buy a lot and spend their money rather carelessly,"" said Li Mengru, the cosmetic sales manager at the Dennis Department Store who oversees brands including Chanel, Dior and  Estee Lauder  (NYSE:EL). ""Now they are becoming choosier as they turn cautious about spending.""
EASY MONEY
A key driver of consumption in China in recent years has been the explosion of new finance options, including peer-to-peer loans and endless opportunities for acquiring credit cards. That put a wealth of consumer goods in reach for people previously unable to afford them.
Chai Maofeng, a 28-year-old beef distributor in Xuchang, a Henan city of about 4 million people, opened ten credit card accounts in 2016 to furnish his apartment with a sofa set, refrigerator, air conditioners and televisions – all brand new.
""Opening a credit card account was easy - banks were happy to lend to you, and all you needed was a landline number that suggested you worked in an office,"" said Chai.
But Chai said he had to put his freespending ways on hold after the economic slowdown started hurting his business, which had also been hit by a sweeping crackdown on polluting industries that pushed up beef prices.
Chai said he had put off plans to buy a second property and a new car.
""This one from the company is actually fine,"" he said, referring to the white van his company lets him use.
WORSE TO COME? 
China's economy showed signs of recovery in the first quarter, with gross domestic product growing more than expected by analysts. But an intensifying trade war with the United States, sluggish factory activity and slowing global demand for Chinese products suggest the slowdown will continue through 2019, most economists say.
Efforts by Beijing to rein in credit and risky debt over the past few years to contain speculative bubbles has also reduced the amount of easy money available for many consumers.
Those factors are likely to keep weighing on consumer spending, analysts say.
Beijing has taken steps to prop up spending, announcing plans in January for subsidies to boost purchases of cars, an industry that saw sales decline last year for the first time in two decades. The government has also sought to increase take-home pay by reducing the income tax burden for many individuals.
(Graphic: Henan's skidding auto sales - https://tmsnrt.rs/2WD0Gxy)
But government help is unlikely to offset a decline in confidence stemming from slowing income growth and rising household debt, analysts say.
For all that, consumers have not stopped spending altogether. On a recent afternoon in downtown Zhengzhou, David Plaza was bustling, with shoppers checking out the latest lipsticks and sipping lattes in coffee shops.
But Zhao was not among them.
Staring at almost 30 years of mortgage payments ahead of her, and the car loans she still needs to repay, she said it might be a while before she shops at the mall again.

""With income falling, I have to make every penny count,"" Zhao said. ""Unnecessary luxury spending has to go for now.""

1263,By Reuters,"<span>May 16, 2019 12:29PM ET</span>",U.S. housing starts beat expectations; supply constraints remain,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. housing starts increased more than expected in April and activity in the prior month was stronger than initially thought, suggesting declining mortgage rates were providing some support to the struggling housing market.
Land and labor shortages, however, continue to constrain builders' ability to construct more lower-priced houses, the segment of the market that has suffered an acute shortage of inventory and weak sales. Those supply challenges were highlighted by a drop in the number of homes under construction to a seven-month low in April.
""The housing market is coming back a little,"" said Joel Naroff, chief economist at Naroff Economic Advisors in Holland, Pennsylvania. ""Building activity is what really matters for economic growth and right now, that is softening."" 
Housing starts rose 5.7% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.235 million units last month, driven by gains in the construction of both single- and multi-family housing units, the Commerce Department said on Thursday. Groundbreaking was also likely boosted by drier weather in the Midwest.
Data for March was revised up to show homebuilding rising to a pace of 1.168 million units, instead of falling to a rate of 1.139 million units as previously reported. 
Building permits rose 0.6% to a rate of 1.296 million units in April, after three straight monthly declines. Single-family building permits, however, fell for the fifth straight month, suggesting a moderation in groundbreaking activity was likely.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast housing starts would increase to a pace of 1.205 million units in April.
The 30-year fixed mortgage rate has dropped to 4.10% from a peak of about 4.94% in November, according to data from mortgage finance agency Freddie Mac. Decreasing mortgage rates reflect a recent decision by the Federal Reserve to suspend its three-year monetary policy tightening campaign.
A survey on Wednesday showed confidence among homebuilders rose to a seven-month high in May. While lower borrowing costs are boosting demand, builders said they ""continue to deal with ongoing labor and lot shortages and rising material costs that are holding back supply and harming affordability."" 
Relatively cheaper home loans and a strengthening labor market, characterized by the lowest unemployment rate in nearly 50 years, are underpinning demand for housing. In a separate report on Thursday, the Labor Department said initial claims for state unemployment benefits dropped 16,000 to a seasonally adjusted 212,000 for the week ended May 11.
The PHLX housing index was trading higher, also tracking a broadly firmer U.S. stock market. The dollar rose against a basket of currencies, while U.S. Treasury prices fell.
SLUGGISH MANUFACTURING
The robust job market should also support the economy as the boost from the White House's $1.5 trillion tax cut package fades and President Donald Trump's escalating trade war with China disrupts supply chains at factories, which are already struggling with an inventory bloat that has cut production.
A third report from the Philadelphia Federal Reserve on Thursday showed manufacturing activity in the mid-Atlantic region accelerated in May, but factories reported receiving fewer orders and were less upbeat about capital spending over the next six months. 
The survey was conducted before last Friday's move by Trump to hike tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods.
""While business sentiment appears to have picked up lately, it is unclear what types of assumptions respondents had about trade policy, and many of the responses for these surveys likely were completed before the increase in tariffs implemented last Friday,"" said Daniel Silver, an economist at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) in New York.
The housing market has been mired in a soft patch since last year. Investment in homebuilding contracted at a 2.8% annualized rate in the first quarter, the fifth straight quarterly decline.
Last month, single-family homebuilding, which accounts for the largest share of the housing market, increased 6.2% to a rate of 854,000 units. Single-family homebuilding surged in the Midwest, which had suffered flooding in prior months. Single-family starts also rose in the Northeast and West, but fell in the South, where the bulk of homebuilding occurs. 
Permits to build single-family homes dropped 4.2% to a rate of 782,000 units in April. The number of houses under construction fell last month as did competitions.
Starts for the volatile multi-family housing segment advanced 4.7% to a rate of 381,000 units last month. Permits for the construction of multi-family homes rebounded 8.9% to a pace of 514,000 units last month.

""It looks like residential construction will move sideways in coming months, with a slight increase in multifamily construction edging out a decrease in single-family starts,"" said Andres Carbacho-Burgos, a senior economist at Moody's Analytics in West Chester, Pennsylvania.

Initial claims for state unemployment benefits dropped 16,000 to a seasonally adjusted 212,000 for the week ended May 11, the Labor Department said on Thursday. Data for the prior week was unrevised.
Claims had been stuck at higher levels for three straight weeks, reflecting difficulties stripping out seasonal fluctuations from the data around moving holidays like Easter, Passover and school spring breaks. 
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast claims would fall to 220,000 in the latest week. The Labor Department said no states were estimated last week. 
The four-week moving average of initial claims, considered a better measure of labor market trends as it irons out week-to-week volatility, rose 4,750 to 225,000 last week. 
The labor market is strong, with the unemployment rate near a 50-year low of 3.6%. The robust job market is supporting the economy as the boost from the White House's $1.5 trillion tax cut package fades and President Donald Trump's escalating trade war with China disrupts supply chains at factories, which are already struggling with an inventory bloat that has cut production.

Thursday's claims report showed the number of people receiving benefits after an initial week of aid decreased 28,000 to 1.66 million for the week ended May 4. The four-week moving average of the so-called continuing claims rose 1,500 to 1.67 million.

With China, the EU's trade deficit expanded to 49.4 billion from 46.9 billion euros.
In the Jan-Feb period, the EU trade surplus with the United States had risen, while its deficit with China expanded.
The United States has hit the European Union with tariffs and threatened more while complaining over the trade balance. Both Washington and Brussels have also complained that China wants free trade without playing fair.
Overall, the goods trade deficit of the 28-nation bloc increased to 24.0 billion euros in Jan-March 2019 from 9.6 billion a year earlier. 
Energy imports were the chief cause of the deficit, especially from Russia and Norway. However, the sharpest movements were related to trade from Turkey and South Korea, the EU's trade balance with both turning from a surplus to a deficit.
For the narrower 19-country euro zone, exports grew by 3.1 percent year-on-year in March and imports by 6.0 percent, leading to a decline of its trade surplus to 22.5 billion euros from 26.9 billion euros a year earlier.
On a seasonally adjusted basis, the euro zone's trade surplus also decreased to 17.9 billion euros in March from 20.6 billion euros in February as exports increased by 0.9 percent month-on-month and imports rose by 2.5 percent.

KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - Malaysia's economy grew faster than expected in the first quarter supported by a recovery in the agriculture sector, but the central bank warned of downside risks to full-year growth. 
Bank Negara Malaysia said the economy grew 4.5% in the January-March quarter from a year earlier, above the 4.3% expansion forecast in a Reuters poll.
The Southeast Asian economy had grown a faster 4.7% in the October-December period last year, accelerating after four straight quarters of slowing growth.
In the first quarter, the agriculture sector grew 5.6%, far stronger than the 0.1% growth recorded in the previous quarter. 
A 7.6% increase in private consumption also boosted economic growth in the quarter, the central bank said, though it was a moderation from the fourth-quarter's 8% growth.
BNM cut its policy rate last week for the first time since 2016 to support the economy on heightening concerns about global growth.
The country's exports contracted in February and March and will likely face sustained pressure as the United States and China pursue another round of tariff increases. Malaysia is one of the most vulnerable countries to the U.S.-China trade war, being a large exporter of intermediary goods to China. 
""Risks to the outlook remain tilted to the downside, mainly emanating from external factors,"" the central bank said, maintaining its full-year growth target at 4.3-4.8%.
Bank Negara also introduced measures to improve liquidity in the repo and currency markets, and more flexibility in currency hedging.

1267,By Reuters,"<span>May 16, 2019 12:15AM ET</span>","China's solid home price growth faces bubble, trade war risks","BEIJING (Reuters) - New home prices in China grew at a solid pace in April as Beijing sought to boost economic activity in the face of an escalating trade war with the United States, though potential bubble risks may prompt some cities to tighten policies. 
Beijing has repeatedly called on local governments to take more responsibility in keeping the frothy market under control. But pent-up demand for housing, easier credit conditions and some local governments relaxing purchase restrictions may be further fanning price gains in a market where fear of missing out is strong.    
    Average new home prices in China's 70 major cities rose 0.6% in April, unchanged from the pace of growth in March, according to Reuters calculation of data released by the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) on Thursday.  
    On the whole, it logged the 48th straight month of price increases. Most of the 70 cities surveyed by the NBS still reported monthly price increases for new homes, and the number was up to 67 from 65 in March, signaling broadening strength in the market. 
    On an annual basis, home prices rose 10.7% in April, picking up from a 10.6% gain in March. 
""The impact of a series of cuts in banks' required reserve ratio (RRR) on the property market is showing,"" said Zhang Dawei, an analyst with property consultancy Centaline. China has announced five RRR cuts in the past year with another targeted reduction focused on small and medium-sized banks earlier in May.
The government has been walking a tightrope between maintaining economic growth and cracking down on a potential housing bubble, amid weakening exports and sluggish consumer demand.
Chinese banks throttled back new lending in April after a record first quarter that sparked fears of more bad loans, but the central bank is widely expected to roll out more measures to support the economy after an unexpected flare-up in trade tensions with the United States earlier this month. 
Data on Wednesday showed while property investment was resilient in April as developers rushed to boost their land inventories in the wake of looser credit and purchasing rules, demand for new homes remained weak in a reflection of the broader economic slowdown.
Authorities appear keen to avoid dealing a sharp knock to the real estate market as it directly influences 40 other business sectors in China and is key to maintaining financial stability and tempering the economic slowdown.
The solid home price growth contrasts with surprisingly weak April retail sales and industrial output data, adding pressure on Beijing to roll out more stimulus as the trade war with the United States escalates.
OVERHEATING?
But the government's push for banks to step up support for struggling smaller companies and shore up the economy could actually work against its pledge to flush out property speculators. 
Medium- to long-term new household loans, mostly mortgages, totaled 416.5 billion yuan ($60.6 billion) in April, according to central bank data, down slightly from 460.5 billion yuan in the previous month but still remained elevated. 
Most of the price gains appeared to have been driven by growth in China's four top-tier cities - Beijing, Shanghai, Shenzhen and Guangzhou. Collectively, they rose 0.6% from a month earlier, quickening from a 0.2% gain in March, the statistics bureau said in a statement accompanying the data. 
Tier-2 cities, which include most of the larger provincial capitals, also posted gains. They increased 0.8% in April on a monthly basis, compared with the 0.6% gain in the previous month.
In smaller tier-3 cities, they rose 0.5%, easing from 0.7% in March, the statistics bureau said.
Qinhuangdao, a small port city on the coast of China in northeastern Hebei province, was the top price performer in the month, with its prices increasing 1.8% on a monthly basis.    
Previously, some smaller cities had quietly loosened curbs to prop up sentiment and demand. Moody's said last month that regulatory measures were unlikely to be loosened further amid strong growth in Chinese property prices, which it expects will slow during the remainder of 2019.
In fact, some cities have started to implement additional curbs on signs of overheating. 
While some market watchers speculate Beijing will be forced to roll out more stimulus due to a slowing economy, Centaline's Zhang said the government is unlikely to allow unfettered gains in the property market.

""The market can enter a warm 'spring' but it's impossible that the government will let it enter a full-swing summer.""

1268,By Reuters,"<span>May 15, 2019 11:06PM ET</span>","Australia jobless rate jumps to eight-month highs, Australian dollar stumbles","By Swati Pandey
SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia's unemployment rate rose to the highest in eight months while full-time jobs fell, official data showed on Thursday, cementing views its central bank may be forced to lower rates soon to stimulate the economy. 
The local dollar skidded 0.4 percent to $0.6891, the weakest since early January when a currency 'flash crash' briefly sent the Aussie to $0.6743. 
The data has ""increased the risk the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) will cut the cash rate in June, earlier than our call of July,"" said Kaixin Owyong, Sydney-based economist at National Australia Bank. 
The RBA has held rates at a record low 1.50 percent since August 2016. It is counting on labor market strength for a long-awaited pick up in wage growth and inflation in the face of a sharp economic slowdown led by a property market downturn.
""In recent statements, the RBA has said that a lack of improvement in the labor market would warrant a cut, such that today’s deterioration is likely to be of great concern to them,"" Owyong added. ""We now place a 50/50 chance of a cut in June.""
Thursday's figures showed 28,400 new jobs were created in April, surging past expectations for a rise of 14,000. But in an unwelcome sign, all of the increase was led by part-time work, with full-time declining 6,300. 
Australia is creating jobs at a brisk annual pace of 2.6 percent, much faster than the 1.6 percent rise in population, but that is still not enough to meet with surging labor supply.
The unemployment rate rose for a second straight month to 5.2 percent, when analysts had expected 5.1 percent, as the participation rate climbed to 65.8 percent indicating more people went looking for work. 
The data will prove a setback for Australia's governing Liberal-National coalition, which is heading into this weekend's general election claiming to be a sound manager of the economy. Opinion polls show the opposition Labor Party is the favorite to win. 
Forward-looking indicators of labor demand are now pointing to emerging weakness. 
The National Australia Bank monthly employment index slipped last month, dragging it down to 51.4, the lowest reading since September 2016, from 53.4 in March.
A job index by Westpac has also turned down, suggesting that employment growth should slow to around 2 percent in the July-September period.
Some economists believe the labor market will soon revive after election uncertainties have faded.
""Business will get back to business as we have seen after previous polls,"" said CommSec economist Craig James.

""More people are finding work and more people are looking for work. So the job market remains solid. The Reserve Bank will not make a knee-jerk response to the latest jobs figure. It will wait for clear air to make a judgment.""

1269,By Bloomberg,"<span>May 15, 2019 11:00PM ET</span>","Australia Unemployment Rises, Boosting Odds of Interest-Rate Cut","(Bloomberg) -- Australian unemployment unexpectedly climbed as more people sought work, underscoring extensive slack in the labor market and increasing the chances of an interest-rate cut.
The jobless rate advanced to 5.2% in April from an upwardly revised 5.1% in March, the statistics bureau said in Sydney Thursday. The participation rate climbed to a record and underutilization jumped 0.4 percentage point to 13.7%, highlighting the spare capacity in the labor market cited by the central bank.
“Even if the unemployment rate hadn’t moved, steady job growth and a static unemployment rate is not enough,” said Kerry Craig, global market strategist at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) Asset Management Holdings Inc. “Job growth needs to be fast enough to push the unemployment rate lower to keep the RBA from cutting rates. According to the RBA’s own estimates a 5% unemployment rate won’t see inflation return to the target range and prevent a cut to interest rates.”
Reserve Bank chief Philip Lowe resisted pressure to ease earlier this month, citing the persistent strength of employment, while also signaling that only a tightening labor market would prevent him from doing so in the coming months. Traders see a better than 50% chance of a cut in June and two reductions this year that would take the cash rate to a fresh record low of 1%.
The Australian dollar slid after the release and bought 69.18 U.S. cents at 12:50 p.m. in Sydney. It has fallen 3.6% in the past month.
Today’s data showed employment actually advanced in April -- gaining by a better-than-expected 28,400 -- though it was exclusively down to part-time roles, again highlighting slack. Still, the labor market has managed to buck the slowdown in other areas; in the second half of last year, GDP rose an annualized 1%, the weakest performance since the depths of the global financial crisis in the second half of 2008.
Australia’s economy has been weighed down by a retrenchment in household spending as property prices slump and slash personal wealth. Outside jobs, business investment has remained reasonable while exports have boomed in response to strong commodity prices.
The government has been a key supporter of the economy with increased investment in infrastructure and other programs, including a disability program that has boosted hiring. An election Saturday is likely to see the opposition Labor party win power and lift spending further.
Thursday’s data showed the biggest job gain was in New South Wales, the nation’s most populous state and the epicenter of the property boom from 2012-2017. It added 25,100 positions. In contrast, Victoria, which has similarly enjoyed strong economic and population growth, shed 7,600 roles.
The RBA is now almost completely boxed in on a rate cut, not least following the renewed trade tensions between the U.S. and China, the latter the source of so much of Australia’s prosperity since the turn of the century.
“The RBA’s real challenge is communication,” said Craig. “By opting to highlight jobs growth and the direction of the unemployment rate, the market is now focusing on a lagging indicator of economic activity rather than a forward looking one. But also one that is not devoid of noise.”

1271,By Reuters,"<span>May 15, 2019 02:16PM ET</span>","Weak U.S. retail sales, industrial output highlight slowing economy","By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. retail sales unexpectedly fell in April as households cut back on purchases of motor vehicles and a range of other goods, pointing to a slowdown in economic growth after a temporary boost from exports and inventories in the first quarter.
The moderation in economic activity was underscored by other data on Wednesday showing a drop in industrial production last month as manufacturers, especially in the automotive sector, worked off stockpiles of unsold merchandise. 
Growth is slowing as the stimulus from the White House's $1.5 trillion tax cut package fades. President Donald Trump's escalating trade war with China, which triggered a steep U.S. stock market sell-off, is also seen hurting business confidence and undercutting spending on equipment. 
Following the weak reports on Wednesday, the Atlanta Federal Reserve cut its second-quarter gross domestic product (GDP) growth estimate to a 1.1% annualized rate from a 1.6% pace. The economy grew at a 3.2% rate in the January-March period.
""Not a great start to the current quarter,"" said Sal Guatieri a senior economist at BMO Capital Markets in Toronto.
The Commerce Department said retail sales slipped 0.2% last month after surging 1.7% in March, which was the largest increase since September 2017. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast retail sales gaining 0.2% in April. Retail sales in April increased 3.1% from a year ago. 
The National Retail Federation blamed the downbeat sales on slower tax refunds and the weather, including flooding in the Midwest, and ""blizzards and extreme temperature swings"" elsewhere. Given the stock market rout and cooler temperatures in May, which could have delayed summer purchases, a strong rebound in retail sales in unlikely.
Excluding automobiles, gasoline, building materials and food services, retail sales were unchanged in April after marching 1.1% higher in March. These so-called core retail sales correspond most closely with the consumer spending component of GDP. 
Consumer spending accounts for more than two-thirds of economic activity. While March's strong core retail sales set consumer spending on an upward trajectory in the second quarter, last month's weakness suggested a moderate pickup in spending. But consumption remains underpinned by a strong labor market, marked by the lowest unemployment rate in nearly 50 years. 
""Whatever caused last month's disappointment, the general backdrop for consumers still looks pretty favorable,"" said Michael Feroli, an economist at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) in New York. ""But the quarter got off to a rough start, and we estimate real consumption was down 0.2% last month.""
The dollar was little changed against a basket of currencies, while U.S. Treasury prices rose. Stocks on Wall Street turned higher after a report that Trump might delay a decision to impose auto tariffs.
INVENTORY BUILD
Slower consumer spending early this year led to a build-up of inventories, which is putting pressure on industries. 
In a separate report on Wednesday, the Federal Reserve said industrial production fell 0.5% in April after rising 0.2% in March. The third drop in production this year was led by manufacturing. Output at factories declined 0.5% as motor vehicles and parts production tumbled 2.6%. 
Manufacturing production was unchanged in March.
Automobile assembly plants are cutting back production as slowing sales have led to a glut of vehicles in showrooms.
Production was also hammered by a 1.8% tumble in aircraft and parts output last month. The drop, which was the largest since 2013, probably is the result of Boeing (NYSE:BA) cutting production of its troubled 737 MAX aircraft. 
Boeing's fastest-selling 737 MAX jet was grounded in March after two fatal plane crashes in five months. 
""We expect manufacturing to remain under pressure in the coming months,"" said Sarah House, a senior economist at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) Securities in Charlotte, North Carolina. 
""The latest escalation in the trade war between the United States and China is not likely to immediately show up in next month’s production figures ... but disarray to global supply chains and heightened levels of uncertainty are likely to negatively impact investment.""
Another report from the Commerce Department on Wednesday showed motor vehicle and parts inventories rising 7.8% year-on-year in March, keeping the inventory-to-sales ratio at an elevated 2.29 months. 
With the retail sales report showing sales at auto dealerships dropping 1.1% in April, the inventory overhang could last for a while. Weak auto sales combined with a 0.2% fall in online and mail-order sales and a 1.9% tumble in building materials and garden equipment receipts to hold down retail sales in April. 

There were also declines in sales at clothing stores and those selling personal grooming products. Sales at furniture outlets were flat. But receipts at service stations increased 1.8%, likely boosted by more expensive gasoline. Sales at bars and restaurants also rose moderately last month, as did receipts at hobby, musical instrument and book stores.

1272,By Bloomberg,"<span>May 15, 2019 09:30AM ET</span>",U.S. Retail Sales Unexpectedly Fall in April on Autos,"(Bloomberg) -- U.S. retail sales unexpectedly declined in April for the second time in three months, weighed down by soft sales of autos and building materials and suggesting consumer spending will remain subdued this quarter.
The value of overall sales declined 0.2% after a 1.7% increase the prior month that was the strongest gain since 2017, according to Commerce Department figures released Wednesday. That compared with the median forecast in Bloomberg’s survey calling for a 0.2% rise.
Sales in the “control group” subset, which some analysts view as a cleaner gauge of underlying consumer demand, were unchanged from the prior month, below projections for a 0.3% gain. The measure excludes food services, car dealers, building-materials stores and gasoline stations.
The figures, also reflecting weakness in the category that includes online sales, suggest spending remains soft following the weakest quarterly increase in a year. That could bolster pressure from President Donald Trump and financial markets to cut borrowing costs amid unexpectedly low inflation, though Federal Reserve policy makers have pledged patience as steady job and income gains should support purchases in coming months.
Retailers may be poised to take a further hit should Trump follow through on his threat to impose tariffs of 25% on almost all remaining Chinese imports, which would likely force Americans to absorb higher prices. Unlike the previous targets of U.S. levies, the majority of this tranche is consumer goods.
The report showed seven of 13 major retail categories decreased, with other down sectors including clothing, health and personal care, and electronics and appliances. Categories with increases included general merchandise, food and beverage stores, and restaurants and bars.
Sales at automobile dealers fell 1.1%, the most since January, after increasing 3.2% in the previous month. Industry data from Wards Automotive Group previously showed unit sales retreated in April, touching the lowest level since 2017.
Filling-station receipts increased 1.8%, the report showed, as oil prices rallied. The figures aren’t adjusted for price changes, so higher retail sales in the category could reflect higher gasoline costs, sales, or both.
Excluding automobiles and gasoline, retail sales fell 0.2% following a 1.1% increase.

Eurostat said the economy of the 19 countries sharing the euro expanded by 0.4% quarter-on-quarter in the January-March period, the same as its initial estimate, after 0.2% growth in the last three months of 2018.
Year-on-year, the euro zone grew by 1.2% in the first quarter, also as previously estimated, the same rate as at the end of last year.
The quarterly acceleration was mainly thanks to Germany, which rebounded to 0.4% growth from zero growth in the previous three months. 

Italy also helped as it rallied from a technical recession of two consecutive quarters, when its economy contracted each time by 0.1%. It expanded by 0.2% in the first quarter of 2019.

BEIJING (Reuters) - China reported surprisingly weaker growth in retail sales and industrial output for April on Wednesday, adding pressure on Beijing to roll out more stimulus as the trade war with the United States escalates. 
Clothing sales fell for the first time since 2009, suggesting Chinese consumers were growing more worried about the economy even before a U.S. tariff hike on Friday heightened stress on the country's struggling exporters.
Overall retail sales in April rose 7.2% from a year earlier, the slowest pace since May 2003, data from the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) showed. That undershot March's 8.7% and forecasts of 8.6%.
The data suggested consumers were now beginning to cut back spending on everyday products such as personal care and cosmetics, while continuing to shun more expensive items such as cars. 
""Weak retail sales partially stemmed from a deterioration in employment and declining income of the middle-and-low income groups,"" said Nie Wen, an economist at Hwabao Trust. 
""In terms of future policies to keep consumption as the stabilizer of the economy, China might roll out targeted tax cuts or subsidies to the middle-and-low income groups.""
As a whole, Chinese data for April largely pointed to a loss of momentum, after surprisingly upbeat March readings had raised hopes the economy was slowly getting back onto firmer footing and would require less policy support. 
Growth in industrial output slowed more than expected to 5.4% in April on-year, pulling back from a 4-1/2-year high of 8.5% in March, which some analysts had suspected was boosted by seasonal and temporary factors. 
Analysts polled by Reuters had forecast output would grow 6.5%. 
Motor vehicle production dropped nearly 16% as demand weakened, with sedan output slumping 18.8%, the steepest decline since September 2015. Industry data this week showed auto sales fell 14.6% in April, the 10th consecutive month of decline. 
China's exports also unexpectedly shrank in April in the face of U.S. tariffs and weaker global demand, while new factory orders from at home and abroad remained sluggish.
""There are still uncertainties haunting the performance of the economy. Tensions between China and the U.S. have returned while concerns about insufficient demand worldwide are on the rise,"" Nie said. 
Nie said China may need a more comprehensive cut in banks' reserve requirements in June before a G20 summit where Presidents Donald Trump and Xi Jinping are expected to discuss trade.
""The funding gap in the market is relatively large,"" Nie said, adding that smaller, more targeted reductions in bank reserves may no longer be enough to spur stronger growth.
There is relatively big room for policies to support growth, Liu Aihua, a spokeswoman at the statistics bureau, told reporters at a briefing, adding that employment is expected to remain steady.
The April nationwide survey-based jobless rate improved to 5.0% from 5.2% in March, though analysts are generally skeptical of Chinese employment data and see a rise in layoffs if export conditions deteriorate. 
INVESTMENT
Adding to worries about domestic demand, Wednesday's data also showed an unexpected stumble in investment. 
Fixed-asset investment growth slowed to 6.1% in the first four months of this year, dashing expectations for a slight rise to 6.4%.
Growth in infrastructure spending held steady at 4.4%, with a sharp slowdown in cement production possibly reflecting a slower-than-expected payoff from Beijing's efforts to fast-track road and rail projects.
China is trying to engineer a construction boom even as it steps up efforts to ease strains on smaller companies, ranging from tax cuts to financial incentives for firms which do not shed staff.
But private sector fixed-asset investment slowed sharply to 5.5% growth from 6.4%, suggesting the sector continues to face difficulties. The private sector accounts for the majority of jobs in China and about 60% of overall investment.
One of the few bright spots in the data was property investment, a key growth driver.
Real estate investment in April rose 12% from a year earlier, unchanged from March, according to Reuters calculations. But demand for new homes remained weak, weighing on sales of appliances and furniture.
TRADE TENSIONS
Washington dramatically escalated its 10-month tariff war with Beijing on Friday by raising levies on $200 billion of Chinese goods in the midst of trade talks, and Trump has threatened new levies on all remaining U.S. imports from China, sending global financial markets into a tailspin.
China retaliated on Monday, though on a smaller scale.
The two sides appear deadlocked in negotiations. But Trump softened his tone on Tuesday, insisting that talks between the world's two largest economies had not collapsed. 
Economists at Citi estimate the U.S. tariff increase could lop 50 basis points off China's GDP growth, reduce exports by 2.7% and cost the country another 2.1 million jobs, though they are optimistic a trade deal will be reached eventually. 
Analysts at BofA Merrill Lynch believe a prolonged period of brinkmanship would drag China's growth to 6.1% this year, from a near 30-year low of 6.6% in 2018.
They expect more policy easing in the short term, further cuts in banks' reserve requirements and another surge in bank lending, as well as consumer subsidies to boost sales of products such as cars, appliances and smartphones.
Some companies such as BMW have already lowered their prices after China cut the value-added tax (VAT) from April 1. 
""We have full confidence in China's economic prospects,"" Geng Shuang, spokesman at the Chinese foreign ministry, said at a daily news briefing. 

""U.S. protectionist and bullying actions will have some influences on the Chinese economy, but they can be completely overcome. If some people are not willing to do business with China, others will naturally fill this gap.""

1275,By Reuters,"<span>May 15, 2019 04:02AM ET</span>",'First ray of hope' as German economy returns to growth,"By Michael Nienaber and Rene Wagner
BERLIN (Reuters) - The German economy returned to growth in the first quarter as householders spent more freely and construction activity picked up, but the government cautioned that the outlook remained clouded by trade disputes.
Gross domestic product (GDP) rose 0.4% quarter-on-quarter, Wednesday's Federal Statistics Office data showed. Year on year it grew a calendar-adjusted 0.7%. Both preliminary readings were in line with market expectations.
Economy Minister Peter Altmaier told Reuters the figures offered a ""first ray of hope"" following two quarters without expansion, but it was too early to give the all-clear.
""The international trade disputes are still unresolved. We must do everything possible to find acceptable solutions that enable free trade,"" Altmaier said.
The U.S. and China have ramped up their trade conflict, with Beijing this week announcing new tariffs against U.S. imports after Washington ramped up levies on Chinese imports. Both countries are important markets for German exporters, meaning the tariffs are hurting their businesses too.
U.S. President Donald Trump may also this week increase tariffs on European car imports, which would have a disproportionate impact on Germany.
Altmaier, a confidant of conservative Chancellor Angela Merkel, repeated a call to support companies by cutting red tape and taxes. Finance Minister Olaf Scholz, a Social Democrat, has declined to cut corporate taxes.
The Statistic Office said growth was mainly driven by construction and increased household spending. Corporate investments in machinery and equipment also helped, while state spending was slightly negative.
MIXED SIGNALS
""The trade development sent mixed signals as exports and imports both picked up on the quarter,"" the office said, leaving open the question whether net trade had a positive impact on GDP.
The Office will publish more detailed growth data next week which should shed more light on which sectors of the economy contributed to growth and to what extent.
It confirmed that the German economy contracted by 0.2% in the third quarter of last year and stagnated in the fourth.
Headwinds from abroad suggest any growth rebound this year is likely to be modest.
""In normal times, today's growth figures would be reason enough to revise up GDP projections,"" DekaBank analyst Andreas Scheuerle. ""But in light of the massive threats for world trade, economists are likely to keep their powder dry.""
German exporters are also struggling with weaker foreign demand and uncertainty caused by Britain's chaotic departure from the European Union.
The government halved its 2019 growth forecast to 0.5% last month. That would mark a sharp slowdown after expansion rates of 2.2% in 2017 and 1.4% in 2018.

ING economist Carsten Brzeski said the growth figures should be no reason for complacency. ""In fact, the economy still needs more investment, both from the private and public sectors, as well as new structural reforms,"" Brzeski said.

Growth in the country’s industrial output slowed to 5.4% in April from a four-and-a-half year high in March, data showed. Analysts previously expected industrial output to grow 6.5%.
Retail sales rose 7.2% in April on-year, missed a forecast rise of 8.6% and undershot March's 8.7%. This month’s growth was the slowest pace since May 2003.
""Weak retail sales partially stemmed from a deterioration in employment and declining income of the middle-and-low income groups,"" said Nie Wen, an economist at Hwabao Trust, in a Reuters report.

At the same time, data from the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) showed fixed-asset investment rose 6.1% in January-April from the same period last year, also lagging expectations.
Private-sector fixed-asset investment, which accounts for about 60% of overall investment in China, rose 5.5% in the same period.

China retaliated on Monday, though on a smaller scale.
Market sentiment recovered somewhat overnight after Trump said it would become apparent “in about three or four weeks” whether trade talks with China were successful. “You never really know, right?” Trump said. “But I have a feeling it’s going to be very successful."""
1277,By Reuters,"<span>May 14, 2019 06:06PM ET</span>",U.S. import prices rise; underlying imported inflation weak,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. import prices rose less than expected in April as increases in the cost of petroleum and food were tempered by the largest decrease in the price of capital goods in 10 years, suggesting inflation could remain tame for a while.
The report from the Labor Department on Tuesday came on the heels of data last week that showed moderate producer and consumer price gains in April, which underscored the Federal Reserve's projection of no more interest rate hikes this year.
Economists said while inflation was not too low for the U.S. central bank to cut rates this year, the Trump administration's escalating trade war with China, if it starts to impact economic and job growth, could force the Fed's hand. 
The U.S. central bank early this month kept rates unchanged and signaled little inclination to adjust monetary policy anytime soon. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said he believed the weak inflation readings ""may wind up being transient.""
""There is little reason for the Fed to do anything and the assumption would normally be that they would stand pat,"" said Joel Naroff, chief economist at Naroff Economic Advisors in Holland, Pennsylvania. ""But this is not a normal world where economics is the driving force for monetary or fiscal policy.""
Import prices increased 0.2% last month after an unrevised 0.6% increase in March. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast import prices would climb 0.7% in April. 
In the 12 months through April, import prices fell 0.2% after edging up 0.1% in March.
The dollar was trading slightly higher against a basket of currencies, while U.S. Treasury prices were trading mostly lower. Stocks on Wall Street rebounded after recent steep declines.
EYES ON TARIFFS 
Inflation could get a boost from last week's move by President Donald Trump to raise tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods to 25% from 10%. Economists estimate the latest duties could add as much as two-tenths of a percentage point to inflation. That will most likely show in consumer prices as import prices exclude duties.
""If all of the tariffs are passed through to the consumer, it would boost year-over-year growth in the core CPI by four-tenths of a percentage point,"" said Ryan Sweet, a senior economist at Moody's Analytics in West Chester, Pennsylvania.
""Odds are that the impact will be smaller, as some U.S. businesses will eat the cost or risk losing sales. Therefore, we expect the boost to inflation will be closer to two-tenths of a percentage point."" 
In April, prices for imported fuels and lubricants rose 2.5% after surging 6.9% percent in the prior month. Prices for imported petroleum jumped 6.1% percent after rising 5.3% in March. Imported food prices rebounded 2.8% last month, the largest increase since July 2016, after falling 0.2% in March.
The cost of imported capital goods dropped 0.4% last month, the biggest fall since March 2009. Prices for imported consumer goods excluding automobiles decreased 0.3% in April, after declining by the same margin in March.
Excluding fuels and food, import prices dropped 0.3% in April after falling 0.2% in the prior month. The so-called core import prices decreased 1.1% in the 12 months through April.
Though the dollar has weakened a bit this year, its gains last year against the currencies of the United States' main trading partners continue to depress core import prices.
Chinese import prices fell 0.2% last month after being unchanged in March. They dropped 1.1% on a year-on-year basis, the largest decline since May 2017. The cost of goods imported from Japan slipped 0.1% percent. Prices of Canadian imports, however, surged 1.3 percent, driven by higher fuel prices.
The report also showed export prices rose 0.2% in April after increasing 0.6% in March. A 1.5% decrease in prices of agricultural exports was offset by a 0.4% rise in prices of nonagricultural goods. Agricultural export prices were weighed down by a 17.2% plunge in vegetable prices.
Export prices rose 0.3% on a year-on-year basis in April, driven by weak prices for soybeans, corn, cotton, fruit, nuts and meat. They increased 0.6% in March. 

""The farmers, who will be bashed once again by retaliatory tariffs, are already suffering from declining prices,"" Naroff said.

Eurostat said output in the 19 countries sharing the euro dropped by 0.3% on the month, in line with market expectations, and by 0.6% year-on-year.
The monthly fall in March followed a 0.1% decrease of the industrial production in February, which Eurostat revised upward from its previously estimate of a 0.2% drop. 
The first quarter of the year, however, remained positive thanks to the 2.0% hike posted in January.
Output was driven down mostly by a 1.0% drop in non-durable consumer goods, such as food or toothpaste, as retail sales came to a halt in the bloc in March. 
In a positive sign, production of durable consumer goods, such as cars or fridges, went up by 0.7% on the month, signaling managers' expectations of a rebound in sales of more expensive items.
Germany's first positive month in the year was not enough to offset marked falls of output in France and Italy, the bloc's second and third largest economies, resulting in an overall negative reading for the euro zone.
The largest economy of the currency bloc, Germany, posted a 0.4% hike, Eurostat said, after two consecutive monthly falls. 

But production declined by 1.0% in France and by 0.9% in Italy. The falls followed increases in the two previous months in both countries.

1279,By Bloomberg,"<span>May 14, 2019 12:30AM ET</span>",Australian Employment Gauge Slumps in Potential Rate-Cut Signal,"(Bloomberg) -- A gauge of Australian employment slumped to the lowest level in more than three years, according to a closely watched survey of businesses sentiment, in a possible harbinger of interest-rate cuts ahead.
National Australia Bank Ltd.’s April employment index dropped to -1 in April from 6 in March, the weakest reading since January 2016. The Reserve Bank of Australia is using the ongoing strength of the labor market to resist easing, while acknowledging that rates would likely need to be lowered if unemployment failed to fall further.
“We will be watching future readings of the employment index to assess if this is a sustained signal,” Alan Oster, chief economist at NAB, said in Tuesday’s release. The level of the gauge suggests a slowdown from the pace in the second half of 2018 and early 2019 and “will likely mean that no further progress is made on reducing the unemployment rate.”
Australia’s labor market has been a standout over the past 2-1/2 years and the jobless rate has fallen to 5%, a level that was previously seen as close to full employment. While that is no longer the case, and the jobless rate would probably need to drop closer to 4% to spark faster wage growth and inflation, hiring has managed to remain strong even as the economy has decelerated.
Overall, the report showed business confidence edged up to 0 in April from -1, while conditions slipped to 3 from 7, giving up most of their March gains. The survey was conducted from April 18-30, meaning it covered the release of weak first-quarter inflation that prompted a number of economists to switch to forecasting rate cuts.
“We will continue to watch the employment index as well as the other forward-looking variables over coming months for further slowing,” Oster said. “In particular, the readings of labor market related variables will remain important as, for now, the interest rate outlook appears to hinge on continuing strength in the labor market.”
The economy probably added 15,000 jobs in April and unemployment held at 5 percent, economists predicted ahead of employment data due out Thursday.
Traders are pricing in a rate cut in the next three months with a strong chance of a follow up easing in the ensuing quarter.

1280,By Reuters,"<span>May 13, 2019 09:10AM ET</span>",India April inflation hits six-month high; keeps rate cut hopes alive,"By Aftab Ahmed
NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India's retail inflation rate hit a six-month high in April, due to bigger increases in food prices, but remained below the central bank's target for a ninth month, keeping hopes alive for a June cut in the key interest rate.
Annual retail inflation  in April was 2.92%, up from the provisional 2.86% in the previous month, but slightly below analyst forecasts, government data showed on Monday. 
A Reuters poll had predicted an April retail inflation rate of 2.97%.
The inflation rate has fallen sharply from a peak of more than 12% in November 2013, which Prime Minister Narendra Modi has touted while seeking a second term in general elections that began on April 11. Votes will be counted on May 23.
While low inflation is helping the economy, declining farm incomes and record high unemployment have hit consumer demand and economic growth. 
The economy likely grew an annual 6.5% in January-March, according to government estimates, slower than five-quarter low growth of 6.6% in October-December. 
This year, the monetary policy committee of Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has cut its benchmark repo rate  twice, reducing it to 6.0% and many economists expect another 25 basis point trim on June 6.
""A significant deceleration in inflation for clothing and footwear and miscellaneous components has reduced core inflation from 5.06% in March to 4.57% in April. This reflects severe demand slowdown,"" said Rupa Rege Nitsure, chief economist at L&T Financial Holdings.
She said the contraction of industrial output has opened up space for monetary easing in June. 
Figures released on Friday showed annual industrial output fell 0.1% in March compared with a 0.1% rise the previous month.
The central bank has lowered its retail inflation forecast to 3.8% by January-March 2020, but warned it could be higher if food and fuel prices rise abruptly, or if the fiscal deficit overshoots targets.
Economists said inflation could pick up in coming months as manufacturers' spare capacity was at its tightest in over seven years and any shortfall in June-September rains could trigger a spike in food prices. 
Retail food prices increased 1.10% in April from a year earlier, up from 0.30% in March.
Core consumer inflation, which strips out food and fuel prices, was estimated at 4.53%-4.57% in April, lower than March's 5.02%-5.08%, according to two analysts after seeing the inflation figures released on Monday.
Retail fuel prices could also increase after the elections as state-run oil companies have largely held back from passing on the rise in global crude prices to consumers during the campaign. India meets 80 percent of its fuel needs through imports.

Prices of crude oil, India's biggest import item, have gone up over 30% this year to around $71 a barrel. Retail petrol and diesel prices in Delhi this year have gone up about 6%.

Worries about the economy have grown as Japan's exports and factory output were hit by China's economic slowdown and the escalating U.S.-China trade friction, which had disrupted global supply chains.
The index of coincident economic indicators, which consists of a range of data including factory output, employment and retail sales, fell a preliminary 0.9 of a point in March from the previous month, the Cabinet Office said on Monday.
In its view on the index, the government described the economy as ""worsening"". That compared with its previous assessment for February when it described the economy at ""a turning point towards a downgrade"".
The index for leading economic indicators is compiled using data such as job offers and consumer sentiment and is seen as a forward-looking gauge of the economy. It slipped 0.8 of a point from February.
Clouding the outlook are government plans to raise a sales tax to 10 percent from the current 8 percent in October unless a big shock on the scale of Lehman Brothers' collapse in 2008 hits the economy.
There is also speculation Prime Minister Shinzo Abe may postpone the sales tax hike as risks to demand grow, having already twice delayed it.
There are concerns the sales tax increase will damage private consumption as it did so when Japan raised the tax to 8 percent from 5 percent in 2014.
Japan releases gross domestic product (GDP) data on May 20, which will give a clearer read on the state of the economy and whether the government will proceed with the tax hike as scheduled. 

The economy likely contracted at an annualized 0.2 percent in January-March as corporate and consumer spending weakened, a Reuters poll showed.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. consumer prices rose moderately in April and underlying inflation remained muted, suggesting the Federal Reserve could keep interest rates unchanged for a while. 
The persistently benign inflation reported by the Labor Department on Friday could, however, increase White House pressure on the U.S. central bank to cut rates. President Donald Trump has repeatedly criticized the Fed for tightening monetary policy, arguing that inflation was low. 
""Great Consumer Price Index just out. Really good, very low inflation! We have a great chance to 'really rock!' Good numbers all around,"" Trump tweeted after the report.
The Fed last week kept interest rates unchanged and signaled little desire to adjust monetary policy anytime soon. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said he believed the weak inflation readings ""may wind up being transient."" 
The Consumer Price Index increased 0.3 percent last month, lifted by rising gasoline, rents and healthcare costs. The CPI gained 0.4 percent in March. It increased 2.0 percent in the 12 months through April after advancing 1.9 percent in March.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the CPI increasing 0.4 percent in April and rising 2.1 percent year-on-year.
Excluding the volatile food and energy components, the CPI edged up 0.1 percent as apparel prices dropped for a second straight month. The so-called core CPI has now increased by the same margin for three straight months. 
In the 12 months through April, the core CPI increased 2.1 percent after gaining 2.0 percent in March. 
The Fed, which has a 2 percent inflation target, tracks a different measure, the core personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index, for monetary policy. 
The core PCE price index increased 1.6 percent on a year-on-year basis in March, the smallest rise in 14 months, after advancing 1.7 percent in February. The April PCE price index data will be published later this month.
The dollar fell against a basket of currencies after the CPI data, while U.S. Treasuries extended gains.
In April, gasoline prices rose 5.7 percent, accounting for more than two-thirds of the increase in the CPI last month, after surging 6.5 percent in March.
Food prices dipped 0.1 percent in April, the first drop since June 2017, after gaining 0.3 percent in the prior month. Food consumed at home dropped 0.5 percent, the largest decline since March 2016. 
But consumers paid more for rent and healthcare. Owners' equivalent rent of primary residence, which is what a homeowner would pay to rent or receive from renting a home, increased 0.3 percent last month after rising by the same margin in March.
Healthcare costs increased 0.3 percent, matching March's gain. There were increases in the cost of prescription medication and doctor visits. But the cost of hospital services fell 0.5 percent. 
Apparel prices declined 0.8 percent last month. They plunged 1.9 percent in March, which was the biggest drop since January 1949, after the government introduced a new method and data to calculate apparel prices.
Prices for used motor vehicles and trucks fell 1.3 percent, decreasing for a third straight month. There were also declines in the cost of airline fares, alcoholic beverages and tobacco.

Prices for household furnishings fell for the first time in 10 months. The cost of new vehicles ticked up 0.1 percent after rising 0.4 percent in March.

BRASILIA (Reuters) - Annual consumer price inflation in Brazil rose to 4.9% in April, government statistics agency IBGE said on Friday, the highest in over two years and further above the central bank's end-year target of 4.25%.
It is the highest since January 2017, but policymakers may draw comfort from the fact that it didn't hit 5.00%, as was predicted in a Reuters poll of economists. The monthly rate of inflation eased and was also slower than expected.
Consumer prices were 0.57% higher in April from March, IBGE said, but below forecasts of 0.63% and down from 0.75% the month before.
Accumulated inflation in the first four months of the year was 2.09%, the highest for this particular period since 2016.
Prices were driven up by food and drink rising 0.63% on the month, transport climbing 0.94% and health and personal care goods increasing 1.51%, IBGE said. The only sector to register deflation in April was household goods, down 0.24%.
Among the notable increases, perfumes jumped 6.56% in April from March, airline tickets rose 5.32% and gasoline was up 2.66%, on average.
Brazil's central bank earlier this week left interest rates on hold at a record low 6.50%, opting to look past the current strength in inflation to highlight the general and broad-based weakness of the economy.
Policymakers have said they think inflation will peak around April or May and then drift back toward their 4.25% target by the end of the year.

The consumer price index rose 2.0% from a year ago, while core inflation, that excludes volatile food and energy costs, increased 2.1%.
The headline number rose less than expected on both a monthly and annual basis, although the annualized reading in core inflation was in line with consensus.
While U.S. futures and Treasury yields showed no reaction to the data, the U.S. dollar index ticked lower following the release, down 0.2% to 97.01 by 8:42 AM ET (12:42 GMT), compared to 97.13 ahead of the release.
The Fed has repeatedly cited sluggish inflation as a primary reason why it can hold off on hiking rates this year.
Inflation has remained stubbornly low despite better-than-expected economic growth and a strong labor market.
U.S. President Donald Trump has pressured the Fed to lower interest rates by up to 100 basis points and to resume 'quantitative easing' in order to spur economic growth, He had criticized both QE and the Fed's low interest-rate policy before becoming President.
Vice President Mike Pence took up the call to lower rates after last week’s jobs report.
“We just don't see any inflation in this economy at all,” he told CNBC in an interview last Friday.
Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said after the central bank's last policy meeting that there was no compelling reason for interest rates to move either higher or lower in the near term.
Since the Fed’s preferred inflation measure, the core personal consumption expenditure (PCE) price index, sank to 1.6% in March, the chorus of policymakers has suggested that it was due to “transitory” factors, including a 30% drop in wholesale gasoline prices between September and December last year. That has largely reversed in the meantime."

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's economy got a sharp one-off boost in the first three months of 2019, official figures showed on Friday, as manufacturers rushed to deliver orders before a Brexit that never came.
Gross domestic product grew at a quarterly rate of 0.5% in the first quarter of 2019 after a sluggish 0.2% in late 2018, in line with expectations from the Bank of England as well as the consensus forecast in a Reuters poll of economists.
Year-on-year GDP growth picked up to an 18-month high of 1.8% in early 2019, up from 1.4% in the last three months of 2018, Britain's Office for National Statistics said.
Sterling was little changed by the figures, which showed household spending continued to fuel the economy as businesses grappled with Brexit uncertainty.
""The relatively strong growth figures for Q1 may just be a flash in the pan,"" said Tej Parikh, an economist at the Institute of Directors.
""Some businesses brought activity forward early this year in preparation for leaving the EU, so higher stocks and earlier orders have artificially bumped up the growth numbers.""
In the event, with just days to go before Britain was due to leave, Prime Minister Theresa May asked the EU for more time to negotiate a deal. Brexit has now been delayed until Oct. 31 unless there is an early agreement.
Finance minister Philip Hammond said the data showed the economy remained robust. 
The ONS said factories rushed to complete orders ahead of the original March 29 Brexit deadline, spurring a 2.2% jump in output in the first quarter and marking the sector's biggest contribution to overall economic growth in nearly 20 years.
Previous private-sector business surveys had shown manufacturers reported building up stocks of goods in case the country left without a transition deal, which they feared could cause chaos at Britain's borders.
The ONS data showed businesses bought an extra 4.6 billion pounds ($6.0 billion) worth of stocks in the first quarter, the biggest increase since late 2016, which statisticians said added 0.7 percentage points to the first-quarter growth rate.
However, some sectors - such as car dealers, wholesalers and warehouses reported relatively little stockpiling.
Net trade took a record 2.2% off the quarterly rate of GDP growth and Britain's first-quarter trade deficit hit a record high 18.3 billion pounds, although the severity of the drag reflected imports of gold and vehicles which often cause big swings in the data. 
Last week BoE Governor Mark Carney said he expected growth to fall back to 0.2% during the current quarter as the one-off boost from stock-building faded and businesses continued to hold off from investment as economic uncertainty lingers.
However, Friday's ONS data unexpectedly showed a return to growth for business investment in the first three months of the year, after contracting for every quarter of 2018. 
Britain's economy has slowed since June 2016's vote to leave the EU, with annual growth rates dropping from more than 2% before the referendum to expand by 1.4% last year. 
The euro zone's economy expanded by 0.4% in the three months to March, rebounding from a patch of sluggish growth in the second half of 2018 caused by global trade tensions and regulatory problems for the auto industry.
In March alone, Britain's economy unexpectedly contracted by 0.1%, pulled down by a dip in construction and weakness in the services sector that accounts for most economic output, versus expectations for an unchanged reading in a Reuters poll.

1287,By Reuters,"<span>May 10, 2019 03:10AM ET</span>",German exports rebound unexpectedly in March,"BERLIN (Reuters) - German exports rose unexpectedly in March, data showed on Friday, raising hopes that a slowdown in Europe's largest economy will not significantly dent growth in the first quarter despite headwinds from trade disputes.
The Federal Statistics Office said seasonally adjusted exports rose by 1.5 percent on the month while imports were up 0.4 percent. That meant the trade surplus edged up to 20.0 billion euros ($22.45 billion) in March from 18.7 billion euros the previous month.
A Reuters poll of economists had pointed to a 0.3 percent decrease in exports and a 0.5 increase in imports. The trade surplus was expected to narrow to 18.2 billion euros.
The government has slashed its 2019 growth forecast to 0.5 percent.
Trade disputes between the United States and both China and the European Union, a slowing world economy and uncertainties linked to Britain's planned departure from the EU are leaving their mark on Germany's export-dependent manufacturers.
The sharp slowdown has also been linked to domestic factors such as problems in the car industry, where companies are struggling to adjust to stricter emission rules.
The economy has been sending mixed signals.
Data published this week showed exports had risen less than expected in March after two months of steep declines.
Industrial output unexpectedly increased in March but the economy ministry said the outlook remained subdued.

The slowdown has prompted the government to revise down its tax revenue estimates.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's household spending rose more than expected in March but real wages tumbled the most in nearly four years, dashing hopes consumer sector activity may soften the blow from external factors such as global trade conflicts.
The data add to recent weak signs in the export-reliant economy, which has been hit by slumping shipments to China and soft factory output, and cast doubt on the Bank of Japan's view that growth will rebound in the second half of this year.
Fading recovery prospects were among key topics of debate at the BOJ's rate review in April, with one board member warning that a scheduled sales tax hike in October and soft global demand could push the country into recession, a summary of the meeting showed on Friday.
""Given the current level of the unemployment rate, wages should be growing by around 1 percent and we expect a rebound in working hours to provide a tailwind over coming months,"" said Marcel Thieliant, senior Japan economist at Capital Economics.
""But as economic activity remains weak and the labor market slackens, we expect wage growth to keep falling short of last year's strong gains.""
Household spending gained 2.1 percent from a year earlier, government data showed on Friday, rising for the fourth straight month and beating market forecasts for a 1.7 percent increase.
But separate data showed inflation-adjusted real wages fell 2.5 percent in March from a year earlier, the biggest decline since 2015, casting doubt about the resilience of consumption.
The data underlines the challenge policymakers face in breaking Japan's sticky deflationary mindset, which discourages firms from raising prices for fear of scaring away households who have become accustomed to tepid price and wage growth.
Tensions between Washington and Beijing have risen after a major setback in negotiations this week, dashing the BOJ's hopes that apparent progress in the negotiations in recent months would help global growth rebound in the second half of this year.
The modest rise in household spending, however, may help Japan's economy avert a contraction in January-March. The gross domestic product (GDP) data is due for release on May 20.
Some analysts have said a weak GDP data could heighten calls from politicians for Prime Minister Shinzo Abe to put off a twice-delayed increase in the sales tax rate to 10 percent from 8 percent in October.
""There's a chance the economy may see flat or slightly positive growth thanks to stronger-than-expected household spending,"" said Hiroaki Mutou, chief economist at Tokai Tokyo Research Institute.
""I don't think the government will postpone the sales tax hike if the economy shows a small growth, or even a slight contraction,"" he said.

Abe and his ministers have consistently said they will proceed with the tax hike unless the economy is hit by a shock of the scale of the collapse of Lehman Brothers in 2008.

Real wages fell 2.5 percent in March year-on-year, the biggest decline since June 2015, labor ministry data showed on Friday. It followed a revised 1.0 percent drop in February.
Monthly wage data showed nominal total cash earnings in March fell 1.9 percent from a year earlier, following a revised 0.7 percent annual decrease in February. It was the sharpest decline since June 2015.
A labor ministry official said the big drops from a year earlier might have been caused in part by sampling changes. 
Revelations earlier this year that labor ministry officials used faulty polling methods that caused revisions cast doubts on wage data issued by the ministry from 2004 to 2017.
Regular pay, which accounts for the bulk of monthly wages, dropped an annual 0.9 percent in March after a 0.1 percent decline in February, the fastest drop since December 2013.
One-off special payments fell 12.5 percent in the year to March, after a 31.6 percent year-on-year plunge in February.
Overtime pay, a barometer of strength in corporate activity, declined 3.1 percent in March from a year earlier, reflecting efforts to curb overtime in line with the government's campaign to limit long working hours.
The labor ministry said in January it used faulty polling methods in compiling monthly wage data - which covers about 33,000 firms - and had failed to accurately depict the actual strength of wage growth.

The error has made it harder to gauge the trend for wages.

1290,By Reuters,"<span>May 09, 2019 02:58PM ET</span>",U.S. goods trade deficit with China tumbles to five-year low,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. goods trade deficit with China, a focus of the White House's ""America First"" agenda, shrank to its smallest in five years in March, which could embolden President Donald Trump as he escalates his trade war on Beijing.
The report from the Commerce Department on Thursday came as the United States and China began two days of make-or-break talks to salvage a faltering trade deal. 
Trump said on Thursday he would start paperwork to launch tariffs on a new $325 billion category of Chinese imports previously untouched by the trade feud. This is in addition to an expected increase of duties on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods to 25 percent from 10 percent on Friday. China has promised to retaliate if the tariffs are imposed. 
""This (narrowing deficit) could allow President Trump to assert that the tariffs in place are having the intended effect as negotiations between the U.S. and China intensify today in Washington,"" said Scott Anderson, chief economist at Bank of the West in San Francisco.
The politically sensitive goods trade deficit with China decreased 16.2 percent to a seasonally unadjusted $20.7 billion, the lowest level since March 2014, as exports, including soybeans, surged 23.6 percent. Imports from the world's No. 2 economy fell 6.1 percent. 
Washington last year imposed tariffs on $250 billion worth of goods imported from China, with Beijing hitting back with duties on $110 billion worth of American products. China initially targeted U.S. soybean exports, but later committed to buy more of the crop as trade negotiations proceeded.
China is the world's biggest buyer of soybeans. Economists said the latest flare-up of trade tensions could undercut soybean exports, which rose by $0.5 billion in March.
""In the near-term, trade frictions might arrest the recent ramp-up of soybean exports from the U.S. to China,"" said Andrew Hollenhorst, an economist at  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) in New York. ""This would be in addition to some expected softer demand from China as African swine fever has reduced feed requirements.""
The overall trade deficit increased 1.5 percent to $50.0 billion in March. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the trade shortfall widening to $50.2 billion that month. The goods trade deficit increased 0.7 percent to $72.4 billion in March. 
The trade data have been volatile in recent months, with big swings between exports and imports because of Washington's conflicts with trading partners, including the European Union, Mexico and Canada. The goods trade deficit with Mexico hit a record high of $9.5 billion in March.
When adjusted for inflation, the overall goods trade deficit increased $0.5 billion to $82.1 billion in March.
The dollar was trading lower against a basket of currencies as investors cautiously watched the trade talks in Washington, while U.S. Treasury prices rose. Stocks on Wall Street fell.
MODERATE INFLATION 
The government reported last month that trade contributed 1.03 percentage points to the economy's 3.2 percent annualized growth pace in the first quarter. While another report on Thursday from the Commerce Department showed wholesale inventories were weaker than initially thought in March, data for February was revised higher. 
As a result, economists expect the advance GDP growth estimate could be trimmed to about a 3.1 percent pace when the government publishes its revision later this month. They had previously expected first-quarter GDP growth would be lowered to around a 2.9 percent pace.
While the economy continued to expand early in the second quarter, there are signs the labor market could be slowing after April's hefty employment gains. Underlying inflation also appears to be firming, which bolsters Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell's views that recent weak inflation readings ""may wind up being transient.""
The Fed last week kept interest rates unchanged and signaled little desire to adjust monetary policy anytime soon. Initial claims for state unemployment benefits decreased 2,000 to a seasonally adjusted 228,000 for the week ended May 4, the Labor Department said in other data on Thursday.
The producer price index for final demand increased 0.2 percent last month after jumping 0.6 percent in March. A key gauge of underlying producer price pressures that excludes food, energy and trade services increased 0.4 percent last month, the largest rise since January 2018, after being unchanged in March.
""The data support the Fed chairman's argument that some of the recent slowing in core PCE inflation was due to transitory factors,"" said Jim O'Sullivan, chief U.S. economist at High Frequency Economics in White Plains, New York, referring to the Fed's preferred inflation measure. ""That said, underlying trends are not showing significant strengthening or weakening.""
The rise in the overall trade deficit in March came as both exports and imports increased. Goods exports rose 1.4 percent to $141.7 billion. They were driven by shipments of industrial supplies and materials, as well as soybeans.
But shipments of civilian aircraft fell and further declines are likely after Boeing (NYSE:BA) suspended deliveries of its troubled 737 MAX aircraft. The MAX planes have been grounded indefinitely following two deadly crashes.

Goods imports rose 1.2 percent to $214.1 billion in March. There were increases in imports of crude oil. Food imports hit an all-time high of $13.1 billion. Consumer goods imports, however, fell amid declines of cellphones and other household goods.

But relatively weak advance wholesale and retail inventory data for March has led economists to expect the initial GDP growth estimate would be trimmed to just below a 3.0 percent rate when the government publishes its revision later this month. 
In March, goods exports increased 1.4 to $141.7 billion. There were increases in exports of industrial supplies and materials, and soybeans. 
But shipments of civilian aircraft fell $0.7 billion in March. Commercial aircraft exports are likely to decline further after Boeing (NYSE:BA) suspended deliveries of its troubled 737 MAX aircraft. The MAX planes have been grounded indefinitely following two deadly crashes.

Economists polled by Reuters had forecast claims falling to 220,000 in the latest week. The Labor Department said claims for Indiana were estimated last week. Claims have been volatile in recent weeks because of the different timings of the Easter and Passover holidays as well as school spring breaks.
Still, last week's smaller-than-expected drop could be pointing to some slowdown in the labor market. The four-week moving average of initial claims, considered a better measure of labor market trends as it irons out week-to-week volatility, increased 7,750 to 220,250 last week.
The economy created 263,000 jobs in April and the unemployment rate dropped to a near 49-1/2-year low of 3.6 percent, the government reported last week.

FAO","ROME (Reuters) - World food prices rose some 1.5 percent in April, with a jump in dairy and meat prices helping offset a fall in cereal quotations, the United Nations food agency said on Thursday.
The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) also issued its first forecast for global cereal production this year, seeing a record output for 2019 following a decline in 2018.
FAO's food price index, which measures monthly changes for a basket of cereals, oilseeds, dairy products, meat and sugar, averaged 170.1 points last month against an upwardly revised 167.5 points in March.
The March figure was previously given as 167.0.
The index in April was at its highest level since last June, but still some 2.3 percent below its level of one year ago.
The FAO dairy price index jumped 5.2 percent from March's value, its fourth successive monthly rise, driven by strong import demand for butter, whole milk powder and cheese. 
The meat price index rose 3.0 percent month-on-month, pushed higher in part by a rise in pig meat quotations following a surge in import demand in Asia, notably China, where the rapid spread of African Swine Fever has impacted the local market.
The sugar and vegetable oil indices also rose, but the cereal index fell 2.8 percent last month -- its fourth consecutive decline, with wheat leading the way down as prospects for a strong 2019 production hit prices. 
FAO said the cereals index in general was pressured by ""large export availabilities and slowing trade"". 
In its first forecast for 2019, FAO predicted world cereal production would come in at a record 2.722 billion tonnes this year, up 2.7 percent on 2018 levels, when output declined.
""Among the major cereals, wheat, maize and barley would account for most of the rise in cereal production, with projected year-on-year increases of 5.0 percent, 2.3 percent and 5.4 percent, respectively,"" FAO said.
Global rice production was seen largely stable. 
FAO said global food consumption of cereals was set to rise by at least 1.1 percent this year, due to the growing world population, with world cereal utilization seen rising 1.5 percent in 2019/20.

This meant that world cereal stocks are likely to be drawn down by 0.7 percent to 847 million tonnes -- the lowest volume since 2015/16.

The official consumer price index rose 2.5% year-on-year in April, according to the National Bureau of Statistics, its highest reading since October. The number was in line with expectations and slightly higher than March’s 2.3%.
Pork prices, which are heavily weighted in the gauge’s basket of goods, rose 14.4% year-on-year and 1.6% month-on-month. China's hog herd has been hit by African swine fever in recent months.
“We estimate that pork prices could be on an uptrend till at least Q4 or even year-end, and may rise as much as 30% year on year. As a result, both food inflation and headline CPI inflation may continue to head higher in the near term,” Jingyang Chen, economist with HSBC, said in a Financial Times report.
Overall, food consumer price inflation rose 6.1% from a year ago in April compared to a 4.1% rise a month earlier, data from the bureau showed.
April non-food inflation was 1.7%.
Meanwhile, producer price inflation - a gauge of industrial profitability - rose 0.9% from a year ago in April, the fastest pace since December 2018."

BEIJING (Reuters) - China's factory-gate inflation in April quickened at its fastest pace in four months, buoyed by higher commodity prices and a sign demand may be starting to perk up as Beijing rolls out more stimulus.
Consumer inflation also accelerated, jumping to the highest pace in six months, official data showed on Thursday, as pork price remained elevated due to supply issues from a growing swine fever epidemic.
China's producer price index (PPI) in April rose 0.9 percent from a year earlier, the quickest pace since December, driven largely by rapid rises in oil and gas prices, and advancing from a 0.4 percent increase in March, the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) said. Analysts polled by Reuters had expected factory gate inflation would nudge up to 0.6 percent in April.
Analysts and investors are closely watching inflation gauges in China to see whether there has been real improvement in underlying demand, which would support industrial profits and investment.
The pick-up in producer inflation suggests the world's second-largest economy may slowly be responding to support, as authorities seek to head off external risks such as trade tensions with the United States, which unexpectedly escalated this week.
However, some analysts remain concerned about the true state of the demand factors driving China's economy.
""Looking ahead, higher food inflation will probably continue to push up CPI (consumer price index) in the coming months,"" Capital Economics Senior China Economist Julian Evans-Pritchard said. ""But with economic growth unlikely to stage a strong recovery and industrial commodity prices likely to drop back before long, we don’t anticipate much upside to PPI and non-food CPI.""
Most of the PPI gain was driven by ferrous metal ore mining, with prices rising 10.6 percent on-year, up from 5.8 percent in March. 
To arrest a sharper slowdown of the economy, Beijing has fast-tracked big-ticket infrastructure projects, which are pushing up prices of construction materials.
China's iron ore futures posted their fifth straight monthly gain for April while construction steel marked its best month since July 2018, fueled by hopes that demand will remain firm as construction activities typically pick up in May and June when the weather is usually favorable.
Imports of copper, widely used in construction and manufacturing, also rose in April from March.
On a monthly basis, producer prices inched up 0.3 percent, for the second consecutive month after a marginal step-up in March. 
Stronger factory-gate price rises have bolstered profits for industrial firms, which saw earnings rebound from four months of contraction in March.
China's economy posted surprisingly strong data in March, stoking debate over how much more stimulus China needs to generate a sustainable recovery, however, initial April readings have been more subdued.
HIGHER FOOD PRICES
The consumer price index (CPI) in April rose 2.5 percent from a year earlier, a six-month high, fueled by higher pork prices as the spread of African swine fever prompts farmers to cull their herds.
That was more than a 2.3 percent increase in March and in line with market expectations.
On a month-on-month basis, CPI rose 0.1 percent, compared with a 0.4 percent drop the preceding month.
The food price index in April rose 6.1 percent from a year earlier, marking the fastest pace in April 2016, and much higher than March's reading of 4.1 percent.
Pork prices rose 14.4 percent in April from a year earlier, rising for the second consecutive month following a more than two-year declining streak, and contributed to about 0.31 percentage points of CPI gains for the month, the NBS said in a statement.
Chinese pork prices are expected to jump 70 percent in the second half of the year, the country's agriculture ministry said last month, after the swine fever outbreak.

1300,By Reuters,"<span>May 08, 2019 08:10PM ET</span>","UK labor market strength fades fast in April, recruiters say","LONDON (Reuters) - British companies' demand for staff rose at the slowest rate since 2012 last month, according to a survey on Thursday that suggested the labor market, a bright spot in the economy ahead of Brexit, might be losing its shine.
The monthly index of staff demand from the Recruitment and Employment Confederation (REC) and accountants KPMG fell to 53.6 from 55.5 in March, its lowest level since August 2012.
The survey also showed slower pay growth, something the Bank of England said last week it had seen signs of recently.
Starting salaries for new permanent staff rose by the smallest amount in two years, though pay growth for temporary workers improved slightly.
Business confidence fell in Britain in the run-up to the original Brexit date of March 29, and growth in much of the rest of the world has weakened. 
However, job creation roared ahead in the three months to February, pushing the unemployment rate down to its lowest since 1975 at 3.9 percent.
While the Bank of England last week predicted the unemployment rate would fall a little further, Thursday's REC survey suggests the labor market is slowing.
""This report shows how the UK jobs market has seized up, with both employers and candidates waiting to see which direction Brexit is going to go in,"" said James Stewart, vice chair of accountants KPMG, who sponsor the survey.

Other business surveys have also pointed to weakening hiring intentions among British companies.

1302,By Reuters,"<span>May 08, 2019 02:31AM ET</span>",China April exports unexpectedly fall but imports rebound as fresh U.S. tariffs loom,"By Yawen Chen and Kevin Yao
BEIJING (Reuters) - China's exports unexpectedly shrank in April but imports surprised with their first increase in five months, painting a mixed picture of the economy as Washington ratchets up pressure on Beijing with threats of more punishing tariffs. 
The latest trade data, which would normally be pored over for clues on how the world's second-largest economy is faring, has been overshadowed by worries that the U.S.-China trade war is escalating, rather than nearing a resolution as many investors had expected. 
High-level Chinese and U.S. negotiators will meet in Washington in the next two days, as Beijing tries to avoid a sharp increase in tariffs on its goods ordered by President Donald Trump to take effect from Friday.
Investors have been hoping that China's April trade data would add to signs that its economy is beginning to steady, easing worries about cooling global growth.
But exports fell 2.7 percent from a year earlier, customs data showed on Wednesday.
ANZ estimated more than 80 percent of the headline decline was due to a sharp drop in shipments to the United States, while its high-tech exports continued to be weighed down by sluggish global demand for smartphones and other electronic gadgets.
Economists polled by Reuters had expected growth to slow to 2.3 percent after March's surprising 14.2 percent jump, which some analysts suspected was inflated by seasonal factors and temporary business distortions related to a cut in the value-added tax (VAT) effective April 1.
""The outlook for Chinese exports is challenging. If Trump follows through on his latest tariff threats, we think this would drag down export growth by two to three percentage points,"" Capital Economics said in a note.
""Even if a last-minute deal is struck this week to avoid further tariffs, the downbeat prospects for global growth will probably mean that export growth remains subdued.""
POSITIVE IMPORT SURPRISE
Imports, however, beat expectations with a 4.0 percent rise year-on-year, much better than analysts' forecasts for a 3.6 percent fall and March's 7.6 percent drop.
The gain was the first since November, suggesting domestic demand is starting to perk up as Beijing rolls out more stimulus, such as higher spending on roads, railways and ports. Imports of copper, widely used in construction and manufacturing, rose from March, but were down on-year. 
China's major trading partners, big multinational suppliers like  Caterpillar  (NYSE:CAT) and global investors have been closely watching to see how long it will take support measures announced in recent months to take hold.
Tang Jianwei, a senior economist at Bank of Communications in Shanghai, said China stands to lose in either case.
""If there is a set-back in trade talks, both external demand and domestic demand could be hit. If the U.S. and China reach a trade deal, China will have to step up imports form the U.S., which will reduce its trade surplus, which will reduce net exports' contribution to GDP growth,"" he said.
China had an overall trade surplus of $13.84 billion in April, smaller than forecasts of $35 billion.
Its trade surplus with the United States, a major irritant for Washington, widened to $21.01 billion in April, from $20.5 billion in March. China's imports from the U.S. fell nearly 26 percent while exports to the U.S. fell just over 13 percent. 
TRADE TURNABOUT? 
Some analysts believe recent signs of improvement in both the Chinese and American economies may have hardened their negotiating positions on trade after months of progress made when the business outlook appeared much more shaky.
China posted surprisingly strong data for March, but initial April readings have been more subdued, suggesting the economy is still struggling for traction. 
Factory surveys for April suggested demand was improving at a much slower rate at home and abroad, adding to the debate over how much more stimulus China needs to generate a sustainable recovery, without risking a rapid jump in debt.
""Weak growth in Chinese exports to the U.S. will also be concerning to Chinese officials, particularly amid a potential escalation in the trade war,"" said Nick Marro, an analyst at The Economist Intelligence Unit.
""The data will add more urgency to the trade negotiations this week and could push China more forcefully towards an agreement, despite its past reluctance to negotiate under threat.""
Top U.S. trade officials said China had backtracked on substantial commitments it made earlier in trade talks. That prompted Trump to issue a new deadline of Friday to raise tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods to 25 percent from 10 percent. Trump also threatened new levies soon.
The swift deterioration in negotiations between the world's two largest economies has jolted global financial markets, which had been increasingly betting that a deal would be reached soon.
Major stock indexes in trade-reliant Asia continued to fall on Wednesday, tracking a slide on Wall Street.

""Today's exports data support our view that there is real risk of double dip in growth, and Beijing cannot afford to stop easing (policy) yet. With the rapid escalation of the trade conflict with the U.S., we believe Beijing will likely step up easing measures again,"" Nomura analysts wrote in a note.

1306,By Reuters,"<span>May 07, 2019 10:55PM ET</span>",New Zealand central bank cuts rates for first time since 2016,"By Charlotte Greenfield and Praveen Menon
WELLINGTON (Reuters) - New Zealand's central bank cut its benchmark interest rate for the first time in two-and-a-half years on Wednesday as it looks to support a cooling economy and counter global uncertainties, sending the country's currency to a six-month low.
The Reserve Bank of New Zealand cut the official cash rate (OCR) by 25 basis point to a record low of 1.5 percent, a move that followed its shift in March to an explicitly dovish footing.
""The Monetary Policy Committee decided a lower OCR is necessary to support the outlook for employment and inflation consistent with its policy remit,"" the RBNZ's monetary policy committee, said in a statement accompanying its rates decision. 
""Global economic growth has slowed since 2018, easing demand for New Zealand's goods and services.""
RBNZ projections show rates are expected to be steady for the rest of the year. Inflationary pressure is projected to rise only slowly, the central bank said.
The New Zealand dollar tumbled to a six-month low of $0.6525 from $0.6600 after the announcement.
The OCR had been unchanged since November 2016 and a small majority of economists in a Reuters poll had forecast the RBNZ would lower interest rates on Wednesday.
Expectations for the cut had grown in recent months, as New Zealand struggles with weak economic momentum, slowing global growth and inflation falling further below its target.
Softer global economic conditions had contributed to the bank's recent shift to a dovish tone, Orr told Reuters in an interview last month.
Other central banks in the region have also swung to accommodative footings.
In neighbouring Australia, the central bank held rates at all-time lows on Tuesday but signaled an easing in the future if the unemployment rate didn't fall, while Malaysia cut its key interest rate.
This was the first cash rate review by the RBNZ's newly-formed monetary policy committee, in a transfer of the decision-making power from the governor alone.
RBNZ said the committee reached a decision by consensus.
""Given this employment and inflation outlook, a lower OCR now is most consistent with achieving our objectives and provides a more balanced outlook for interest rates,"" the statement said.

New Zealand's labour figures last week showed tepid wage growth, and employment falling, while business sentiment has also remained gloomy, all adding to arguments for a rate cut.

The Markit/Nikkei Japan Services Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) edged lower to a seasonally adjusted 51.8 in April from 52.0 in March.
The index stayed above the 50 threshold that separates contraction from expansion for the 31th straight month.
""Domestic demand is holding up, currently supporting activity and keeping the year-ahead outlook well anchored,"" said Joe Hayes, economist at IHS Markit, which compiles the survey.
""Nevertheless, manufacturing woes continued, which have kept the composite PMI at a subdued level which is indicative of quarterly GDP growth of about 0.2 percent.""
The subindex measuring new business decreased to 52.8 from 53.8 in March. New export business also swung to contraction for the first time in three months.
The composite PMI, which includes both manufacturing and services, nudged higher to 50.8 from 50.4 in the previous month, because manufacturing activity expanded in April for the first time in three months as companies hired more workers and grew more optimistic about the business outlook.
The United States and China appear to be making progress in hammering out a deal to end the months-long trade dispute, but analysts caution it is unlikely to end Washington's more protectionist stance.
Japan is exposed to the dispute as it ships big volumes of electronics items and heavy machinery to China which are used to make finished goods destined for the United States.

Washington is also pressing Tokyo for a new trade deal to reduce its large trade deficit with Japan, and in particular is urging Japanese automakers to build more vehicles in the United States.

The British Retail Consortium (BRC) said shops sales failed to meet expectations in April despite recording an annual 4.1 percent jump which in part reflected the timing of the Easter holidays. That compared with a 0.5 percent decline in March.
Separate figures from payments company Barclaycard - which includes entertainment and travel as well as shopping - also showed consumers were more willing to spend last month, especially in bars and restaurants.
Consumer spending, along with stockpiling by manufacturers ahead of Brexit, has helped to support Britain's economy just as businesses, unnerved by uncertainty over the country's departure from the European Union, cut back on investment.
""Retail sales were below expectation this month as the sunshine over the Easter weekend persuaded many to pursue recreational, rather than retail, activities,"" BRC chief executive Helen Dickinson said.
Barclaycard said spending at pubs and restaurants increased 13 and 10 percent in annual terms respectively, contributing to a 2.5 percent rise in overall consumer spending last month.
By contrast, airline spending fell by 4.8 percent, the weakest performance for the category since Barclaycard started tracking it in 2015.
Barclaycard said the latest delay to the Brexit deadline until the end of October, combined with warmer weather, seemed to have boosted the mood of Britons - 33 percent of consumers felt confident about the economy, up from 26 percent in March.

But shoppers remained cautious - 61 percent said they expected no change to their spending plans for May and only one in 10 said they were likely to spend on big-ticket items due to the Brexit delay.

1310,By Reuters,"<span>May 07, 2019 01:24PM ET</span>","U.S. job openings surge, point to tightening labor market","By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. job openings rebounded sharply in March, while the pace of hiring was little changed, pointing to a growing worker shortage that could slow employment growth this year.
Despite the tightening labor market conditions, the report from the Labor Department on Tuesday also showed workers still reluctant to voluntarily quit their jobs in droves to seek opportunities elsewhere. The scarcity of workers poses a risk to the economy's growth prospects. The economy will mark 10 years of expansion in July, the longest in history.
""The risks right now for the economic outlook going forward is there is actually a danger that companies will run out of the help they need to produce goods or sell their services,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG in New York. 
""The U.S. economy has never faced a time when labor shortages might endanger or cut short a long economic expansion, but now it does."" 
Job openings, a measure of labor demand, surged by 346,000 to a seasonally adjusted 7.5 million, the Labor Department's monthly Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey, or JOLTS, showed. The job openings rate rose to 4.7 percent from 4.5 percent in February. 
Vacancies in the construction industry increased by 73,000 in March. There were 87,000 job openings in the transportation, warehousing and utilities sector, while real estate, rental and leasing companies had 57,000 unfilled position. Job openings in the federal government, however, decreased by 15,000 in March. 
HIRING LAGGING
Hiring was little changed at 5.7 million in March. The hiring rate was steady at 3.8 percent. The lag in hiring suggests employers are experiencing difficulties finding qualified workers, a trend that implies a slowdown in job growth later this year. 
There is growing anecdotal evidence of worker shortages, especially in the transportation, manufacturing and construction industries. The economy created 263,000 jobs in April, with the unemployment rate dropping two-tenths of a percentage point to 3.6 percent, the government reported last Friday.
Economists expect job growth to slow to about 150,000 per month this year, still well above the roughly 100,000 needed to keep pace with growth in the working age population. 
In March, there were 0.83 job seekers for every job opening. Job openings exceeded the number of unemployed by 1.3 million. Vacancies have outpaced the unemployed for 13 straight months.
The number of workers voluntarily quitting their jobs was little changed at 3.4 million in March, keeping the quits rate at 2.3 percent for a 10th straight month. 
The quits rate is viewed by policymakers and economists as a measure of job market confidence. The Federal Reserve last week kept interest rates unchanged and signaled little desire to adjust monetary policy anytime soon. 
""You have to hand it to the business community. Despite being on the wrong side of the tight labor market, firms are managing to keep from a major bidding war for workers and are still not losing workers to competitors,"" said Joel Naroff, chief economist at Naroff Economic Advisors in Holland, Pennsylvania.
Layoffs slipped in March, lowering the layoffs rate to 1.1 percent from 1.2 percent in the prior month. Layoffs fell in the government sector, but rose slightly in manufacturing and construction. The increase in manufacturing layoffs likely reflected redundancies in the automobile sector, which is experiencing slowing sales and an inventory overhang.

""Layoffs and discharges are extremely low, by historical standards, which reflects that employers need their workers and are prepared to make an effort to retain them,"" said Julia Pollak, labor economist at employment marketplace ZipRecruiter.

Minutes of the Swedish Riksbank’s latest meeting suggest policy makers weren’t quite as dovish as first thought after the bank last month delayed planned interest-rate increases.
The minutes, released on Tuesday, showed that a clear majority is still intent on tightening further, with two members hesitant toward supporting the lower interest rate path revealed last month. Deputy Governor Cecilia Skingsley pondered whether extending the bond purchased was really necessary.
The bank last month kept its benchmark rate at minus 0.25 percent after hiking in December for the first time in seven years.

1314,By Reuters,"<span>May 07, 2019 04:49AM ET</span>",Lackluster German industrial orders point to weak growth,"By Michael Nienaber
BERLIN (Reuters) - German industrial orders rose less than expected in March following two months of steep declines, data showed on Tuesday, bringing little relief for Europe's largest economy which is facing a sharp slowdown in growth and dwindling tax revenues.
German exporters have been hit by weaker demand from abroad, trade tensions triggered by U.S. President Donald Trump's ""America First"" policies and business uncertainty caused by Brexit.
Domestic factors include problems in the car industry where companies are struggling to adjust to stricter emission rules. 
Contracts for 'Made in Germany' goods were up 0.6 percent, figures from the Federal Statistics Office showed, undershooting a consensus forecast of 1.5 percent.
The rise in March was mainly due to bulk orders, the economy ministry said. ""The industrial orders data suggests that activity in manufacturing will remain subdued in the coming months,"" it added.
Excluding bulk orders, industrial orders fell by 1.9 percent in March, the ministry said.
""Together with the weak business sentiment indicators, this is another sign that the industrial sector is in a deep recession,"" Ralph Solveen from Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) said.
For the first quarter as a whole, industrial orders fell by 4.1 percent on the quarter with the drop mainly driven by weaker demand from abroad, the economy ministry said.
The industrial orders reading for February was revised slightly up to a fall of 4.0 percent from a previously reported drop of 4.2 percent. In January, orders fell by 2.1 percent.
SLASHED FORECAST
The German government has slashed its 2019 growth forecast to 0.5 percent. This would mark a sharp slowdown after expansion rates of 2.2 percent in 2017 and 1.4 percent in 2018.
The difficult trade environment means that domestic demand is likely to be the main growth driver this year, helped by record-high employment, rising real wages and low borrowing costs. Higher state spending and construction are expected to give the economy an additional push.
The slowdown is reducing tax receipts and with it the budget surplus which makes it more difficult for Finance Minister Olaf Scholz to inject additional fiscal stimulus into the economy as all parties in conservative Chancellor Angela Merkel's coalition government agreed to refrain from issuing new debt and hiking taxes.
Scholz, a Social Democrat, will present updated tax revenue estimates on Thursday. The figures are likely to show that Berlin will have less fiscal room to hike state spending from 2019 to 2023.
""Politicians have to become braver,"" Joachim Lang, the managing director of Germany's BDI industry association, said. He called on the government to reduce taxes for companies and increase incentives to support corporate research and development.
The German cabinet is expected to pass a draft law next week which aims to support corporate research and development with new incentives worth 1.25 billion euros ($1.4 billion) annually from 2020.
Companies doing basic research or industrial development can apply for a bonus of up to 500,000 euros per year, with the incentives not limited to small- and medium-sized firms.
""This is the right step... but the sum has to become bigger so that companies can use this new instrument efficiently,"" BDI's Lang said.

1315,By Reuters,"<span>May 07, 2019 03:34AM ET</span>","Australia central bank holds rates, jobs key to future cuts","By Swati Pandey
SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia's central bank kept rates at record lows on Tuesday while signaling future cuts if the unemployment rate failed to nudge lower as the country's retailers suffered their worst quarter in nearly seven years.
The Reserve Bank of Australia's (RBA) decision to hold rates at 1.50 percent wrong-footed some doves and sent the Aussie dollar jumping to a one-week top of $0.7048.
Calls from some analysts for the RBA to ease policy at its May meeting intensified after first-quarter inflation came in below expectations last month to undershoot the central bank's 2-3 percent target for 13 straight quarters.
In holding the cash rate, the RBA board ""recognized that there was still spare capacity in the economy and that a further improvement in the labor market was likely to be needed for inflation to be consistent with the target,"" it added.
""Given this assessment, the Board will be paying close attention to developments in the labor market at its upcoming meetings,"" the RBA said.
At the same time, the RBA characterized the labor market as ""strong"" and said it expected the unemployment rate to ease to 4.75 percent in 2021 from current levels of 5 percent where it has stayed for almost six months now.
Most economists said the statement had an ""implicit"" easing bias with the RBA still sounding broadly confident about the economy despite a run of disappointing data lately. 
The on-hold decision comes just 10 days before a closely-fought national election where Prime Minister Scott Morrison is campaigning on being a strong economic manager. The opposition Labor Party - the favorites to win - is championing workers rights, including stronger wage growth and personal tax cuts. 
Analysts expect some sort of fiscal stimulus irrespective of which party wins this month.
""After digesting the RBA's words and deeds, we have to respect the RBA's endless patience and 'reluctant cutter' stance,"" said Annette Beacher, Singapore-based macro-strategist at TD Securities.
A majority of the 42 economists polled by Reuters in late-April, including Beacher, expect the RBA to cut rates twice by year-end. [AU/INT]
But ""if the labor market remains surprisingly resilient, the risk is now a later move,"" UBS economist George Tharenou said in a note.
MAIN UNCERTAINTY
The RBA has tolerated sub-target inflation for 16 of the past 18 quarters by keeping rates unchanged since August 2016 as other economic indicators including the jobless rate showed signs of improvement.
On Tuesday, it acknowledged that consumer prices were ""noticeably weaker"" than anticipated though they were expected to pick up, albeit gradually. Economic growth was also seen growing around trend at 2.75 percent this year and next.
One reason for subdued inflation is depressed household consumption, which the RBA singled out as the ""main domestic uncertainty"" for its outlook.
Cementing that view, earlier data on Tuesday showed retail sales rose a tepid 0.3 percent in March compared with an upwardly revised 0.9 percent in February.
For the first quarter, sales fell 0.1 percent in inflation-adjusted terms for its first negative reading since the September quarter of 2012 and followed an already sedate December quarter.
The soft result implies retail sales did not contribute to growth in Australia's A$1.9 trillion economy in the March quarter. It also adds to growing evidence of a rocky outlook, given household spending accounts for around 57 percent of annual gross domestic product.
The focus now shifts to the RBA's quarterly economic outlook due at 0130 GMT Friday.
""Recognition that inflation will hold below the bottom of the 2-3 per cent target band for 2019 and 2020 will signal the need for further policy easing,"" Westpac chief economist Bill Evans said.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australian retailers posted their weakest quarter in seven years in March in a bad omen for the broader economy as the country's central bank deliberates on whether or not to cut interest rates later on Tuesday.
Figures from the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) showed retail sales rose a tepid 0.3 percent in March compared with an upwardly revised 0.9 percent in February and forecasts for a 0.2 percent gain in a Reuters poll.
For the first quarter as a whole, sales fell 0.1 percent in inflation-adjusted terms for its first negative reading since September quarter of 2012 and followed an already sedate December quarter.
The soft result implies retail sales did not contribute to growth in Australia's A$1.9 trillion economy in the March quarter. It also adds to growing evidence of a rocky outlook, given household spending accounts for around 57 percent of annual gross domestic product.
The quarterly data showed the decline in volumes was led by household goods retailing - a sign Australia's heavily indebted consumers are re-thinking spending decisions on big-ticket items as home prices tumble.
Department store sales were also weak while demand for food and eating out stayed upbeat.
""These data bolster the case for a near-term rate cut and reinforces our view that the RBA (Reserve Bank of Australia) will have to downgrade its outlook for growth,"" said Sydney-based National Australia Bank economist Kaixin Owyong.
Calls from some analysts for the RBA to ease policy at its May meeting intensified after first-quarter inflation came in below expectations to undershoot the central bank's 2-3 percent target for 13 straight quarters.
About 40 percent of economists polled by Reuters in late-April expect the RBA to cut interest rates on Tuesday to an all-time low of 1.25 percent while futures market imply a 36 percent chance of a cut.
The RBA decision is due at 0430 GMT.
Other data out on Tuesday showed Australia's commodity exporters enjoying a bonanza from high prices, notably iron ore. The country's trade surplus came in at A$4.9 billion ($3.4 billion) for March, bringing the total for the quarter to a record A$14.74 billion.
Westpac economist Andrew Hanlan estimates inflation-adjusted net exports likely added to domestic activity in the March quarter, potentially in the order of 0.4 percentage points.
""This is an upside surprise to our forecast of 0.1 percentage point, albeit largely driven by falling imports - a sign of domestic weakness - rather than by strength in exports,"" Hanlan said in a note.
Westpac expects two RBA rate cuts later in the year.

1317,By Reuters,"<span>May 06, 2019 08:40PM ET</span>","Japan April manufacturing PMI returns to expansion but export orders, output still falling","TOKYO (Reuters) - Japanese manufacturing activity expanded in April for the first time in three months as companies hired more workers and grew more optimistic about the business outlook, a preliminary survey showed on Tuesday.
But the survey also showed new export orders fell in April at a faster rate than the previous month, in a reminder of the damage to Asia's exporters from the U.S.-China trade war and weak global demand for semiconductors.
The Markit/Nikkei Japan Flash Manufacturing Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) rose to a seasonally adjusted 50.2 in April from a final 49.2 in the previous month.
For the first time since January, the index swung above the 50 threshold that separates contraction from expansion, though the improvement was modest.
The pick-up ""will be a welcome sign that the recent drop in momentum has potentially subsided for now,"" said Joe Hayes, an economist at IHS Markit, which compiles the survey.
""Given the difficulties faced by firms in semi-conductor and automobile-related industries in recent months, it bodes well that anecdotal evidence indicated that stronger optimism was in part driven by more upbeat forecasts for these two key Asian industries.""
The index measuring employment suggested companies were creating jobs at the fastest pace since November, while optimism over the one-year production outlook rose to five-month high.
But factory output and overall new orders continued to shrink, albeit at a milder pace, while companies stepped up efforts to clear excess inventories, suggesting they do not see a near-term rebound in activity.
A gauge of new export orders fell at a sharper pace, dropping to 47.8 from 48.1 in March.
Operating costs continued to rise amid higher expenses for fuel, labor and materials, but companies were able to pass only some of the increases on to customers. 
Data last week showed Japan's industrial output fell in January-March at the fastest pace in almost five years, suggesting the economy may post a mild contraction in the first quarter as manufacturers struggle with the U.S.-Sino trade war and a slowing Chinese economy.
The United States and China appear to be making progress in hammering out a deal to end the months-long trade dispute, but analysts caution it is unlikely to end Washington's more protectionist stance.
Japan is exposed to the dispute as it ships big volumes of electronics items and heavy machinery to China which are used to make finished goods destined for the United States.

Washington is also pressing Tokyo for a new trade deal to reduce its large trade deficit with Japan, and in particular is urging Japanese automakers to build more vehicles in the United States.

The Sentix research group said on Monday its investor sentiment index for the euro zone rose to 5.3 in May from -0.3 in April. Analysts had expected a reading of 1.4.
""In May, the economic situation continued to improve globally, but also in Europe. Fears of a recession are thus receding into the background,"" Sentix Managing Director Manfred Huebner said in a statement.
A sub-index on euro zone expectations improved for the fourth month in a row, reaching -0.3, its highest level since March last year. A current situation index rose to 11.0 from 3.8.
Investor morale also improved in Germany, with an investor sentiment index for Europe's largest economy rising to 7.9 - its highest since November 2018 - from 2.1 in April.

""Apparently, the spark from the Chinese economy, which has recovered significantly since the start of the year, is increasingly jumping over to the export-dependent German economy,"" Huebner said.

LONDON, May 6 (Reuters) - The euro zone economy limped into the second quarter with lackluster growth as weakness in the manufacturing sector is increasingly affecting the bloc's dominant services industry, a survey showed on Monday.
IHS Markit's Euro Zone Composite Final Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI), considered a good measure of overall economic health, dipped to 51.5 in April from March's 51.6.
That was higher than an earlier flash reading of 51.3 but close to the 50 mark separating growth from contraction.
""The survey is indicative of the economy growing at a quarterly rate of approximately 0.2 percent, but manufacturing remained mired in its steepest downturn since 2013 and service sector growth slipped lower,"" said Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit.
In the first quarter the economy grew a surprisingly strong 0.4 percent, official data showed last week, but an April Reuters poll suggested growth would slow to 0.3 percent this quarter.
Once again some of that activity was generated by firms filling in past orders. The backlogs of work index was well below the breakeven mark at 48.6, not much higher than March's more than four-year low of 48.2.
""Worryingly, growth of output continues to run ahead of that of new orders, meaning even the modest current growth of business activity is only being sustained by firms eating into orders placed in prior months,"" Williamson said.
A PMI covering the services industry fell to 52.8 from 53.3. A factory PMI released last week showed activity contracted for a third consecutive month in April. 
As a downturn in manufacturing usually spreads to services, optimism waned. The business expectations index for services firms dipped to 62.2 from 62.3.

Continuing last month's trend, the Germany Service PMI index rose to 55.7 from 55.4 in March, its highest reading since September, led by strong growth in the post and telecoms sector.
Service providers were hiring at their fastest rate since October 2007, with numbers nearing their highest since data was first collected 22 years ago, with rising wages feeding through into both input cost and sales price inflation.
""At 55.7, the headline business activity index has edged further above its long-run trend level and isn't too far off the highs in 2018,"" said Markit's Principal Economist Phil Smith.
Only the transport and storage services sectors showed a decrease in activity, reflecting the manufacturing weakness that is dragging on Markit's Germany Composite Output index.

Coming in at 52.2, that reading was one of the lowest seen in six years, though it was nonetheless up on the previous month's 51.4, thanks to the strong services performance.

1321,By Reuters,"<span>May 06, 2019 03:00AM ET</span>",Indonesia first-quarter GDP growth slower than expected as investment cools,"By Nilufar Rizki and Maikel Jefriando
JAKARTA (Reuters) - Indonesia's gross domestic product grew more slowly than expected in the first quarter of this year, as investment dropped and prices of its main commodities softened, data from the statistics bureau showed on Monday.
Southeast Asia's largest economy expanded 5.07 percent in January-March from a year earlier, the slowest pace in a year. A Reuters poll had expected growth of 5.18 percent, in line with fourth quarter expansion.
The statistics bureau attributed the weaker growth to soft investment, while household consumption, which represents more than half of the economy, also lost momentum and slowed slightly.
Analysts in the poll had expected spending related to presidential and parliamentary elections held in the country to cushion the weaker performance of investment and exports. 
Indonesia's rupiah and benchmark stock index showed little reaction to the data, but had slipped ahead of the release on concerns over a fresh deterioration in the U.S.-China trade dispute. 
Despite missing expectation, Masyita Crystallin, an economist with DBS, described the data as ""pretty good considering pressure from external factors"", noting other world economies were also growing more slowly.
Crystallin expects Bank Indonesia (BI) to resist cutting interest rates for now, at least until it sees a narrowing of Indonesia's current account deficit.
""There is room to cut, but I think BI will consider the strong pressures on the trade balance and the rupiah,"" she said.
Fakhrul Fulvian, an economist at Trimegah Securities in Jakarta, said with economic and investment growth slowing, the current account deficit should shrink this year.
BI last year raised its key interest rate six times by 175 basis points to defend the rupiah, making it one of Asia's most aggressive central banks amid growing pressure from U.S. interest rate hikes and a ballooning current account gap. 
Some analysts have argued BI has room to unwind these hikes to support economic growth this year, as the United States turns more dovish with its monetary policy and Indonesia's inflation stays near the lower end of BI's target range.
In January-March, annual investment growth slowed to 5 percent, from 6 percent in the previous three months. 
On the trade front, net exports supported GDP growth in the first quarter, as imports fell faster than exports.
The official government growth target for 2019 is 5.3 percent, while the central bank has forecast a range of 5.0-5.4 percent.

1322,By Reuters,"<span>May 05, 2019 09:50PM ET</span>",China April services sector expands further on strong export sales: Caixin PMI,"BEIJING, (Reuters) - - Activity in China's services sector further improved in April, with export sales rising at a record pace, a private business survey showed on Monday, although the longer-term outlook for new orders stayed subdued due to global economic uncertainties.
The Caixin/Markit services purchasing managers' index (PMI) climbed to 54.5, the highest since January 2018 and slightly up from 54.4 in March. The 50-mark separates growth from contraction.
Export orders increased the most since the survey began measuring this in September 2014. 
While the growth contrasts with a slight slowdown suggested by official data last week, both readings indicated China's services sector remained firmly in expansionary territory. 
The strength in services, which account for more than half of China's economy, would help to counter any volatility in the country's manufacturing sector, which is still searching for firm footing.
Caixin's composite manufacturing and services PMI slipped to 52.7 in April from 52.9 a month earlier, weighed down by the slowing expansion of factory activity. 
Costs remained a concern for both services and industries. Price data shows rising input costs in the services sector due to higher staffing costs and price hikes for raw materials, the Caixin survey showed. 
""In general, China's economy looked resilient in April, especially in the services sector,"" Zhengsheng Zhong, director of macroeconomic analysis at CEBM Group, said in a commentary released alongside the Caixin data.
""However, pressure on costs across the services sector remained relatively high, limiting companies' profit growth potential. Business confidence hasn't recovered.""
Outstanding business in the services sector contracted for the fourth straight month in April, although only marginally, according to the Caixin survey. 
Job creation in the sector rose the most in 10 months, but a sub-gauge measuring the outlook for the year ahead remained subdued, capped by concerns over the strength of the global economy. 
To provide ballast for the economy, Beijing has ramped up fiscal stimulus this year, unveiling tax and fee cuts amounting to 2 trillion yuan ($297 billion) to ease burdens on firms, while allowing local governments to issue 2.15 trillion yuan of special bonds to fund infrastructure projects.
Analysts have said it would take time for those measures to fully kick in, with most not expecting the economy to convincingly stabilize until around mid-year.
Signs that China and the United States could reach a trade deal in coming weeks following a year of tit-for-tat tariffs would also offer reprieve for Chinese exporters.

The seasonally adjusted Emirates NBD Saudi Arabia Purchasing Managers' Index remained unchanged month on month at 56.8 in April. A reading above 50 indicates expansion and below that contraction.
The Saudi private sector struggled last year because of fuel price hikes, the introduction of a 5 percent value-added tax and higher fees for hiring foreign workers.
But private sector growth picked up pace this year. It rose to a 13-month high in January and continued to gain momentum -- though only marginally -- through February and March.
""The headline PMI was unchanged at 56.8 last month. Output and new order growth remained firm, but there has been no meaningful growth in private sector employment over the last three months,"" said Khatija Haque, head of MENA research at Emirates NBD.
The output sub-index rose to 61.2, the highest since December 2017, while new order growth remained strong, at 63.5, but two points below March levels. 
The higher output in April was backed by stronger underlying demand and an associated rise in new business. Some 26 percent of surveyed businesses recorded an increase in output at their units, versus just 3 percent that recorded a contraction, according to the survey.

But the kingdom's non-oil labor market was subdued, with the majority of firms keeping staffing numbers unchanged. Still, the employment sub-index rose slightly, to 50.1, from a contraction in March.

1324,By Reuters,"<span>May 03, 2019 01:20PM ET</span>",U.S. job growth surges; unemployment rate drops to 3.6 percent,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. job growth surged in April and the unemployment rate dropped to the lowest in nearly half a century, pointing to sustained strength in economic activity even as last year's massive stimulus from Republican tax cuts and spending increases fades.
The Labor Department's closely watched monthly employment report on Friday showed the greater-than-expected 263,000 new jobs created last month were spread across most industry sectors, and the unemployment rate was just 3.6 percent, the lowest since December 1969. 
Still, wage gains did not accelerate as expected, holding at a reading that is consistent with moderate inflation. Moreover, the decline in the unemployment rate was driven largely by the most people leaving the labor force in a year and a half. 
The report was supportive of the Federal Reserve's decision on Wednesday to keep interest rates unchanged and signal little desire to adjust monetary policy anytime soon. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell described the economy and job growth as ""a bit stronger than we anticipated"" and inflation ""somewhat weaker.""
""Employment gains are strong enough to dispel any immediate concerns over the health of the economy, while wage gains are not strong enough to force the Federal Reserve's hand to tighten the policy stance,"" said Harm Bandholz, chief U.S. economist at UniCredit Research in New York.
Aside from April's surge in nonfarm payrolls, the economy created 16,000 more jobs in February and March than previously reported. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast payrolls rising by 185,000 jobs last month.
The strong economy, especially the labor market, could boost President Donald Trump's re-election hopes next year. Trump, who has boasted about the economy being one of the major wins of his first term in office, cheered April's robust employment gains.
""JOBS, JOBS, JOBS,"" Trump tweeted. 
The economy will mark 10 years of expansion in July, the longest on record. Job gains are well above the roughly 100,000 needed per month to keep up with growth in the working-age population. 
The second month of strong employment growth put to rest concerns about a recession and ironically undercut Trump's call for the Fed to cut interest rates. A brief inversion of the U.S. Treasury yield curve in March had fanned fears of an economic downturn, leading markets to price in a rate cut this year.
""It would be awfully hard for the Fed to explain a rate cut given the strong job market, so forget that,"" said Joel Naroff, chief economist at Naroff Economic Advisors in Holland, Pennsylvania. 
Hiring remains strong, despite anecdotal evidence of worker shortages in the transportation, manufacturing and construction industries, suggesting there is still some spare capacity in the labor market. 
Steadily rising wages had until recently been keeping workers in the labor force and drawing back some who had dropped out. Average hourly earnings rose six cents, or 0.2 percent in April after rising by the same margin in March. That kept the annual increase in wages at 3.2 percent for a second straight month.
Though wage growth is not strong enough to drive up inflation, it is seen sufficient to underpin economic growth as the stimulus from last year's $1.5 trillion tax cut wanes. The economy grew at a 3.2 percent annualized rate in the first quarter, driven by a surge in exports and inventories, quickening from the October-December period's 2.2 percent pace.
The dollar fell against a basket of currencies, while U.S. Treasury prices rose. Stocks on Wall Street were trading higher.
WEAK SUPPLY MANAGER SURVEYS
Despite April's robust job gains, there are signs the economy slowed early in the second quarter. 
A survey from the Institute for Supply Management (ISM) on Friday showed a measure of services industry activity dropped to a 20-month low in April. It followed on the heels of another ISM survey this week showing factory activity hitting a 2-1/2-year low last month. 
Last month's two-tenths of a percentage point drop in the unemployment rate from 3.8 percent in March was because 490,000 people left the labor force in April, the most in 18 months. It was the fourth straight month of workers dropping out of the labor force and could shrink the pool of available workers.
The labor force participation rate, or the proportion of working-age Americans who have a job or are looking for one, fell to 62.8 percent in April from 63.0 percent in March. 
This suggested more slack in the labor market than indicated by the unemployment rate. The drop in participation was almost across the board, with significant declines among prime-age and younger workers.
""The supply side of the economy looks a little less shiny in light of the decline in the participation rate,"" said Michael Feroli, an economist at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) in New York. 
A broader measure of unemployment, which includes people who want to work but have given up searching and those working part-time because they cannot find full-time employment, was unchanged at 7.3 percent in April.
Economists expect job growth will slow this year as fewer workers become available, which will push up wages and lift inflation back to the Fed's 2 percent target. An inflation measure tracked by the U.S. central bank increased 1.6 percent in the year to March, the smallest gain in 14 months.
Employment at construction sites increased by 33,000 jobs in April, rising for a second straight month. Manufacturing sector payrolls rebounded by 4,000 jobs after being unchanged in March.
The industry is being pressured by layoffs in the automobile sector as assembly plants try to cope with declining sales and an inventory overhang. The auto sector shed jobs for a fourth straight month.
Employment increased in the leisure and hospitality, professional and business services, healthcare, transportation and warehousing, and financial activities industries. But retail payrolls declined for a third straight month. 

Temporary help, a harbinger for future hiring, rebounded last month after dropping in March. Government payrolls increased by 27,000 in April.

Nonfarm payrolls (NFP) rose by 263,000 in March, smashing consensus expectations for 181,000.
The jobless rate fell unexpectedly to 3.6%. That was its lowest level December 1969 when it was at 3.5%.
Analysts said the numbers vindicated the Federal Reserve's refusal to consider cutting interest rates after signs that the economy cooled in the first quarter.
“Policy implications are that the market got out ahead of itself on pricing in a rate cut,” Joseph Brusuelas, chief economist at consultancy RSM US LLP.
“That is now off the table due to the strong fundamentals underscoring the April jobs estimate. (Fed Chairman Jerome) Powell got it right: no case for rate hike or cut,” he added.
Average hourly earnings grew just 3.2% on an annualized basis, unchanged from March, and short of a consensus forecast of 3.3%. The Fed monitor that component of the data for signs of upward pressure on inflation.
Markets had been expecting a rate cut before the end of the year up until the Fed’s policy decision earlier this week. Powell's resistance, emphasizing that policymakers were comfortable with rates at their current levels, forced markets to reevaluate. They now see the possibility of a December rate cut at less than 50%.
“Solid growth dynamics have been neutralised by subdued inflation,” said Lena Komileva, chief economist with (g+)economics in London. “Although the growth cycle has peaked, there is no sign of (a) deceleration that can lead the economy into a recession.”
Komileva said the report was “a boon for equities”, in so far as it hints a further extension of what is already the longest period of growth in recent history.
U.S. futures extended gains following the release with S&P 500 futures last up 0.5%, having been up 0.4% ahead of the report.

The AIB services purchasing managers' index slipped to 54.7 from 55.3 in March, still comfortably above the 50 mark that has separated growth from contraction since 2012 but just above the near six-year low the series fell to in January.
The weaker expansion was driven by a fall in new orders, the subindex for which dropped to 54.1 from 55.7, the lowest reading in two-and-a-half years.
""Although the rate of expansion remained solid amid reports of improved customer demand conditions both domestically and abroad, some panellists indicated that Brexit had negatively impacted on sales,"" AIB Chief Economist Oliver Mangan said.
""Softer new order growth resulted in a weaker increase of backlogs. Outstanding business rose modestly in April, with the rate of accumulation easing to its slowest in 69 months.""
Ireland has brushed aside the initial uncertainty from the 2016 vote of its nearest neighbour to leave the European Union, posting the fastest economic growth in the bloc for five straight years.
However a corresponding survey for manufacturers earlier this week showed that it was growing at the slowest rate since the aftermath of the Brexit vote, also due to a moderation in new orders.

""Overall, the AIB Services PMI reading of 54.7 for April suggests that the Irish economy is continuing to expand at a good pace, though not as strong as in recent years,"" Mangan said.

Factory goods orders rebounded 1.9 percent, also boosted by orders for computers and electronic products, the Commerce Department said on Thursday. That was the largest rise since August 2018. Data for February was revised up to show factory orders slipping 0.3 percent instead of falling 0.5 percent as previously reported.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast factory orders would rise 1.5 percent in March. Factory orders increased 1.7 percent compared to March 2018.
Inventories at factories increased 0.4 percent in March. The stock of unsold goods has increased in 28 of the last 29 months. Unfilled others at factories rose 0.2 percent in March after falling 0.2 percent in February.
Manufacturing, which accounts for about 12 percent of the economy, is being pressured by sluggish global demand, continued uncertainty over trade talks between the United States and China, and a large inventory build. Fading depreciation provisions for capital equipment as a result of the Trump administration's tax restructuring has also slowed business investment, further squeezing manufacturing.
A survey on Wednesday showed a measure of national factory activity fell to a 2-1/2-year low in April.
In March, orders for machinery edged up 0.1 percent after falling 0.9 percent in the prior month. Orders for electrical equipment, appliances and components rose 0.5 percent while those for computers and electronic products jumped 2.2 percent.
Transportation equipment orders surged 7.0 percent in March after falling 2.9 percent in the prior month. Orders for civilian aircraft and parts soared 31.0 percent. Motor vehicles and parts orders increased 1.5 percent.
The Commerce Department also said March orders for non-defense capital goods excluding aircraft, which are seen as a measure of business spending plans on equipment, increased 1.4 percent instead of the 1.3 percent jump reported last week.
Orders for these so-called core capital goods were unchanged in February. Shipments of core capital goods, which are used to calculate business equipment spending in the gross domestic product report, were unchanged in March rather than slipping 0.2 percent as previously reported. 

Core capital goods shipments rose 0.3 percent in February. Business spending on equipment spending stalled in the first quarter.

LONDON/HONG KONG (Reuters) - Global factory activity recovered a little last month but still appeared to be in the doldrums as demand remained weak and trade protectionism concerns prominent, while stimulus measures had yet to fully kick in.
In the euro zone, business survey data on Thursday pointed to a third straight month of contraction and while manufacturing is still growing in the United States, it missed expectations by a wide margin on Wednesday. The picture was similarly gloomy across much of Asia. 
That left the outlook for central banks predominantly skewed towards either easing - or at least not tightening - policy. Malaysia and New Zealand are prime candidates for potential rate cuts, and monetary authorities in Australia are facing growing calls to do likewise. 
The Bank of England, meeting on Thursday, is almost certain to remain on hold but keep its options open for later in the year, in what will be its first policy decision since the postponement until Oct. 31 of Britain's scheduled departure from the European Union.
As the euro zone's economic prospects have dimmed - in part due to a lack of clarity over Brexit - expectations for interest rate hikes from the European Central Bank have been pushed further into next year. [ECILT/EU]
The Federal Reserve held interest rates steady overnight, saying it saw no strong case for either hiking or cutting, disappointing U.S. stock markets.
""We see the May meeting as more evidence that this pause has legs. We continue to expect the Fed to leave rates unchanged through this year and next,""  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP) economists told clients. 
A resolution in the trade dispute between Washington and Beijing would go a long way towards improving the mood.
While there is still great uncertainty, U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said the two countries completed productive talks on Wednesday and were nearing a deal that would roll back a portion of the $250 billion in U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods.
Beijing in March announced additional tax cuts and infrastructure spending this year worth hundreds of billions of dollars, while bank lending in the first quarter hit a record 5.81 trillion yuan ($863 billion). 
The People's Bank of China has also been cutting banks' reserve requirements and keeping short-term money market rates low. 
FLOUNDERING FACTORIES 
Purchasing Managers' Indexes showed manufacturing activity shrank again in the euro zone, and that the boost to British factories from record rates of pre-Brexit stockpiling slowed in April. [EUR/PMIM][GB/PMIM]
Uncertainty over the terms of Britain's EU departure, long scheduled for March 29, had previously prompted factories to load up on parts and materials at the fastest rate in the 27-year history of the PMI surveys.
The same factor affected the rest of Europe. Activity in the continent's manufacturing powerhouse Germany shrank for a fourth month running and in Italy it contracted for a seventh month. It accelerated in Spain but only stabilized in France.
In China, both official and private factory surveys suggested an unexpected loss of momentum last month, though overall activity still expanded, albeit at a more subdued rate. 
While many analysts agree the worst may be over for the world's second-largest economy, the disappointing readings - which followed surprisingly upbeat March data - suggested it is still struggling for traction.
April's downbeat reading, coupled with a soft outlook for trade, have raised questions over how much more stimulus is needed to generate sustainable growth in China without risking a sharper jump in debt.
""These uncertainties make us strongly believe that the Chinese government will continue its fiscal stimulus ... and will provide enough credit to smaller private firms to keep them running and stabilize the job market,"" said ING's Greater China economist Iris Pang.
As China has generated nearly a third of global growth in recent years, financial markets have been counting on another strong, credit-fueled bounce.
""We're starting to see a bottoming-out of the slowdown,"" said Khoon Goh, head of Asia research at ANZ.
""But bottoming out doesn't mean that economies are firing away. We still think in some economies further support will be very helpful."".
Activity contracted in Malaysia and Taiwan and slowed in the Philippines and Indonesia. India's expanded at its slowest pace in eight months while South Korea snapped a five-month streak of contractions.
Japan releases PMI data next week due to public holidays.

1331,By Reuters,"<span>May 02, 2019 08:40AM ET</span>",U.S. first quarter productivity rise fastest since 2014; labor costs fall,"WASHINGTON, (Reuters) - - U.S. worker productivity increased at its fastest pace in more than four years in the first quarter, depressing labor costs and suggesting inflation could remain benign for a while. 
The Labor Department said on Thursday nonfarm productivity, which measures hourly output per worker, increased at a 3.6 percent annualized rate in the last quarter. That was the strongest pace since the third quarter of 2014.
Data for the fourth quarter was revised down to show productivity rising at a pace of 1.3 percent instead of the previously reported 1.9 percent rate.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast first-quarter productivity would advance at a 2.2 percent rate. 
The acceleration in productivity was flagged by a surge in gross domestic product growth in the January-March period.
The economy grew at a 3.2 percent rate in the first three months of the year after expanding at a 2.2 percent pace in the fourth quarter.
The trend in productivity is improving. Compared to the first quarter of 2018, productivity increased at a rate of 2.4 percent, the best performance since the third quarter of 2010.
The strong pace of productivity suppressed growth in labor costs, a potential boost to corporate profits. Unit labor costs, the price of labor per single unit of output, fell at a 0.9 percent rate in the first quarter after increasing at a 2.5 percent rate in the prior quarter.
Compared to the first quarter of 2018, labor costs grew at a 0.1 percent rate, the weakest pace since the fourth quarter of 2013. Weak unit labor costs came on the heels of a report on Tuesday showing wages increasing steadily in the first quarter despite a tightening labor market.
The Federal Reserve on Wednesday held interest rates steady and signaled little desire to adjust them anytime soon. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell told reporters the moderation in price pressures was likely due to transient factors, and predicted inflation would rise back to the U.S. central bank's 2 percent target. A key inflation measure tracked by the Fed increased 1.6 percent in the year to March, the smallest gain in 14 months.

In the first quarter, hourly compensation increased at a 2.6 percent rate, slowing from the fourth quarter's brisk 3.9 percent pace. Hourly compensation increased at a 2.5 percent rate compared to the first quarter of 2018.

1332,By Reuters,"<span>May 02, 2019 08:40AM ET</span>",U.S. weekly jobless claims unchanged last week,"WASHINGTON, (Reuters) - - The number of Americans filing applications for unemployment benefits was unchanged at higher levels last week, but the trend remained consistent with tightening labor market conditions.
Initial claims for state unemployment benefits were flat at a seasonally adjusted 230,000 for the week ended April 27, the Labor Department said on Thursday. Claims surged 37,000 in the prior week, which was the largest rise since September 2017. 
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast claims falling to 215,000 in the latest week. The Labor Department said no states were estimated last week. Claims have been volatile in recent weeks because of the different timings of the Easter and Passover holidays as well as school spring breaks. 
A strike by workers at Stop & Shop supermarkets in New England, which has since ended, likely contributed to the recent surge in claims. Unadjusted claims in Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut and Vermont dropped last week after rising in the week ended April 20.
There was a jump in unadjusted claims for New York, likely reflecting a late spring break for public schools.
The four-week moving average of initial claims, considered a better measure of labor market trends as it irons out week-to-week volatility, rose 6,500 to 212,500 last week. 
The claims data has no bearing on April's employment report, which is scheduled for release on Friday. According to a Reuters survey of economists, nonfarm payrolls probably increased by 185,000 jobs in April after rising by 196,000 positions in March.
Job gains averaged 180,000 in the first quarter, well above the roughly 100,000 jobs per month needed to keep up with growth in the working-age population. The unemployment rate is forecast to be unchanged at 3.8 percent in April.
Sustained labor market strength, which is underpinning the economy, encouraged the Federal Reserve on Wednesday to hold interest rates steady.
The U.S. central bank signaled little appetite to adjust its monetary policy stance any time soon, also holding out hope that inflation will rose toward its 2 percent target. A key inflation measure tracked by the Fed increased 1.6 percent in the year to March, the smallest gain in 14 months.

Thursday's claims report showed the number of people receiving benefits after an initial week of aid increased 17,000 to 1.67 million for the week ended April 20. The four-week moving average of the so-called continuing claims fell 13,750 to 1.67 million.

1333,By Bloomberg,"<span>May 02, 2019 07:30AM ET</span>",Bank of England Hints at Slow Rate Hikes Even as Growth Improves,"(Bloomberg) -- The Bank of England signaled that it’s in no rush to raise interest rates despite stronger economic growth, as policy makers stayed united on the need to keep borrowing costs on hold for now.
In an upbeat set of forecasts, Governor Mark Carney and his colleagues upgraded their expectations for growth, saying unemployment will fall further and the economy will generate more excess demand than previously predicted. Yet the Monetary Policy Committee cut its inflation outlook. Investors predict only one more quarter-point hike between now and 2021.
“There remained mixed signals from indicators of domestically generated inflation and the cost of waiting for further information was relatively low,” the minutes of the meeting said. At the same time, “an ongoing tightening of monetary policy over the forecast period, at a gradual pace and to a limited extent, would be appropriate.”
The pound was choppy after the decision, advancing initially before reversing gains. Investors in the money market now see a 30 percent chance of a 25-basis point rate increase by the end of the year, compared with 35 percent before the decision.
The vote was 9-0 to hold at 0.75 percent and to keep the asset purchase program unchanged. All 62 economists in a Bloomberg survey correctly predicted Thursday’s decision.
Brexit Delay
The bank’s new forecasts are the first since the deadline for the U.K. to leave the European Union was extended to October. The economy has been hobbled by the uncertainty around Brexit, leading to a year of falling investment, and the minutes said the timing and nature of Brexit remained the biggest factor for the outlook.
Still, policy makers assume a smooth transition, and the forecasts weren’t materially affected by the delay to the exit date. U.K. economic data in the short term may be volatile and difficult to interpret because of Brexit, the bank said.
Agents reported that Brexit is pushing down already weak business investment intentions. Investment will probably fall for a few more quarters, but the bank raised its forecast for investment growth through 2021.
Stronger Growth
The forecast for GDP expansion this year was lifted to 1.5 percent from 1.2 percent because of a stronger first-quarter performance as companies stockpiled for Brexit. Officials now see the economy expanding 0.5 percent at the start of the year, up from 0.3 percent in March, with inventory building adding about 0.1 percentage point.
The growth predictions for 2020 and 2021 also went up, though that was due more to looser global financial conditions and the lower yield curve in the U.K. Unemployment, already at the lowest in four decades, will fall further, although wage gains appear to be levelling off, the bank said.
The BOE’s slightly hawkish tone sets it apart from many of the world’s biggest central banks. The Federal Reserve on Wednesday left rates on hold and said the next move could be a hike or a cut. The European Central Bank will offer new loans to help banks. The Bank of Japan last month reinforced a promise to keep rates at rock bottom.
The BOE lowered forecasts for inflation this year but kept them unchanged for two years out. The change was based on lower energy prices and a higher pound, not a different judgment on domestically generated inflation, the bank said.
Before the report, investors didn’t see the next BOE hike until well into next year, with overnight index swaps not fully pricing in a move until beyond September 2020.

1334,By Investing.com,"<span>May 02, 2019 07:00AM ET</span>","Bank of England Leaves Rates Unchanged, Raises Growth Forecasts ","Investing.com - The Bank of England left interest rates on hold at 0.75% on Thursday and raised its growth forecasts, in what was its first monetary policy meeting since the deadline for Brexit was delayed for six months.
The vote on the decision was unanimous, with all nine policymakers voting in favor of keeping rates on hold. The decision was widely expected with most economists forecasting that borrowing costs will remain on hold until it's clear whether and on what terms the U.K. will actually leave the European Union.
Last month, the deadline for Brexit was postponed until Oct. 31 after Prime Minister Theresa May failed to secure parliamentary backing for her withdrawal deal in time for the original March 29 departure date.
The BoE said it now expects the U.K. economy to grow by 1.5% this year, up from 1.2% that it forecast in February.
""GDP is expected to have grown by 0.5% in 2019 Q1, in part reflecting a larger-than-expected boost from companies in the United Kingdom and the European Union building stocks ahead of recent Brexit deadlines,"" the bank's rate statement said.
""That boost is expected to be temporary, however, and quarterly growth is expected to slow to around 0.2% in Q2. Smoothing through those developments, the underlying pace of GDP growth appears to be slightly stronger than previously anticipated, but marginally below potential.""
Policymakers noted that Brexit uncertainties are having a ""particularly pronounced impact"" on business investment, which has been falling for a year.
The BoE reiterated its view that further tightening of monetary policy in the future would be appropriate.
""The Committee continues to judge that ... an ongoing tightening of monetary policy over the forecast period, at a gradual pace and to a limited extent, would be appropriate,"" the statement said.
But the bank noted that uncertainty over Brexit continued to cloud the outlook for monetary policy decision making.
""The economic outlook will continue to depend significantly on the nature and timing of EU withdrawal, in particular: the new trading arrangements between the European Union and the United Kingdom; whether the transition to them is abrupt or smooth; and how households, businesses and financial markets respond,"" the statement said."
1335,By Reuters,"<span>May 02, 2019 05:59AM ET</span>",Hong Kong's first-quarter GDP growth slows to near decade low,"By Twinnie Siu and Donny Kwok
HONG KONG (Reuters) - Hong Kong's economy grew at its slowest annual pace in nearly 10 years in the first quarter, an advance government estimate showed on Thursday, hit by a slowdown in exports and investment.
The Asian financial center has been buffeted by China's slowing economy and the U.S.-China trade war, along with cooling property prices and volatile stock markets.
The economy grew 0.5 percent in the January-March quarter from a year earlier, the weakest increase since the third quarter of 2009, compared with a revised 1.2 percent pace of growth in the final quarter of 2018. 
This was the first time the government has released a preliminary reading on gross domestic product (GDP).
On a quarterly basis, the economy expanded a seasonally adjusted 1.2 percent after contracting a revised 0.5 percent in the fourth quarter.
""Total exports of goods weakened further in the first quarter, similar to the situation in many other Asian economies,"" a government spokesman said in a statement. ""Exports of services also recorded decelerated growth, yet sustained expansion of inbound tourism continued to provide support.""
Private consumption grew marginally and overall investment expenditure contracted as business sentiment had turned cautious since the latter part of 2018, the spokesman said.
WORST MAY BE OVER
Paul Tang, chief economist of Bank of East Asia, said the economy looked set to improve in the near future thanks to the positive wealth effect from stronger stock and property markets.
""We are quite sure the performance in the first quarter is the worse, and a recovery in the second half will become more obvious,"" Tang said, adding that positive signs in Sino-U.S. trade talks and a stabilizing Chinese economy were lending support to business confidence. 
Hong Kong's Financial Secretary Paul Chan said on his blog on Sunday that first-quarter growth would be modest on a year-on-year basis and would be much lower than the fourth quarter amid increased uncertainties in the political and economic environment. (https:// 
In February, Chan forecast the city's economy would expand 2-3 percent this year, compared with 3 percent in 2018. He also predicted growth would average 3 percent from 2020-2023.
Though the coastal city's share of China's trade has declined with the rise of mega-ports on the mainland, its open economy remains highly vulnerable to external risks. In addition to trade, it is highly reliant on tourists and investment flows from China.
""If the trade issues could be resolved to some extent and part or all of the tariffs previously imposed could be lifted, global economic sentiment will be boosted, facilitating the growth of Hong Kong's economy,"" Chan said.
The United States and China are nearing a trade deal that would roll back a portion of the $250 billion in U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods, Politico reported on Wednesday after U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said the two countries completed ""productive"" talks in Beijing.
As for China's economy, it is starting to show some signs of bottoming out in response to stimulus measures, but analysts say it is too early to call a turnaround.
While conditions are expected to stabilize around mid-year, economists caution that China is unlikely to see a sharp rebound as in the past, noting Beijing's stimulus measures so far have been relatively more restrained. That would mean more subdued recoveries in Hong Kong and other trade-reliant Asian economies.

Hong Kong will release first-quarter data and its latest economic forecasts for the year on May 17.

1336,By Reuters,"<span>May 01, 2019 08:40PM ET</span>",South Korea April factory activity returns to growth as employment expands: PMI,"SEOUL, May 2 (Reuters) - South Korea's factory activity rebounded in April helped by a boost in hiring, snapping five months of contraction, a private manufacturing survey showed on Thursday.
The headline Nikkei/Markit purchasing managers' index (PMI) on the country's manufacturing sector improved to 50.2, up from 48.8 in March.
The overall index inched above the 50-point level that separates growth from contraction, signaling a possible improvement in the economy, but major sub-components still remained weak, hovering below the neutral point.
New export orders from the world's sixth-largest exporter continued to shrink for a ninth month, the longest decline since 2015, while new orders also contracted for a sixth month but at a slower pace amid weakening demand both at home and abroad. 
In a sign of continued strain, South Korea's exports in April contracted for the fifth straight month on a double-digit drop in memory chips and slowing shipments to China.
""Sluggish sales in semiconductor and automobile-related industries were reported by some panelists, while demand from Europe, China and Japan was also reportedly subdued,"" said Joe Hayes, an economist at IHS Markit.
Exports to China, its biggest trading partner, fell 4.5 percent in April from a year earlier and marked a sixth consecutive month of decline to its bigger neighbor.
Unlike other major sub-indexes, employment returned to expansion after five months of contraction thanks to new product development plans and efforts to comply with the recently-implemented 52 working hour week. The rate of job creation, however, remained below the long-run average.
Though respondents surveyed forecast improvements in the domestic economy, the sentiment was relatively weak in the historical context, Hayes said.
""Business confidence remained sub-par, with firms expressing little optimism that global export headwinds will fade any time soon,"" he added.
The April PMI data shows that the South Korean economy could continue cooling in the second quarter.
Asia's fourth-largest economy unexpectedly suffered its worst quarter since the global financial crisis in the January-March period, as companies slashed investment and exports slumped in response to Sino-U.S. trade tensions and cooling Chinese demand, Bank of Korea data showed last month.
Last week, the government unveiled a proposed 6.7 trillion won ($5.8 billion) supplementary budget to fight unprecedented air pollution levels and boost weak exports. Economists, however, say it will have a limited stimulative effect and more are considering bringing forward their expectations for a rate cut.
South Korea's finance minister told reporters on Monday he is aware of market views that policy interest rates need to be lowered to boost growth, but did not comment further.
The current policy rate stands at 1.75 percent, after the Bank of Korea left it unchanged in April. The next policy meeting will be May 31.

The KBC Bank/ESRI consumer sentiment index fell to 87.7 in April from 93.1 in March, largely erasing a partial recovery from February's 51-month low of 86.5.
April's weakness ""reflects the difficulty the typical Irish consumer is having in assessing how various threats may affect the Irish economy and their own household finances in the year ahead"", said Austin Hughes, Chief Economist, KBC Bank Ireland.
""At the margin, higher energy bills and other increases in living costs may have made consumers a little more cautious in April.""
Despite being widely seen as the EU country with the most to lose from Brexit, Ireland weathered initial concerns stemming from Britain's 2016 referendum vote, which failed to interrupt a run of five straight years as Europe's fastest growing economy.
But the Irish central bank has said that if Britain crashes out of the EU without a deal it could knock as much as 4 percentage points off Ireland's growth rate in the first full post-Brexit year.
The survey's authors said there was little clarity on Brexit during the survey period, and while the likely postponement of the UK's exit lessened the near-term risks, the shadow cast by the current uncertainty is a drag on Irish consumer sentiment.
They said Irish consumers are currently positioned for bad news. ""Only one in five consumers now expects the Irish economy to strengthen in the next twelve months whereas two in five see it becoming weaker.""

1338,By Reuters,"<span>May 01, 2019 07:10PM ET</span>",UK construction buoyed by house-building: surveys,"LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's construction industry is being shielded from the uncertainty about Brexit by modest growth in house-building, industry surveys showed on Thursday.
Builders registered 37,672 new homes for warranties and insurance from the National House-Building Council (NHBC) between January and March, up 3 percent compared with a year earlier.
NHBC's figures, which cover 80 percent of the new homes market, are viewed as a lead indicator for the housing sector.
Separately, the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (RICS) said private house-building supported the otherwise subdued construction industry, with overall confidence at an almost six-year low.
While the commercial construction sector has been hurt by falling business investment ahead of Brexit, efforts to narrow a shortfall in the number of residential homes on the market has helped the house-building sector.
Construction represents about 6 percent of British economic output.
""We are pleased to report good numbers for the start of the year, although we do need to bear in mind the situation 12 months ago when freezing conditions caused major hold-ups in registrations as well as build-rates across the bulk of the UK,"" NHBC chief executive Steve Wood said.
Uncertainty around Brexit had caused ""some dampening"" of the housing market for new homes in early 2019, he said.
Prime Minister Theresa May has failed to get her European Union divorce deal through parliament, forcing her to delay the original Brexit date of March 29. A new deadline has been set for Oct. 31, more than three years since the 2016 referendum.

House-building was the only source of growth for Britain's construction industry during the first three months of 2019, according to the most recent purchasing managers index from IHS Markit/CIPS. The survey for April is due at 0830 GMT.

1339,By Reuters,"<span>May 01, 2019 02:24PM ET</span>","U.S. factory activity at two-and-half-year low, points to slowing economy","By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. manufacturing activity slowed to a 2-1/2-year low in April amid a sharp drop in new orders while construction spending unexpectedly fell in March, suggesting economic growth was moderating after surging in the first quarter.
One of the reports from the Institute for Supply Management (ISM) on Wednesday showed businesses increasingly anxious that President Donald Trump's threats to close the U.S.-Mexico boarder would further disrupt the supply chain. Washington's trade war with China has created bottlenecks at factories.
The Federal Reserve kept U.S. interest rates unchanged on Wednesday, noting solid economic growth in the first quarter, and also holding out hope that inflation will rise toward the U.S. central bank's 2 percent target. 
""The slowing manufacturing sector needs to be watched carefully as income gains are not strong enough to support solid growth,"" said Joel Naroff, chief economist at Naroff Economic Advisors in Holland, Pennsylvania.
The ISM said its index of national factory activity fell to 52.8 in April, the lowest reading since October 2016, from 55.3 in March. A reading above 50 indicates expansion in the manufacturing sector, which accounts for about 12 percent of the U.S. economy. 
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the ISM index dipping to 55.0 in April. The slowdown in manufacturing partly reflects sluggish global economies and continued uncertainty over the trade talks between the United States and China. A stockpile of unsold goods is also seen slowing manufacturing.
The ISM said 13 industries, including machinery, computer and electronic products, furniture, and electrical equipment, appliances and components reported growth last month. Apparel, transportation equipment and three other industries reported a contraction.
Manufacturers in the electrical equipment, appliances and components industry said ""there is growing concern about supply chain product flow through the southern U.S. border."" Those worries were also echoed by their counterparts in the computer and electronic products industry who said ""Mexico-U.S. border crossing delays are slowing supplier deliveries."" 
Machinery and transportation equipment manufacturers said they were also monitoring the situation on the U.S. southern boarder. Trump has repeatedly threatened to shut down the border because of a surge in illegal immigrants seeking to enter the United States.
The dollar fell against a basket of currencies, while U.S. Treasury prices rose. Stocks on Wall Street were trading higher. 
WEAK FACTORY ORDERS
The ISM's new orders sub-index dropped 5.7 points to a reading of 51.7 last month. More industries reported paying less for raw materials, which suggest inflation will probably remain muted for a while. A measure of export orders also fell and factories reported a decline in hiring, with a measure of manufacturing employment falling to 52.4 from 57.5 in March. 
That suggests manufacturing payrolls remained weak in April after they dropped in March for the first time since July 2017. Weak manufacturing employment in April also suggested a step-down in overall job growth last month. The government is scheduled to publish April's employment report on Friday. 
""The U.S. manufacturing sector remains under pressure,"" said Sarah House, a senior economist at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) Securities in Charlotte, North Carolina. ""We expect the sector's contribution to payrolls to be noticeably more minimal in the months ahead.""
While the ADP (NASDAQ:ADP) National Employment Report on Wednesday showed private payrolls increased by 275,000 jobs in April, Moody's Analytics, who jointly developed the report downplayed the surge in hiring saying it ""overstate the economy's strength."" 
It was the biggest private payrolls increase in nine months and followed a 151,000 gain in March. The economy grew at a 3.2 percent annualized rate in the first quarter, the government reported in its advance estimate last week, after expanding at a 2.2 percent pace in the October-December period.
The ADP report has a poor record of predicting the private payrolls component of the government's employment report. 
Economists polled by Reuters are looking for nonfarm employment to have increased by 185,000 jobs after rising by 196,000 in March. Job growth has slowed from last year's 223,000 monthly average pace as workers become scarce.
The pace of job gains, however, remains above the roughly 100,000 per month needed to keep up with growth in the working age population. The unemployment rate is forecast to be unchanged at 3.8 percent in April. 
A third report from the Commerce Department on Wednesday showed construction spending decreased 0.9 percent in March.

Data for January and February was revised lower to account for additional projects identified as eligible for inclusion in the series. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast construction spending rising 0.1 percent in March.

But Fed Chairman Jerome Powell cooled investor expectations for a rate cut, prompting a selloff across stocks.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.61%, the S&P 500 lost 0.75%, while the Nasdaq Composite fell 0.57%.
“We do think our policy stance is appropriate right now. We don’t see a strong case for moving in either direction,” Powell said during a news conference after the central bank’s policy meeting.
The remarks from Powell comes as calls for a rate cut intensify, with U.S. President Donald Trump suggesting on Tuesday that a 1% cut to rates was needed.
The Federal Open Market Committee left its overnight funds rate in a range of 2.25% to 2.5%. The unchanged decision on rates was widely expected as tame domestic inflation and speed bumps in the global economy persist.
""On a 12-month basis, overall inflation and inflation for items other than food and energy have declined and are running below 2 percent,"" the Fed said in in its statement.
The most recent measure of core PCE, the Fed's preferred measure of inflation, showed a slowdown to a rate 1.6%, well below the central bank's 2% target.
Ahead of the rate decision, about 97% of traders expected the Fed to keep rates unchanged, according to Investing.com's Fed Rate Monitor Tool.
Overall, Fed members continued to view sustained expansion of economic activity, strong labor market conditions, and inflation near the Committee's symmetric 2 percent objective as the ""most likely outcomes.""
The Fed said economic activity rose at a ""solid rate,"" but acknowledged that the growth of household spending and business fixed investment slowed in the first quarter.
The U.S. economy grew at a 3.2% annualized rate, above the 2.2% pace in the final three months of last year, but the rebound was driven by temporary factors.
Ahead of the crucial nonfarm payrolls report due Friday, the central bank continued to highlight the strength in the labor market. ""Job gains have been solid, on average, in recent months, and the unemployment rate has remained low,"" the Fed said.

1341,By Reuters,"<span>May 01, 2019 11:25AM ET</span>","Exports sag, UK factories report lower Brexit stockpile boost - PMI survey","By Andy Bruce and William Schomberg
LONDON (Reuters) - British factories lost some of the boost from pre-Brexit stockpiling last month while households slowed their borrowing ahead of the original deadline for the country's departure from the European Union, data showed on Wednesday.
The IHS Markit/CIPS manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) dropped to 53.1 in April from March's 13-month high of 55.1, broadly in line with the average forecast in a Reuters poll of economists.
Exports fell at one of their fastest rates in the past five years, reflecting a slowdown in the global economy.
Uncertainty around the terms of Britain's exit from the EU, originally scheduled for March 29, had previously prompted factories to load up on parts and materials at the fastest rate in the 27-year history of the PMI surveys.
Bank of England data for March, also released on Wednesday, showed caution on the part of consumers whose spending has helped to offset weakness elsewhere in Britain's economy.
Lenders approved the fewest mortgages since December 2017 ahead of the expected Brexit date, and consumer credit growth slowed to its weakest in more than four years.
However, there have been signs that the slowdown in Britain's housing market may have bottomed out. Nationwide Building Society said house price growth picked up to an annual 0.9 percent in April, its highest since November though much slower than growth of about 5 percent at the time of the 2016 Brexit referendum.
With the deadline for Brexit now pushed back to Oct. 31, the pace of factory stockpiling eased in April, though it continued to boost British output amid a broader downturn in European manufacturing.
""The slowdown is less severe than we had expected,"" economist Samuel Tombs of Pantheon Macroeconomics said.
One in five manufacturers reported that Brexit-related stock-building had continued to boost output in April.
The survey's gauge of export orders fell to its lowest since August 2018, and its second-lowest reading since October 2014. Although global demand for goods has slowed markedly over the last six months, IHS Markit said Brexit uncertainty was the main factor for British factories in April.
""There were also reports of overseas clients acting now to re-route their supply chains away from the UK in advance of Brexit,"" said Rob Dobson, a director at IHS Markit, the firm which compiles the data.
Last week a quarterly survey of manufacturers by the Confederation of British Industry showed the biggest fall in export orders since the depths of the financial crisis in 2009.
Andrew Wishart of consultancy Capital Economics said he expected Britain's manufacturing PMI to fall further, coming closer into line with a weak euro zone manufacturing PMI.
""The upshot is that a hangover from Brexit preparations in the sector will weigh on GDP in Q2,"" he said.
Officials at the Bank of England preparing new economic forecasts for publication on Thursday are likely to note cooling producer price pressures shown in the latest PMI, echoing European Commission business surveys published on Monday.

Factories raised selling prices at the slowest pace since July 2016, and their material and energy costs increased at the second-slowest pace May 2016, the PMI showed.

1342,By Reuters,"<span>May 01, 2019 10:20AM ET</span>",U.S. construction spending unexpectedly falls in March,"WASHINGTON, May 1 (Reuters) - U.S. construction spending unexpectedly fell in March after three straight monthly gains, pulled down by declines in both private and public construction projects.
The Commerce Department said on Wednesday construction spending decreased 0.9 percent. Data for February was revised to show construction outlays rising 0.7 instead of increasing 1.0 percent as previously reported. Construction spending data for January was also revised lower to account for additional projects identified as eligible for inclusion in the series.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast construction spending edging up 0.1 percent in March. Construction spending dropped 0.8 percent on a year-on-year basis in March. 
March's weak construction spending as well as downward revisions to January and February outlays suggest the government's initial estimate of first-quarter gross domestic product published last week could be revised lower.
Increased state and local government spending on roads and highways helped to lift GDP growth to a 3.2 percent annualized rate in the first quarter, according to the advance estimate. The economy grew at a 2.2 percent pace in the October-December period.
In March, investment in public construction projects fell 1.3 percent after rising 3.2 percent in the prior month. Spending on state and local government construction projects dropped 1.1 percent after advancing 3.4 percent in February.
Outlays on federal government construction projects tumbled 2.7 percent after increasing 1.4 percent in February. 
Spending on private construction projects dropped 0.7 percent in March to the lowest level since August 2017, after slipping 0.2 percent in the prior month. Private construction outlays have now declined for three straight months.
Investment in private residential projects plunged 1.8 percent to the lowest level since December 2016, after falling 0.4 percent in February. The housing market has struggled, with spending on homebuilding contracting for five straight quarters.
With mortgage rates declining from last year's lofty levels, the outlook for the housing market is improving, though land and labor shortages remain a challenge.
Spending on private nonresidential structures, which includes manufacturing and power plants, rose 0.5 percent in March after climbing 0.1 percent in February.

April's robust figure might be overstating the strength of the jobs sector due to technical factors, said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics which jointly developed the employment report with ADP (NASDAQ:ADP).
Job growth last month was likely in the 175,000 to 200,000 range, which is the current consensus range among economists, Zandi said on a conference call with reporters.
Economists surveyed by Reuters had forecast the ADP National Employment Report would show a gain of 180,000 jobs, with estimates ranging from 141,000 to 225,000.
Private payroll gains in the month earlier were revised up to 151,000 from an originally reported 129,000 increase.
While the overall labor market is ""fine,"" it is slowing, Zandi said.
The ADP figures come ahead of the U.S. Labor Department's more comprehensive non-farm payrolls report at 8:30 a.m. (1230 GMT) on Friday, which includes both public and private-sector employment.
Economists polled by Reuters are looking for U.S. private payroll employment to have grown by 180,000 jobs in April, down from 182,000 the month before. Total non-farm employment is expected to have changed by 185,000.

It was the largest increase since July, when the private sector added 284,000 jobs. Economists had expected the report to show a gain of 181,000 jobs.

SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea's exports contracted less in April than in the previous month, but the fifth straight of month of shrinkage, with memory chip shipments down 13.5 percent, could hurt chances of the trade-reliant economy returning to growth this quarter.
April exports fell 2.0 percent from a year earlier, government data showed on Wednesday. That was less than the 5 percent decline forecast in a Reuters poll and March's 8.2 percent drop.
Policymakers worry that the trade dispute between Washington and Beijing could cause collateral damage for South Korea, especially as Asia's fourth largest economy suffered an unexpected contraction in the first quarter on slumping exports and investment. 
Gross domestic product (GDP) in the first quarter declined a seasonally adjusted 0.3 percent from October-December, the worst contraction since a 3.3 percent drop in late 2008.
The trade ministry said slowing Chinese growth and weaker global demand for Korea's memory chips resulted in further declines in exports in April.
It also said April exports would have expanded 0.8 percent from a year earlier if not for the 13.5 percent drop in memory chips. 
""The huge price drop in memory chips, adjustment of inventories at global IT companies, as well as stalled consumer demand for new smartphones in China"" have slowed semiconductor exports in April, the ministry said.
Shipments to China, South Korea's biggest trading partner, fell 4.5 percent, making a sixth consecutive monthly fall.
However, U.S.-bound exports rose for a seventh consecutive month, helped by a boost in demand for Korean cars and mobile phones. 
""Exports are likely to recover in the coming months as demand from China recovers. The chip sector will also likely see a rebound in demand,"" said Chun Kyu-yeon, an economist at Hana Financial Investment.
Imports increased 2.4 percent from a year earlier, compared with the poll prediction of 0.3 percent. This led to a preliminary trade surplus of $4.12 billion, down from $5.2 billion in March. 

South Korean markets are closed on Wednesday for a holiday.

1348,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 30, 2019 10:14PM ET</span>","New Zealand jobless rate falls, but tepid wage and employment data hit currency","WELLINGTON (Reuters) - New Zealand's jobless rate edged lower in the first quarter, taking it close to the decade-low reached last year, but sluggish wage growth and a drop in employment indicated a softer growth outlook, sending the currency sliding.
After Wednesday's release of job market data, the New Zealand dollar dropped 0.5 percent to $0.6638 from around $0.6675, as some in the market factored in an increased probability of an interest rate cut.
The currency later settled at $0.6648.
The chance of a cut in the official cash rate (OCR) has increased in recent months, as the Reserve Bank of New Zealand grapples with the prospect of a weak economic momentum amid slowing global growth.
The RBNZ, which has a policy meeting on May 8, in March indicated its next move was more likely to be a cut in the OCR than a hike.
Data from Statistics New Zealand showed the unemployment rate slipped to 4.2 percent in January-March, just below the previous quarter's 4.3 percent, and in line with expectations of economists polled by Reuters. The jobless rate dropped to a 10-year low in the quarter ending in September 2018.
But the drop in the jobless rate stemmed from fewer people participating in the workforce, as the participation rate fell to 70.4 percent compared to a Reuters poll expectation of 70.9 percent.
The number of jobs dropped 0.2 percent, in contrast to the poll's forecast of a 0.5 percent increase.
ANZ senior economist Miles Workman said the data is consistent with the softer growth outlook that implicitly lies behind the RBNZ’s dovish position.
In a note, Workman said he continues to expect a rate cut in August, ""with next week's monetary policy statement to set the stage"".
Other analysts have said they expect a rate cut at next week's meeting. 
New Zealand business sentiment remained gloomy in April, providing further cause for the RBNZ to consider rate cuts. 
SOFTENING EMPLOYMENT
The employment rate, which reflects the number of people employed as a share of the working-age population, fell to 67.5 percent in the March 2019 quarter from 67.8 percent three months earlier.
This reflected a fall in the number of people employed and a rise in the working-age population, Stats NZ said.
""New Zealand has seen a softening of economic growth as measured by gross domestic product over the last six months, and we now are seeing that softening come through the employment rate,"" labor market and household statistics senior manager Jason Attewell said in a statement.
Wages grew 0.3 percent from the previous quarter, compared to a Reuters poll expectation of 0.5 percent, and annual growth was 2.0 percent versus a prediction of 2.1 percent.

""We expect further increases in wage growth to be gradual, with the peak in capacity pressures now behind us,"" said ANZ's Workman.

Ireland's fast-growing economy has weathered the uncertainty created by the June 2016 vote, with the impact so far mainly limited to a ramping up of pre-production inventories in recent months ahead of the original end of March date for Britain's departure from the bloc.
However, the AIB manufacturing purchasing managers' index slipped to 52.5 in April from 53.9 in March, the lowest level in two-and-a-half years, as panelists reported weaker demand from home and abroad.
""The reading of 52.5 is still consistent with solid growth in the sector. Despite falling in April, the Irish manufacturing PMI continues to outperform its Eurozone counterpart, with stood at 47.8 in its first reading in April,"" AIB Chief Economist Oliver Mangan said.
Mangan also pointed to the fact that another month of growth extended the run of consecutive expansion to almost six years, while the sector slumped to a similar level in January before bouncing back.

Attempts to mitigate any potential supply disruptions from Brexit also continued in April with holdings of post-production inventories increasing at the fastest rate in the 21-year series history.

1350,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 30, 2019 08:10PM ET</span>","Australia home price slide slows, may be 'past worst'","SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia's long decline in home prices continued in April amid lackluster demand and tight credit, though the pace of losses eased as auction clearance rates stabilized in the major cities.
This constant erosion of household wealth is one reason the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) is under pressure to cut interest rates at its next policy meeting on May 7.
It is also a sore spot for the Liberal National government as it fights a close election campaign ahead of a vote on May 18. The opposition Labor Party has vowed to remove some tax breaks for property investors, arguing they put home occupiers at a disadvantage.
Wednesday's report from property consultant CoreLogic showed home prices nationally fell 0.5 percent in April from March, when they dropped 0.6 percent. The pace of decline has been gradually slowing since December when prices slid 1.1 percent.
""The current trend in the data implies that housing market conditions may have moved through the worst of the downturn,"" said CoreLogic's head of research Tim Lawless.
Values nationally were down 7.2 percent on the year. In the major capital cities, prices fell 0.5 percent on the month and 8.4 percent for the year.
The slower pace of decline came as auction clearance rates have stabilized over the last few months, particularly in the hardest-hit markets of Sydney and Melbourne.
Prices still fell by 0.7 percent in Sydney in April, but that followed a 0.9 percent drop in March. Values in Melbourne likewise eased by a smaller 0.6 percent.
Values nationally have fallen 7.9 percent from their peak in October 2017, though they are still more than 15 percent higher than five years ago.
The fall has been a drag on household wealth given the housing stock is valued at A$6.8 trillion ($4.83 trillion), or almost four times the country's annual gross domestic product.
Financial markets are wagering the RBA will have to respond by cutting rates from already record lows of 1.5 percent, particularly given a recent disappointingly low reading for first quarter inflation.

Futures markets imply around a 36 percent chance of a rate cut as soon as next week and a move to 1.25 percent is fully priced in by July.

The British Retail Consortium (BRC) and market research group Nielsen said shop prices were 0.4 percent higher than a year ago in April, compared with 0.9 percent in March.
""There were more than double the number of product lines on discount this month compared to the previous, as retailers hope to recover ground after March's disappointing sales figures,"" BRC chief executive Helen Dickinson said.
Clothing and footwear saw the most widespread discounts, followed by home improvement goods and fresh food.
The official measure of annual consumer price inflation - which covers a much wider range of goods and services - stood at 1.9 percent in March, close to the two-year low of 1.8 percent struck in January.

The BRC collected price data between April 1 and April 5, two weeks before the Easter holiday weekend which typically brings a boost to consumer spending.

After projected 5.3 percent growth in 2018, the region's economies are expected to expand at a slower pace of 5.1 percent in 2019 and 5.0 percent in 2020, the ASEAN+3 Macroeconomic Research Office (AMRO) said in a report.
The region includes China, South Korea, Japan and the 10 countries in the Association of South East Asian Nations.
""The region will undoubtedly be tested amid growing headwinds from slowing global trade. Uncertainties surrounding trade remain high, and the risk of further escalation in trade tensions frictions cannot be discounted"", according to the ASEAN+3 Regional Economic Outlook 2019 report.
Growth in China is forecast to cool further this year, with the world's second-largest economy seen expanding 6.3 percent, down from 6.6 percent last year, the report said. Growth in 2020 is expected to dip again to 6.2 percent.
China has a 6.0-6.5 percent growth goal this year.
Washington and China are working to hammer out a deal to ease their tit-for-tat tariffs dispute, which have cost the world's two largest economies billions of dollars, roiled markets and disrupted manufacturing and supply chains.
The U.S. government is pressing for an end to practices and policies it argues have given Chinese firms unfair advantages, including subsidizing of industry, limits on access for foreign companies and alleged theft of intellectual property.
""There is little room for complacency on the policy front, given that downside risks have become more pronounced"", AMRO said as it called on authorities to be ready to ""recalibrate"" monetary and fiscal policies to support growth and preserve financial stability.
Given that inflationary pressures are relatively subdued, AMRO said policymakers have some room for maneuver.
Headline inflation in the region is forecast at 2.1 percent this year, from an estimated 2.0 percent last year, and ease to 1.9 percent in 2020, AMRO said.
AMRO said the region could lose 0.4 percentage points of growth over a two-year period if its adverse scenario - both the U.S. and China impose tariffs of 25 percent on all imports between the two countries - materializes.
AMRO was established in Singapore in April 2011 as a surveillance unit to monitor economies in the region and granted status by ASEAN+3 members as an international organization in 2016.
It conducts macroeconomic surveillance and supports the implementation of a multi-billion dollar regional currency swap arrangement called the Chiang Mai Initiative Multilateralization (CMIM).

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. labor costs increased steadily in the first quarter as a jump in transportation and manufacturing wages was offset by small gains elsewhere, pointing to moderate inflation pressures even as the labor market tightens.
Other data on Tuesday showed a rebound in consumer confidence this month amid growing labor market optimism. While house prices increased at their slowest pace since 2012 in February, slowing house price inflation is stimulating demand for homes.
The signs of the economy's brightening prospects and benign price pressures came as Federal Reserve officials began a two-day policy meeting on Tuesday.
Citing cross-currents facing the economy, the U.S. central bank in March dropped its forecasts for any rate increases this year, halting a three-year policy tightening campaign. The Fed raised borrowing costs four times in 2018. 
Inflation has retreated further from the Fed's 2 percent target, catching the attention of President Donald Trump, who has been critical of the central bank's past rate hikes. Trump tweeted on Tuesday that the economy could go ""up like a rocket if we did some lowering of rates, like one point, and some quantitative easing.""
While economists agree that inflation is low, most do not believe the Fed should be easing monetary policy. 
""Inflation really isn't an issue right now, it looks like the outlook for growth is strengthening,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG in New York. ""At this stage, the Fed can stay on the sidelines and rate cuts at this juncture are premature.""
The Employment Cost Index, the broadest measure of labor costs, rose 0.7 percent after advancing by the same margin in the fourth quarter, the Labor Department said. That lowered the year-on-year rate of increase in the ECI to 2.8 percent. Labor costs rose 2.9 percent in the fourth quarter, which was the largest gain since June 2008.
The first-quarter rise in the ECI was in line with economists' expectations. The ECI is widely viewed as one of the better measures of labor market slack. It is also considered a better predictor of core inflation.
The government reported on Monday that the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index excluding the volatile food and energy components increased 1.6 percent in the 12 months through March, the smallest increase since January 2018 and down from 1.7 percent in February. The so-called core PCE index is the Fed's preferred inflation measure.
The dollar fell against a basket of currencies, while prices of U.S. Treasuries rose. Wall Street's main stock indexes were trading mixed after hitting record highs in the previous session.
CONFIDENCE PERKS UP
In separate report on Tuesday, the Conference Board said its consumer confidence index rose to a reading of 129.2 this month from 124.2 in March. That jump strengthened the view that consumer spending will accelerate after growing at its slowest pace in a year in the first quarter.
""The Fed puts more store in consumer confidence as a predictor of consumer spending behavior, and from this perspective the Fed should be reassured that the second quarter looks strong on the consumer spending front,"" said John Ryding, chief economist at RDQ Economics in New York.
The survey's so-called labor market differential, derived from data about respondents saying jobs are scarce or plentiful, jumped to 33.5 percent from 28.7 percent in March.
This measure closely correlates to the unemployment rate in the Labor Department's employment report. The rise in labor market differential together with dwindling numbers of people on unemployment rolls raises the possibility the jobless rate could drop in April from its current level of 3.8 percent. The government will publish its April employment report on Friday.
But consumers' inflation expectations fell this month. With the labor market continuing to tighten, there is optimism wage growth will pick up a notch this year. There is growing anecdotal evidence of companies struggling to find workers. 
In the first quarter, wages and salaries, which account for 70 percent of employment costs, increased 0.7 percent after rising 0.6 percent in the prior period. Wages and salaries were up 2.9 percent in the 12 months through March. That followed a 3.1 percent gain in the year through December.
There were strong wage gains in the manufacturing, construction and transportation industries, but compensation slowed in the professional and business services, education and health services sectors as well as in the leisure and hospitality industry.
A third report on Tuesday showed the S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller composite home price index of 20 U.S. metropolitan areas rose 3.0 percent in February from a year ago. That was the smallest gain since September 2012 and followed a 3.5 percent increase in January. 
Growth in house prices has slowed from as high as 6.8 percent in March 2018. The moderation in prices followed an ebb in demand after mortgage rates spiked last year. Mortgage rates have since declined. That, together with lower prices, is helping stimulate demand for homes, though supply remains tight.
A fourth report from the National Association of Realtors showed contracts to buy previously owned homes rebounded 3.8 percent to an eight-month high in March after dropping 1.0 percent in February.

""As long as mortgage rates remain near current levels, sales activity should trend higher this year, although low inventory levels will likely cap housing sector expansion to some degree,"" said Ben Ayers, senior economist at Nationwide in Columbus, Ohio.

ROME (Reuters) - Italy's economy returned to growth in the first quarter of the year, pulling clear of its third recession in a decade, while the unemployment rate receded in March, data showed on Tuesday. 
Gross domestic product rose a quarterly 0.2 percent between January and March, and was up 0.1 percent on an annual basis, national statistics bureau ISTAT reported.
Italian GDP had fallen 0.1 percent in both the third and fourth quarters of last year, putting the euro zone's third largest economy into what economists often call a technical recession of two straight quarters of shrinking output.
The swift return to growth, however tepid, was hailed by the coalition government, which is struggling to keep a lid on both the budget deficit and state debt as it seeks to fulfill election campaign pledges to boost welfare spending.
ISTAT also reported on Tuesday a fall in unemployment in March, with the jobless rate dropping to 10.2 percent from a previous 10.5 percent and youth unemployment down to 30.2 percent -- its lowest reading since October 2011.
Some 60,000 jobs were created last month, while the overall employment rate climbed to 58.9 percent in March from 58.6 percent in February -- its highest level since April 2008.
""These numbers testify to the solidity and stability of the Italian economy,"" Economy Minister Giovanni Tria said. 
The first quarter GDP data beat the average forecast in a Reuters survey of analysts of a 0.1 percent rise quarter-on-quarter and a 0.1 percent decline year-on-year.
Italy once again lagged its euro zone peers, however, with the EU statistics office Eurostat saying economic growth in the 19-nation currency bloc had risen 0.4 percent quarter-on-quarter in the first three months of 2019. 
ISTAT gave no numerical breakdown of components with its preliminary estimate, but said industry, services and agriculture had all shown an increase in activity, with exports helping revive growth.
By contrast weak domestic demand had had a negative impact.
""The Italian economy came out of recession at the start of 2019 in better shape than expected. It is likely that the current quarter may be less dynamic, but the cycle's minimum seems to be behind us,"" said Paolo Mameli with  Intesa Sanpaolo  (MI:ISP).
Data released last month showed that the fall in Italy's fourth quarter GDP was primarily due to a sharp reduction in inventories, while exports, consumer spending and investments all expanded at the end of last year.
Earlier this month, the government of the anti-establishment 5-Star Movement and the right-wing League was forced to slash its forecast for full-year growth to 0.2 percent from a previous target of 1.0 percent.

But Tria said on Tuesday the first quarter data suggested the economy could beat the new forecast so long as the international context proves ""moderately favorable"".

Pending home contracts are seen as a forward-looking indicator of the health of the housing market because they become sales one to two months later.U.S. home sales tumbled in March as rising demand stoked by declining mortgage rates and slowing house price inflation continued to be frustrated by a lack of properties, especially in the lower-priced segment of the market.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The euro zone economy grew more than expected in the first quarter, rebounding from a slump in the second half of 2018, while unemployment fell to its lowest in more than a decade, data showed on Tuesday.

""And indeed, the elderly are also more vulnerable to shocks. While there are still a number of risks (think of trade tensions, higher oil prices and the Brexit uncertainty) the improving international picture is likely to support eurozone exports in the coming months,"" Vanden Houte said.
GDP growth should hover around 0.3 percent in the remainder of the year, he said, below ECB and European Commission forecasts of growth at 0.4 percent in the second half of 2019.
""Not great, but probably the best we can expect in the current stage of the cycle,"" he said.
The ECB, which put off tightening monetary policy at the end of last year amid persistently weak inflation, had expected first-quarter growth of 0.2 percent, accelerating to 0.3 percent in the second quarter.
Separately, Eurostat said that euro zone unemployment fell to 7.7 percent of the workforce in March with 12.630 million people seeking jobs -- the lowest rate since September 2008 -- against 7.8 percent of the workforce or 12.804 million people in February.
The fall in the number of jobless people is likely to eventually put upward pressure on consumer prices. The ECB wants to see inflation below but close to 2 percent over the medium term.
""Today's figures probably haven't made the European Central Bank any wiser,"" ING's Vanden Houte said.
""The economy remains solid enough not to need extra stimulus. But at the same time not much has to go wrong to bring GDP growth to a standstill. In that regard, wait-and-see remains the most likely ECB monetary policy stance,"" he said.

PARIS (Reuters) - The French economy maintained a steady pace of growth in the first three months of the year as household spending recovered after anti-government protests at the end of 2018, official data showed on Tuesday.
The euro zone's second-biggest economy grew 0.3 percent in the January-March period, the third quarter in a row at that rate, the INSEE statistics agency said.
The preliminary GDP reading was in line with the average expectation in a Reuters poll of 27 economists and was just a tad less than the 0.4 percent recorded in the broader euro zone.
Some economists were disappointed that consumer spending had not rebounded more strongly given government pledges to cut taxes and boost pensions in response to the violent ""yellow vest"" street protests over the high cost of living. 
The government outlined a 10 billion euro ($11.18 billion)package in December aimed at boosting the incomes of the poorest workers and pensioners. 
President Emmanuel Macron followed up last week with a pledge to cut income tax by 5 billion euros, after five months of weekly protests.
""At this stage, even though the announced tax measures should contribute to the growth of purchasing power, which already increased significantly in 2018, private consumption growth in 2019 should be barely above 1 percent,"" ING economist Julien Manceaux said.
""Only when households feel they have rebuilt their savings is it likely that these measures will have a stronger acceleration effect on private consumption.""
MORE SPENDING
Household spending, the traditional motor of French growth, grew 0.4 percent in the first quarter after stalling in the final three months of 2018, when spending was hit by some of the angriest street protests seen in decades.
INSEE said the improvement was seen particularly in services, with spending in hotels and restaurants recovering after a drop in tourist numbers in December due to the protests.
Meanwhile, business investment picked up only marginally, growing 0.5 percent after 0.4 percent in the fourth quarter, when the unrest weighed heavily on business confidence.
Exports grew only 0.1 percent in the first quarter, slowing after an end-of-year rush to deliver Airbus aircraft pushed up deliveries in the fourth quarter. 
Import growth thus easily outpaced exports at 0.9 percent, which meant foreign trade subtracted 0.3 percentage points from growth. That was offset, however, by firms rebuilding inventories, which boosted output by 0.3 percent.

1360,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 30, 2019 05:40AM ET</span>","German inflation accelerates to ECB target in April, state data suggests","BERLIN (Reuters) - Annual inflation in Europe's largest economy accelerated in April toward the European Central Bank's target, data from German states suggested on Tuesday, but the rise may be due to one-off price rises around the Easter holiday.
The ECB aims to keep inflation in the euro zone close to, but just below, 2 percent a year. Inflation has long been below this target in the single currency bloc, and ECB rate-setter Olli Rehn said on Friday that investors may be doubting the effectiveness of the ECB's monetary policy measures in boosting inflation.
A poll conducted before the release of the regional data suggested annual German consumer price inflation, harmonized to compare with data from other European Union countries, would rise to 1.7 percent from 1.4 percent.
After data from the states was published, ING economist Carsten Brzeski said he expected harmonized nationwide annual inflation - due to be published at 1200 GMT - to show a 1.9 percent increase.
In North Rhine-Westphalia (NRW), Germany's most populous state, consumer price inflation accelerated to 2.1 percent from 1.5 percent. Price pressures picked up in four other states too.
This acceleration is, however, largely due to the cost of package holidays going up, with Easter falling later this year than last, and partly due to higher fuel prices, but inflation will likely slow again next month, Brzeski said.
""There is no reason to draw any conclusions because we see this Easter fluctuation every year, which means there is no real big shift in core inflation, so for the ECB, in terms of any impact on policy decisions, it's close to zero,"" he said.
Economists expect annual euro zone inflation - due to be published on May 3 - to accelerate to 1.6 percent from 1.4 percent in March.

The state inflation readings, which are not harmonized to compare with other euro zone countries, feed into nationwide preliminary inflation data.

Gross domestic product increased 0.4 percent in the three months through March, Eurostat said on Tuesday. That’s the fastest in three quarters. Activity in the 19-nation currency bloc was helped by strong investment in Spain and buoyant consumer spending in France.
While the region’s growth rate was below the average of the past five years, it marks the second quarterly acceleration since a downturn in trade and factory activity pulled the economy close to a standstill last summer. Some countries in the bloc have yet to experience a meaningful turnaround, with Germany expected to see the weakest expansion in six years.
Business confidence continued to soften in April, and the European Central Bank has already said it won’t raise interest rates this year. Policy makers have expressed mixed feelings about whether a rebound initially penciled in for the second half will pan out. More evidence of weakness across the region could force them to make recently announced stimulus tools more accommodative to support growth.
While resilience in Spain and France provides a brightening picture for the region, external trade conflicts and homegrown difficulties, notably an upheaval in Germany’s car industry, have yet to clear. Italy has been in recession in the second half of 2018. GDP data at 12 p.m. will show whether that slump has ended.

1362,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 30, 2019 12:26AM ET</span>",China April factory growth unexpectedly slows as economy struggles for traction,"By Stella Qiu and Ryan Woo
BEIJING (Reuters) - Factory activity in China expanded for a second straight month in April but at a much slower pace than expected, an official survey showed on Tuesday, suggesting the economy is still struggling for traction despite a flurry of support measures.
The unexpected loss of momentum at the start of the second quarter followed upbeat data in March which had raised hopes among global investors that the world's second-largest economy was getting back on firmer footing.
A private business survey on Tuesday also pointed to a loss of momentum, confounding expectations for a pick-up, with factories starting to shed jobs again after adding staff in March for the first time in years.
The weak manufacturing readings, along with softer construction growth, could stoke debate over how much more stimulus China needs to generate a sustainable recovery, without risking a rapid jump in debt. 
The official Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) for manufacturing fell to 50.1 in April from March's reading of 50.5, which was the first expansion in four months, data from the statistics bureau showed.
It hovered just above the neutral 50-point mark which separates expansion from contraction on a monthly basis. Analysts surveyed by Reuters had forecast the PMI to match March's 50.5.
""For now, the official PMIs suggest that Q2 got off to a weaker start and reinforce our view that there are still some downside risks to near-term activity,"" Julian Evans-Pritchard, senior China economist at Capital Economics, said in a research note.
Shares in much of Asia fell after the data, while the Chinese yuan and the Australian dollar wilted. China's slowdown has weighed heavily on exports of many of its trading partners and sales of multinational firms from Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) to industrial conglomerate 3M (NYSE:MMM).
While the official factory survey disappointed on the growth front, it did not show a marked deterioration in business conditions, either. Output expanded at a slower but still moderate pace, while growth in new orders eased only slightly.
Some analysts had expected a pullback in the PMIs, arguing that March's more upbeat readings were likely due in part to one-off factors, such as changes in production and purchasing patterns ahead of a cut in value-added tax rates on April 1.
A spokesperson for the statistics bureau said earlier this month that many firms had brought forward purchases of input materials ahead of the tax change in order to increase their tax deductions. Indeed, a PMI sub-index for inventories of raw materials retreated significantly from March's seven-month high. 
A gauge of construction activity fell to 60.1 from 61.7 in March, still solid but possibly indicating that the government's infrastructure push may be losing steam despite a burst of bond issuance and new bank lending at the start of the year, analysts said.
To counter the slowdown, Beijing has ramped up fiscal stimulus this year, unveiling tax and fee cuts amounting to 2 trillion yuan ($297 billion) to ease burdens on firms, while allowing local governments to issue 2.15 trillion yuan of special bonds to fund infrastructure projects.
Analysts have cautioned it will take time for those measures to fully kick in, with most not expecting the economy to convincingly stabilize until around mid-year. 
Another official survey on Tuesday showed growth in China's services industry also cooled in April, though it remained in solid expansionary territory. 
EYES ON TRADE DEAL
While new factory orders remained sluggish, there were some encouraging signs on the export front.
The official index for export orders continued to contract, but hit its highest level in eight months, as optimism grows that Beijing and Washington will reach a trade deal in coming weeks which could ease pressure on Chinese exporters.
President Donald Trump said on Thursday that he would soon host Chinese leader Xi Jinping at the White House, setting the stage for a possible agreement on trade between the world's two largest economies.
U.S. Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin told the New York Times that negotiations are in ""the final laps"" as he and Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer prepared to fly to Beijing for more talks this week.
ENCOURAGING SIGNS
Despite the disappointing factory readings, analysts say there are signs that earlier growth-boosting measures are starting to percolate through the system. 
The official PMI survey showed small and mid-sized manufacturers continued to fare worse than larger companies, many of which are state-controlled. But small manufacturers' activity improved to a six-month high, suggesting that policymakers' efforts to support the struggling private sector are starting to bear fruit.
Big state-run banks have been told to increase lending to smaller firms by 30 percent this year, even if it risks more bad loans, and the central bank has been guiding shorter-term money market interest rates lower.
Profits may already be turning the corner. China's industrial firms reported higher earnings in March after four months of contraction.
Better-than-expected March data had prompted a major shift in the market's expectations for more stimulus this year, with analysts and investors scaling back forecasts for the timing and size of further support measures.
After the drop in April's PMIs, ""Beijing can't afford to stop easing,"" economists at Nomura said.
China's economy grew at a steady 6.4 percent pace in the first quarter, defying expectations for a further slowdown.
While analysts believe stimulus will put a floor under growth eventually, they are not predicting a strong rebound as seen in China in the past, noting Beijing's support measures so far have been relatively more restrained.

Economic growth is expected to slow to a near 30-year low of 6.2 percent this year, down from 6.6 percent in 2018, a recent Reuters poll showed.

1366,By Bloomberg,"<span>Apr 29, 2019 08:40PM ET</span>",U.S. Farmer Income Drops Most Since 2016 as Trade War Losses Mount,"(Bloomberg) -- Personal income for farmers fell by the most in three years in the first quarter, as losses to U.S. agriculture mount from President Donald Trump’s trade wars.
The Commerce Department on Monday cited the steep decline in farm proprietors’ income as a key factor weighing on the nation’s overall personal income growth in March, even though agricultural producers represent only about 2 percent of total employed Americans.
The report provided fresh evidence of the growing financial strain on U.S. farmers hit by the trade war, low commodity prices and a series of natural disasters including spring floods in the Midwest. With rural voters a key part of Trump’s electoral coalition, it also underscores the political pressure to conclude the China trade war as U.S. negotiators begin another round of talks in Beijing this week.
One-time subsidy payments from the Trump administration to compensate producers for some of their trade-war losses helped prop up farm income in the previous quarter, but earnings plunged by an annualized $11.8 billion in the January to March period, according to seasonally adjusted data. On Monday, Larry Kudlow, President Trump’s top economic adviser, said the White House is prepared to do more to help agriculture.
Trump’s budget cuts would lower federal subsidies for crop insurance and small growers. The spending plan for 2020 he submitted for Congress would reduce subsidies for crop insurance premiums to 48 percent from 62 percent and limit current subsidies for growers who make less than $500,000 annually.
Even prior to the trade disputes, U.S. producers were struggling with lower commodity prices. The financial impact has spread across rural America as farmers cut back on purchases from local tractor dealers and other suppliers.
Still, the data can be volatile and factors in inventories.
A spike in December income, for example, was “likely a function of gyrations in federal subsidy payments” because of the administration’s one-time aid program to compensate farmers for trade war losses, Stephen Stanley, chief economist for Amherst Pierpont Securities, said in note to clients.
Trump has promised his trade wars will eventually be a boon for farmers.
“We’re doing trade deals that are going to get you so much business, you’re not even going to believe it,” he told a cheering crowd at American Farm Bureau Federation’s annual meeting in New Orleans in January.

1367,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 29, 2019 07:25PM ET</span>","UK consumers unfazed by Brexit storm, firms more upbeat: surveys","LONDON (Reuters) - British consumers were unruffled by the latest twists and turns in the country's Brexit drama and companies have dialed down their worry levels, two surveys published on Tuesday showed.
The GfK consumer confidence index - which was conducted mostly in the run-up to a Brexit deadline that was eventually pushed back, the second such delay since March - held steady for a third month at -13 in April.
Spending by Britain's consumers has helped soften a slowdown in the overall economy, thanks to a combination of low unemployment, rising wages and modest inflation.
By contrast, employers have displayed more concern and they cut back on investment throughout 2018.
While a business confidence survey published by Lloyds (LON:LLOY) Bank rose for a second month in April - up four points to 14 percent - it was below its early 2019 level and its long-term average.
Lloyds said confidence among manufacturing, construction and services firms improved but fell among retailers. 
GfK also pointed to potential problems ahead in the retail sector with its measure of the willingness of consumers to make major purchases down by two points to -1, its lowest level in five months.
The GfK survey was conducted for the European Commission and polled 2,001 Britons between April 1 and 14. The Lloyds survey polled 1,200 firms between April 1 and 16.

The Bank of England is expected to keep interest rates on hold on Thursday but economists are watching for any hints that about raising borrowing costs more quickly than many investors believe, if Britain can avoid a no-deal Brexit.

Output tumbled by an annual 14.4 percent to 126,195 cars in March, the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders said.
Exports, which account for nearly four out of every five cars made in Britain, were down by 13.4 percent.
The SMMT said analysis it had commissioned predicted output would fall this year to 1.36 million units from 1.52 million in 2018, assuming London can secure a transition deal with the EU.
If Britain has to rely instead on World Trade Organization rules for its trade with the bloc, which include import tariffs, output is forecast to fall by around 30 percent to 1.07 million units in 2021, returning to mid-1980s levels, the SMMT said.
The forecasts were produced for SMMT by AutoAnalysis, a consultancy.
Prime Minister Theresa May has secured a delay to the Brexit deadline until Oct. 31, giving her more time to try to break an impasse in parliament over the terms of Britain's departure from the EU.
Foreign minister Jeremy Hunt traveled to Japan earlier this month to try to persuade the Japanese government and Toyota, which has a big presence in Britain, that London was determined to avoid a no-deal Brexit.

1369,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 29, 2019 12:30PM ET</span>","U.S. consumer spending roars back, but inflation tame","By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. consumer spending increased by the most in more than 9-1/2 years in March as households stepped up purchases of motor vehicles, but price pressures remained muted, with a key inflation measure posting its smallest annual gain in 14 months.
The surge in consumer spending reported by the Commerce Department on Monday sets a stronger base for growth in consumption heading into the second quarter after it slowed sharply in the first three months of the year.
It further allayed concerns about the economy's health, which had been brought to the fore by a temporary inversion of the U.S. Treasury yield curve last month. Tame inflation, however, supported the Federal Reserve's recent decision to suspend further interest rate increases this year.
Fed officials are scheduled to meet on Tuesday and Wednesday to assess the economy and deliberate on the future course of monetary policy. The U.S. central bank in March dropped forecasts for any interest rate increases this year, halting a three-year policy tightening campaign. The Fed raised borrowing costs four times in 2018.
""The economy is in a sweet spot for now with not enough inflation to cause the Fed to raise rates, and with inflation not low enough to worry Fed officials that economic demand is weakening, which could require rate cuts,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG in New York. 
Consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, surged 0.9 percent. That was the biggest rise since August 2009 and was also driven by increased healthcare expenditures. Spending rose 0.1 percent in February. 
Data for January was revised up to show consumer spending rising 0.3 percent instead of the previously reported 0.1 percent gain. The release of the February spending data was delayed by a five-week partial shutdown of the federal government that ended on Jan. 25. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast consumer spending jumping 0.7 percent in March. 
When adjusted for inflation, consumer spending increased 0.7 percent in March. This so-called real consumer spending was unchanged in February. The data was included in last Friday's first-quarter gross domestic product report. 
March's surge in real consumer spending suggested an acceleration in consumption was likely in the second quarter. Consumer spending increased at a 1.2 percent annualized rate in the first quarter, the slowest in a year. The overall economy grew at a 3.2 percent rate last quarter.
The dollar was little changed against a basket of currencies, while U.S. Treasury prices fell. Stocks on wall Street rose, lifting the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite to record highs. 
INFLATION BELOW TARGET
In March, spending on goods rebounded 1.7 percent, with outlays on long-lasting manufactured goods such as cars shooting up 2.3 percent. Spending on goods fell 0.5 percent in February. Outlays on services increased 0.5 percent last month, driven by healthcare spending, after rising 0.4 percent in February.
Inflation was benign, with the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index excluding the volatile food and energy components unchanged in March after edging up 0.1 percent in February. That lowered the year-on-year increase in the so-called core PCE price index to 1.6 percent, the smallest increase since January 2018, from 1.7 percent in February.
The core PCE index is the Fed's preferred inflation measure. It hit the central bank's 2 percent inflation target in March last year for the first time since April 2012. 
The low inflation readings caught the attention of the White House, where President Donald Trump has railed against the Fed for tightening monetary policy. Trump has called for rate cuts, tweeting earlier this month that there was ""almost no inflation."" The Trump administration blamed the economy's stumble at the turn of the year on the rate hikes. 
On Monday, White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow said slowing inflation opened the door for possible rate cuts. Economists, however, are not convinced.
""These below-target rates of inflation will likely be acknowledged by the Fed at this week's meeting, but we still think it unlikely that the Fed would be prompted into rate cuts by weak inflation readings alone,"" said Jesse Edgerton, an economist at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) in New York.
With personal income ticking up 0.1 percent in March after rising 0.2 percent in February, there are concerns that the current pace of consumer spending might be unsustainable. Incomes have been almost flat since surging last December. 

But a strong labor market and still very high savings are seen underpinning spending. Wages rose 0.4 percent in March after advancing 0.3 percent in the prior month. Savings fell to $1.03 trillion in March from $1.16 trillion in February.

1370,By Bloomberg,"<span>Apr 29, 2019 08:50AM ET</span>",U.S. March Consumer Spending Picks Up While Core Inflation Cools,"(Bloomberg) -- U.S. consumer spending rebounded in March while the Federal Reserve's preferred underlying inflation gauge eased to a one-year low, reinforcing the central bank's patient stance on interest rates even as the economy's main engine holds up.
Purchases, which make up more than two-thirds of the economy, rose 0.9 percent in March from the prior month, topping estimates, while rising 0.1 percent in February, according to a Commerce Department report Monday that combined two months after delays related to the government shutdown. Personal income rose 0.1 percent in March, less than forecast.
Excluding food and energy, the Fed's preferred core-price gauge was little changed from the previous month, compared with estimates for a 0.1 percent gain. The measure was up 1.6 percent from a year earlier, the slowest since January 2018 and missing projections. The broader personal consumption expenditures price index rose 0.2 percent in March from the previous month and climbed 1.5 percent from a year earlier, also below forecasts.
The signs of consumer strength follow Friday’s gross domestic product report showing consumer spending, the largest chunk of the economy, cooled in the first quarter to a 1.2 percent pace of gains. That was offset by boosts from inventories and trade that helped economic growth accelerate to a 3.2 annualized rate.
The below-forecast price data Monday showed inflation still below the Fed's 2 percent goal despite low unemployment and what most economists see as above-average growth. Policy makers on Wednesday are expected to hold interest rates steady, though new growth and inflation data are likely to affect their characterization of the economy.
Inflation Target
A broader question for the Fed and Chairman Jerome Powell -- who holds a press conference Wednesday -- is how low core inflation could go before the central bank cuts interest rates to maintain the credibility of the 2 percent goal for price gains. President Donald Trump has cited muted inflation as a reason for the Fed to ease monetary policy to keep economic growth strong.
The forecasts in Bloomberg survey had called for March spending to increase 0.7 percent with incomes up 0.4 percent. Economists had forecast the annual inflation gauge would climb 1.6 percent while the core measure advanced 1.7 percent.
Monday’s Commerce Department release included personal spending data for both February and March. The earlier data were delayed because of the federal government shutdown that ended in January. The latest figures reflect a monthly breakdown of data already included in Friday's GDP report.
While the main personal-income figure missed forecasts, wage and salary gains remained solid with a 0.4 percent monthly rise in March following a 0.3 percent increase in February. Lower interest income and farm payments dragged down the headline number, the Commerce Department said.

1371,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 26, 2019 10:15PM ET</span>",China's industrial profits pick up in March with 13.9 percent rise,"BEIJING (Reuters) - Profits at China's industrial firms grew in March, rebounding from four months of contraction, adding to optimism the world's second-largest economy may be starting to stabilize.
A return to profits could add to the debate over how much more stimulus Beijing needs to pump into the economy if it is on the mend. 
Beijing and Washington appear to be edging toward a trade deal, but investors are concerned that a sharp slowdown in China will have repercussions on the wider global economy. 
Profits in March rose 13.9 percent year-on-year to 589.52 billion yuan ($87.62 billion), the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) said on its website on Saturday, recovering from a 14 percent fall in the first two months. 
That marked the biggest monthly increase since July 2018. 
For the first quarter of the year, profits notched up by industrial companies dropped 3.3 percent to 1.3 trillion yuan compared with a year earlier, according to the NBS. 
The growth in March mainly came from an acceleration in production and sales, as well as a recovery of profits in key industrial sectors, Zhu Hong of the statistics bureau said in a statement accompanying the data. 
The pick-up in industrial profits eased concerns about the slowing momentum in China's economy as it has been cooling for the past year, weighed down by a bitter trade dispute with the United States, as well as a campaign to curb debt risks that has led to higher financing costs for companies. 
The government has ramped up stimulus measures this year, announcing billions of dollars in additional tax cuts and infrastructure spending. Growth in China's industrial output increased at the fastest pace since July 2014 in March, while gross domestic product grew 6.4 percent, beating expectations. 
Producer prices, in the meantime, also picked up for the first time in nine months in March, lifted by higher global commodity prices and government efforts to boost domestic demand.
However, there are still concerns about whether the turnarounds will be sustainable, as gains could have been due to seasonal factors - such as the resumption in constructions after the Lunar New Year - instead of a rebound in broader demand. 
Most of China's major steel makers logged smaller earnings in the first quarter due to higher raw material prices and weak demand. 
The country's largest listed steel firm Baoshan Iron & Steel Co Ltd posted its first negative growth since 2015 on Wednesday. Jiangsu Shagang Co Ltd, China's biggest private-owned steel mill, reported a 60.62 percent decrease in its Q1 net profit too. 
Upstream sectors such as mining and metal producers and state-owned firms still dominated the biggest share of profit gains. Profits for oil and natural gas extraction rose 10.3 percent in the first versus a 5.7 percent decline in the January-February period. 
Profits at China's state-owned industrial firms, however, declined 13.4 percent on an annual basis for the first quarter, according to the statistics bureau. 
Liabilities of industrial firms rose 6.5 percent year-on-year as of end-March, the NBS said. 
The data includes companies with annual revenues of more than 20 million yuan from their main operations.

Gross domestic product increased at a 3.2 percent annualized rate in the first quarter, the Commerce Department said in its advance GDP report released on Friday. Growth was also boosted by an increase in government investment. 
But consumer and business spending slowed sharply, and investment in homebuilding contracted for a fifth straight quarter, giving the report a weak tone. 
While the report suggested there is no recession on the horizon, its details painted a picture of an economy that is slowing as the stimulus from the White House's $1.5 trillion tax cut package fades and the effects of past interest rate increases by the Federal Reserve linger. 
Fears of a recession were stoked by a brief inversion of the U.S. Treasury yield curve last month.
""The gain in first-quarter GDP would seem to make a mockery of claims that the U.S. economy is slowing as the fiscal stimulus fades,"" said Paul Ashworth, chief U.S. economist at Capital Economics in Toronto. ""Looking beyond the headline number, however, there are plenty of causes for concern.""
The economy grew at a 2.2 percent pace in the October-December period. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast GDP increasing at a 2.0 percent rate in the first three months of the year. Growth has stepped down from a peak 4.2 percent pace in the second quarter of 2018. The economy will mark 10 years of expansion in July, the longest on record. 
Fed officials are likely to shrug off the surge in growth last quarter and focus on a measure of domestic demand that increased at only a 1.3 percent rate, the slowest since the second quarter of 2013. It increased at a 2.6 percent pace in the October-December quarter.
The Fed recently suspended its three-year monetary policy tightening campaign, dropping forecasts for any rate hikes this year. The U.S. central bank increased borrowing costs four times in 2018.
U.S. Treasury yields jumped after the release of the data before retracing and the U.S. dollar rose against a basket of currencies before reversing course. U.S. stock index futures were trading mixed.
BUSINESS SPENDING STALLS
Exports surged and imports declined in the first quarter, leading to a small deficit that added 1.03 percentage points to GDP after being neutral in the fourth quarter. Trade tensions between the United States and China have caused wild swings in the trade deficit, with exporters and importers trying to stay ahead of the tariff fight between the two economic giants.
The standoff has also had an impact on inventories, which increased at a $128.4 billion rate in the first quarter, the strongest pace since the second quarter of 2015. Inventories increased at a $96.8 billion pace in the October-December quarter. Part of the inventory build was because of weak demand, especially in the automotive sector, which is expected to weigh on future production at factories.
Inventories contributed 0.65 percentage point to first-quarter GDP after adding one-tenth of a percentage point in the October-December period. 
Growth in consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, slowed to a 1.2 percent rate from the fourth quarter's 2.5 percent rate. The moderation in spending reflected a decline in motor vehicle purchases and other goods, likely related to a 35-day shutdown of the federal government. There was also a slowdown in spending on services.
The government said while it could not quantify the full effects of the shutdown, it estimated that reductions in labor services supplied by federal workers and intermediate purchases of goods and services by nondefense agencies had subtracted three-tenths of a percentage point from GDP last quarter.
Business spending on equipment braked sharply, rising at only at a 0.2 percent rate, the slowest since the third quarter of 2016. Spending was held down by weak outlays on agricultural machinery and office furniture. Investment in structures contracted for a third straight quarter.

Residential construction fell at a 2.8 percent rate, marking the fifth straight quarterly decline. Government investment rebounded at a 2.4 percent rate, driven by spending at state and local governments.

Power, LMC Automotive","(Reuters) - U.S. auto sales are expected to drop about 3.5 percent in April from a year-ago period, as rising prices and reduced incentives pinch buyers at the lower end of the spectrum, according to industry consultants J.D. Power and LMC Automotive.
The consultancies see total U.S. vehicle sales of about 1.37 million units in April, while retail sales are expected to drop 5.3 percent to 1,041,600 vehicles, the consultancies said on Friday.
""With the volume contraction focused on the low end of the market, the dip in industry retail sales poses a smaller threat to OEM profitability than headline sales results suggest,"" Thomas King, senior vice-president of the data and analytics division at J.D. Power, said.
Sales of vehicles priced below $20,000 plunged 25 percent from a year-ago period, but demand for vehicles costing $40,000 and above rose 7 percent.
Higher prices and reduced incentives are squeezing younger buyers, who have been affected the most. Among various segments, sales are expected to fall 8 percent among those aged between 16 years and 35 years, compared with a mere 4 percent decline among buyers above 55 years in April.
Transaction prices in April expected to touch $33,695, up about 4 percent from a year-ago period, is also the highest-ever level for the month. Incentive spending has fallen to $3,408 per unit, $300 less than for the same period a year ago.
LMC Automotive, however, maintained its forecast for total light-vehicle sales to 16.9 million units this year, a 2.2 percent fall from 2018.

1375,By Investing.com,"<span>Apr 26, 2019 08:48AM ET</span>","U.S. 1Q GDP Growth Surges, But Devil Is in the Details","Investing.com - Economic growth in the U.S. economy unexpectedly accelerated in the first quarter, although economists warned that the underlying dynamic may not be as positive as the headline number suggested.
The Bureau of Economic Analysis said Friday that gross domestic product registered a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 3.2% growth in the first three months of 2019, above expectations for a reading of 2.0% and an increase from 2.2% in the final three months of last year.
The strong expansion was boosted by inventories and net trade that served to offset a slowdown in consumer spending.
The reading blasted past not only the consensus estimate but settled well above the highest estimate of 2.9% in the most recent Bloomberg survey of economists. The number was particularly remarkable, given headwinds from the government shutdown at the start of the year, and from lingering worries about the still-unresolved trade dispute with China.
U.S. futures immediately saw upside after the release with Dow futures paring earlier losses, S&P futures turning slightly positive and Nasdaq 100 futures extending gains ahead of the open.
However, the dollar eased slightly and bond yields fell as analysts argued that the uptick may not last.
""Fab Q1 GDP print..till you look under the hood and kick the tires,"" Megan Greene, chief economist with Manulife/John Hancock Asset Management, said via Twitter. She argued that the inventory buildup ""will have to be unwound"" dragging on future growth, while government spending outside the defense sector was weak.


.
Prior to Friday’s publication, growth had been steadily slowing in the U.S. economy since a peak of 4.2% in the second quarter of 2018.
Coupled with a gloomier outlook for the global economy and muted inflation stateside, the Federal Reserve opted to take a pause from policy tightening in January.
Policymakers are set to meet next week and markets do not expect any changes to official interest rates. But financial markets price in a more than 50% chance that the Fed will in fact cut rates by the end of the year, even after the data release.
For some, however, that was a step too far.
""Simple point is that this does not even vaguely make the case for a Fed rate cut,"" said ADM ISI strategist Marc Ostwald."

The Confederation of British Industry's (CBI) quarterly survey of the manufacturing industry showed expectations for export orders in the next three months fell to their lowest level since mid-2009, when Britain was reeling from the global financial crisis.

1377,By Bloomberg,"<span>Apr 26, 2019 12:30AM ET</span>","Singapore’s Economy Will Slow in 2019, Says Central Bank","(Bloomberg) -- Singapore’s economy will slow in 2019, reflecting a weakening in key trading partners and a further cooling of the electronics sector, the central bank said.
The city state is set to expand slightly below the midpoint of a 1.5 percent to 3.5 percent forecast range for this year after growing 3.2 percent in 2018, the Monetary Authority of Singapore said in its Macroeconomic Review on Friday. The expansion will come in slightly below Singapore’s potential growth after two years of outpacing that yardstick, according to the report.
“Global growth eased considerably in Q4 2018 as a deceleration in China rippled out to other economies via weaker trade flows, exacerbated by trade tensions,” according to the report, which is released twice a year and contextualizes MAS policy decisions. “This has carried over into 2019.”
Inflation should also step down this year, due to domestic electricity market liberalization, more subdued oil prices, and generally benign external price pressures, the report said. The authority’s core inflation gauge is set to slide to the middle of a revised 1 percent to 2 percent range.
The more subdued forecasts reflect a global outlook that has soured since the end of last year. The MAS sees slower domestic growth heavily influenced by weakening in its key trading partners, with final demand impact from China, the ASEAN-5 economies, the Euro area, and the U.S. accounting for about 30 percent of Singapore’s GDP.
While the impact of the slowdown in China, Singapore’s biggest trading partner, will weigh heavily, a downturn in the tech cycle also will drag on the city state. After the electronics industry bolstered overall trade over the prior two years, global chip sales turned to negative year-on-year growth in December and should remain soft this year amid oversupply and a weakening Chinese market, the MAS reported.
At the same time, Singapore’s labor market should remain firm on the back of a broadening in employment growth in the second half of last year. The MAS sees particular strength in information and communications technology roles amid a national push for digitalization.
The MAS kept monetary policy unchanged earlier this month, in line with an ongoing global trend in monetary policy pauses as growth and inflation under-perform. The MAS retained a cautionary tone about U.S.-China trade friction.
“Trade tensions remain a key downside risk for the economic outlook, although the risks could come on the upside as well: a meaningful reduction in tensions would boost confidence and spur investment,” according to the report.

1378,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 25, 2019 10:40PM ET</span>",Japan's March factory output decline flags risk of GDP contraction,"By Stanley White
TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's industrial output fell in January-March at the fastest pace in almost five years, suggesting the economy may post a mild contraction in the first quarter as manufacturers struggle with the U.S.-Sino trade war.
However, economists say any decline in Japanese GDP is likely to be temporary as Washington and Beijing edge toward an agreement to end punitive tariffs and China's economy shows signs of stabilization due to government stimulus.
The sharp decline in Japan's output highlights the extent of the damage caused by the trade war, but economists are optimistic the world's third-largest economy can quickly bounce back as global growth remains on relatively firm footing.
""The first quarter looks like a contraction, because output, exports, and business investment are all likely to be weak,"" said Hiroaki Muto, chief economist at Tokai Tokyo Research Center.
""Still, we already see a turnaround in China, and that will lift manufacturing globally. The worst is already over for Japan, so I would not get pessimistic."" 
Industrial output in January-March tumbled 2.6 percent, the biggest decline since April-June 2014, data from the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) showed on Friday. That followed a 1.4 percent expansion in the previous quarter.
On a monthly basis, output fell 0.9 percent in March, more than a median estimate for a 0.1 percent decline in a Reuters poll of economists, and versus a 0.7 percent rise in February.
The mounting pressure on Japan's economy from weak external demand has hurt exports and threatens corporate profits, which could weigh on capital expenditure in the first quarter, analysts say.
March industrial output fell due to a 3.4 percent decline in car output and a 6.7 percent drop in the production of machines used to make semiconductors and flat-panel displays, the data showed.
In another source of concern, inventories rose 1.6 percent in March, the fastest increase in a year, due to higher inventories of metals, plastics, and heavy equipment.
The rise in inventories suggests makers of these goods could curb output in the future.
Manufacturers surveyed by the ministry expect production to rise 2.7 percent in April and 3.6 percent in May, but a METI official said it downgraded its assessment of output to say it is weakening recently. 
Japan's exports weakened at the start of the year as Washington and Beijing slapped tariffs on each other's goods in a dispute over the U.S. trade deficit. Japanese companies are exposed because they sell a lot electronic parts and manufacturing equipment to companies in China.
The trade war initially caused China's economy to wobble, but the world's second-largest economy defied expectations for a slowdown in the first quarter, raising hope for other countries that rely on Chinese demand. South Korea's export-reliant economy, however, unexpectedly shrank in the first quarter as companies slashed investment and trade slumped.
Separate data on Friday showed Japan's retail sales - a key gauge of private consumption that makes up about 60 percent of the economy - rose 1.0 percent in March from a year earlier, more than a 0.8 percent annual gain expected by economists.
Friday's batch of data comes a day after the Bank of Japan said it would keep interest rates low for at least another year, in a move to dispel uncertainty over its commitment to support the economy and drive inflation.
Japanese policymakers are nervously monitoring developments overseas but have few policy options if weakness in the global economy continues to damage the country's outlook, some economists say.
Additional data on Friday showed Japan's jobless rate edged up to 2.5 percent in March from 2.3 percent previously, and job availability held steady at 1.63 per applicant, hovering at a 44-year high.

Tokyo's core consumer price index (CPI), which includes oil products but excludes fresh food prices, rose an annual 1.3 percent in April from a year earlier, more than the median estimate for a 1.1 percent annual increase.

The reading on the world’s third-largest economy comes a day after South Korea, a bellwether for world trade and technology, surprised markets in reporting its biggest contraction of GDP in a decade, signaling that the worst of the global slowdown may not have passed.
Japan needs to see a healthy recovery in exports and industrial output ahead of a long-delayed sales-tax increase set for October. The Bank of Japan again highlighted the risks from the hike in guidance on interest rates after its policy meeting Thursday, pledging to keep rates extremely low through at least spring 2020 in the face of ""high uncertainties.""
Japan’s factory output slid 0.9 percent in March from a month earlier, compared with the median estimate of economists of no change, according to data from the trade and industry ministry Friday. Production during the first quarter slid 2.6 percent from the previous three months, the biggest decline in nearly five years.
Separately, core inflation in Tokyo, an early indicator of nationwide prices, accelerated to 1.3 percent in April, the highest in four years. Economists had estimated 1.1 percent. Inflation in Tokyo was expected to have benefited as the prices of food and restaurant meals went up at the start of the new fiscal year on April 1.
Retail sales rose 0.2 percent in March from the previous month, slightly better than expectations from economists for no change, while the jobless rate ticked up to 2.5 percent.
What Bloomberg’s Economists Say
""Key risks to the outlook are U.S. protectionism and political instability in Europe. The former would hurt Japan’s exports that feed into global supply chains, as well as autos. The latter could spur the yen up on safe-haven demand -- denting exports.""
--Yuki Masujima, Japan economistClick here to read more
The global slowdown, trade tensions and Japan’s sputtering growth are all contributing to speculation that Prime Minister Shinzo Abe might postpone the tax increase for a third time. The last increase, in 2014, sent consumption into a tailspin, triggering a contraction in the economy.
Meanwhile, Japan is trying to fend off possible U.S. auto tariffs in bilateral trade negotiations with the U.S. this week. Abe is scheduled to meet President Donald Trump on Friday, while Finance Minister Taro Aso has been in talks with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Economy Minister Toshimitsu Motegi held discussions with Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer.
The U.S. is pushing to cut its trade deficit with Japan and gain better access to its agriculture market. Japan is looking for a promise that it won’t be hit by possible U.S. tariffs on autos imports, after Trump last year imposed similar duties on steel and aluminum.
After Friday’s data release, Capital Economics estimated that the Japanese economy would shrink 0.6 percent in the first quarter from the previous three months. ""Further ahead, we think that a strong rebound in activity in the second quarter is not on the cards,"" Asia economist Darren Aw wrote in a note.
The median of forecasts of economists surveyed by Bloomberg -- taken before the output data release -- was for GDP to eke out a 0.1 percent gain in the first quarter. Estimates ranged from a 2.1 percent contraction to 2.0 percent growth.
Yet the global economy is still expected to pick up in the second half of the year, BOJ Governor Haruhiko Kuroda said Thursday, while noting that risks to inflation and the economy were tilted to the downside.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - New orders for U.S.-made capital goods increased by the most in eight months in March, hitting their highest level on record and brightening the outlook for manufacturing and the economy.
While other data on Thursday showed the number of Americans filing claims for unemployment benefits last week was the largest in 19 months, that did not change views of a tightening labor market that is increasingly running out of workers. The reports underscored the economy's enduring strength as it prepares to celebrate a record 10 years of growth in July.
""Company CEOs may have feared recession in surveys taken at the start of the year, but those concerns have faded as businesses bring on new equipment to meet the demand for the goods and services they provide their customers,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG in New York.
The Commerce Department said orders for non-defense capital goods excluding aircraft, a closely watched proxy for business spending plans, surged 1.3 percent to an all-time high of $70.0 billion, powered by a jump in demand for computers and electronic products. 
The increase in these so-called core capital goods orders was the biggest since last July and followed a 0.1 percent gain in February. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast core capital goods orders only nudging up 0.1 percent in March. They increased 2.8 percent on a year-on-year basis.
But shipments of core capital goods slipped 0.2 percent in March after gaining 0.2 percent in the prior month. Core capital goods shipments are used to calculate equipment spending in the government's gross domestic product measurement. 
While March's drop in shipments suggested business spending on equipment slowed down in the first quarter that did not have an impact on economists' growth estimates for the period.
According to a Reuters survey of economists, gross domestic product probably increased at a 2.0 percent annualized rate in the first quarter. The economy grew at a 2.2 percent pace in the October-December period. The government will publish its snapshot of first-quarter GDP on Friday. 
Business spending on equipment is expected to have slowed because of the delayed impact of sharp drops in oil prices toward the end of 2018 and fading depreciation provisions in the 2018 tax bill, as well as supply chain disruptions caused by Washington's trade war with China.
The dollar rose to a near two-year high against the euro, while U.S. Treasury prices fell. Stocks on Wall Street were trading lower amid a mixed batch of corporate earnings.
BROAD ORDER GAINS
In March, orders for machinery rose 0.3 percent after declining 0.7 percent in February. Orders for computers and electronic products soared 2.2 percent. There were also increases in orders for electrical equipment, appliances and components. But orders for primary metals fell, as did those for fabricated metal products.
Overall orders for durable goods, items ranging from toasters to aircraft that are meant to last three years or more, shot up 2.7 percent in March after declining 1.1 percent in the prior month. Orders for transportation equipment rebounded 7.0 percent after falling 2.9 percent in February. 
Orders for motor vehicles and parts rose 2.1 percent in March. Orders for non-defense aircraft jumped 31.2 percent after plunging 25.4 percent in February. 
Boeing (NYSE:BA) reported on its website that it received 44 aircraft orders, up from only five in February. There were no orders booked for its troubled 737 MAX aircraft. Boeing's fastest-selling 737 MAX jet was grounded in March after two fatal plane crashes in five months.
In a separate report on Thursday, the Labor Department said initial claims for state unemployment benefits jumped 37,000 to a seasonally adjusted 230,000 for the week ended April 20. The increase was the largest since early September 2017. 
Claims dropped to 193,000 in the week prior, which was the lowest level since September 1969. Economists had forecast claims rising to only 200,000 in the latest week. Claims tend to be volatile around this time of the year because of the different timings of Easter and Passover holidays, as well as spring breaks for schools and universities.
Despite the volatility, labor market strength remains intact. The four-week moving average of initial claims, considered a better measure of labor market trends as it irons out week-to-week volatility, rose 4,500 to 206,000 last week.

""We see nothing in these data to change our view that the labor market is extremely tight and companies are highly reluctant to lay off workers,"" said John Ryding, chief economist at RDQ Economics in New York.

The Confederation of British Industry said the later timing of Easter this year probably helped to push its monthly sales balance up to +13, meaning more retailers reported rising sales than falling sales.
The index suffered its biggest fall in 17 months in March when it sank to -18.
Economists polled by Reuters had expected a reading of zero for April.
""It's encouraging to see retailers with more of a spring in their step than in recent months,"" Rain Newton-Smith, the CBI's chief economist, said. 
""The recent pick up in real wages is a welcome support to the sector, making the pound in people's pockets stretch that bit further.""
But falling sales in clothing and department stores showed how tough the underlying conditions were for retailers, Newton-Smith said.
Official data published last week showed retail sales volumes surged by the most in nearly two-and-a-half years in annual terms, leaping by 6.7 percent.

The CBI said retailers were more optimistic about sales in the month ahead than they had been in March.

For a full account of the first-quarter GDP report, click here
Kong Dongrak, Daishin Securities in Seoul:
“We are considering bringing forward our BOK rate cut call, which currently forecasts the central bank to cut rates sometime in the fourth quarter. I assume many other economists, who have maintained a rate hold view, will probably change their call following today’s reading.”
“Yields of three-year bonds may drop to as low as 1.7 percent in the next month, while 10-year yields could dip to 1.85 percent.”
Park Chong-hoon,  Standard Chartered  (LON:STAN) Bank in Seoul:
“It was a surprise. The growth figures were extremely bad. In order to meet the BOK’s growth forecast of 2.3 percent for the first half, the economy should expand at least 1.5 percent in the second quarter, which looks daunting.”
“The latest figure shows that the business sentiment is clearly bad. Facilities investment equals business sentiment but this seems extremely squeezed; so that worries me. The latest growth figure will likely make people think the government may have become too complacent over economic issues.”
Rob Carnell, ING Bank in Singapore:
“The numbers were bad, worse than expected, and coupled with low inflation, ought to encourage the BOK to respond with easier policy rates.”
“At the heart of this is the global semiconductor slump, which is weighing on both exports and investment, but also feeding through into generally weak domestic demand and sentiment.”
“Government measures to provide offsetting stimulus look insufficient to totally offset these drags, and further weakness of both activity and inflation in the coming months and quarters look likely.”
Kim Doo-un, KB Securities in Seoul:
“As was expected the capital investment seemed very bad. It will only start improving from the latter half of the year. Looking at those figures, I may have to revise down my previous growth forecast of 2.5 percent for this year.”
“The latest reading shows the overall investment, including facilities and construction, is completely stalled and it will take some time to get these back on track.”
“Any sharp improvement in investment is unlikely at least until the second quarter of this year. But it may improve slightly in the second half, partly helped by lower base effect last year.”

1386,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 24, 2019 10:22PM ET</span>","South Korea economy unexpectedly contracts in first quarter, worst since global financial crisis","By Joori Roh and Cynthia Kim
SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea's economy unexpectedly shrank in the first quarter, marking its worst performance since the global financial crisis, as companies slashed investment and exports slumped in response to Sino-U.S. trade tensions and cooling Chinese demand.
The shock contraction boosted money market bets that the central bank is likely to make a U-turn on policy soon, shifting to an easing stance and possibly cutting interest rates to counter waning business confidence and growing external risks.
A worse-than-expected downturn in the memory chips sector hit first quarter capital investment, while falling exports offset gains from private consumption, the Bank of Korea said on Thursday, echoing strains in other trade-reliant Asian economies.
Gross domestic product (GDP) in the first quarter declined a seasonally adjusted 0.3 percent from the previous quarter, the worst contraction since a 3.3 percent drop in late 2008 and sliding from 1 percent growth in Oct-Dec.
None of the economists surveyed in a Reuters poll had expected growth to contract. The median forecast was for a rise of 0.3 percent.
""Government spending failed to keep up the bumper boost of the fourth quarter, especially for construction investment, while a drop in business investment was worse than expected due to a downturn in the chips sector,"" a BOK official said, adding there was also a strong base effect after solid fourth-quarter growth. 
From a year earlier, the Korean economy grew 1.8 percent in the January-March quarter, compared with 2.5 percent growth in the poll and 3.1 percent in the final quarter of 2018.
South Korea's main stock index fell 0.4 percent after the data, while the won weakened to its lowest since early 2017.
June futures on three-year treasury bonds rose 0.15 points to 109.58 while the nation's three-year bond yields fell below the benchmark interest rate of 1.75 percent again, in a sign that rate-cut expectations are rising to put an end to the bank's tightening cycle that began in 2017. 
RATE EXPECTATIONS 
Kong Dong-rak, a fixed income analyst at Daishin Securities, said he may push forward his rate cut call from the fourth quarter to sometime earlier this year.
""A rate cut won't come as early as May when policymakers next meet, as it will monitor how the government's supplementary bill goes at the parliament,"" Kong said.
A Reuters poll of 17 economists in mid-April showed a slim majority of nine forecast a rate cut between now and 2021.
The grim data came a day after the Moon Jae-in government unveiled a 6.7 trillion won ($5.9 billion) supplementary budget to tackle unprecedented air pollution levels and boost weak exports.
Capital investment tumbled 10.8 percent, the worst reading since 1998, while construction investment inched down 0.1 percent, the BOK said.
In an urgently called policy meeting to discuss slumping growth, finance minister Hong Nam-ki said global trade spats and uncertainties related to Brexit are delaying major investment decisions by Korea Inc.
""The economy is in difficult situation, but the second quarter will be better than the first, and the second half will be better than the first half,"" Hong said. 
Exports fell 2.6 percent quarter-on-quarter, a sharper drop than the 1.5 percent decline three months earlier as Korea's export-focused economy took a hit from fifth consecutive months of shipment declines for China through March, its biggest trading partner.
Shipments out of Asia's fourth-largest economy contracted for a fourth month in March.
While recent data from China suggest its economy may be starting to bottom out in response to stimulus measures, analysts do not expect a sharp rebound in its import appetite like those seen in past recoveries.
Economists polled by Reuters expect China's growth to slow to a near 30-year low of 6.2 percent this year, from 6.6 percent in 2018, an April poll by Reuters showed. 
One saving grace for Korea in the first quarter came private consumption, which grew 0.1 percent due to a rise in demand for durable goods.
A breakdown of GDP contribution showed net exports by volume boosted growth by 0.2 percentage point in the first quarter, while negative net domestic demand was a 0.5 percent point drag, resulting in a quarterly contraction of 0.3 percent in the January-march period.
While South Korea's preliminary trade figures are announced in value terms, the BOK accounts for exports by volume. 
""There are reasons to think that first-quarter GDP may have marked the bottom in growth, (but) the big picture is that South Korea’s economic performance is likely to be lacklustre in 2019 and any recovery would likely be gradual,"" ANZ said in a note, lowering its full-year forecast from 2.5 percent to 2.2 percent.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. mortgage applications to buy a home and to refinance one recorded their steepest weekly decline in four months as some mortgage rates increased to one-month highs, in step with higher bond yields, the Mortgage Bankers Association said on Wednesday.
The Washington-based industry group said its seasonally adjusted index on home loan requests to lenders fell by 7.3% to 425.6 in the week ended April 19. The drop was the biggest since a 9.9% decrease in the week of Dec. 21. 
""The strong economy and job market (are) keeping buyer interest high, but rising mortgage rates could add pressure to the budgets of some would-be buyers,"" MBA's chief economist Mike Fratantoni said in a statement.
Interest rates on conforming 30-year mortgages, with loan balances of $484,350 or less, averaged 4.46% last week, marking a one-month peak and edging up from 4.44% a week earlier, MBA said.
Other mortgage rates MBA tracks on average increased from 2 basis points to 6 basis points.
Mortgage rates rose in tandem with Treasury yields last week as investors scaled back their safe-haven bond holdings amid encouraging economic data in China and the United States.

""Borrowers remain extremely sensitive to rate changes, which is why there has been a 28% drop in refinance applications over this three-week period,"" Fratantoni said. ""Purchase activity also declined, but remains almost 3% higher than a year ago.""
MBA's seasonally adjusted gauge on refinancing applications fell 11.0% to 1,293 last week. Four weeks earlier, it climbed to 1,786, its strongest since November 2016 when mortgage rates fell to their lowest levels in over 14 months.
The share of refinancing requests versus total applications contracted to 39.4% from 41.5% in the prior week.
The group's index on purchase mortgage activity, which is seen as a proxy for future housing activity, retreated from a near nine-year high last week.
The purchase index decreased for the first time in seven weeks, slipping 4.1% on a seasonally adjusted basis to 269.3.

MBA's weekly survey, which began in 1990, covers more than 75% of all U.S. retail mortgage applications.

BERLIN/MUNICH (Reuters) - German business morale deteriorated in April, bucking expectations for a small improvement, as trade tensions hurt the industrial engine of Europe's largest economy, leaving domestic demand to support slowing growth.
The Munich-based Ifo economic institute said on Wednesday its business climate index fell to 99.2 in April from an upwardly revised 99.7 in March, the first rise after six straight declines. The consensus forecast for a rise to 99.9.
""March's gentle optimism regarding the coming months has evaporated,"" Ifo President Clemens Fuest said in a statement. ""The German economy continues to lose steam.""
Ifo sub-indices on current conditions and expectations fell in April.
Last week, Economy Minister Peter Altmaier said that Berlin expected gross domestic product to grow by 0.5 percent this year after an expansion of 1.4 percent in 2018.
The government had already cut its 2019 forecast in January to 1.0 percent growth from 1.8 percent previously. Long the euro zone's economic powerhouse, Germany is in its 10th year of expansion, but only narrowly avoided recession last year.
German exporters are struggling with weaker demand from abroad, trade tensions triggered by U.S. President Donald Trump and business uncertainty caused by Britain's planned departure from the European Union.
""Pessimism is increasing,"" Ifo economist Klaus Wohlrabe told Reuters. ""The industrial sector is dragging down the German economy.""
Late last month, German lighting company Osram cut its forecast for the fiscal year 2019, citing market weakness in the automotive industry, general lighting and mobile devices as well as a broader economic slowdown.
A delay to Brexit, which leaders from the remaining 27 EU countries granted Britain earlier this month, did not buoy German business morale.
""The uncertainty has receded slightly, but is still very high,"" Wohlrabe added.
In a fresh development in the trade difficulties unnerving German businesses, Trump said on Tuesday European tariffs facing motorcycle manufacturer Harley Davidson Inc were ""unfair"" and vowed to reciprocate.
The difficult trade environment means that Germany's vibrant domestic demand, helped by record-high employment, inflation-busting pay increases and low borrowing costs, is expected to be the sole driver of growth this year and next.
Germany's HDE retail association on Wednesday confirmed its forecast that sales would rise 2 percent this year, marking a 10th straight year of growth.
""The domestic economy remains a pillar of support,"" said Ifo's Wohlrabe.

However, the HDE added that although it did not yet have a forecast for 2020 sales, it expected the industrial slowdown to affect retailers.

More firms were downbeat about the outlook for jobs and investment than were optimistic for only the second time since the Recruitment and Employment Confederation began its surveys in June 2016, the month of the referendum.
But in the short term, companies planned to increase their headcount, especially for temporary workers, possibly reflecting their reluctance to make longer-term commitments to investment.
""The more positive figures on hiring for temporary workers suggest that many businesses are turning to agency work to help them navigate the unpredictability they currently face,"" Neil Carberry, the REC's chief executive, said.
""This might be driven by waiting to see whether permanent hiring is justified, or by using additional labor to meet demand rather than making big capital investments.""
Britain's economy slowed in the run-up to the original Brexit date of March 29, and as growth in much of the rest of the world has also weakened. But job creation has roared ahead, pushing the unemployment rate down to its lowest since 1975.

Companies signed up for $8.2 billion in new loans, leases and lines of credit last month, down from $9.1 billion a year earlier.
Borrowings jumped 39 percent in March from the previous month.
""First quarter new business volume got off to a slow start, relative to Q1 last year. This was not unexpected...,"" ELFA Chief Executive Officer Ralph Petta said, adding that the overall U.S. economy continued to perform reasonably well.

Washington-based ELFA, which reports economic activity for the $1 trillion equipment finance sector, said credit approvals totaled 75.3 percent, down from 76.0 percent in February.
ELFA's leasing and finance index measures the volume of commercial equipment financed in the United States. It is designed to complement the U.S. Commerce Department's durable goods orders report, which it typically precedes by a few days.

1391,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 23, 2019 01:14PM ET</span>","U.S. new home sales hit one-and-a-half-year high on lower mortgages, prices","By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Sales of new U.S. single-family homes rose to a near 1-1/2-year high in March, boosted by lower mortgage rates and house prices.
The third straight monthly increase reported by the Commerce Department on Tuesday suggested some recovery was under way in the housing market, which hit a soft patch last year against the backdrop of higher borrowing costs and more expensive homes. 
""In this housing market, affordability for buyers is key,"" said Danielle Hale, chief economist at realtor.com. ""This trend supports the fact that lower mortgage rates have started to entice buyers this spring and foreshadows a potential strengthening of existing home sales in the months to come."" 
New home sales increased 4.5 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 692,000 units last month, the highest level since November 2017. February's sales pace was revised down to 662,000 units from the previously reported 667,000 units. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast new home sales, which account for 11.7 percent of housing market sales, decreasing 2.5 percent to a pace of 650,000 units in March. 
New home sales are drawn from permits and tend to be volatile on a month-to-month basis. They increased 3.0 percent from a year ago. The median new house price dropped 9.7 percent to $302,700 in March from a year ago, the lowest level since February 2017. The drop was because of an increase in the share of homes sold in the $200,000-$300,000 price range.
Away from the new housing market, overall house price inflation is slowing. A separate report on Tuesday showed the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) house price index rose a seasonally adjusted 4.9 percent in February from a year ago.
That was the smallest gain since early 2015 and followed a 5.6 percent increase in January. 
The FHFA's index is calculated by using purchase prices of houses financed with mortgages sold to or guaranteed by mortgage finance companies Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. The moderation in house prices was set in motion by last year's slackening in demand, which was triggered by higher mortgage rates.
STRONG FUNDAMENTALS
The 30-year fixed mortgage rate has dropped by about 80 basis points since November, according to data from Freddie Mac. That followed a recent decision by the Federal Reserve to suspend its three-year monetary policy tightening campaign. Wage growth has picked up, also making home purchasing more affordable for some working Americans. 
The PHLX housing index was trading higher, also tracking a higher U.S. stock market. The dollar firmed against a basket of currencies. Prices for U.S. Treasuries rose.
New home sales have not been as severely impacted by the supply problems that have plagued the market for previously owned homes. A report on Monday showed home resales tumbled in March, weighed down by a persistent shortage of lower-priced houses.
Despite the strengthening housing market fundamentals, land and labor shortages are constraining builders' ability to break more ground on lower-priced housing projects. Expectations for slower economic growth this year are also seen curbing demand.
""We expect that a slowing economy will keep housing demand in check, and house price growth will continue to slow to around 2 percent by the end of 2019,"" said Matthew Pointon, property economist at Capital Economics in New York.
Economists believe housing probably remained a drag on gross domestic product in the first quarter. Investment in homebuilding contracted 0.3 percent in 2018, the biggest drop since 2010. 
In March, new home sales in the South, which accounts for the bulk of transactions, increased 3.6 percent to their best level since July 2007. Sales in the Midwest soared 17.6 percent to an 11-month high, while those in the West surged 6.7 percent to their strongest level in a year. But sales in the Northeast tumbled 22.2 percent.

There were 344,000 new homes on the market last month, down 0.3 percent from February. At March's sales pace it would take 6.0 months to clear the supply of houses on the market, down from 6.3 months in February. About 62 percent of the houses sold last month were either under construction or yet to be built.

1393,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 22, 2019 01:14PM ET</span>",U.S. home sales tumble as supply constraints linger,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. home sales fell more than expected in March as rising demand stoked by declining mortgage rates and slowing house price inflation continued to be frustrated by a lack of properties, especially in the lower-priced segment of the market.
The report from the National Association of Realtors (NAR) on Monday could temper expectations of a strong spring selling season that had been bolstered by a recent surge in applications for loans to buy homes. The housing market continues to buck the broader economy, which has shown signs of gaining momentum after stumbling at the turn of the year.
""Given mortgage rates have dropped and home prices aren't appreciating as quickly, there is more opportunity for home shoppers, who are gearing up for the spring season,"" said Robert Frick, corporate economist at Navy Federal Credit Union in Vienna, Virginia. ""The major problem for home buyers is the low supply of homes, especially at the lower end of the market.""
Existing home sales dropped 4.9 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.21 million units last month. February's sales pace was revised down to 5.48 million units from the previously reported 5.51 million units. Sales fell in all four regions of the country last month.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast existing home sales would fall 3.8 percent to a rate of 5.30 million units last month. Existing home sales, which make up about 90 percent of U.S. home sales, declined 5.4 percent from a year ago. That was the 13th straight year-on-year decrease in home sales.
Economists expect housing probably remained a drag on gross domestic product in the first quarter. Residential investment contracted in 2018, logging its weakest performance since 2010.
While lower borrowing costs and house prices as well as strengthening wage growth have improved affordability, land and labor shortages are making it difficult for builders to ramp up construction of relatively cheaper priced homes. 
The 30-year fixed mortgage rate has dropped from a peak of about 4.94 percent in November to around 4.12 percent, according to data from mortgage finance agency Freddie Mac. Applications for loans to purchase a home jumped to an almost nine-year high in the week ending April 12. 
A survey last week showed that while builders reported strong demand for new homes in April, they also complained about ""affordability concerns stemming from a chronic shortage of construction workers and buildable lots.""
The PHLX housing index fell more than 1.0 percent on Monday, underperforming a broadly flat U.S. stock market. The dollar slipped against a basket of currencies. Prices of U.S. Treasuries fell.
BROAD SALES DECLINES
There were steep declines in sales in the lower and upper ends of the market last month. The NAR said last year's revamp of the U.S. tax code, which reduced the amount of mortgage interest payments homeowners could deduct, was hurting sales of homes priced $1 million and above.
The supply of previously owned homes on the market rose to 1.68 million last month from 1.63 million in February and 1.64 million a year ago. At March's sales pace, it would take 3.9 months to exhaust the current inventory, up from 3.6 months in February. 
A six-to-seven-month supply is viewed as a healthy balance between supply and demand. The median existing house price increased 3.8 percent from a year ago to $259,400 in March. 
The Commerce Department reported last Friday that housing starts dropped to a rate of 1.139 million units in March, the lowest level since May 2017. 
That was the second straight monthly drop in homebuilding and pushed starts substantially below the 1.5 million to 1.6 million units per month range that realtors estimate is needed to alleviate the shortage.
""Supply constraints which have hampered the market for housing for a few years remain in place,"" said Ben Ayers, senior economist at Nationwide in Columbus, Ohio. 
Houses for sale typically stayed on the market for 36 days in March, down from 44 days in February, but up from 30 days a year ago. About 47 percent of homes sold in March were on the market for less than a month. 

First-time buyers accounted for a third of sales last month, little changed from February and up from 30 percent a year ago. Economists and realtors say a 40 percent share of first-time buyers is needed for a robust housing market.

Existing home sales fell 4.9% in March from the previous month to an annualized pace of 5.21 million units, according to data from the National Association of Realtors released on Thursday.
Sales had surged 11.8% in February, its largest gain since December 2015 as it bounced off a three-year low.

TAIPEI (Reuters) - Taiwan's export orders fell for the fifth straight month in March, and at a much sharper pace than expected, as the island's manufacturers kept struggling with a drop in global tech demand.
Orders in March dropped 9 percent from a year earlier to $38.59 billion, Ministry of Economic Affairs data showed on Monday. 
For January-March, export orders slid 8.4 percent, the biggest annual drop for a first quarter since 2009 when they tumbled 30 percent, the ministry said. 
March orders fell at almost twice the 5.45 percent forecast in a Reuters poll, though the pace was less than February's 10.9 percent, the sharpest fall in nearly three years.
Taiwan's hi-tech factories are major suppliers for global tech heavyweights such as Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM), and the continued drop in orders suggests global electronic could remain soft for some time.
The ministry said the March shrinkage was also due to declining machinery orders due to business caution in China as the U.S-Sino trade dispute continues. 
However, launches of smartphone models and demand for new technology such as artificial intelligence and 5G could support a rebound of orders for electronics in coming months, it said.
The faster 5G networks are coming on line in the United States, China, South Korea and other places this year, but probably will not be widespread until 2020. The telecommunications industry is expected to spend $275 billion over seven years in the United States alone, according to Accenture (NYSE:ACN) estimates.
Carl Liu, an analyst at KGI Securities, said Taiwan export orders ""are unlikely to return to growth until in June, thanks to re-stocking of electronics ahead of the peak season in the third quarter"".
CAUTION ON OUTLOOK 
The ministry said it expects April export orders to decline 6.7-9.2 percent, and that it could be July before orders rebound.
""We remain cautious about orders in the first half and expect a year-on-year decline for the second quarter,"" ministry official Lin Lee-jen said. 
The slowing tech demand has taken a toll on Taiwan's supply chain manufacturers. Chipmaker TSMC last week posted its steepest quarterly profit drop in more than seven years partly due to sluggish smartphone sales. 
But the company gave an upbeat forecast for the coming months, betting on rising chip demand thanks to a rollout of 5G mobile network.
In March, weak export demand was seen from all Taiwan's major markets.
Orders from the United States fell 9.7 percent on-year, on top of February's 5.5 percent decline.
Those from China dropped 13.7 percent, compared with a fall of 14.3 percent the previous month, while orders from Europe slipped 2.4 percent. Japan orders declined 5.8 percent.

Taiwan's government in February trimmed its 2019 economic growth forecast to 2.27 percent, citing growing uncertainties over global growth.

1397,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 19, 2019 11:30AM ET</span>",U.S. homebuilding near two-year low; permits extend decline,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. homebuilding dropped to a near two-year low in March, pulled down by persistent weakness in the single-family unit segment, suggesting the housing market continued to struggle despite falling mortgage rates.
The second straight monthly decline in homebuilding reported by the Commerce Department on Friday probably reflected in part massive flooding in the Midwest, with housing starts in the region plunging to levels last seen in early 2015.
The weak report bucked a recent tide of upbeat data, including retail sales, trade and construction spending, that indicated the economy regained speed late in the first quarter after appearing to stumble at the turn of the year.
""Waiting for construction activity to pick up after a sharp drop in mortgage rates is like waiting for Godot,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG in New York. ""It is hard to know what is ailing the home construction industry.""
Housing starts fell 0.3 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.139 million units last month, the lowest level since May 2017. Data for February was revised down to show homebuilding tumbling to a pace of 1.142 million units instead of the previously reported 1.162 million-unit rate.
Housing starts in the Midwest, which was devastated by floods during the month, dropped 17.6 percent. Homebuilding also fell in the Northeast and South, but surged in the West. 
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast housing starts increasing to a pace of 1.230 million units in March. The dollar was trading lower against a basket of currencies. U.S. stock and bond markets were closed for the Good Friday holiday.
A sharp pickup in home construction appears unlikely. Building permits fell 1.7 percent to a rate of 1.269 million units in March, the lowest in five months. It was the third straight monthly decrease in permits.
The prolonged weakness in homebuilding is likely the result of land and labor shortages, as well as expensive building materials. A survey on Tuesday showed that though builders reported strong demand for new homes, they continued to highlight ""affordability concerns stemming from a chronic shortage of construction workers and buildable lots.""
These factors are constraining builders' ability to construct homes in the lower price segment of the market, which continues to experience a shortage of homes for sale. The housing market hit a soft patch last year, with investment in homebuilding contracting 0.3 percent, the weakest performance since 2010. 
FUNDAMENTALS IMPROVING
Despite the weakness in homebuilding, the fundamentals for the housing market are improving. The 30-year fixed mortgage rate has dropped from a peak of about 4.94 percent in November to around 4.12 percent, according to data from mortgage finance agency Freddie Mac. Wage growth is also strengthening. 
Declining mortgage rates follow a recent decision by the Federal Reserve to suspend its three-year monetary policy tightening campaign. 
While housing continues to be soft, the other segments of the economy have rebounded from earlier weakness. Retail sales surged in March and trade, inventory and construction spending data have also been bullish, leading economists to upgrade their gross domestic product growth estimates for the first quarter. 
Growth forecasts for the January-March quarter have been raised to as high as a 2.9 percent annualized rate. They were at one point as low as a 0.3 percent rate following a batch of weak economic reports at the turn of the year. The economy grew at a 2.2 percent pace in the fourth quarter.
""The March (housing starts) numbers show better economic conditions still are not bearing fruit for builders as the market turns toward the spring home shopping season,"" said Matthew Speakman, economic analyst at Zillow. 
Single-family homebuilding, which accounts for the largest share of the housing market, dropped 0.4 percent to a rate of 785,000 units in March, the lowest level since September 2016. 
Permits to build single-family homes dropped 1.1 percent to a rate of 808,000 units in March, the lowest since August 2017. It was the fourth straight monthly decrease in single-family permits. 

Starts for the volatile multi-family housing segment were unchanged at a rate of 354,00 units in March. Permits for the construction of multi-family homes dropped 2.7 percent to a pace of 461,00 units last month.

1398,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 18, 2019 08:10PM ET</span>",Japan inflation edges higher but Bank of Japan still in a bind,"By Stanley White
TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's core inflation picked up slightly in March from a year earlier, but remained distant from the Bank of Japan's ambitious 2 percent target in a sign of rising pressure on the central bank.
Over the past year, policymakers have had to contend with a slowdown in global demand as the Sino-U.S. tariff war put a dent in world trade and hit Japanese exporters. This has made the Bank of Japan's task of generating inflation even more difficult.
Data on Friday showed a 0.8 percent increase in the nationwide core consumer price index (CPI), which includes oil products but excludes volatile fresh food costs, compared with a median market forecast of 0.7 percent. In February, annual core consumer inflation hit 0.7 percent.
An index the BOJ focuses on - the so-called core-core CPI that strips away the effect of both volatile food and energy costs - rose 0.4 percent in March, matching the annual increase in February.
The central bank is in a bind. Years of heavy money printing have dried up bond market liquidity and hurt commercial banks' profits, stoking concerns that its massive easing program is not sustainable.
""There simply isn't enough momentum toward 2 percent inflation, because wages are not rising that much,"" said Hiroshi Miyazaki, senior economist at Mitsubishi UFJ  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) Securities.
""The BOJ became passive last year because it was worried about banks' earnings. This year the BOJ could fine tune its policy if other economic indicators worsen further.""
Subdued inflation has left the BOJ well behind its counterparts in dialing back stimulus, including the United States where monetary policy had a bigger impact. Some economists also argue the BOJ has little ammunition left to fight another serious economic downturn.
There is also a growing view in markets that core consumer inflation may grind to a halt in coming months as recent oil price falls push down gas and electricity bills. Such a scenario could put the central bank under pressure to come up with some measures to buoy prices. 
The BOJ is expected to forecast next week that inflation will remain below its target through the fiscal year that ends in March 2022, sources say.
At a two-day policy meeting ending April 25, the BOJ is widely expected to maintain its pledge to guide short-term rates at minus 0.1 percent and long-term yields around zero under a policy dubbed yield curve control.

The BOJ has notched up its warning against the rising drawbacks of its policy. In a semi-annual report analyzing the banking system on Wednesday, it said nearly 60 percent of regional banks could suffer net losses a decade from now if corporate borrowing keeps falling in line with the current trend.

1399,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 18, 2019 01:21PM ET</span>","U.S. retail sales, labor market data paint upbeat economic picture","By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. retail sales increased by the most in 1-1/2 years in March as households boosted purchases of motor vehicles and a range of other goods, the latest indication that economic growth picked up in the first quarter after a false start.
The economy's enduring strength was reinforced by other data on Thursday showing the number of Americans filing applications for unemployment benefits dropped to the lowest in nearly 50 years last week. Fears of an abrupt slowdown in growth escalated at the turn of the year after a batch of weak economic reports.
They were also exacerbated by a brief inversion of the U.S. Treasury yield curve in late March. But those concerns have dissipated in recent weeks amid fairly upbeat data on trade, inventories and construction spending that have suggested growth last quarter could be better than the moderate pace logged in the final three months of 2018.
A report from the Federal Reserve on Wednesday described economic activity as expanding at a ""slight-to-moderate"" pace in March and early April. The Fed's ""Beige Book"" report of anecdotal information on business activity collected from contacts nationwide showed a ""few"" of the U.S. central bank's districts reported ""some strengthening.""
""The rebound in retail sales underscores that the domestic outlook remains favorable and well-supported by the labor market, and it dispels the misguided concerns that the U.S. economy is slipping into recession,"" said Kathy Bostjancic, head of U.S. macro investor services at Oxford Economics in New York.
The Commerce Department said retail sales surged 1.6 percent in March, the biggest increase since September 2017, after dropping 0.2 percent in February. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast retail sales accelerating 0.9 percent last month. 
With March's rebound, retail sales have now erased the plunge in December that put consumer spending and the overall economy on a sharply lower growth trajectory. Retail sales last month were probably lifted by tax refunds, even though they have been smaller than in previous years, following the revamping of the U.S. tax code in January 2018.
Excluding automobiles, gasoline, building materials and food services, retail sales rebounded 1.0 percent in March after declining 0.3 percent in February. These so-called core retail sales correspond most closely with the consumer spending component of gross domestic product.
Consumer spending accounts for more than two-thirds of economic activity and is being buoyed by a tightening labor market that is driving up wage growth.
STRONG LABOR MARKET
A separate report from the Labor Department on Thursday showed initial claims for state unemployment benefits dropped 5,000 to a seasonally adjusted 192,000 for the week ended April 13, the lowest level since September 1969. Claims have now declined for five straight weeks. Economists had forecast claims rising to 205,000 in the latest week. 
Though the trend in hiring has slowed, job gains remain above the roughly 100,000 needed per month to keep up with growth in the working-age population.
The reports boosted the dollar against a basket of currencies. Stocks on Wall Street were mixed, while U.S. Treasury prices rose.
As a result of March's strong core retail sales, the Atlanta Fed raised its first-quarter GDP estimate by four-tenths of a percentage point to a 2.8 percent annualized rate. 
Growth forecasts for the January-March quarter have been upgraded from as low as a 0.5 percent rate following the recent trade, inventories and construction spending data. The economy grew at a 2.2 percent pace in the fourth quarter.
Stronger growth in the first quarter will probably not change the view that the economy will slow this year as the stimulus from a $1.5 trillion tax cut package diminishes and the impact of interest rate hikes over the last few years lingers.
It also is unlikely to have any impact on monetary policy after the Fed recently suspended its three-year campaign to tighten monetary policy. The central bank dropped projections for any rate hikes this year after increasing borrowing costs four times in 2018.
""Key downside risks to U.S. growth are fading from view,"" said Allison Nathan, an economist at Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) in New York. ""While we still think the next Fed move is much more likely to be a hike than a cut, we've pushed back our forecast for the next hike from the first quarter to the fourth of next year.""
Goldman Sachs has lifted its growth estimate for the second half of 2019 by 25 basis points to 2.5 percent. Despite the recent wave of relatively strong data, business surveys suggest pockets of weakness persist, especially in manufacturing. 
A third report on Thursday from the Philadelphia Fed showed factory activity in the mid-Atlantic region slowed in April and manufacturers were less optimistic about business and labor market conditions over the next six months.
That was corroborated by a fourth report from data firm IHS Markit showing its measure of national factory activity was unchanged near a two-year low in early April, with the survey's gauge of factory employment dropping to its lowest level since June 2017. 

""Many of the 'hard' readings on activity suggest that the economy started picking up momentum late in the first quarter, but this is not evident in much of the recent survey data,"" said Daniel Silver, an economist at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) in New York.

1400,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 18, 2019 10:20AM ET</span>",U.S. business inventories increase steadily in February,"WASHINGTON, (Reuters) - U.S. business inventories increased in February and stock accumulation in the prior month was a bit stronger than initially estimated, suggesting inventory investment could contribute to economic growth in the first quarter.
The Commerce Department said on Thursday that business inventories rose 0.3 percent in February. Data for January was revised slightly up to show inventories rising 0.9 percent instead of the 0.8 percent increase previously reported.
Inventories are a key component of gross domestic product, and economists polled by Reuters had forecast stocks at businesses would rise 0.4 percent in February.
Retail inventories climbed 0.3 percent in February after increasing 0.8 percent in January. Motor vehicle inventories gained 0.3 percent in February.
Retail inventories excluding autos, which go into the calculation of GDP, increased 0.4 percent in February after advancing 0.7 percent in the prior month. This suggests inventory investment could add to first-quarter GDP.
Wholesale inventories increased 0.2 percent in February. Stocks at manufacturers rose 0.3 percent. Inventory investment added 0.11 percentage point to the fourth quarter's 2.2 percent annualized growth rate.
Business sales edged up 0.1 percent in February after increasing 0.3 percent in January. Retail sales fell 0.3 percent in February. Sales at wholesalers gained 0.3 percent while those at manufacturers increased 0.4 percent.
At February's sales pace, it would take 1.39 months for businesses to clear shelves, unchanged from January. The motor vehicle inventory-to-sales ratio increased further in February, pointing to an unwanted piling of vehicles that could further slow production at assembly plants.

Economists polled by Reuters had forecast retail sales would accelerate 0.9 percent in March. Retail sales in March advanced 3.6 percent from a year ago. 
With March's rebound, retail sales have now erased December's plunge, which had put consumer spending and the overall economy on a sharply lower growth trajectory. Retail sales last month were probably lifted by tax refunds, even though they have been smaller than in previous years, following the revamping of the U.S. tax code in January 2018.
Excluding automobiles, gasoline, building materials and food services, retail sales rebounded 1.0 percent in March after a downwardly revised 0.3 percent decline in February. These so-called core retail sales correspond most closely with the consumer spending component of gross domestic product.
They were previously reported to have decreased 0.2 percent in February. Consumer spending accounts for more than two-thirds of economic activity, and strong core retail sales in March could result in the further upgrading of first-quarter GDP estimates. 
Growth forecasts for the first quarter were boosted to around a 2.4 percent annualized rate on Wednesday after data showed the U.S. trade deficit narrowed for a second straight month in February.
First-quarter growth forecasts have been raised from as low as a 0.5 percent rate following fairly upbeat reports on trade, inventories and construction spending. The economy grew at a 2.2 percent pace in the fourth quarter.

In March, sales at auto dealerships jumped 3.1 percent, the most since September 2017. Receipts at service stations increased 3.5 percent, likely reflecting higher gasoline prices. Sales at building materials and garden equipment and supplies dealers rose 0.3 percent. 
Receipts at clothing stores shot up 2.0 percent, the largest increase since last May. There were also increases in sales at furniture outlets, electronics and appliances shops, and food and beverage stores. 

Online and mail-order retail sales increased 1.2 percent last month. Sales at restaurants and bars rose 0.8 percent, the most since last July. But receipts at hobby, musical instrument and book stores fell 0.3 percent.

1402,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 18, 2019 07:25AM ET</span>",UK lenders see big drag from house prices on mortgages: BoE,"LONDON (Reuters) - British lenders think a slowdown in house prices will exert the biggest drag since 2012 on how many mortgages they offer, a Bank of England survey showed on Thursday, as Brexit uncertainty continues to depress the market.
Lenders surveyed by the central bank last month expected to provide around as many mortgages in the second quarter as in the first three months of the year.
But they predicted that expectations for house prices would be the biggest drag on mortgage supply, rather than the economic outlook or financial conditions.
Expectations for demand for mortgages in the prime market -- dominated by London which has been hardest hit by the chaos surrounding Britain's exit from the European Union -- fell to their lowest level since late 2010, the BoE said.
Other surveys have shown Brexit to be a major drag on the property market in the capital, which is sensitive to flows of migrant workers from the European Union. A surge in prices in London in previous years has also stretched affordability. 
Official data on Wednesday showed British house prices rose at the weakest rate in six-and-a-half years in February, dragged down by London's biggest price fall in a decade.

The BoE's survey took place between March 4 and 22.

1403,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 18, 2019 05:54AM ET</span>",UK consumers keep calm and carry on shopping before Brexit deadline,"By William Schomberg and Andy Bruce
LONDON (Reuters) - British shoppers ignored worries about an impending Brexit deadline and spent heavily in March, official data showed on Thursday, supporting the country's sluggish economy while companies were cutting back on investment.
Retail sales volumes surged by the most in nearly two-and-a-half years in annual terms, leaping by 6.7 percent. That was way above all forecasts in a Reuters poll of economists.
The increase in part reflected the slowdown in spending a year ago, when Britain was hit by the so-called Beast from the East snowstorms and icy weather, officials at the Office for National Statistics said. Warm weather in March this year helped increase spending on clothes, the ONS said. 
Sterling rose on the data, reaching a session high against the euro.
Britain was originally due to leave the European Union on March 29, but that deadline was pushed back to April 12 and then again to Oct. 31 as Prime Minister Theresa May failed to break an impasse in parliament on the terms of Brexit.
The figures published by the ONS on Thursday covered the period from Feb. 24 to March 30.
""There is hope that the delay in a potential no-deal Brexit until October will allow the stronger retail sentiment to remain undiminished,"" said Jeremy Thomson-Cook, an economist at WorldFirst, a currency exchange firm. 
""However, a word of warning: credit card defaults in the UK have risen significantly in the first quarter and sit at the highest level since 2015, which could threaten the brighter-than-expected retail picture.""
In monthly terms, sales rose for a third month in a row, by 1.1 percent. The median forecast in a Reuters poll was for a decline of 0.3 percent.
In the first three months of 2019, a smoother reading of spending patterns, sales grew by 1.6 percent compared with the previous three months, the strongest increase since August 2018.
CONSUMERS TO THE RESCUE
Consumer spending has supported Britain's sluggish economy through the Brexit crisis, in contrast to businesses, which have cut back on investment. Falling inflation, rising wages and the lowest unemployment since 1975 have boosted household incomes.
However, wages after inflation are still below their peak before the financial crisis, raising questions about how long consumers can support the economy, which is struggling not only with Brexit but also with slower global growth.
The Bank of England said on Thursday that banks reported they cut back on the availability of consumer credit in early 2019 and expected more tightening in the second quarter.
The BoE has predicted the slowest overall growth in Britain's economy for a decade this year. But BoE officials say they underestimated the resilience of British households in the face of the Brexit referendum in 2016, and Thursday's figures are likely to further surprise the central bank.
The BoE has said it plans to raise interest rates gradually once the uncertainty about Brexit clears.
Last week, figures from the British Retail Consortium suggested shoppers had cut spending at high-street retailers for the first time in almost a year in March.

But supermarket chain  Tesco  (LON:TSCO) said its shoppers were not being put off by Brexit.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - A bumper run in Australian jobs extended to March and more people went looking for work, official data on Thursday showed, a sign the country's labor market remains strong despite a small uptick in the unemployment rate. 
The local dollar jumped about a quarter of U.S. cent to $0.7200 as traders wagered the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) will not rush to ease rates even though the broader economy has seemingly lost momentum.
The employment report is being closely watched for clues on monetary policy as the country's central bank is counting on labor market strength for a long-awaited pick up in wage growth and inflation in the face of a property market downturn. 
Thursday's data showed a total 25,700 new jobs were created in March, surging past expectations for a rise of 12,000.
Encouragingly, all of that increase was led by full-time work with part-time decreasing 22,600. 
""A solid set of employment figures, dominated by full-time roles, suggests that households and businesses may have to wait a little longer for rate cuts,"" said Callam Pickering APAC economist at global job site Indeed.
""From the perspective of policymakers, particularly the Reserve Bank, this will be viewed as a positive report,"" Pickering said.
Australia is creating jobs at a brisk annual pace of 2.4 percent, much faster than the 1.6 percent rise in population.
Even so, the unemployment rate rose to 5.0 percent in March from an eight-year trough of 4.9 percent the previous month as the participation rate climbed to 65.7 percent in a sign more people went looking for work. 
While the jobless rate has stayed in a 4.9-5.1 percent band since last September, consumer prices have remained lukewarm for years now. 
Worryingly for the RBA, first-quarter data due next week is expected to show core inflation further cooled to 1.7 percent from 1.8 percent in the previous quarter, undershooting its 2-3 percent mid-term target.

The RBA has held the cash rate at an all-time low of 1.50 percent for 2-1/2 years now and earlier this year switched away from its long-held tightening bias to a more neutral stance. On Tuesday, minutes of the central bank's April meeting showed it believes a cut in interest rates would be appropriate if inflation stayed low and unemployment trended high.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japanese manufacturers' business confidence slipped to a 2-1/2-year low in April, a Reuters poll showed on Thursday, underlining growing concerns the economy could slip into a recession in the face of slowing external demand.
The monthly poll, which tracks the Bank of Japan's (BOJ) closely watched tankan quarterly survey, found the service-sector mood up for the first time in four months, which may help ease some of the pressure on the world's third-biggest economy.
Manufacturers' mood is expected to rebound over the coming three months and service-sector morale is also seen edging up slightly, although the pace of recovery appears weak.
Subdued business confidence - on top of weakness in factory output and exports - has raised the specter of a downturn, although BOJ Governor Haruhiko Kuroda has maintained a relatively sanguine view on the economy in a signal that policy will remain steady at next week's rate-review.
In the Reuters poll of 478 large- and mid-sized companies, in which 241 firms responded on condition of anonymity, many managers voiced concerns about China's economic slowdown and its trade war with the United States.
""A sense of caution is rising due to the global slowdown amid the U.S.-China trade war and Brexit, which are causing companies to hold off on business investment, curbing orders for capex,"" a manager of a machinery maker wrote in the survey.
The Reuters Tankan sentiment index for manufacturers stood at 8 in April, down two points from March, weighed on by manufacturers of processed food, transport equipment machinery and chemicals, the April 3-15 survey showed.
The index posted a sixth straight month of falls and hit the lowest reading since September 2016.
It is expected to rebound to 13 in July.
A bruising Sino-U.S. tariff war and slowing global growth have curbed global trade, in turn hurting Japan's exporters and manufacturing industry. Some analysts warn of the risk of the economy sliding into a recession.
In the fourth quarter, Japan's economy managed a modest bounce after a contraction in the previous quarter as floods and an earthquake temporarily halted production. The worry is that the recovery is being stunted by a cooling global economy.
The service-sector index grew to 24 in April from 22 in the previous month, led by industries such as construction/real estate and transport/utility.
The index is expected to inch up to 25 in July.
The BOJ's last quarterly tankan showed the business mood hit a two-year low in the March quarter, highlighting worries that global trade tensions and weakening world demand were taking a toll on the export-reliant Japanese economy.

The Reuters Tankan indexes are calculated by subtracting the percentage of pessimistic respondents from optimistic ones. A positive figure means optimists outnumber pessimists.

1407,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 17, 2019 02:05PM ET</span>","U.S. labor market remains tight, economy continues to grow: Fed Beige Book","By Pete Schroeder
WASHINGTON, (Reuters) - Labor markets remained tight across the United States as businesses struggled to find skilled workers and wages grew modestly, the Federal Reserve said on Wednesday in its latest report on the economy.
The U.S. central bank's ""Beige Book"" report, a glimpse of the economy based on conversations with business contacts across all 12 of the Fed's districts, found economic activity grew at a slight-to-moderate pace in March and early April. A few districts reported some strengthening in economic growth.
Prices have risen modestly since the last Beige Book, with tariffs, freight costs and rising wages often cited as key factors, the Fed said. It added that consumer spending was mixed but suggested sluggish sales for both general retailers and auto dealers.
Wages grew moderately in most districts for both skilled and unskilled workers, with only three reporting slight growth in workers' pay, the Fed said.
Businesses in most districts reported shortages of skilled workers, mainly in manufacturing and construction, but also in technical and professional roles. Companies have responded to the tight labor market by boosting bonuses and benefits packages, along with raising wages moderately, according to the report.
Employment increases were most highly concentrated in highly-skilled jobs.
In terms of the manufacturing sector, the Fed said contacts in many districts reported that trade-related uncertainty was weighing on activity.
Several Fed districts said flooding and severe weather in the Midwest was affecting agricultural production. The Kansas City Fed reported that recent blizzards and flooding could weigh on the farming sector in the coming months, as it had resulted in damaged infrastructure and losses of cattle and crops.
The impact of the 35-day U.S. government shutdown that began in late December appeared muted. The Richmond Fed reported a few federal contractors saw business starting to return to normal and the San Francisco Fed saw higher-than-expected retail sales once the government reopened.
The Fed held interest rates steady at its last policy meeting in March, sticking with the ""patient"" approach adopted by policymakers in January, given little sign of rising inflation and the growing concerns about trade tensions and slowing global growth.
The Beige Book gives the Fed a sense of what central bank officials are hearing in their own districts, which in turn could inform their thinking when it comes to the economy and the Fed's stance on rates.

The latest Beige Book was prepared by the St. Louis Fed based on information collected on or before April 8, 2019.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. trade deficit fell to an eight-month low in February as imports from China plunged, temporarily providing a boost to President Donald Trump's ""America First"" agenda and economic growth in the first quarter.
The surprise second straight monthly narrowing in the trade gap reported by the Commerce Department on Wednesday was also driven by soaring aircraft exports, which are likely to reverse after Boeing (NYSE:BA) halted deliveries of its troubled 737 MAX aircraft. MAX planes have been grounded indefinitely following two deadly crashes. 
Economists warned the trade deficit would remain elevated regardless of whether the United States and China struck a trade deal that was to the White House's liking because of Americans' insatiable appetite for cheaper imports.
Talks between Washington and China to resolve the bitter trade war have been dragging. The United States is also embroiled in conflicts with other trading partners, including the European Union, contributing to big swings in exports and imports data in recent months.
""Even if trade negotiations are resolved in such a way as to reduce the bilateral trade deficit with China, one of the Trump administration's stated goals, this would likely divert trade flows to other countries and have little impact on the top-line U.S. trade deficit,"" said Emily Mandel, an economist at Moody's Analytics in West Chester, Pennsylvania.
The trade deficit tumbled 3.4 percent to $49.4 billion in February, the lowest level since June 2018. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the trade shortfall widening to $53.5 billion in February. 
The politically sensitive goods trade deficit with China - a focus of the Trump administration's protectionist trade policy - decreased 28.2 percent to $24.8 billion in February as imports from the world's No. 2 economy plunged 20.2 percent. U.S. exports to China jumped 18.2 percent in February.
Washington last year imposed tariffs on $250 billion worth of goods imported from China, with Beijing retaliating with duties on $110 billion worth of American products. Trump has defended the duties as necessary to protect domestic manufacturers from what he says is unfair foreign competition.
Trump has delayed tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese imports. The White House argues that substantially reducing the trade deficit would lift annual economic growth by at least 3 percent on a sustainable basis, a feat that economists have said is impossible because of low productivity and population growth.
The economy grew 2.9 percent in 2018.
The dollar was little changed against a basket of currencies, while U.S. Treasury debt prices rose marginally. Stocks on Wall Street fell.
GROWTH ESTIMATES RAISED
February's smaller trade deficit suggests the economy will probably avoid a sharp slowdown in growth that had been feared at the start of the year. The goods trade deficit declined 1.7 percent to an eight-month low of $72.0 billion in February.
When adjusted for inflation, the overall goods trade deficit fell $1.8 billion to $81.8 billion, also the lowest since last June. Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) raised its first quarter gross domestic product estimate by four-tenths of a percentage point to a 2.1 percent annualized rate. 
The Atlanta Federal Reserve bumped up its GDP forecast to a 2.4 percent pace from a 2.3 percent rate. The economy grew at a 2.2 percent rate in the fourth quarter.
""It sounds like pencils are being sharpened in order to revise up first-quarter GDP forecasts,"" said Jennifer Lee, a senior economist at BMO Capital Markets in Toronto. 
In February, goods exports increased 1.5 percent to $139.5 billion. The surge in goods exports is unlikely to be sustained given slowing global economic growth. The dollar's strength last year means U.S.-manufactured goods are less competitive on foreign markets. 
Shipments of civilian aircraft soared by $2.2 billion in February. Exports of motor vehicles and parts increased by $0.6 billion. There was a small rise in soybean exports. Economists expect soybean exports to remain moderate because of an outbreak of swine flu that has reduced demand for soybean meal in China.
In February, imports rose 0.2 percent to $259.1 billion. Consumer goods imports increased by $1.6 billion in February, led by a $2.1 billion rise in imports of cellphones and other household goods. 
Imports of industrial supplies and materials fell by $1.2 billion. Capital goods imports rose slightly, pointing to slower business spending on equipment.
Crude oil imports fell to 173.7 million barrels, the lowest since March 1992, from 223.1 million barrels in January. An increase in domestic production has seen the United States become less dependent on foreign oil. 

""We see more potential for stronger imports in coming months, which would reestablish a trend toward wider deficits,"" said Andrew Hollenhorst, an economist at  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) in New York.

The Commerce Department said on Wednesday wholesale inventories climbed 0.2 percent to a record $668.9 billion.
Data for January was revised down to show wholesale inventories advancing 1.2 percent instead of 1.4 percent as previously reported. Wholesale inventories increased 6.9 percent on a year-on-year basis in February.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast inventories at wholesalers rising 0.5 percent in February. The component of wholesale inventories that goes into the calculation of gross domestic product gained 0.2 percent in February.
Despite February's modest rise, inventory accumulation is expected to contribute to GDP growth in the first quarter. Growth estimates for the January-March quarter are in a 1.5 percent to 2.3 percent annualized range.
The economy grew at a 2.2 percent rate in the fourth quarter, stepping down from the July-September period's brisk 3.4 percent pace. The inventory build, however, will likely weigh on GDP in the second quarter as businesses place fewer orders with manufacturers while disposing the unwanted goods.
In February, wholesale auto inventories edged up 0.1 percent after surging 1.5 percent in the prior month. The auto sector has experienced an inventory overhang because of weak sales.
Wholesale apparel inventories jumped 1.8 percent.
Sales at wholesalers increased 0.3 percent in February after climbing 0.5 percent in January. There were increases in sales of motor vehicles, furniture, professional equipment and electrical goods. But sales of wholesale groceries dropped 2.1 percent, the most since April 2004.
At February's sales pace it would take wholesalers 1.35 months to clear shelves, unchanged from January.

The Washington-based group's seasonally-adjusted barometer on purchase mortgage activity, which is seen as a proxy on future housing activity, edged up 0.9% to 280.7 in the week of April 12, marking its strongest reading since 291.3 in the week of April 30, 2010.
(GRAPHIC: U.S. mortgage applications - https://tmsnrt.rs/2RnEpRD)
""The spring buying season continues to be robust, with activity more than 7% higher than a year ago and up year-over-year for the ninth straight week,” Joel Kan, MBA’s associate vice president of economic and industry forecasting, said in a statement.
The latest pickup in loan requests for home purchases has not been hampered by the uptick in borrowing costs.
Interest rates on conforming 30-year mortgages, with loan balances of $484,350 or less, averaged 4.44% last week, up 4 basis points from the prior week, MBA said.
Other mortgage rates MBA tracks on average increased anywhere from 1 basis points to 10 basis points.
Home loan rates rose in step with rising bond yields, as investors pared their bond holdings on less dismal data from China, Europe and the United States.
On the other hand, refinancing applications fell 8.2% to 1,453.0 in the last week on a seasonally adjusted basis, MBA said.
The refinancing index reached its highest level since November 2016 two weeks earlier at 1,786, when mortgage rates fell to their lowest levels in over 14 months.
The share of refinancing requests versus total applications shrank to 41.5% from 44.1% the week before.
MBA's seasonally adjusted gauge on overall mortgage application activity decreased 3.5% to 459.0 in the latest week. It retreated further from a 2-1/2 year peak set two weeks ago.

1412,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 17, 2019 05:46AM ET</span>","China's first-quarter growth unexpectedly steadies, but too early to call clear recovery","By Kevin Yao and Lusha Zhang
BEIJING (Reuters) - China's economy grew at a steady 6.4 percent pace in the first quarter, defying expectations for a further slowdown, as industrial production jumped sharply and consumer demand showed signs of improvement. 
The upbeat readings, which included faster growth in investment, will add to optimism that China's economy may be starting to stabilize even as Beijing and Washington appear to be edging toward a trade deal.
Investors have ranked China's slowdown and the trade war as the biggest risks facing the faltering global economy.
But analysts warn it is too early to call a sustainable turnaround, and further policy support is needed to maintain momentum in the world's second-largest economy. Many had expected a recovery only in the second half of 2019.
Beijing has ramped up fiscal stimulus this year, announcing billions of dollars in additional tax cuts and infrastructure spending, while Chinese banks lent a record 5.8 trillion yuan ($865 billion) in the first quarter, more than the economy of Switzerland.
""We need more evidence to call a full-fledged recovery. Our view for the economy is still cautious,"" said Jianwei Xu, senior economist, Greater China at Natixis in Hong Kong.
""We think it (the stronger-than-expected data) is somewhat linked to the stimulus, but we can't attribute it all to it."" 
Analysts polled by Reuters had expected GDP growth to slow slightly to 6.3 percent in January-March from a year earlier.
Share markets and most currencies in Asia rose in relief, as China's slowdown has increasingly weighed on its trading partners from Japan to Germany. The yuan currency rose 0.4 percent to a 7-week high.
Government support is gradually having an effect, though the economy still faces pressure, Mao Shengyong, spokesman at the National Bureau of Statistics, cautioned on Wednesday.
Quarterly growth was supported by a sharp jump in industrial production, which surged 8.5 percent in March on-year, the fastest in over 4-1/2 years. That handily beat estimates of 5.9 percent and 5.3 percent in the first two months of the year.
Output of building materials such as steel and cement, as well as machinery, showed strong gains. Prices of steel reinforcing bars used in construction hit 7-1/2 year highs this week on firm demand.
Industrial output growth will likely remain steady, with exports expected to keep expanding, Mao said.
Exports rebounded more than expected in March, but analysts say the gains could have been due to seasonal factors rather than a rebound in tepid global demand. Long holidays in February likely pushed some production into the following month.
The jump in output was also somewhat at odds with trade data last week, which showed imports shrank for the fourth straight month, suggesting domestic demand is still sluggish.
""We don't think the strength in industrial output is sustainable, said Nie Wen, an economist at Hwabao Trust.
""At home, the huge amount of social financing might ease as the central bank is wary of reigniting property market bubbles, while abroad the global economic recovery is expected to slow down,"" Nie said, penciling in more moderate output growth of 6.0-6.5 percent for the rest of the year.
The OECD on Tuesday sounded a warning about the dangers of prolonged stimulus, saying China's support measures will shore up growth this year and next but may undermine its drive to control debt and worsen structural distortions over the medium term.
Analysts polled by Reuters expect China's growth to slow to a near 30-year low of 6.2 percent this year, as sluggish demand at home and abroad and the trade war weigh on activity despite support measures.
The government is aiming for growth of 6.0-6.5 percent.
IMPROVING RETAIL SALES
Wednesday's data also helped ease fears of weakening consumer confidence in China. Retail sales rose 8.7 percent in March, beating estimates of 8.4 percent and the previous 8.2.
Sales were led by stronger demand for appliances, furniture and building materials, reflecting a resurgence in the residential property market, a key economic driver.
Real estate investment rose slightly to 11.8 percent in the first three months, while construction starts jumped in March. Data on Tuesday showed March new home prices rose at a quicker pace after months of cooling.
But auto sales extended their decline in March, falling 4.4 percent on-year.
Fixed-asset investment expanded 6.3 percent in January-to-March on-year, in line with estimates but picking up from the previous period as new road, rail and port projects gathered steam. 
Local governments will be allowed to issue 2.15 trillion yuan ($321 billion) of special purpose bonds in 2019 to fund infrastructure projects, a jump of 59 percent from last year.
NO SHARP REBOUND EXPECTED
On a quarterly basis, GDP in the first quarter grew 1.4 percent, as expected, but dipped from 1.5 percent in October-December.
However, many analysts do not expect a sharp rebound in China's economy like its recoveries in the past, which produced a strong reflationary pulse worldwide. Most say its stimulus has been relatively more restrained this time around, given concerns about high levels of debt left over from past credit sprees.
Earlier support measures will take time to fully kick in, and corporate balance sheets are expected to remain under stress if profits are slow to recover from their worst slump in more than seven years.
Some analysts such as Nomura warn there is a risk of a ""double dip"", where growth appears to improve only to falter soon after. In particular, it noted there was further heavy drop in land sales for future development, which could drag on construction and local government revenues later this year.
The central bank has already slashed banks' reserve requirement ratios (RRR) five times over the past year and is expected to ease policy further in coming quarters to spur lending and make borrowing costs more affordable.
However, some analysts said authorities could be more cautious about further stimulus if data remains solid.
China has rolled out many policies to support growth - the key is to implement them, Mao said.

Eurostat said prices in the 19-nation currency bloc rose 1.4 percent in March on the year, from a 1.5 percent increase a month earlier, confirming the previous reading. 
The ECB targets an inflation rate below, but close to 2.0 percent, and last week raised the prospect of more support for the euro zone in the face of an economic slowdown. 
On the month, inflation accelerated to 1.0 percent, as markets had expected, from 0.3 percent in February.
The core indicator watched closely by the ECB for its monetary policy decisions, which excludes volatile energy and food prices, dropped to 1.0 percent in March on the year from 1.2 percent in February. That was the weakest reading since April 2018, Eurostat data showed, confirming earlier estimates.
This can add to the pressure on the ECB as it battles an economic slowdown which threatens to undo years of stimulus, while many of its own rate-setters think the bank's economic projections are too optimistic.
A narrower inflation indicator that excludes energy, food, alcohol and tobacco was also confirmed dipping to 0.8 percent from 1.0 percent a month earlier.
Inflation was held back by a slowdown in price rises of food, alcohol and tobacco, which rose 1.8 percent on the year in March after a 2.3 percent rise in February.
Inflation in the services sector, the largest in the euro zone economy, also slowed to 1.1 percent from 1.4 percent in February.

Energy prices were the only major component of the index that accelerated in March, to a rise of 5.3 percent year-on-year from 3.6 percent in February.

The European Union's surplus with the United States grew to 21.6 billion euros in Jan-Feb 2019 from 20.9 billion euros ($23.7 billion) in the same period of 2018, EU statistics office Eurostat reported on Wednesday. With China, the EU's trade deficit expanded to 37.8 billion from 35.5 billion euros.
The United States has hit the European Union with tariffs and threatened more in complaint over the trade balance. Both Washington and Brussels have also complained that China wants free trade without playing fair.
Overall, the goods trade deficit of the 28-nation bloc increased to 28.4 billion euros in Jan-Feb 2019 from 20.7 billion a year earlier. 
Energy imports were the chief cause of the deficit, especially from Russia and Norway.
For the narrower 19-country euro zone, exports grew by 4.4 percent year-on-year in February and imports by 4.0 percent, leading to an expansion of its trade surplus to 17.9 billion in February from 16.5 billion euros a year earlier.

On a seasonally adjusted basis, the euro zone's trade surplus also increased to 19.5 billion euros in February from 17.4 billion in January as exports fell by 1.4 percent and imports declined by 2.7 percent.

1415,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 17, 2019 04:45AM ET</span>",London slump drags UK house price growth to more than six-year low,"LONDON, April 17 (Reuters) - - British house prices rose in February at the weakest rate in six-and-a-half years, dragged down by the biggest slump in London for a decade as Brexit uncertainty sent chills through the market.
Official data on Wednesday also showed consumer price inflation unexpectedly held just below the Bank of England's 2 percent target in March, offering some relief to consumers whose spending has helped Britain's economy through the Brexit crisis.
British house prices stood 0.6 percent higher in February than a year ago, slowing sharply from a 1.7 percent annual rise in January, the Office for National Statistics said.
In London, house prices plunged by 3.8 percent on the year -- the biggest drop since mid-2009. The malaise in the capital spread to the south-east of England, where prices fell for the first time since 2011.
Other surveys have shown Brexit to be a major drag on the property market in the capital, which is sensitive to flows of migrant workers from the European Union. A surge in prices in London in previous years has also stretched affordability.
Separately, the ONS said consumer prices rose at an annual rate of 1.9 percent in March, the same rate as in February. A Reuters poll of economists had pointed to 2.0 percent.
""Inflation is stable, with motor fuel prices rising between February and March this year, offset by falls in food prices as well as the cost of computer games growing more slowly than it did this time last year,"" ONS statistician Mike Hardie said.
The recent weakening of inflation, combined with the lowest unemployment rate in 44 years and rising wages, has taken the edge off the uncertainty about Brexit.
Britain's modest inflation rate is also helping the Bank of England to hold off on fresh interest rate hikes while it waits for the outcome of Britain's Brexit impasse.

BoE policymakers have said they want to see firm evidence of domestic inflation pressure building before they vote to raise rates.

The auto industry is facing a downturn in European demand just as it struggles to make drastic cuts to average fleet carbon dioxide emissions, or face massive fines.
Nissan deliveries were down 29.4 percent in March, broadly in line with their decline for the first quarter as a whole, as the Japanese brand reins in less profitable sales to car rental firms and other heavily discounted channels.
Ford, which is restructuring its European operations to address a weak European performance and the looming regulatory emissions hurdles, saw March registrations drop 15.5 percent.

Gross domestic product rose 6.4 percent in the first quarter from a year earlier, exceeding economist estimates and matching the previous three months. In March, factory output jumped 8.5 percent from a year earlier, much higher than forecast. Retail sales expanded 8.7 percent, while investment was up 6.3 percent in the year to date.
Pro-growth policies have helped arrest a slowdown that’s rattled investors and cast doubt over the global expansion. The stronger-than-expected performance spurred debate over whether more stimulus measures are needed or if the central bank and finance ministry should now begin paring back their support.
“The recovery has come earlier than expected on the back of policy support,” said Grace Ng, a China economist at JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM). in Hong Kong. “Macro policy won’t significantly ease further but won’t tighten either in the next few months. Fiscal policy may fade off approaching the end of the year after significant front-loading of spending early this year.”
The Shanghai Composite rose immediately after the data before dropping back to trade little changed. Ten-year bond yields also climbed and then reversed course, while the Australian dollar advanced on the bullish numbers.
The better-than-forecast China numbers coincide with shipping data that offer the latest signs of reprieve for global trade as the U.S. and China inch toward an agreement.
Investment by state-owned firms quickened to 6.7 percent and slowed for private firms to 6.4 percent, underscoring the government’s role in supporting growth. Economists forecast a full-year growth rate of 6.2 percent in 2019, down from 6.6 percent last year.

Within the unexpectedly strong industrial output numbers, car production grew in March for the first time since September, showing manufacturers might be growing more optimistic after the sales slump last year. China’s aluminum and steel output also reached records in the first quarter as producers ramped up operations amid prospects for better demand in the world’s biggest commodities consumer.
It wasn’t all good news. The surveyed jobless rate remained over 5 percent for a third month and the nominal growth rate, which is un-adjusted for price trends, decelerated.

1419,By Bloomberg,"<span>Apr 16, 2019 11:40PM ET</span>",China's Growth Story Has Plenty of Holes,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- As China posts yet another quarter of six percent-plus growth, analysts have been quick to brand the latest upswing as a rebound. Buoyed by this year’s double-digit stock-market gains, large flows of credit and tax cuts for consumers, Beijing is trying to sell the narrative that growth remains stable.
Some official statistics seem to support that theory: Gross domestic product grew an annualized 6.4 in the first quarter from a year earlier. Retail sales rose 8.7 percent and factory output climbed 8.5 percent. 
Dig beneath the headline data, though, and we get another story.
Beijing has been flooding the market with credit, with total social financing up 40 percent so far this year. Notably, the source of funds is expanding beyond banks, indicating an uptick in shadow activity. Yet fixed-asset investment is up only 6 percent from last year. That means loans aren’t heading into areas that will boost the real economy. Meanwhile, companies aren’t getting paid what they’re owed, and account receivables are building up.
The consumer side doesn’t look any better. Auto sales fell 11 percent in the first quarter from an already tepid 2018. Mobile-phone shipments slid 12 percent over the same period, compounding a 26 percent tumble a year earlier. Households are clearly feeling the pinch: They’re ordering less takeout from delivery apps and seeing fewer movies at the box office. Shoppers are using their credit cards more, with balances up 23 percent in the fourth quarter from a year earlier. And while surveys show household expenditure rose nearly 15 percent in 2018, there’s little left over in the budget for any extras. That helps explain why production of air conditioners is down 1 percent in the first two months of the year, while washing machine output dipped 7 percent.
Beijing has unveiled a standard buffet of fiscal stimulus, credit growth, debt restructuring and consumer-focused tax breaks to boost growth. It’s debatable whether any of that will work. Public finance doesn’t play out in a vacuum: A tax-cut recipient has the option of saving that money or spending it. Given high Chinese household debt levels, it’s quite likely that windfall will have a much smaller impact on consumption than hoped. The same thinking applies to firms and local governments.
The more pressing question might be how much new credit is flowing into financial markets given the rise in stocks and commodities prices. A long history of credit binges is a reminder that Beijing could end up spending a lot of money to accomplish very little.
With total inflation running at around 1 percent, compared with 2.9 percent at the end of 2018, the drop-off in nominal growth is going to push economy-wide leverage significantly higher in 2019. While Beijing has abandoned specific growth targets, it still aims for a range – and even that may not be feasible. Trying to maintain six percent-plus real growth in an economy already saddled with debt and excess capacity, one that can no longer depend on current account surpluses of 2 percent to 3 percent, is simply unrealistic. More than anything, Beijing may need to reset its own expectations.

One of the bright spots in recent data -- increasing shipments to the U.S. -- could darken if trade talks with the Trump administration that began this week turn sour.
The value of exports to the U.S. rose for a sixth month, by 4.4 percent, generating a bilateral surplus of 683.6 billion yen ($6.1 billion) in March, according to the finance ministry in Tokyo. Sales to China slumped, driving a 2.4 percent drop in total exports.
The figures came as negotiators wrapped up an initial round of trade talks in Washington that are being used by the U.S. to try to crack open Japan’s agricultural market and reduce America’s trade deficit. Japan has managed to dodge the talks for two years and is now trying avoid tariffs or quotas on auto exports, and a possible currency clause.

Electronics shipments dropped 26.7 percent from a year ago, weighing down overall non-oil domestic exports, which fell 11.7 percent. That was far worse than the 2.2 percent contraction forecast by economists in a Bloomberg survey.
The Chinese economic slowdown, uncertainty over U.S.-China trade talks, and disruptions around the Lunar New Year holidays have soured exports numbers this year, especially in trade-reliant economies like Singapore’s. The city state’s critical electronics sector has contracted for 15 of the past 16 months after an unexpected surge across the region for much of 2017.
Weaker Chinese demand has also resulted in exports to the U.S. outpacing those to China for the first time in more than seven years.
Economists are counting on a recovery in Chinese demand, helped by government stimulus measures, which should filter through to the region’s economies. China’s economy grew a better-than-expected 6.4 percent in the first quarter from a year ago, matching the previous three months’ pace, government data showed Wednesday. The Bloomberg survey median had called for a 6.3 percent gain.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's exports fell for a fourth straight month in March as China-bound shipments slumped again, reinforcing growing anxiety that weak external demand is likely to have knocked first quarter economic growth.
Ministry of Finance data out on Wednesday showed exports fell 2.4 percent in March from a year earlier, compared with a 2.7 percent drop predicted by economists in a Reuters poll, and followed a 1.2 percent decline in February.
The data reinforces worries that weak external demand may hurt company profits and in turn curb business expenditures, workers' wages and consumer spending in a broad hit to growth. 
Some analysts expect Japan's economy likely swung back to a mild contraction in the first quarter as declines in exports and capital expenditure dented private consumption. That would pile pressure on Prime Minister Shinzo Abe to once again delay a planned sales tax hike in October needed to fix the world's heaviest public debt burden at twice the size of its economy.
The economy grew at an annualized rate of 1.9 percent in the fourth quarter driven by business and consumer spending.
Bank of Japan Governor Haruhiko Kuroda last week stuck to his optimism that Japan's export-dependent economy will soon climb out of its doldrums as global growth recovers.
Kuroda, however, did warn of lingering risks to the global outlook, including the outcome of U.S.-China trade talks and Britain's potentially messy departure from the European Union.
Markets expect the BOJ to stand pat at a rate review next week, though some investors say the recent batch of soft indicators may pile pressure on policymakers to add to the central bank's already massive stimulus later in the year. 
Wednesday's data came on the heels of this week's bilateral trade talks between Tokyo and Washington.
U.S. President Donald Trump has prodded Japanese automakers to boost more jobs in the United States as the White House has threatened to impose tariffs of up to 25 percent on imported vehicles, on the grounds of national security.
Imports of Japanese cars make up about two-thirds of Japan's $69 billion annual trade surplus with the United States. 
U.S.-bound exports rose 4.4 percent in the year to March, driven by car shipments, which grew 5.1 percent. Imports from the United States declined 0.2 percent, resulting in Japan's trade surplus with the country rising 9.8 percent year-on-year to 683.6 billion yen.
Exports to China, Japan's biggest trading partner, fell 9.4 percent year-on-year in March, reversing from a 5.6 percent gain in February.
Asia-bound shipments, which account for more than half of overall exports, fell 5.5 percent, down for a fifth straight month.

Japan's overall imports rose 1.1 percent in the year to March, undershooting the median estimate for a 2.6 percent annual increase, resulting in a trade surplus of 528.5 billion yen.

1423,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 16, 2019 07:15PM ET</span>","UK marketing spending rises despite Brexit, uncertainty clouds forecast: survey","(Reuters) - British companies spent more on marketing in the opening quarter of 2019 despite uncertainty around Brexit, but their budgets for the rest of the year could be the most subdued since after the financial crisis, a survey showed.
The IPA Bellwether survey, conducted by IHS Markit, showed on Wednesday that 21.6 percent of marketing executives raised their budgets during the quarter, while just under 12.8 percent of executives who took part in the survey cut their marketing budgets. 
""This sharp increase following Q4 2018's flatlining signals that UK marketing budgets have received a much-needed kiss of life in an economy gripped by Brexit uncertainty,"" IPA Director General Paul Bainsfair said.
Bainsfair, however, added that the forecast for the year ahead was uncertain given the seemingly endless negotiations around Britain's exit from the European Union.
The report showed that cautious undertones were still apparent in budget plans for the current financial year, with panelists providing only modest growth expectations in available marketing spend. 
Brexit was postponed by a late-night agreement in Brussels last week that gave Prime Minister Theresa May until Oct. 31 to persuade parliament to approve the terms of the country's departure. 
""A return to growth in marketing budgets during the opening quarter of 2019 may come as a surprise given that the uncertainty that shrouds the UK political and economic climate has only built further,"" said Joe Hayes, economist at IHS Markit.
A six-year run of marketing spending growth at British companies ended in the final quarter of 2018 as uncertainty over Brexit led companies to clamp down on costs. 
While Brexit uncertainty continued to prompt belt tightening and a delay in decision-making, some companies pushed resources into their brands in the first quarter, the report showed.
The survey found that the best performing category was internet with its net balance seen at a growth of 17.2 percent in the quarter. 
The rise in marketing spend was supported by demand for big ticket advertising campaigns such as those on TV and radio. The survey also flagged that marketing executives expect further growth in traditional media advertising through the year. 

Around 300 UK marketing professionals, primarily from Britain's top 1,000 companies and across all key business sectors, were interviewed for the survey.

1424,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 16, 2019 12:42PM ET</span>",U.S. manufacturing mired in soft patch in first quarter,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. manufacturing output was unchanged in March after two straight monthly declines, resulting in the first quarterly drop in production since President Donald Trump was elected.
The weakness in manufacturing reported by the Federal Reserve on Tuesday is in tandem with a moderation in the broader economy, and is despite the White House's ""America First"" policies, including trade tariffs aimed at protecting domestic factories from what Trump says in unfair foreign competition.
Soft manufacturing and slowing economic growth reflect the ebbing stimulus from a $1.5 trillion tax cut package and supply chain disruptions caused by Washington's trade war with China.
""Manufacturing production has pivoted to the downside in the first quarter of the year, showing the revival in factories and output is sputtering for the first time since the Trump economics team took office,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG in New York. ""The trade war and America First policies have not brought factories back home yet.""
Manufacturing output last month was restrained by weak motor vehicle and wood products production after falling 0.3 percent in February. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast manufacturing production edging up 0.1 percent in March.
Production at factories dropped at a 1.1 percent annualized rate in the first quarter. That was the first quarterly drop since the third quarter of 2017 and followed a 1.7 percent pace of increase in the October-December period.
U.S. financial markets were little moved by the data.
Motor vehicles and parts production dropped 2.5 percent in March after increasing 2.3 percent in February. An inventory overhang in the automobile sector is weighing on production.
Factory employment declined in March for the first time since July 2017. Excluding motor vehicles and parts, manufacturing output rose 0.2 percent in March, lifted by increases in the production of primary metals, and computer and electronic products, after falling 0.5 percent in February.
UNDERWHELMING RECOVERY EVIDENCE
While that offered some glimmers of hope for manufacturing, the outlook for the sector, which accounts for about 12 percent of the economy, is cloudy. A survey from the New York Fed on Monday showed a measure of future business activity in New York state dropped to a more than three-year low in April, with companies downbeat about new orders and shipments.
""We think we could be moving past the worst of the recent soft patch for the manufacturing sector, although the evidence of this improvement has not been overwhelmingly clear,"" said Daniel Silver, an economist at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) in New York. 
Manufacturing is also being hobbled by last year's surge in the dollar and softening global economic growth, which are hurting exports. The sector could be further strained by Boeing's decision to stop deliveries and cut back production of its troubled 737 MAX aircraft. The MAX planes have been grounded indefinitely following two deadly crashes.
""The delivery stoppage and production slowdown of the 737 MAX will be a drag on production and orders data in the near term, and may subtract as much as two tenths of a percentage point from second-quarter GDP growth,"" said Tim Quinlan, a senior economist at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) Securities in Charlotte. 
While manufacturing is struggling, there are signs of green shoots in the housing market after activity contracted last year. A survey from the National Association of Home Builders on Tuesday showed confidence among single-family homebuilders edged up this month amid optimism over sales conditions and buyer traffic. 
The housing market is getting a lift from a fall in mortgage rates after they surged last year. But housing accounts for a small fraction of the economy, meaning the recovery in activity is unlikely to have a huge impact on gross domestic product. 
Growth forecasts for the first quarter are between a 1.5 percent and 2.3 percent annualized rate. The economy grew at a moderate 2.2 percent rate in the fourth quarter after expanding at a brisk 3.4 percent pace in the July-September period.
The flat manufacturing output in March, together with a 0.8 percent drop in mining, led to a 0.1 percent dip in industrial production. Industrial output edged up 0.1 percent in February. It fell at a 0.3 percent rate in the first quarter after rising at a 4.0 percent pace in the fourth quarter.
Mining production was unchanged in February. Oil and gas well drilling rebounded 0.3 percent in March after tumbling 1.3 percent in February. Utilities output gained 0.2 percent in March after surging 3.7 percent the prior month. 
Capacity utilization for the manufacturing sector, a measure of how fully firms are using their resources, slipped to 76.4 percent last month, the lowest in a year, from 76.5 percent in February. Overall capacity use for the industrial sector fell to 78.8 percent from 79.0 percent in February. 

It is 1.0 percentage point below its 1972-2017 average. Officials at the Fed tend to look at capacity use measures for signals of how much ""slack"" remains in the economy — how far growth has room to run before it becomes inflationary.

LONDON (Reuters) - Once shunned due to intense public scrutiny and competition from corporate buyers, private equity firms are increasingly targeting listed companies in Europe, shrugging off forecasts of a regional economic slowdown.
European buyouts have hit a 12-year record of $31.6 billion so far this year, of which almost half has been invested in listed companies, Refinitiv data shows, with industry buyers deterred by geopolitical concerns and global slowdown fears. 
Although these worries have led to a 67 percent fall in European mergers and acquisitions (M&A) activity in the first quarter, buyout firms - entrusted with record amounts of cash to invest - say they cannot stay on the sidelines.
""Whether it's a good or bad time, the industry's job is to put money at work,"" said Warburg Pincus European head Daniel Zilberman. Warburg Pincus is leading a $3.4 billion deal to buy British satellite operator Inmarsat with Apax Partners.
So-called take-private deals, where a public company is bought and delisted, hit their highest level last year since a previous boom in 2006–2007, a report by Bain & Company showed, with 170 such deals clinched globally. 
Of $227 billion of public-to-private deals last year, $71 billion were in Europe and $118 billion in North America.
This is continuing into 2019, with a consortium of Hellman & Friedman and Blackstone (NYSE:BX) buying German classifieds group Scout24 in a 5.7 billion euro deal which ranks as the biggest private equity takeover of a listed company in Germany.
""Private equity funds are not scared of a downturn. They have the flexibility to underwrite any macro concern in their pricing model and holding periods. In fact, they can take a long-term approach if market conditions suddenly deteriorate,"" Laurent Haziza, global co-head of financial sponsors at Rothschild, said.
This confidence is backed by cash swelling U.S. private equity coffers, highlighted by Blackstone's latest $22 billion buyout fund.
And European rivals are keeping up the pace as London-based Cinven looks to raise 10 billion euros for its seventh fund, sources said, well beyond an initial target of 8 billion euros, while CVC raised a record 16 billion euros in 2017.

""UNDER PRESSURE""
Private equity investors say European mid-cap companies - especially those trading in London's FTSE 250 index which has been on a downward trajectory for the past 12 months - have become cheaper due to macro-economic jitters, with executives more receptive to their proposals as a result.
""Most CEOs are under pressure as they need to prepare for a downturn and consider ways to keep funding growth. They are increasingly turning to private equity firms to discuss their options,"" Luca Bassi, a managing director at Bain Capital Private Equity, said.
Bassi also said the perception of private equity funds has changed due to their growing focus on piecing together global industry leaders.
""We are part of the same ecosystem,"" he said, pointing to Bain's expertise in digital payments. ""The days of corporate raids have gone. We can help companies navigate the recession when it hits.""
But bankers and analysts say some buyout funds may regret paying top dollar to buy listed companies.
""The biggest risk for private equity funds is a contraction of valuation multiples at exit,"" Zilberman at Warburg Pincus said. ""At the moment assets are priced at very high multiples, but interest rates are rising, the cost of capital is going up and multiples will need to come down over time.""
The average purchase price for leveraged buyouts in Europe has surged to nearly 11 times core earnings (EBITDA) in 2018, above levels leading up to the global financial crisis, data from LCD, part of S&P Global (NYSE:SPGI) Market Intelligence, showed.
In the United States valuations have hovered at an all-time high of roughly 10.6 times EBITDA since 2017.

""You need to create real strategic value to justify the kind of multiples in the market and meet your return targets,"" said Zilberman of Warburg Pincus. ""But you also need to price in a recession and prepare for the worst."" 
In the boom years of 2006-2007, when global private equity investments surged to roughly $650 billion, the industry relied on excessive debt to fund mega deals and then extracted returns through financial engineering, resulting in companies struggling to stay afloat and some funds going out of business.
Although similar fears have started to surface given the combination of record asset prices, abundant capital and an uncertain economic backdrop, the industry is so far unfazed.

""Higher risk is a function of higher returns. Big funds are designed to take on more risk, and often over longer time horizons,"" JP Morgan's co-head of EMEA M&A Dwayne Lysaght said.

1426,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 16, 2019 05:37AM ET</span>",UK wage growth at new decade high as employers hire in the face of Brexit,"By William Schomberg and Andy Bruce
LONDON (Reuters) - British workers' pay grew at its joint fastest pace in over a decade as employers extended their hiring spree, adding to signs that uncertainty about Brexit is prompting firms to take on workers rather than commit to longer-term investments.
Contrasting with other sluggish readings of Britain's economy, total earnings, including bonuses, rose by an annual 3.5 percent in the three months to February, official data showed, in line with a Reuters poll of economists.
That was the joint highest rate since mid-2008 although in the month of February on its own the pace of wage growth slowed.
Britain's labor market has defied the approach of Brexit, helping households whose spending drives the economy. Last week, Britain's exit from the EU was delayed until October.
Employment grew by 179,000 in the three months to February, in line with the Reuters poll forecast, helping to keep the unemployment rate at 3.9 percent, its lowest since early 1975, the Office for National Statistics said.
However, the jobs surge could reflect nervousness among employers about Brexit and risks aggravating Britain's long-standing productivity problem, the Achilles heel of the world's fifth-biggest economy.
Workers can be hired and then fired if the economy takes a hit, whereas investment in technology and new machinery -- which helps the economy over the long term -- fell throughout 2018.
PRODUCTIVITY PROBLEM
""The elongated period of uncertainty has kept businesses in a hiring cycle,"" Tej Parikh, an economist at the Institute of Directors, an employers group, said.
""Without a pick-up in investment, low productivity will also keep wages from growing further, particularly when considering the higher regulatory costs businesses are facing this tax year.""
Data earlier this month showed output-per-hour rose by only 0.5 percent in 2018, well below the annual average of 2 percent before the global financial crisis.
Accountancy firm Deloitte said on Monday that large British-based businesses were increasingly focused on cashflow as they worried about the long-term economic hit from Brexit.
The ONS said the increase in jobs over the past year was all coming from full-time workers, both employees and self-employed.
Average weekly earnings, excluding bonuses, rose by an annual 3.4 percent, the ONS said, in line with the Reuters poll and down from 3.5 percent in the three months to January.
It was the first fall in that measure of pay growth since the middle of last year.
The strength of the labor market is pushing up wages more quickly than the Bank of England has forecast, leading some economists to think it might move quickly to raise interest rates once the Brexit uncertainty lifts.

The BoE forecast in February that wage growth would slow to 3.0 percent by the end of 2019 with the overall economy likely to grow at its slowest pace in a decade.

1427,By Investing.com,"<span>Apr 16, 2019 05:16AM ET</span>",'Green Shoots' of German Recovery Seen as ZEW Index Turns Positive,"Investing.com -- The worst may be over for the German economy.
A closely-watched measure of confidence turned positive for the first time in 11 months in April, suggesting that the euro zone's most important economy may be regaining momentum after nearly tipping into recession around the turn of the year.
The economic sentiment index compiled by the Mannheim-based think-tank ZEW rose to 3.1 from -3.6 in March, a stronger rise than forecast by economists and the first time in 13 months that the index has been above zero.
""After a long series of downward revisions of German growth prospects, it could be time for first (tentative) upward revisions,"" said ING economist Carsten Brzeski, pointing to the ZEW's (not always reliable) function as an indicator of turning points for the economy. He said that the drop in the euro's trade-weighted exchange rate and the more accommodative stance taken recently by the European Central Bank had helped to improve sentiment.
There was also better news on a Europe-wide front, as the EU's statistics agency Eurostat reported that construction activity in both the euro zone and the EU overall rose at its fastest rate since 2011 in February. Construction, like retail, is one of the more domestic-focused sectors of the economy that has helped keep activity ticking over in recent months as the export-sensitive manufacturing sector has suffered from the fallout of trade tensions between the U.S. and China.
""It may be that some of the super gloomy (euro zone) forecasts for Q1 may need to be revised,"" Angel Talavera, a European economist with Oxford Economics, said via Twitter.


.
ING's Brzeski warned against giving the all-clear too soon, however.
""While the current situation in the industry is not as disastrous as some data points suggest, as order books are still filled, the risk of a negative sentiment loop or a cycle of fear has clearly increased.""

1429,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 15, 2019 12:00PM ET</span>",Brazil's economic activity falls in February by most in nine months,"SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Brazilian economic activity contracted in February by the most in nine months, a central bank indicator showed on Monday, adding to concerns about a sluggish start to the year for Latin America's largest economy.
The central bank's IBC-BR economic activity index, a leading indicator of gross domestic product (GDP), fell 0.73 percent in February from January. That followed a revised drop of 0.31 percent in January, a smaller contraction than first reported.
""Economic indicators so far continue to suggest a slight drop of 0.1 percent for GDP in the first quarter of this year,"" Bradesco economists wrote in a note.
The data adds to pressure on new President Jair Bolsonaro to reignite an economic recovery which has been lackluster since Brazil's deep 2015-2016 recession. The cornerstone of Bolsonaro's economic agenda is a pension reform bill aimed at restoring public finances, which received a rocky reception in Congress.

Treasury Secretary Mansueto Almeida told Reuters last week that Brazil must stick to its fiscal commitments and cut public spending for the long-term benefit of the country, even if that has a detrimental short-term effect on the economy.

1430,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 15, 2019 04:36AM ET</span>",Turkish unemployment jumps to highest in nearly a decade,"ANKARA (Reuters) - Turkey's unemployment rate surged to 14.7 percent in the December-February period, its highest level in nearly a decade according to official data on Monday, as the effects of last year's currency crisis continued to weigh on workers.
The jobless rate was up from 13.5 percent in the previous period ending in January, and it included a jump in youth unemployment to its highest level since at least 2005. 
The Turkish economy contracted a sharper than expected 3 percent in the fourth quarter of 2018, its worst performance in nearly a decade, indicating that last year's near 30 percent slide in the lira had tipped it into recession.
Both President Tayyip Erdogan and his son-in-law Finance Minister Berat Albayrak have said Turkey has left the worst of its economic troubles behind, and Albayrak last week announced a series of structural measures to prop up the ailing economy.
Inflation has slipped from last year's high but remains elevated, and the country's current account deficit has narrowed sharply. 
However, the number of people registered as unemployed rose to 4.67 million in the three months to February, a surge of more than one million from a year earlier, data from the Turkish Statistics Institute showed. 
Non-agricultural unemployment stood at 16.8 percent in the same period, the data showed, jumping from 15.6 percent in the November-January period.
In February, the government and Union of Chambers and Commodity Exchanges launched a campaign to boost employment, which they said will provide jobs for 2.5 million people.
But Turkish unemployment was expected to continue rising in the months ahead and weigh on private consumption and investment, ratings agency Moody's said in March. 
Tatha Ghose, senior emerging markets economist at Commerzbank (DE:CBKG), said: ""The labor market is a lagging indicator and we all know Turkey is in a recession, and until that changes, unemployment is expected to go up.""
""It should go up further as the recovery has not yet taken hold and will continue rising at least until July or August. It will get worse before it gets better,"" Ghose said.
In the three months to February, the unemployment rate among people aged 15-24 rose to 26.7 percent, its highest level since the data became available in 2005, the data showed.

Overall unemployment last stood at 14.7 percent in the February-April period of 2009.

1431,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 15, 2019 02:05AM ET</span>",UK economy leans on consumers as Brexit drags on business,"LONDON (Reuters) - Moving slowly in the fog of Brexit and slowing global growth, Britain's economy is increasingly reliant on consumers and their spending as business investment and exports fade.
The world's fifth-biggest economy grew 1.4 percent in 2018, the weakest increase in six years, and it looks set to slow further in 2019.
On Wednesday, the European Union delayed Britain's departure from the bloc until the end of October, but scepticism runs high that lawmakers in London can form a consensus over Brexit.
Below are charts that highlight some of the most notable features of Britain's economy in early 2019.
CONSUMER SPENDING: HOLDING UP
Household spending grew by the least since 2012 last year. Some of the slowdown was a by-product of the June 2016 Brexit vote, which hammered the value of the pound and pushed up inflation above wage growth through most of 2017.
But pay growth has rebounded in recent months, helping to support consumer spending. 
In late 2018, households and the government were the only drivers of Britain's weak economy. Business investment and net trade dragged on growth.
Bank of England Governor Mark Carney said the world economy was suffering some of the same problems. ""Normally when expansions are reliant on the consumer, you start watching the clock, in terms of how much longer it will last,"" he said.

INVESTMENT? WHAT INVESTMENT?
Businesses have held back on plans for investment ever since it became clear that Britain was going to hold a referendum on its membership of the EU.
The value of business investment lost in Britain's economy since the June 2016 referendum is roughly 10 billion pounds compared with its simple trend growth from late 2009 to the second quarter of 2016. 
Graphic: UK business investment flatlines after Brexit vote, click https://tmsnrt.rs/2D1Ctcs 
STOCKPILING 
The extent of stockpiling going on among British manufacturers looks likely to limit the extent of any potential rebound in investment.
A survey earlier this month showed manufacturers upped their stocks of materials and parts at a pace never before seen in a Group of Seven advanced economy.
Official data has suggested stockpiling had boosted factories in February, although by how much was unclear.
Economists worry that the recent drive to build inventories has brought forward output, heralding a downturn later.

WILL CONSUMERS KEEP SPENDING?
Public confidence in the economic outlook is weaker in Britain than in any other EU country, according to European Commission data.
Thus far, this has not had a big impact on consumer spending as households' budgets have benefited from faster wage growth. But it suggests there is a risk that Britons could tighten their belts if the recovery in pay falters.

WHAT WILL THE BANK OF ENGLAND DO?
The Bank of England has long signaled that it thinks interest rates should rise in a limited and gradual way, as long as Brexit progresses smoothly. 
But with the uncertainty set to last for several more months, the BoE is likely to sit tight, especially with indicators such as the IHS Markit/CIPS purchasing managers' index - historically a good marker for interest rate moves - a long way from levels typically consistent with a rate hike.

The BoE's nine rate-setters might want to avoid adding to economic uncertainty by giving different views on the outlook for borrowing costs.

Southeast Asia's largest economy had a surplus of $540 million in March, compared with February's $330 million surplus and a forecast of $180 million deficit in a Reuters poll.
Exports fell 10.01 percent from a year earlier to $14.03 billion in March. This was against an 11.82 percent drop expected in the poll.
Imports dropped 6.76 percent to $13.49 billion, compared to the poll's forecast of a 3.76 percent decline.
Trade deficit hit a record high of $8.5 billion in 2018 and authorities have been trying to reverse that by raising tariffs to halt imports and relaxing rules to support exports.
Analysts say an improvement in trade and current account deficits is a determining factor for Bank Indonesia (BI) to start loosening monetary policy, now that inflation is stable and the U.S. Federal Reserve will probably not raise rates further this year.
BI last year increased interest rates by a total of 175 basis points in response to a weak rupiah and capital outflows that were partly prompted by rising U.S. interest rates and large trade and current account deficits.

The central bank's next policy meeting is scheduled for April 24-25.

The country’s current-account balance is expected to maintain its improving trend, Cetinkaya said. Developments with domestic demand and the bank’s tight monetary policy have led to some improvement in inflation indicators and the central bank will continue to use all available instruments to achieve price stability, according to the governor.

The Labor Department said on Friday import prices rose 0.6 percent last month, boosted by increases in the costs of fuels and industrial supplies. Data for February was revised higher to show import prices rising 1.0 percent, the largest monthly advance since May 2016. 
Petroleum prices rose 4.7 percent in March, slowing from February's 9.7 percent gain. Industrial supplies and materials were up 2.7 percent.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast import prices rising 0.4 percent in March. 
In the 12 months through March, import prices were unchanged after declining on an annual basis in the three prior months. 
The report comes after data earlier this week showed consumer prices in March rose by the most in 14 months and producer prices increased by the most in five months on higher gasoline costs, while inflation excluding the volatile food and energy components remained tame. 
Minutes of the Federal Reserve's March 19-20 policy meeting published on Wednesday described inflation as ""muted,"" though officials expected it to rise to or near the U.S. central bank's 2 percent target.

1438,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 12, 2019 05:09AM ET</span>","China auto sales drop at smallest pace in seven months, tax cuts help","By Yilei Sun and Brenda Goh
BEIJING (Reuters) - China's auto sales fell again in March but the pace of decline was the smallest in seven months, industry data showed, as car makers reduced retail prices to boost business after Beijing handed out tax cuts to spur consumer spending.
Sales fell 5.2 percent from a year ago to 2.52 million vehicles, the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers (CAAM) said on Friday, marking the ninth straight month of decline in the world's largest auto market.
But this was the smallest drop since August 2018.
""We saw a warmer recovery in March. We are optimistic and hope to see the turning point appear in around July and August"" said Xu Haidong, assistant secretary general at CAAM, the country's biggest auto industry association.
Recent government cuts to value-added tax (VAT) are expected to further benefit car sales, Xu added. ""The VAT cut can drive production and employment, so an effective implementation of the policy can bring warmth to the market."" 
China has cut VAT for the manufacturing sector to 13 percent from 16 percent, prompting some car makers such as BMW and Mercedes-Benz to lower prices.
""We expect China's auto market to see positive growth in the third quarter and a relatively large increase in the fourth,"" said Alan Kang, Shanghai-based analyst at LMC Automotive. 
In 2018, China's car market hit reverse for the first time since the 1990s against a backdrop of slowing economic growth and a crippling Sino-U.S. trade war.
However, new energy vehicle (NEV) sales have remained a bright spot, jumping almost 62 percent last year even as the broader auto market contracted.
Last month, NEV sales rose 85.4 percent to 126,000 units, the CAAM said.
China has been a keen supporter of NEV - pure battery electric, hybrid and plug-in hybrids - and has started implementing NEV sales quota requirements for automakers.

After rolling out a generous 5-year NEV subsidy program in 2016 to support sales and encourage innovation, Beijing recently pledged to phase it out by 2020 and raise standards for vehicles eligible for subsidies amid criticism some firms have become too reliant on the funds.

1439,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 12, 2019 04:55AM ET</span>",China March exports rebound to five-month high but imports fall more than expected,"By Lusha Zhang and Kevin Yao
BEIJING (Reuters) - China's exports rebounded in March but imports shrank for a fourth straight month and at a sharper pace, painting a mixed picture of the economy as trade talks with the United States reach their endgame. 
Investors are hoping for signs of economic recovery in China to temper worries about slowing global growth, after the IMF this week downgraded its 2019 world outlook for the third time.
But veteran China watchers had said export gains may be due more to seasonal factors than any sudden turnaround in lackluster global demand, as shipments were expected to jump after long holidays in February.
March exports rose 14.2 percent from a year earlier, customs data showed on Friday, the strongest growth in five months. Economists polled by Reuters had expected a 7.3 percent gain after February's 20.8 percent plunge.
Shipments picked up around 3 percent month-on-month, suggesting some improvement in foreign demand, Julian Evans-Pritchard, senior China economist at Capital Economics, said in a note. But he said exports have yet to fully recover from a sharp slowdown late last year.
""With global growth set to remain weak in the coming quarters, a strong rebound in exports looks unlikely,"" he said. 
Adding to the worries, China's imports fell more than expected, suggesting its domestic demand remains weak.
Imports fell 7.6 percent from a year earlier, worse than analysts' forecasts for a 1.3 percent fall and widening from February's 5.2 percent drop.
That left the country with a trade surplus of $32.64 billion for the month, according to Reuters calculations based on the official data, much larger than forecasts of $7.05 billion.
In the first quarter, exports rose 1.4 percent from a year earlier, while imports fell 4.8 percent.
A customs spokesman said he expects mild growth in both exports and imports in the current quarter.
China also released lending data on Friday that, unlike trade, was unambiguously strong. 
Chinese banks extended 1.69 trillion yuan ($251.59 billion) in net new yuan loans in March, up sharply from February and far more than expected, as policymakers push bankers to keep lending to struggling smaller companies, even at the risk of more bad loans. 
Total bank lending in the first three months of 2019 hit a record quarterly tally of 5.81 trillion yuan, suggesting months of policy loosening by the central bank are starting to bear fruit.
Strong credit growth is likely to reinforce analysts' views that the economy will stabilize later in the year after a rocky first half.
TENTATIVE SIGNS OF RECOVERY
China factory surveys for March had provided some glimmers of hope that demand was improving at home and abroad, suggesting government stimulus measures may be starting to take hold.
While export orders remained sluggish, there were signs that a long spell of contraction was easing even as trade talks with the United States appeared to be making progress.
Washington and Beijing have largely agreed on a mechanism to police any trade agreement they reach, including establishing new ""enforcement offices,"" U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said on Wednesday.
However, a top White House official said on Monday the U.S. side is ""not satisfied yet"" about all the issues standing in the way of a deal to end the U.S.-China trade war.
President Donald Trump said last week that an agreement could be reached in about four weeks.
But economists warn that even if a deal is reached, and both sides rescind tit-for-tat tariffs, Chinese exporters will still have to contend with weakening demand globally. 
The International Monetary Fund trimmed its 2019 global growth forecast this week to 3.3 percent, while slightly boosting its forecast for China to 6.3 percent, in part because the Sino-U.S. trade war did not escalate as much as expected.
Chinese exporters will also likely have to scramble to win back lost market share.
The trade dispute has prompted some U.S. firms to shift purchases of tariff-targeted products like furniture and refrigerators to countries such as Vietnam, South Korea, Taiwan and Mexico, according to a report by S&P Global (NYSE:SPGI) Market Intelligence's trade data firm Panjiva.
China's trade surplus with the United States, a major source of frustration for Washington, rose nearly 40 percent in March from February to $20.5 billion and hit $62.66 billion in the first quarter. 
SHRINKING IMPORTS
On imports, analysts said companies may not be restocking inventories as much as usual due to concerns over the longer-term economic outlook and global trade, though an infrastructure push is likely to see imports of raw materials improve. 
Slackening demand has sent corporate profits into a tailspin, which could curb the fresh investment that Beijing is counting on to fuel an economic revival.
Policymakers have acknowledged the economy is under pressure as multi-year debt and pollution crackdown have deterred investment, while the trade war is increasingly hurting China's exporters and their domestic supply chains.
In response, Beijing has announced more spending on roads, railways and ports, along with trillions of yuan of tax cuts to ease pressure on corporate balance sheets and avert a sharper economic slowdown. State-controlled banks are also being urged to keep lending to companies that are struggling.
Investors are closely watching to see how long it will take those support measures to take hold. But analysts believe China will still need to loosen policy further in coming months to ensure a sustained economic turnaround.

China's economic growth is expected to cool to around 6.3 percent in the first quarter of the year and may not bottom out until later in the year, according to a Reuters poll. The economy grew 6.6 percent last year, a 28-year low.

Thirty-year mortgage rates averaged 4.12% in the week ended April 11, up from the previous week's 4.08%. Two weeks earlier, they fell to 4.06%, which was the lowest since Jan. 18, 2018, the mortgage finance agency said.

1441,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 11, 2019 08:45AM ET</span>",U.S. weekly jobless claims lowest since 1969,"WASHINGTON, (Reuters) - The number of Americans filing applications for unemployment benefits dropped to a 49-1/2-year low last week, pointing to sustained labor market strength that could temper expectations of a sharp slowdown in economic growth.
Initial claims for state unemployment benefits fell 8,000 to a seasonally adjusted 196,000 for the week ended April 6, the lowest level since early October 1969. Claims have now declined for four straight weeks. Data for the prior week was revised to show 2,000 more applications received than previously reported. 
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast claims would rise to 211,000 in the latest week. The Labor Department said no states were estimated last week.
The four-week moving average of initial claims, considered a better measure of labor market trends as it irons out week-to-week volatility, fell 7,000 to 207,000 last week, the lowest level since early December 1969.
The labor market is the main pillar of support for the economy, which appears to have lost momentum in the first quarter as the stimulus from a $1.5 trillion tax cut package fades and a trade war between China and the United States and softening global demand hurt exports. 
Nonfarm payrolls increased by 196,000 jobs in March, well above the roughly 100,000 needed per month to keep up with growth in the working-age population. The unemployment rate is at 3.8 percent, close to the 3.7 percent Federal Reserve officials project it will be by the end of the year. 

Thursday's claims report showed the number of people receiving benefits after an initial week of aid decreased 13,000 to 1.71 million for the week ended March 30. The four-week moving average of the so-called continuing claims dropped 11,000 to 1.73 million.

The Labor Department said on Thursday its producer price index for final demand rose 0.6 percent last month, lifted by a surge in the cost of gasoline. That was the largest increase since last October and followed a 0.1 percent gain in February.
In the 12 months through March, the PPI rose 2.2 percent after advancing 1.9 percent in February. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the PPI would climb 0.3 percent in March and increase 1.9 percent on a year-on-year basis.
A key gauge of underlying producer price pressures that excludes food, energy and trade services was unchanged last month after ticking up 0.1 percent in February. The so-called core PPI increased 2.0 percent in the 12 months through March. That was the smallest annual increase since August 2017 and followed a 2.3 percent rise in February..
Data on Wednesday showed consumer prices rose by the most in 14 months in March, driven by more expensive gasoline. But core inflation remained muted amid a plunge in the cost of apparel.
Slowing domestic and global growth are keeping inflation contained. Wage inflation has also been moderate despite a tight labor market. 
Minutes of the Federal Reserve's March 19-20 policy meeting published on Wednesday described inflation as ""muted,"" though officials expected it to rise to or near the U.S. central bank's 2 percent target. The Fed's preferred inflation measure, the core personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index, is currently at 1.8 percent.
Last month, wholesale energy prices jumped 5.6 percent, with gasoline prices shooting up 16.0 percent, the most since August 2009. Energy prices rose 1.8 percent in February. 
Gasoline accounted for over 60 percent of the 1.0 percent rise in goods prices last month. Goods prices increased 0.4 percent in February.
Wholesale food prices rose 0.3 percent in March, reversing a 0.3 percent drop in the prior month. Core goods prices rose 0.2 percent after edging up 0.1 percent in February.
The cost of services increased 0.3 percent in March after being unchanged in the prior month. Prices for healthcare services fell 0.2 percent last month. There was a sharp drop in the cost of hospital outpatient services. Those healthcare costs feed into the core PCE price index.

The Labor Department said its producer price index (PPI) increased 0.3% last month, while the core PPI, which excludes food and energy costs, rose 0.6%.
In the 12 months through February, overall factory prices increased 2.2% while core prices rose 2.4%.
The Fed watches these data because producers often pass higher costs on to consumers, putting upward pressure on inflation.
However, the annualized reading for core PPI slowed from February’s reading of 2.5%, mirroring a similar move seen in consumer prices in data released on Wednesday."

Economists had expected weekly jobless claims to rise to 211,000 from the previous week’s upwardly revised total of 204,000.
The four-week moving average was 207,000, a decline of 7,000 from the previous week. The monthly average is seen as a more accurate gauge of labor trends because it reduces volatility in the week-to-week data.
That was the lowest level since Dec. 6, 1969.
Continuing jobless claims declined to 1.713 million from 1.726 million in the preceding week, compared to expectations for an increase to 1.738 million."

BEIJING (Reuters) - China's factory-gate inflation picked up for the first time in nine months in March, lifted by price rises in global commodities as well as signs that government efforts to boost the economy may be putting a floor under domestic demand. 
Consumer inflation also quickened, jumping to the highest since October 2018 as pork prices soared due to a growing epidemic of swine fever, official data showed on Thursday.
The step-up in producer inflation, while slight, will ease deflation worries and likely add to optimism that the world's second-largest economy is starting to turn the corner. Recent surveys showed factory activity expanded for the first time in months in March.
But analysts urge caution, saying it will take a few more months of better data and further policy support from Beijing to see if a recovery can be sustained. 
China's producer price index (PPI) in March rose 0.4 percent from a year earlier, driven largely by rapid rises in oil and gas prices, and advancing from a 0.1 percent increase in February, the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) said.
That was in line with analysts' forecasts in a Reuters poll. 
Most of the gain was in mining, with prices rising 4.2 percent on-year, up from 1.8 percent in February. Drops in raw material prices also moderated.
Beijing is fast-tracking more infrastructure projects, which is pushing up prices of construction materials.
Surging iron ore prices hit a record domestically on Tuesday, fuelled by concerns over tight global supply after disruptions to production and shipments at top miners in Brazil and Australia. Prices of steel reinforcing bars used in building hit a 7-1/2 year high this week.
But underlying demand in other parts of the economy still appears subdued. Prices of consumer durables fell for a second month, pointing to weakness in demand for big-ticket items such as cars and appliances.
""Looking ahead, we expect oil prices to fall back in the coming months. This will drag down PPI... Meanwhile, continued economic weakness is likely to keep a lid on broader price pressures,"" said Julian Evans-Pritchard, Senior China Economist at Capital Economics. 
On a monthly basis, producer prices increased for the first time in five months. The index inched up 0.1 percent, compared with a 0.1 percent decrease in February.
The world's second-largest economy is growing at its weakest pace in almost three decades amid weaker domestic demand and a year-long trade war with the United States. Multi-year campaigns to curb debt risks and pollution have deterred fresh investment.
Last month, the government announced nearly 2 trillion yuan (227 billion pounds) in additional tax cuts to ease the pressure on corporate balance sheets, while authorities are pressing banks to keep lending to struggling smaller firms.
Cuts in value-added tax (VAT) that kicked in on April 1 have already led authorities to reduce prices for electricity and natural gas. Retail gasoline and diesel prices are to be reduced as well.
A growing number of companies ranging from Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) to BMW have lowered prices for their products following the tax cuts.
SWINE FEVER DRIVING UP PORK PRICES
The consumer price index (CPI) in March rose 2.3 percent from a year earlier, a five-month high, largely due to higher pork prices as the spread of African swine fever prompts farmers to cull their herds. 
That was more than a 1.5 percent increase in February but just below market expectations for a 2.4 percent rise.
Pork prices rose 5.1 percent in March from a year earlier, the first increase after a 25-month declining streak. 
On a month-on-month basis, CPI rose 1.2 percent. 
Some analysts forecast pig production in China, which eats about half of the world's pork, will fall by around 30 percent in 2019, which would send meat prices soaring.
But economists say the central bank is unlikely to overreact to a food price spike if it appears temporary and core inflation, which strips out volatile energy and food prices, remains steady.

Non-food consumer inflation was 1.8 percent on-year, just a touch more than February.

1447,By Bloomberg,"<span>Apr 11, 2019 12:10AM ET</span>",China Consumer Inflation Surge Seen as Unlikely to Shift PBOC,"(Bloomberg) -- China’s consumer prices surged on the back of temporary food supply factors, while factory inflation provided further evidence of a nascent economic recovery.
Consumer inflation accelerated to 2.3 percent in March from a year earlier, up from 1.5 percent in February and posting the biggest jump in more than a year. The surge was mostly led by rising vegetable and pork prices, which drove the CPI up by more than half a percentage point, according to the National Bureau of Statistics.
Core consumer prices, excluding food and energy, stayed flat at 1.8 percent, and factory inflation halted a dis-inflationary slide, gaining 0.4 percent.
Because the inflation rebound was driven by food-price increases that may prove temporary, the central bank is unlikely to abandon its policy of keeping cheap money flowing to the private sector for now. Lingering deflation risks and uncertainties over the trade war and the sustainability of the economic upswing also argue for caution.
“Monetary policy won’t make adjustments, and overall inflation won’t be a big issue for this year"" because core inflation remains steady and factory-gate prices will stay at a low level going forward, said Ding Shuang, chief China and North Asia economist at  Standard Chartered  (LON:STAN) Bank Ltd. in Hong Kong. The People’s Bank of China is likely in an “observation window” at the moment.
Pork prices, a key element in the country’s CPI basket, rose 5.1 percent in March, the first increase after 25 months of decline. That alone drove the CPI to rise 0.12 percentage point, the NBS said in a statement. Over a million hogs were culled in an outbreak of African swine fever and pig feed output has dropped.
Rebounding factory prices signal a further firming in the nascent economic recovery, which if sustained give firms greater pricing power, aid profits and the help them repay their debts. The outlook for producer-price inflation is still modest. The PPI index will likely grow by just 0.3 percent in 2019, according to the median estimate of 15 economists in a Bloomberg survey, down from a forecast of 0.8 percent in February.
What Bloomberg’s Economists Say...
“With the economy broadly slowing and the banking system in need of liquidity, we think it necessary for the People’s Bank of China to sustain support -- and the current inflationary environment still allows room for it to do so.”-- David Qu and Qian Wan, Bloomberg Economics in Hong Kong-- For the full note click here
Economists are looking ahead to first-quarter output data due next week for hard evidence that the worst of a cyclical slowdown is over as multiple targeted stimulus measures kick in. Signs that China’s economy is stabilizing have spurred a debate about whether the central bank should keep injecting liquidity into financial markets, with a former senior official warning of the risk of asset bubbles.
Economists and traders expect the PBOC to cut reserve requirements at least three more times this year, having used such cuts since early 2018 to manage market liquidity and funnel cash into the slowing economy. It will likely take more than a higher food prices to shift the central bank, according to Lu Ting, chief China economist at Nomura Holdings Inc.
“The acceleration in CPI inflation mainly comes from pork prices rather than a general rise in prices,” he said. “Unless inflationary pressures spread over to other areas, the central bank will more likely look through the cyclical acceleration in pork prices and continue to support the economic growth via an easing monetary policy bias throughout the rest of this year.”

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. consumer prices increased by the most in 14 months in March, but the underlying inflation trend remained benign amid slowing domestic and global economic growth.
The mixed report from the Labor Department on Wednesday was broadly supportive of the Federal Reserve's decision last month to suspended its three-year campaign to raise interest rates. The U.S. central bank dropped projections for any rate hikes this year after lifting borrowing costs four times in 2018. 
Minutes of the Fed's March 19-20 meeting, published on Wednesday, showed most policymakers viewed price pressures as ""muted,"" but expected inflation to rise to or near the central bank's 2 percent target. The Fed's preferred inflation measure, the personal consumption expenditures price index excluding food and energy is currently at 1.8 percent.
""For the most part, inflation remains tame,"" said Joel Naroff, chief economist at Naroff Economic Advisors in Holland, Pennsylvania. ""The Fed effectively went on vacation and is likely to stay there for quite a few more months.""
The Labor Department said its Consumer Price Index rose 0.4 percent, boosted by increases in the costs of food, gasoline and rents. That was the biggest advance since January 2018 and followed a 0.2 percent gain in February.
In the 12 months through March, the CPI increased 1.9 percent. The CPI gained 1.5 percent in February, which was the smallest rise since September 2016. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the CPI climbing 0.3 percent in March and accelerating 1.8 percent year-on-year.
Stripping out the volatile food and energy components, the CPI nudged up 0.1 percent, matching February's gain. The so-called core CPI was held down by a 1.9 percent plunge in apparel prices, the largest drop since January 1949. 
The government last month introduced a new method and data to calculate apparel prices. Apparel prices, which had increased for two straight months, trimmed the core CPI by 0.07 percentage point in March. Many economists expected a reversal in April.
""The new price collection methodology for apparel incorporates corporate data from one unidentified department store to complement prior survey-based collection,"" said Kathy Bostjancic, head of U.S. Macro Investor Services at Oxford Economics in New York. ""The new methodology appears more likely to show large monthly declines due to the lifecycle of apparel.""
LOW INFLATION EXPECTATIONS
In the 12 months through March, the core CPI increased 2.0 percent, the smallest advance since February 2018. The core CPI rose 2.1 percent year-on-year in February.
The dollar was trading slightly lower against a basket of currencies, while U.S. Treasury prices rose. Stocks on Wall Street were mostly higher. 
Inflation has remained muted, with wage growth increasing moderately despite tightening labor market conditions. Minutes of the March policy meeting showed some Fed officials believed the benign price pressures could be the result of low inflation expectations and also an indication the labor market was likely not as tight as implied by measures of resource utilization. 
""The minutes reinforce our view that rates are on hold for the foreseeable future, though this could shift if the economy and or inflation surprise to the up or down sides,"" said Sal Guatieri, a senior economist at BMO Capital Markets in Toronto.
A 3.5 percent jump in energy prices in March accounted for about 60 percent of the increase in the CPI last month. Gasoline prices surged 6.5 percent, the biggest gain since September 2017, after rising 1.5 percent in February. 
Food prices gained 0.3 percent after accelerating 0.4 percent in February. Food consumed at home increased 0.4 percent. Consumers also paid more for rent. Owners' equivalent rent of primary residence, which is what a homeowner would pay to rent or receive from renting a home, increased 0.3 percent in March after a similar gain in February.
Healthcare costs rebounded 0.3 percent after slipping 0.2 percent in February. There were increases in the costs of prescription medication and hospital services.

The cost of new vehicles rebounded 0.4 percent after declining 0.2 percent in February. But there were decreases in the prices of used motor vehicles and trucks, airline fares and motor vehicle insurance.

The consumer price index rose 1.9% from a year ago, while core inflation, that excludes volatile food and energy costs, increased 2.0%. That's compared to consensus forecasts for them to rise 1.8% and 2.1%, respectively.
For the month, the CPI and core CPI were up 0.4% and 0.1%, respectively.
The dollar held on to modest losses on the news, while stock index futures remained slightly higher.
As the Federal Reserve seeks to maintain core inflation close to 2%, the reading supports its current promise to “be patient as it determines what future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate may be appropriate”.

1453,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 10, 2019 07:50AM ET</span>","ECB keeps policy, rate guidance unchanged","FRANKFURT (Reuters) - The European Central Bank kept its policy unchanged as expected on Wednesday, maintaining interest rates at record lows and keeping its guidance for steady interest rates this year despite a sharp slowdown in economic growth.
With the economy and inflation both slowing, the ECB has already backtracked on its plans to tighten policy this year, unveiling instead even more stimulus to prop up an export-focused economy now struggling amid a global slowdown in trade.
But having unveiled fresh measures just last month, the ECB can afford to wait before contemplating any further steps, keeping its last remaining policy powder dry in case the growth downturn becomes more severe than now feared.
""The Governing Council now expects the key ECB interest rates to remain at their present levels at least through the end of 2019, and in any case for as long as necessary,"" the ECB said in a statement, reaffirming its interest rate guidance. 
While this policy is out of sync with market expectations, which put the first hike in 2021, policymakers have dismissed the significance of the disconnect, arguing that economic conditions would impact the eventual move and market prices simply reflect the changing outlook.
Attention now turns to ECB President Mario Draghi's 1230 GMT news conference, at which he is likely to say that risks to growth remain on the downside and the bank remains ready to act with all available instruments. 
Investors will also look to see if Draghi elaborates on his recent comments that the ECB would study whether negative rates are starting to have unintended side effects. 
With Wednesday's decision, the ECB's rate on bank overnight deposits, which is currently its primary interest rate tool, remains at -0.40 percent.

The main refinancing rate, which determines the cost of credit in the economy, remained unchanged at 0.00 percent while the rate on the marginal lending facility -- the emergency overnight borrowing rate for banks -- remains at 0.25 percent.

The central bank reiterated its forward guidance on interest rates.
""The Governing Council now expects the key ECB interest rates to remain at their present levels at least through the end of 2019, and in any case for as long as necessary,"" the ECB said in a statement.
With the euro area’s largest economy Germany narrowly avoiding a recession and Brexit uncertainty mounting the ECB has already been forced to backtrack on plans to tighten policy. The central bank is now facing calls to do more even though the root cause of the downturn, weak demand from abroad, is largely beyond its control.
In the latest move in his global trade war, U.S. President Donald Trump on Tuesday threatened to impose tariffs on $11 billion worth of European Union products, while the International Monetary Fund cut its forecast for world economic growth this year.
The ECB meeting was held one day earlier than usual so policymakers can attend the IMF's spring meeting in Washington DC this week.
ECB policymakers are likely to have discussed market speculation about further delays to their first post-crisis rate hike and the side effects of years of negative rates but analysts were not expecting further details of the next Targeted Longer-Term Refinancing Operations (TLTROs) or of any tiering system at the post policy meeting press conference.
“A tiering system might be one of the things that policymakers are looking at but it would probably only be announced if the economy has not started to rebound by June. This suggests a fairly modest reaction in EUR crosses today”, said Petr Krpata, FX strategist at ING.

Gross domestic product grew by 0.2 percent from January, the Office for National Statistics said.
Economists taking part in a Reuters poll had expected zero growth.
Britain's economy has held up better than many economists expected since the 2016 Brexit referendum although it has slowed ahead of its departure from the European Union and as the world economy loses momentum.
The International Monetary Fund said on Tuesday that Britain would grow by 1.2 percent in 2019 -- as long as it avoids the shock of a no-deal Brexit. That would be faster than Germany's 0.8 percent and only a touch slower than France's 1.3 percent.
However, Britain still looks set for its weakest growth in a decade this year, according to forecasts from the IMF and the Bank of England which assume a Brexit deal will be done.
Prime Minister Theresa May will seek a new delay to Brexit when she meets EU leaders on Wednesday, just two days before Britain is due to leave the bloc without the cushion of a transition deal.
Wednesday's data showed that over the three months to February, the economy grew by 0.3 percent, holding at the same pace as in January -- which was revised up from a previous estimate -- and stronger than a forecast of 0.2 percent in the Reuters poll.
Manufacturing output jumped by 0.9 percent in February from January, stronger than all forecasts in the Reuters poll and accounting for about half of the overall economic growth rate.
The ONS said it seen signs that clients of manufacturers were stockpiling goods to get ahead of any border delays in the event of a no-deal Brexit which was scheduled for March 29 but was subsequently delayed.
An ONS official said orders were being brought forward to beat the Brexit schedule, suggesting a likely drag on the numbers for coming months. 
The statistics office said it could not quantify the impact of stockpiling on the data. 
Britain's dominant services sector grew by 0.1 percent in monthly terms in February, held back by the 12th fall in a row in the financial services sector - the longest such run on record -- while construction rose by 0.4 percent.
There were signs that the slowdown in the global economy was also weighing on Britain's economy.
Export volumes fell by 0.4 percent in the three months to February from the three months to November while imports jumped by 6.8 percent.
So far, Britain's exporters have shown no sign of being helped by the fall in the value of the pound caused by the 2016 Brexit referendum.

The ONS said it could not say whether the increase in imports was driven by pre-Brexit stockpiling.

Gross domestic product grew 0.2% in February, the Office for National Statistics reported on Wednesday, slowing from the 0.5% expansion seen in January but in line with consensus.
“Services again drove the economy, with a continued strong performance in IT,” ONS Head of GDP Rob Kent-Smith said in the report. “Manufacturing also continued to recover after weakness at the end of last year with the often-erratic pharmaceutical industry, chemicals and alcohol performing well in recent months.”
In a separate report, manufacturing production grew 0.9% in February, while industrial production increased 0.6%.
With two days to go until the official deadline for the U.K.’s departure from the EU, an extension to that deadline is widely expected to be reached at an emergency EU summit later on Wednesday.
The terms, however, still remain uncertain as U.K. Prime Minister Theresa May failed to gain approval of a short delay until June 30. European Council President Donald Tusk has suggested a 12-month delay, but other leaders, notably French President Emmanuel Macron, have insisted on restrictions to its rights as a member during that time. Such conditions would make it even harder for May to keep her rebellious party in line.
The International Monetary Fund cut its forecasts for world growth on Tuesday and gave a specific warning over not reaching an agreement over Brexit.
“A no-deal Brexit that severely disrupts supply chains and raises trade costs could potentially have large and long-lasting negative impacts on the economies of the United Kingdom and the European Union,” the IMF said in its World Economic Outlook..
For the U.K. separately, the IMF predicted that a chaotic departure could result in two years of recession."
1457,By Bloomberg,"<span>Apr 09, 2019 08:50PM ET</span>",Korean Breadwinners Hit Even as Overall Jobs Growth Rises,"(Bloomberg) -- While employment growth accelerated for the second straight month in South Korea, the number of jobs for people age 30-49 extended its years-long decline amid a slowdown in manufacturing that is hurting family breadwinners.
The number of jobs increased by 250,000 in March from a year earlier, following a 263,000 gain in February, data from Statistics Korea showed on Wednesday. There was a sharp rise in the number of jobs for people age 60 and over, concentrated in sectors such health, welfare and public administration.
The results are unlikely to ease pressure on President Moon Jae-in, who was elected on a pledge to create hundreds of thousands of jobs and to raise the incomes of regular workers. Increasing public sector jobs hasn’t offset weakness in manufacturing and big jumps in the minimum wage have been blamed for crimping expansion in low-pay positions.
""The quantity of employment seems to be improving but the quality of the jobs is expected to remain unhealthy for quite some time,"" said Park Chong-hoon, an economist at  Standard Chartered  (LON:STAN) Bank in Seoul. The decline in new positions for middle-age workers reflects sluggish capital investment, according to Park, who said companies need to drive employment growth rather than public-sector hiring.
Meanwhile, the seasonally adjusted unemployment rate rose to 3.8 percent last month, lower than the median forecast of economists of 3.9 percent.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's machinery orders posted their first monthly increase in four months in February due to improved demand from the energy and telecommunications sectors but weakening global conditions remain major challenges for the world's third-largest economy.
The 1.8 percent increase month-on-month in core machinery orders, an often volatile leading indicator of capital expenditure, followed a 5.4 percent decline in the previous month.
But the expansion was weaker than the median forecast for a 2.5 percent increase in a Reuters poll of economists. It is also unlikely to ease concerns that companies could drastically cut business investment due to the U.S.-Sino trade war and rising inventories of electronic parts.
Orders from manufacturers rose 3.5 percent in February, following a 1.9 percent month-on-month decline in January, Cabinet Office data showed on Wednesday.
Orders from non-manufacturers fell 0.8 percent month-on-month in February after an 8.0 percent decline in January from the previous month.
Of some encouragement for policymakers, machinery orders from overseas rose 19.0 percent, recovering from an 18.1 percent tumble in January.
""Core"" machinery orders exclude those for ships and from electricity utilities.
The United States and China are trying to narrow their differences over trade but are yet to agree to a deal that would unwind punitive tariffs and restore global trade flows.
The two countries have been embroiled in a tit-for-tat tariff battle since July 2018, which has roiled supply chains. 
Japanese manufactures rely on selling heavy machinery and electronic parts to companies operating in China, which are used to make finished goods.
Economists say uncertainty over trade policy could discourage Japanese companies from increasing capital expenditure, which will act as a curb on economic growth.

Another risk for Japan's economy is the government's plan to raise the nationwide sales tax to 10 percent from 8 percent in October. The government needs the extra revenue for rising welfare costs, but the tax hike could also weaken consumer spending.

ROME (Reuters) - Italy on Tuesday cut its growth forecasts for this year and next while hiking the budget deficit and public debt, underscoring the economic woes faced by the populist ruling coalition.
Gross domestic product in the euro zone's third largest economy will increase just 0.2 percent this year, the government said, cutting a projection of 1.0 percent it made in December.
The slowdown in growth hurts public finances, and the Treasury raised this year's budget deficit target to 2.4 percent of GDP from a 2.04 percent goal fixed in December after a drawn-out tussle with the European Commission.
The new deficit target is the same as the one the Commission rejected last autumn as being too high and breaking EU rules.
Italy, whose public debt is proportionally the highest in the euro zone after Greece, is struggling to hold its finances in check while keeping costly promises made by the right-wing League and the anti-establishment 5-Star Movement.
Successive Italian governments have promised and failed to get the debt on a downward path since the 2008 financial crisis, and the latest forecast sees it rising this year to a new post-war high of 132.6 percent of GDP.
Unusually, no news conference was held after the cabinet signed off on the Treasury's Economic and Financial Document (DEF), which forms an early framework for the 2020 budget.
However, the leaders of both ruling parties issued statements renewing a commitment to cut taxes.

""We will push on, getting the country going again, stimulating growth and helping families that really need it, without trumpeting false promises as has been done in the past,"" said 5-Star chief Luigi Di Maio.

1460,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 09, 2019 12:53PM ET</span>",U.S. job openings hit 11-month low; quits rate stagnates,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. job openings dropped to an 11-month low in February and hiring decreased, which could partially explain a sharp slowdown in job growth during that month.
Still, the labor market remains a pillar of support for the economy amid signs that activity was easing because of the fading boost from a $1.5 trillion tax cut package and the effects of interest rate increases over the last few years. The economy is also facing headwinds from slowing global growth and the United States' trade war with China.
""The February job openings data reinforced that the labor market weakened in February but there isn't any cause for concern,"" said Ryan Sweet, a senior economist at Moody's Analytics in West Chester, Pennsylvania. 
Job openings, a measure of labor demand, tumbled by 538,000 to a seasonally adjusted 7.1 million, the Labor Department said in its monthly Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey, or JOLTS, report on Tuesday. The drop was the biggest since August 2015. The level was the lowest since March 2018.
Vacancies in the accommodation and food services industry fell by 103,000 jobs in February. There were 72,000 fewer job openings in the real estate and rental and leasing sector. Job openings in the transportation, warehousing and utilities sector dropped by 66,000.
Nonfarm payrolls increased by only 33,000 jobs in February, the fewest since September 2017. The near-stall in job gains was partially blamed on colder weather and also viewed as payback after robust increases in December and January. 
Job growth picked up in March, with the economy creating 196,000 positions, the government reported last Friday.
WORKERS STILL SCARCE
The drop in job openings in February likely does not change the theme of labor shortages in the economy. A survey of small businesses published on Tuesday found that just over a fifth of owners reported difficulties finding qualified workers as their ""single most important business problem"" in March.
According to the survey from the NFIB, 39 percent of small business owners reported job openings they could not fill in March. Thirty-three percent said they had openings for skilled workers and 14 percent have vacancies for unskilled labor.
Economists expect monthly job growth to average roughly 150,000 this year, stepping down from 223,000 in 2018. 
""There are still millions of help wanted signs out there in the country so we hesitate to revise our outlook for the labor market overall,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG in New York. 
The dive in job openings in February pushed down the vacancies rate to 4.5 percent from 4.8 percent in January. Hiring fell to 5.7 million in February from 5.8 million in the prior month. The decrease in hiring was led by the construction sector, where hiring fell by 73,000. 
Hiring in the nondurable goods manufacturing industry dropped by 33,000 in February. Hiring by state and local government education departments fell 22,000.
The number of workers voluntarily quitting their jobs was little changed at 3.5 million in February, keeping the quits rate at 2.3 percent for a ninth straight month. 
The quits rate is viewed by policymakers and economists as a measure of job market confidence. The worker reluctance to switch jobs is despite the tight labor market conditions that are steadily driving up wages.
""This is not as many quits as you would expect in such a tight labor market, when workers are in higher demand,"" said Nick Bunker, an economist at Indeed Hiring Lab. ""Though perhaps this isn't surprising in the short term given that the ratio of unemployed workers to job openings has been rising.""

Layoffs increased in February, lifting the layoffs rate to 1.2 percent from 1.1 percent in January. There were increases in layoffs in the professional and businesses services, and healthcare and social assistance sectors in February.

Factory goods orders dropped 0.5 percent, the Commerce Department said on Monday, pulled down by weak orders for machinery, transportation equipment and computers and electronic products. Data for January was revised down to show factory orders unchanged instead of edging up 0.1 percent as previously reported.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast factory orders falling 0.6 percent in February. Factory orders rose 2.4 percent compared to February 2018. The release of the report was delayed by a 35-day partial shutdown of the federal government that ended on Jan. 25.
Manufacturing, which accounts for about 12 percent of the economy, is losing momentum as the stimulus from last year's $1.5 trillion tax cut package fades. Activity is also being hampered by a trade war between the United States and China as well as by last year's surge in the dollar and softening global economic growth, which are hurting exports.
While a survey last week showed a measure of national manufacturing rebounded from a more than two-year low in March, factory payrolls fell for the first since July 2017. Job losses were mostly concentrated in the automotive sector, where slowing sales that have led to an inventory bloat.
Shipments of factory goods rose 0.4 percent in February after dropping 0.3 percent in January. They had declined for four straight months. With unfilled orders falling 0.3 percent and inventories rising 0.3 percent in February, factory orders are likely to remain sluggish.
In February, orders for machinery fell 0.6 percent after rising 2.1 percent in the prior month. Orders for industrial machinery declined 2.6 percent after surging 15.5 percent in January. Orders for electrical equipment, appliances and components rose 1.0 percent after increasing 1.1 percent in January. Computers and electronic products orders fell 0.5 percent after dropping 1.9 percent in January.
Transportation equipment orders tumbled 4.5 percent in January after gaining 0.4 percent in the prior month. Orders for civilian aircraft and parts plunged 31.1 percent. Motor vehicles and parts orders gained 0.5 percent.
The Commerce Department also said February orders for non-defense capital goods excluding aircraft, which are seen as a measure of business spending plans on equipment, slipped 0.1 percent as reported last week. Orders for these so-called core capital goods rose 0.9 percent in January.
Shipments of core capital goods, which are used to calculate business equipment spending in the gross domestic product report, dipped 0.1 percent in February rather than being unchanged as previously reported. Core capital goods shipments surged 1.0 percent in January.

The federal mortgage agency said its home purchase sentiment index increased by 5.5 points to 89.8 points, its highest since last June.
Notably, Fannie Mae's latest data showed the net share of consumers surveyed in March who said it is a good time to sell a home jumped 13 points to 43%.
A net share of 22% of consumers said it is a good time to buy a home, up 7 points from the month before.
The net share of consumers surveyed who said they are not concerned about losing their jobs fell 1 point to 80% from February's 81%, which was the highest since the survey began in 2010.
Last Friday, the U.S. Labor Department said employers hired 196,000 workers in March, up from a revised 33,000 a month earlier, while average hourly earnings grew only 0.1% versus a 0.4% jump in February.
Moreover, the share of consumers who said mortgage rates will rise over the next 12 months surpassed those who thought home borrowing costs would decline was a difference of 45 percentage points.

British people surveyed in February expect inflation to average 3.2 percent over the next 12 months, unchanged from November's survey which was the highest reading since November 2013, according to the quarterly BoE survey.
Some 47 percent of the more than 4,000 people surveyed expect the Bank of England to raise interest rates over the next 12 months, down from 53 percent in November.
British consumer price inflation edged up to 1.9 percent in February after touching a two-year low of 1.8 percent in January, and the BoE forecast in February that inflation is likely to rise slightly above its 2 percent target this year.

Chinese reserves, the world's largest, rose by nearly $9 billion in March to $3.099 trillion, its highest since August last year, central bank data showed on Sunday. 
Economists polled by Reuters had expected reserves would rise $5 billion to $3.095 trillion.
""The U.S. dollar index strengthened slightly in March due to China-U.S. trade talks, the revised policy outlooks of central banks in Europe and America as well as uncertainty over Brexit...China's forex reserves expanded marginally,"" China's forex regulator said after the data release. 
The State Administration of Foreign Exchange (SAFE) added that with the economy expected to maintain reasonable growth and improved flexibility in the yuan exchange rate, the country's forex reserves will remain stable. 
The yuan fell 5.3 percent against the dollar last year as trade relations with the United States deteriorated and the Chinese economy slowed. But it has rebounded over 2 percent so far in 2019 on hopes Washington and Beijing will reach an agreement to end their bruising trade war
In March, the yuan fell 0.3 percent against the dollar due to the strength of the greenback. The dollar was up 1 percent against a basket of major currencies. 
U.S. and Chinese negotiators wrapped up their latest round of trade talks on Friday and were scheduled to resume discussions this week to try to secure a pact that would end a tit-for-tat tariff battle that has roiled global markets.
But the outlook for the dollar is expected to remain soft after the Federal Reserve last month abandoned projections for further interest rate hikes this year on signs of an economic slowdown in the United States.
Assuming continued dollar weakness and progress in trade talks, the yuan will likely hold on to its recent gains and appreciate modestly over the coming year, according to analysts in a new Reuters poll. It last traded around 6.72 to the dollar.
U.S. President Donald Trump said on Thursday that a trade deal could be announced in the next four weeks. But the U.S. trade office said on Saturday that significant work remains to be done. Discussions are set to resume this week.
The value of China's gold reserves fell slightly to $78.525 billion from $79.498 billion at the end of February.
REVERSAL OF FORTUNES?
For much of last year, global investors worried about the risk of capital flight from China as the economy cooled, and debated how much yuan weakness Beijing would allow, though strict capital controls kept outflows in check.
More recently, with the dollar on the backfoot, attention has turned to how much upward pressure Chinese policymakers will be comfortable with, as foreign inflows into the country's financial markets look set to boost the currency.
Chinese stocks have rallied more than 20 percent this year on trade deal hopes, while some Chinese bonds were added on April 1 to the Bloomberg  Barclays  (LON:BARC) Global Aggregate Index, one of the most widely tracked fixed income benchmarks.
UBS Asset Management estimated this phase of bond inclusion will introduce $250-$500 billion of passive money alone, and possibly trillions of dollars if active money is counted.
The tide may also be turning for China's economy, with business surveys showing March manufacturing activity returned to growth, suggesting months of government stimulus measures are starting to take hold.

If sustained, improving economic data could prompt markets to scale back expectations of further policy easing, though analysts still expect several more cuts in banks' reserve requirements this year, possibly as soon as next week.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. employment growth accelerated from a 17-month low in March, assuaging fears of an abrupt slowdown in economic activity, but a moderation in wage gains supported the Federal Reserve's decision to suspend further interest rate increases this year.
Milder weather boosted hiring in sectors like construction, but worsening worker shortages and lingering effects of tighter financial market conditions at the turn of the year left job growth below 2018's brisk pace. The Labor Department's closely watched employment report on Friday also showed a small upward revision to February's meager job gains.
""This was a Goldilocks report, with a rebound in job growth to calm fears of an imminent recession, and wage growth that was solid enough without triggering inflationary concerns,"" said Curt Long, chief economist at the National Association of Federally-Insured Credit Unions. ""The Fed will be pleased, as it supports their present stance of holding firm on rates.""
The U.S. central bank last month halted its three-year campaign to tighten monetary policy, dropping projections for any rate hikes this year after lifting borrowing costs four times in 2018. Nonfarm payrolls rose by 196,000 jobs in March. Data for February was revised modestly up to show 33,000 jobs created instead of the previously reported 20,000. February job gains were the smallest since September 2017. 
The economy has shifted into lower gear as stimulus from the Trump administration's $1.5 trillion tax cut package as well as increased government spending fades. A trade war between Washington and Beijing, and slowing global growth have also taken a toll on the economy, which in July will celebrate 10 years of expansion, the longest on record.
President Donald Trump has boasted about the economy, especially the labor market, as being one of the big wins of his first term in office. Sluggish growth, if it persists, could pose a challenge to Trump's re-election hopes next year.
Trump, who has blamed the Fed's relatively tighter monetary policy for the slowdown in economic activity, on Friday urged the central bank to cut interest rates.
""I think they should drop rates,"" Trump told reporters. ""I think they really slowed us down."" 
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast payrolls increasing by 180,000 jobs last month. The pickup in job growth helped to boost U.S. stocks. The dollar rose marginally against a basket of currencies, while U.S. Treasury prices were mixed. 
The employment report added to fairly upbeat construction spending and factory data that led Wall Street banks to boost their growth estimates for the first quarter.
Growth forecasts for the first quarter are between a 1.4 percent and 2.1 percent annualized rate. The economy grew at a 2.2 percent rate in the fourth quarter, stepping down from the July-September quarter's brisk 3.4 percent pace. 
WAGE GAINS SLOW
Average hourly earnings increased by 0.1 percent in March after jumping 0.4 percent in February. That lowered the annual increase in wages to 3.2 percent from 3.4 percent in February, which was the biggest gain since April 2009. 
The length of the average workweek rose to 34.5 hours from 34.4 hours in February. As a result of the rebound in employment, modest wage gains and more hours worked, the aggregate weekly payrolls index, a proxy for take-home wages, increased 0.5 percent last month, which bodes well for consumer spending after it stalled in January. 
""The first quarter has been challenging, but the economy has better momentum entering the second quarter, said Roiana Reid, an economist at Berenberg Capital Markets in New York.
The unemployment rate was unchanged at 3.8 percent in March, close to the 3.7 percent that Fed officials project it will be by the end of the year. Though monthly job gains have moderated to an average of 180,000 this year from 223,000 in 2018, they remain above the roughly 100,000 per month needed to keep up with growth in the working-age population. 
Economists expect job growth to average about 150,000 per month this year. There are about 7.58 million open jobs in the economy. Vacancies could remain elevated as 224,000 people dropped out of the labor force last month. 
The labor force participation rate, or the proportion of working-age Americans who have a job or are looking for one, fell to 63.0 percent in March from 63.2 percent in February, which was the highest in more than five years. 
Employment at construction sites rebounded by 16,000 jobs in March after falling by 25,000 in February. Leisure and hospitality sector payrolls accelerated by 33,000 jobs last month, driven by a 27,300 increase at restaurants and bars.
The manufacturing sector lost 6,000 jobs in March, the first decline in factory payrolls since July 2017. Factory payrolls rose 1,000 in February. Employment at motor vehicle assembly plants fell by 6,300 jobs last month. 
Auto manufacturers have announced thousands of job cuts to deal with slowing sales that have led to an inventory bloat.
Professional and business services employment increased by 37,000 jobs last month. The government added 14,000 jobs in March. There were increases in healthcare, transportation and warehousing employment, as well as financial activities, utilities and information industries.

But retail payrolls fell for a second straight month in March. Temporary help, a harbinger for future hiring, declined for the second time in three months.

OTTAWA (Reuters) - The Canadian economy unexpectedly shed 7,200 jobs in March, its first decline in seven months, Statistics Canada data showed on Friday, reinforcing market expectations that the Bank of Canada will keep interest rates unchanged next month.
The unemployment rate held steady at 5.8 percent for the third straight month. Analysts in a Reuters poll had forecast a marginal gain of 1,000 jobs in March, following outsized gains in the previous two months, and no change in the unemployment rate.
Despite the drop in March, employment rose by 116,000 jobs in the first quarter.
""We got a little dip in employment, but the numbers are volatile and it's been on a pretty strong run over the prior half year,"" said Nathan Janzen, senior economist at Royal Bank of Canada.
Analysts said the small decline in March, following six months of consecutive gains, was unlikely to alter the Bank of Canada's view of employment as a bright spot in Canada's economy.
""After such a strong run of employment gains, a modest pull-back in March is of little concern to us and won't raise many eyebrows at the Bank of Canada either,"" said Andrew Grantham, Senior Economist at CIBC Capital Markets, in a note.
Bank of Canada Governor Stephen Poloz expressed guarded optimism earlier this week that Canada would emerge from a soft patch, but said the economic outlook still warrants an interest rate below the neutral range.
The central bank, which has hiked rates five times since July 2017, held rates steady last month. The next rate decision will be April 24, when the bank also will provide its quarterly monetary policy update. 
The Canadian dollar hit a one-week low at 1.3403 after the jobs data was released but has since pared some of its decline.
The economy added 1,100 goods producing sector jobs, mostly in manufacturing, and shed 8,800 services sector jobs, mostly in healthcare and social assistance, and the business, building and other support services category.
Full-time jobs dropped by 6,400 from February to March, while 900 part-time jobs were shed, the data showed. 
Canada's two most populous provinces, Ontario and Quebec, shed jobs in the month, while British Columbia and Saskatchewan posted job gains. 

The average year-over-year wage growth of permanent employees - a figure closely watched by the central bank - was 2.3 percent in March, up from 2.2 percent in February.

Nonfarm payrolls (NFP) rose by 196,000 in March, above consensus expectations for 175,000, while the jobless rate held steady as expected at 3.8%.
The increase in job creation came after an extremely weak reading in February and Wednesday’s report from payrolls processor ADP that showed the U.S. economy added the fewest private sector jobs in 18 months during March.
“Apart from the lower labor participation rate, the jobs report is supportive of the economy, markets and the Fed’s current policy stance,” Allianz chief economist Mohamed El-Erian commented on the March figures.
Average hourly earnings, meanwhile, grew 3.2% on an annualized basis, slowing from the prior month’s reading of 3.4%. Although it remains above the 3% level that is generally considered to put upward pressure on inflation, the slowdown supports the Fed’s March decision to hold policy steady and no longer forecast a rate hike in 2019.
El-Erian’s concern over the lower labor participation rate - which dipped to 63.0% from 63.2% - was shared by William Spriggs, Howard University economics professor and chief economist at the American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations, who takes a dimmer view of the employment report.
He considers the fact that the jobless rate held steady as a result of a decline in participation and a slight dip in the employment-to-population ration.
For Spriggs, the data “shows a slowing labor market. Obviously, the Federal Reserve got it right.”
Joseph Brusuelas, chief economist at consultancy RSM US LLP, came to the same conclusion: “The March employment data and February revision is not strong enough to dislodge the Fed from its current policy path, which is in line with our model that implies that Fed is likely on hold through 2020.”

In an immediate reaction, U.S. futures extended gains after the release with S&P 500 futures up 0.4% compared to 0.1% ahead of the report. The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of major currencies, gained some support, turned positive although it remained near the unchanged mark.
In another positive sign for stocks, average hourly earnings grew 3.2% on an annualized basis, slowing from the prior month’s reading of 3.4%. Economists had expected no change.
The slowdown in wage inflation supported the Federal Reserve’s recent decision to be “patient” with further policy tightening.
The Fed left interest rates unchanged in its March policy decision and said it was no longer projecting hikes in 2019. At the same time, it announced it will stop shrinking its bond portfolio in September.
Both dovish moves imply that policymakers have become more concerned about the economic outlook.
Some analysts suggest that the next change to rates could be a cut if fears over the U.S. and global economies, plagued by ongoing trade uncertainties, become a reality.
Sluggish global growth, particularly in China and Europe, coupled with volatile financial markets and subdued inflation have supported the Fed’s “patient” stance."

The unemployment rate held steady as expected at 5.8%.
The Bank of Canada held interest rates steady at its last policy meeting in early March when the central bank warned about the damaging effects of trade tensions and uncertainty on confidence and economic activity, forcing it to cut growth forecasts for the Canadian economy. Last Monday, BoC governor Stephen Poloz underlined the need to keep rates stimulative for the time being in order to support the economy.
“That is why we said at our last interest rate announcement in March that the economic outlook continues to warrant a policy interest rate that is below the neutral range to help the economy work through this downshift in growth and keep inflation close to target,” he explained.
The BoC is widely anticipated to leave rates unchanged at 1.75%, where they have been since October 2018, at its upcoming policy meeting on April 24."

Core machinery orders, a volatile data series regarded as an indicator of capital spending in the following six to nine months, likely grew 2.5 percent in February from a month earlier, the poll of 17 economists showed.
In January, orders dropped 5.4 percent from the previous month.
To economists, the anticipated gain in February is not strong enough to change a trend of lackluster core machinery orders, which exclude those for ships and electric power utilities.
""Uncertainty over the economic outlook has risen globally and firms are cautious about investment, especially high-tech companies,"" said Takumi Tsunoda, senior economist at Shinkin Central Bank Research Institute.
Compared with one year earlier, core orders in February are expected to have fallen 5.2 percent in February, according to the poll.
The trade friction between the United States and China is a major risk for Japan, as it ships electronics parts and heavy machinery to China as well as makes finished products for the United States and other markets.
The Cabinet Office will announce the machinery orders data at 8:50 a.m. Wednesday, April 10, Tokyo time.
The Reuters poll also showed an expectation that Japan's current account likely had a surplus of 2.68 trillion yen ($24.00 billion) in February after 600.4 billion yen in January.
A weak yen likely inflated income from investments overseas, which contributed to a wider payments surplus, analysts said. 
The finance ministry will release the February current account balance at 8:50 a.m. Tokyo time on April 8. 
The poll also showed the Bank of Japan's corporate goods price index (CGPI), which measures the prices companies charge each other for goods and services, increased 1.1 percent in March from a year earlier, after a 0.8 percent gain in February.
Price gains in oil-related items and chemical products lifted the index, analysts said.

BERLIN (Reuters) - German industrial output rose by 0.7 percent in February as mild weather helped a surge in construction activity but manufacturing production dipped, doing little to boost spirits in Europe's largest economy after a run of negative news.
Germany is suffering from trade friction and Brexit angst after narrowly avoiding recession last year. Leading economic institutes slashed their forecasts for 2019 growth on Thursday and warned a long-term upswing had come to an end.
The rise in output exceeded expectations for a 0.5 percent increase on the month. January's reading was revised up to show no change from a previously reported contraction of 0.8 percent, Statistics Office figures showed.
""The industrial sector is expected to remain subdued given the weak development in orders and the gloomier business climate,"" the Economy Ministry said in a statement.
""The construction sector remains in a boom. The relatively mild weather contributed to the good result in February.""
Industrial orders in Germany fell by the biggest margin in more than two years in February, slumping 4.2 percent, data showed on Thursday.
The overall gain in industrial output was boosted by a 6.8 percent surge in construction. Manufacturing output declined by 0.2 percent in February. In the first two months of the year, auto industry output fell 1.0 percent from the prior two months.
Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) economist Ralph Solveen said the relatively warm weather would help the economy grow in the first quarter thanks to stronger construction investment, adding: ""Without this effect, hardly any growth is to be expected in the first half.""
On Thursday, Germany's leading economic institutes slashed their forecasts for 2019 growth by more than half and warned that the economy could slow much more if Britain quits the European Union without an agreement. 
Germany is in its 10th year of economic expansion, but narrowly skirted a recession at the end of last year and posted its weakest growth in five years in 2018. Its export-orientated economy is being slowed by the trade and Brexit headwinds.
""German industry remains an international reason for concern,"" ING economist Carsten Brzeski said. ""Brexit woes and the global slowdown have a stranglehold over German industry.""
Officials are hopeful that once global trade disputes and Brexit are resolved, growth can pick up next year.
Chancellor Angela Merkel has repeatedly said she will ""fight until the last hour"" for an orderly Brexit.
Germany's slower-than-previously-expected growth means Finance Minister Olaf Scholz's room for maneuver on fiscal matters is getting tighter as tax revenues are likely to come in lower than expected this year.
Last month, the cabinet passed a draft budget for 2020 that calls for a 1.7 percent spending increase and relies on ministries to cut costs to avoid incurring new debt in light of the slowdown.

Nonfarm jobs increased by 177,000 in March, according to Bloomberg’s survey, a level that would be just under the three-month trend but down from last year’s 223,000 average. The unemployment rate is projected to hold at 3.8 percent, near an almost half-century low, with annual wage gains remaining at a 3.4 percent pace, the strongest of the economic expansion.
Analysts will also be focused on the revision for February’s big payrolls slump to 20,000, the weakest reading in almost a year and a half, after January’s 311,000 gain, which was upwardly revised.

The index of coincident indicators rose a preliminary 0.7 point in February from the previous month, the Cabinet Office said.
The government kept its assessment intact to say the economy was at ""a turning point towards a downgrade"", meaning the economy may have peaked a few months earlier.

1475,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 04, 2019 09:20PM ET</span>","Soft Japanese consumer, wages data casts doubt over household sector","By Stanley White
TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's household spending rose less than expected in February and real wages tumbled at the fastest pace in more than three years, raising concerns about the hit to the consumer sector from heightening global uncertainties. 
The data is likely to be discussed by policymakers worried that risks to the export sector from ongoing trade disputes may discourage firms from raising wages, which in turn would hurt consumption.
The 1.7 percent year-on-year increase in household spending was less than the median estimate for a 2.1 percent increase and followed a 2.0 percent increase in January.
Taken with separate wages data, also released on Friday, the numbers suggested household income may not be strong enough to underpin consumption at a time when exports and output are weakening due to the U.S.-Sino trade war.
The data also suggest the government could come under pressure to delay a planned sales tax hike and turn to the Bank of Japan (BOJ) for help in supporting the economy.
""Labour shortages are not pushing up wages, and you need wages to rise for inflation expectations to rise,"" said Norio Miyagawa, senior economist at Mizuho Securities.
""The BOJ is on hold for now, but it may have to come up with something if there is another downside shock to the economy.""
The growth in household consumption in February was driven by spending on autos and mobile phone charges.
Inflation-adjusted real wages in Japan fell 1.1 percent in February from a year ago, the fastest decline since June 2015.
The soft household sector indicators follow signs of similar weakness in the corporate sector.
Japan's business mood slumped to a two-year low in the March quarter, a central bank survey showed on April 1, highlighting the impact the Sino-U.S. trade war was having on sentiment and economic activity.
Factories across Japan depend heavily on selling electronic parts and heavy equipment to manufacturers in China, which leaved Japan exposed to tit-for-tat tariffs between Washington and Beijing.
The data on consumer spending and wages is likely to raise concerns about the economy. There are still risks to domestic demand, and expectations may heighten for the BOJ to ease monetary policy further.
The government plans to raise the nationwide sales tax to 10 percent from 8 percent in October to generate extra revenue for rising welfare costs.
Some economists and politicians worry that if this plan is not delayed then consumer spending will weaken after the tax hike.
The BOJ is in a bind over how to manage the economy. Years of heavy money printing and prolonged ultra-low rates have dried up the bond market and squeezed profits at banks, prompting Japan's banking lobby to urge the BOJ to rethink its monetary stimulus.
However, Japan's economic outlook this year is weaker than last year's, which supports the argument that the BOJ will eventually need to come up with some measures to keep already low inflation from slowing.

Demand for staff grew at the weakest pace since August 2016, shortly after the referendum result for a vote to leave the European Union, according to the monthly KPMG/Recruitment and Employment Confederation (REC) Report on Jobs.
The report added to a string of downbeat data from businesses ahead of Brexit, despite solid consumer spending and, up to this point, strong employment growth.
""We have a fantastic labor market that has delivered high employment and flexibility for workers because it helps companies meet their needs easily. It's a British success story. But Brexit uncertainty has put the brakes on,"" REC's chief executive Neil Carberry said.
""Ending the uncertainty around Brexit will help firms invest and create jobs,"" he added. ""Firms across the country need a stable plan.""
Britain could ask the European Union for a long Brexit delay next week if crisis talks between Prime Minister Theresa May's government and the opposition Labour Party fail to find a way out of the impasse over the divorce from the European Union.

It is nearly three years since the United Kingdom shocked the world by voting 52 percent to 48 to leave the bloc. Supporters of Brexit fear betrayal and opponents are pushing for another referendum.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The number of Americans filing applications for unemployment benefits fell to a nearly half-century low last week, pointing to sustained labor market strength despite slowing economic growth.
But the loss of momentum in activity has left some employers unsettled about the economy's outlook. Announced job cuts by U.S.-based companies in the first quarter were the highest since 2015, other data showed on Thursday.
Fading stimulus from a $1.5 trillion tax cut package, the United States' trade war with China, slowing global growth and uncertainty over Britain's exit from the European Union are casting a shadow over the economy, which in July will celebrate the longest expansion on record.
""We are at a point of inflection where the overall economic trend is changing,"" said Joel Naroff, chief economist at Naroff Economic Advisors in Holland, Pennsylvania. ""That would account for at least some of the volatility and contradictory nature of the data. It would also point to a slowdown not a crash.""
Initial claims for state unemployment benefits declined 10,000 to a seasonally adjusted 202,000 for the week ended March 30, the lowest level since early December 1969, the Labor Department said. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast claims rising to 216,000 in the latest week. The Labor Department said only claims for California were estimated.
The claims data have shown no significant pickup in layoffs and there have been reports of companies reluctant to let go of workers amid a growing shortage of skilled labor. The scarcity of workers contributed to a recent slowdown in hiring.
Job growth has slowed from last year's roughly 223,000 average monthly pace. The pace of increase, however, remains more than sufficient to keep up with growth in the working age population, holding down the unemployment rate.
The dollar gained versus a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasuries prices rose, while stocks on Wall Street were mixed.
JOB GROWTH REBOUND 
The four-week moving average of initial claims, considered a better measure of labor market trends as it irons out week-to-week volatility, fell 4,000 to 213,500 last week, the lowest level since early October 2018.
While the claims data has no bearing on March's employment report, which is scheduled for release on Friday, economists said it bodes well for an anticipated rebound in job growth.
According to a Reuters survey of economists, nonfarm payrolls likely increased by 180,000 jobs last month after a meager 20,000 in February, which was also seen as pay-back after robust gains in the prior two months. The unemployment rate is forecast unchanged at 3.8 percent.
""We see the initial claims data as consistent with healthy labor market conditions and in line with the widely anticipated rebound in the pace of payroll employment in March,"" said Jonathan Millar, an economist at  Barclays  (LON:BARC) in New York.
A separate report on Thursday from global outplacement consultancy Challenger, Gray & Christmas showed planned job cuts by U.S.-based employers dropped 21 percent to 60,587 in March. 
However, announced layoffs in the first quarter jumped 10.3 percent to 190,410 from the last three months of 2018. That was the highest since the third quarter of 2015 and was partly blamed on ""economic uncertainty and fears of an upcoming downturn.""
Retailers continued to lead job cuts, purging 46,061 positions in the first quarter. The automotive sector eliminated 8,838 jobs in March, leading to 15,887 layoffs by auto manufacturers and suppliers in the first quarter. Redundancies were also high in the energy and financial sectors.

""Companies are reacting to market conditions as much as consumer demand,"" said Andrew Challenger, vice president at Challenger, Gray & Christmas.

The U.S. Department of Labor said Thursday that initial jobless claims in the week ended March 30 fell unexpectedly by 10,000 to a seasonally-adjusted 202,000. That was the lowest level since December 1969.
Analysts had expected 216,000. Claims for the prior week were revised up to 212,000.
The four-week moving average was 213,00, a decline of 4,000 from the previous week. The monthly average is seen as a more accurate gauge of labor trends because it reduces volatility in the week-to-week data. This gauge has been falling steadily since February.
The report said continuing jobless claims for the week ended March 23 fell to 1.717 million from 1.756 million in the preceding week. These claims reflect people who recently lost their jobs and are already receiving benefits.
The data make a reassuring prelude to Friday’s employment report for March.
According to a report Wednesday from payrolls processor ADP, the U.S. economy added the fewest private sector jobs in 18 months during March.
That came after February’s employment report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics showed a sharp slowdown in job creation.
Economists forecast that Friday’s government report will show the creation of 180,000 nonfarm jobs, while the unemployment rate is expected to hold steady at 3.8%. Most of the focus will likely be on average hourly earnings, which are expected to rise 3.4% from a year earlier, similar to the increase reported in February."

Fearing a sharp slowdown in economic growth, the ECB reversed course last month, delaying a planned interest rate hike until 2020 and giving banks fresh access to ultra cheap central bank funding. [L5N20U1N5]
""Concerns were voiced that over time, the effects of persistently low rates could depress banks' interest margins and profitability, with negative effects on banks intermediation and financial stability in the longer run,"" the ECB said in the accounts of the meeting on Thursday.
Even as the bank is still ironing out the details of its new bank loan scheme, ECB President Mario Draghi had already raised the prospect of even more stimulus, saying that a rate hike could be delayed even further and there could be help for banks to mitigate the side effects of negative interest rates.
And sources told Reuters ECB staff was studying a tiered deposit rate to give banks some relief from having to pay a punitive charge for parking their cash at the central bank overnight. 
While such a system would suggest that rates would stay low for even longer, the accounts indicated that policymakers were already expecting policy normalization to be drawn out.
Indeed, the rate-setters argued that inflation will now take even longer to rise to the ECB's target given widespread uncertainty and growth projections were still at risk of being ""optimistic"", even after being cut several times already.
""Weakness in growth was seen as being longer-lasting than had previously been expected,"" the ECB said. ""Projections implied a slower adjustment of inflation to the ECB's price stability objective.
Still, calls by a ""number"" of policymakers to push the timing of the first rate hike to after the first quarter of 2020 were rejected, with others warning about the risk of committing to policy too far into the future. 
The ECB's problem is that economic growth is slowing sharply with no sign yet of a rebound, threatening to unwind years of unprecedented monetary stimulus. 
The slowdown, exacerbated by Brexit uncertainty, could also expose the vulnerability of the ECB as it has exhausted much of its firepower and its few remaining tools are mostly untested and lack potency in tackling economic weakness importer from abroad.

Policymakers argued that growth would not necessarily revert to potential over the longer term and uncertainty might be more persistent than expected.

However, they were countered by others worried that keeping rates too low for too long could undermine a banking sector that has deep-seated profitability issues, according to minutes from the last policy meeting released Thursday. 
""A number of members voiced an initial preference for extending the forward guidance through the end of the first quarter of 2020,"" the minutes said. In the end, the Governing Council only promised not to hike interest rates until the end of 2019.
""Concerns were voiced that over time, the effects of persistently low rates could depress banks' interest margins and profitability, with negative effects on banks' intermediation and financial stability in the longer run,"" the minutes said.
Financial markets sold off in the aftermath of the meeting, seeing the measures as not enough to make a meaningful difference to an economy that has slowed sharply in the last six months.
The bank said it would launch a new round of quarterly targeted longer-term refinancing operation, known as TLTROs, starting in September 2019 and ending in March 2021, each with a maturity of two years. The loans will help banks meet a key new standard on liquidity and avert the risk of them hoarding funds and starving the economy of credit.
Since the meeting, the ECB has dropped a number of hints that it could lay the groundwork for further interest rate cuts. By ‘tiering’ the rate paid by banks to park funds in the ECB’s deposit facility, it could soften the penalty effect of holding excess reserves. "
1483,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 04, 2019 05:12AM ET</span>","Before India votes, RBI cuts rates by 25 bps to spur growth","By Suvashree Choudhury and Swati Bhat
MUMBAI (Reuters) - India's central bank cut its policy interest rate by 25 basis points on Thursday, in a widely expected move to boost the economy just a week before voting begins in an election that will decide whether Prime Minister Narendra Modi gets a second term.
Though inflation remains subdued, falling farm incomes and record high unemployment are seen hampering Modi's prospects going into the polls after economic growth slid to 6.6 percent in December - its slowest in five quarters.
Following a meeting of its monetary policy committee (MPC), the Reserve Bank of India highlighted the need to boost domestic growth due to global headwinds.
""The need is to strengthen domestic growth impulses by spurring private investment which has remained sluggish,"" the RBI wrote in the policy statement.
The six-member MPC cut the repo rate to 6.00 percent as predicted by 57 of 67 analysts polled by Reuters last week. The reverse repo rate was reduced to 5.75 percent. 
Four out of six MPC members voted for a 25 basis points cut, while two called for the rates to remain unchanged. Five of them called for the policy stance to remain ""neutral,"" while one MPC member voted for it to be changed to ""accommodative"".
While the central bank projected retail inflation at 3.8 percent by January-March 2020 - within its target of 4 percent - it also warned of the upside risks to price pressures if food and fuel prices rose abruptly, or if fiscal deficits overshot targets.
Ahead of elections, the major parties have made promises for heavy spending in order to woo voters, leaving the central bank unsure about how fiscal plans will pan out.
""Should there be a fiscal slippage...this could crowd out private investment, impact potential output, and result in higher inflation,"" the RBI said in a separate monetary policy report.
Speaking at an industry event, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley said that the government would continue with fiscal consolidation and pursue policies to enable further reduction in interest rates if it was re-elected.
Meanwhile, weather forecasters have warned that this year's monsoon season could suffer the El Nino effect, which could reduce rainfall and lead to a spike in food prices. 
""While RBI has highlighted the upside risks to inflation, on account of El Nino, food prices and the fiscal situation, I think the tone is largely dovish,"" said Sujan Hajra, chief economist at Anand Rathi Securities in Mumbai.
""If inflation continues to undershoot the 4 percent level, a rate cut of 25 to 50 basis points cannot be ruled out in the next 12 months.""
Annual consumer inflation was just 2.57 percent in February following five months of deflation in food prices, and the RBI said it could be forced to revise down its inflation projection if the current economic slowdown become more pronounced.
The RBI lowered its economic growth forecast to 7.2 percent for the 2019/20 April-March fiscal year, from the February view of 7.4 percent.
TRANSMISSION ISSUES
With inflation so low, some analysts had hoped the RBI would cut interest rates more aggressively to boost economic growth.
The MPC's reluctance could be partly explained, however, by commercial banks only reducing their lending rates by a token 5-10 basis points after the RBI's last 25 bps cut in February.
""We're conscious of the fact that there has to be appropriate and effective transmission of rates,"" Governor Shaktikanta Das told reporters in Mumbai. ""We hope to come out with some guidelines which will ensure effective transmission.""
Das also said the RBI would issue a revised circular on the resolution of stressed assets after the Supreme Court this week struck down its earlier directive that imposed tougher norms on banks dealing with non-performing loans.
In an effort to make more cash available to banks for lending, the RBI permitted the use of a further two percent of banks mandatory bond holdings toward meeting their liquidity coverage ratio in a phased manner.
The RBI also proposed opening new channels for non-resident Indians to participate in the government debt market, with settlements via International Central Securities Depositories.
The 10-year benchmark bond yield rose to 7.50 percent from 7.37 percent before the rate decision and the rupee weakened to 69.11 per dollar from 68.82. The broader NSE stock index was little changed at 11,648.20 points.

FAO,"ROME (Reuters) - World food prices were broadly steady in March, with a jump in dairy prices offset by drops in cereal, vegetable oil and sugar price quotations, the United Nations food agency said on Thursday.
The Food and Agriculture Organization's (FAO) food price index, which measures monthly changes for a basket of cereals, oilseeds, dairy products, meat and sugar, averaged 167.0 points last month, down from 166.8 in February.
The index was 3.6 percent below its level of one year ago.
The FAO dairy price index jumped 6.2 percent from February's value, driven by strong import demand for butter, whole milk powder and cheese. The meat price index rose 0.4 percent month-on-month.
By contrast, FAO's vegetable oil price index fell 4.4 percent from the previous month, due partly to limited demand for palm oil, while its sugar index dropped 2.1 percent and its cereal index fell 2.2 percent on February. 
FAO raised its latest world cereal production forecast for 2018 to 2.655 billion tonnes, against the 2.609 billion it forecast a month ago. The figure was still 1.8 percent down on a year-on-year basis.
The U.N. agency said the latest forecast contained sharply raised estimates for global cereal production, utilization and stocks following the release of new data from China for the period 2007-2017. 
""FAO's new estimate for global cereal stocks for crop years ending in 2019 has been scaled up by almost 11 percent to 849 million tonnes, mostly reflecting larger holdings in China,"" the agency said in a statement.

1485,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 04, 2019 03:15AM ET</span>",German industrial orders slump 4.2 percent in February,"BERLIN (Reuters) - German industrial orders fell at their sharpest rate in more than two years in February as they were hit by a slump in foreign demand, compounding worries that Europe's largest economy had a weak start to the year.
Contracts for German goods slumped by 4.2 percent, data from the Economy Ministry showed on Thursday. That compared to a fall of 2.1 percent in January, revised from a drop of 2.6 percent.
The unexpected fall was the sharpest since January 2017 and confounded forecasts for a 0.3 percent increase.
""Awful new order data suggests that German industry is still suffering from Brexit woes and global uncertainties,"" said ING economist Carsten Brzeski.
Concern about the weakness of the manufacturing sector is clouding the outlook for Germany's economy, which faces headwinds from a slowing world economy, international trade disputes and the threat of Britain leaving the European Union without a deal.
""In the coming months, a subdued industrial economy is to be expected, especially because of a lack of foreign demand,"" said the ministry in a statement.
Data showed that foreign orders were down 6.0 percent in February, with a 7.9 percent drop from non-euro zone countries and a 2.9 percent decrease within the euro zone. Domestic contracts slipped by 1.6 percent.
Germany's leading economic institutes have cut their 2019 growth forecast for Germany to 0.8 percent from a previous estimate of 1.9 percent, two sources familiar with the report to be presented on Thursday told Reuters.

1486,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 04, 2019 01:10AM ET</span>",Weak Indian demand drags March services growth to six-month low: PMI,"BENGALURU, (Reuters) - India's dominant services industry last month grew at its slowest pace since September, hampered by a weaker expansion in domestic demand that dragged the pace of hiring to a six-month low, a private survey showed.
The Nikkei/IHS Markit Services Purchasing Managers' Index fell to 52.0 in March from 52.5 the previous month but remained above the 50 mark separating growth from contraction for a 10th consecutive month.
The index change ""was partly caused by waning new business growth, with further increases to output prices perhaps contributing to the slide,"" noted Pollyanna De Lima, principal economist at IHS Markit.
Although foreign demand improved last month after contracting slightly in February, a sub-index tracking overall demand slipped as firms raised prices more quickly - despite a decline in the rate of input price inflation.
However, that is probably not enough to boost retail inflation to above the Reserve Bank of India's medium-term target of 4 percent, thus paving the way for more monetary policy easing.
The RBI has a policy decision due later on Thursday, and it is widely expected to cut interest rates for a second consecutive meeting, according to a Reuters poll.
A slowdown in the growth in services activity, alongside weaker manufacturing expansion, led the India composite index to fall to a six-month low of 52.7 in March - the lowest since September - from February's 53.8.
Despite a sub-index measuring optimism in the services industry hitting a six-month high, the one gauging employment weakened to its lowest since September.
""An anemic pace of job creation hints that service providers are not fully convinced about a shift into a higher growth gear,"" De Lima said. 

""Digging deeper into the anecdotal evidence provided by surveyed firms, there are concerns about delayed payment from clients and a challenging economic situation,"" she added.

The sharp revision reflects the scale of the slowdown in Germany, whose economy is facing headwinds from a slowing world economy, international trade disputes and the threat of Britain leaving the European Union without a deal.
The institutes' estimates feed into the government's own growth projections, which will be updated later this month. The government said in January it forecast growth of 1.0 percent this year.
One of the sources said the institutes would stick to their forecast from September that predicted growth of 1.8 percent in 2020. The expected rebound is partly due to positive calendar effects such as public holidays falling on weekends.
Germany's manufacturing sector is in recession as exporters bear the brunt of weaker demand.
The export-dependent economy has been relying on consumption and state spending for growth. A solid labor market and low interest rates have been supporting the consumption-driven growth cycle.
The economy posted its weakest growth rate in five years last year.

BRASILIA (Reuters) - Growth in Brazilian economic activity picked up to its strongest in over a year in March, driven by solid increases in domestic new orders across both the manufacturing and services sectors, IHS Markit Insight said on Wednesday.
The closely-watched purchasing managers indices (PMIs) for March, often seen as a leading indicator of overall economic growth, showed the sixth straight month of service sector growth and ninth consecutive month of rising manufacturing activity.
The figures suggest the Brazilian economy may finally be beginning to move up a gear after struggling to fully recover from the 2015-16 recession and virtually stagnating for months.
""Survey data showed a remarkable upswing in inflows of new work at Brazilian service providers, which suggests that the economy may be heating up,"" said Pollyanna De Lima, Principal Economist at IHS Markit. 
""Buoyed by this favorable demand environment, service sector activity rose at the joint-quickest pace in over six years during March, rounding off the strongest quarter since Q1 2013,"" she said.
The Brazilian services PMI rose to 52.7 in March from February, the highest since February last year, while the composite PMI index rose to 53.1 from 52.6, also the highest in 13 months. Services account for around 70 percent of Brazil's economy.
The manufacturing PMI released on Monday showed a slight dip to 52.8 from 53.4, but that still indicates growing activity as PMI readings above 50.0 denote expansion and below 50.0 signal contraction.
The black mark on the March PMIs, however, was employment. A small decline in service sector jobs was offset by growth in the manufacturing industry, but overall private sector employment was broadly stagnant in March, IHS Markit said.

""Lowering the unemployment rate from 12.4 percent seems to be the key piece of the jigsaw for a sustainable economic recovery in the months to come,"" De Lima said.

The Institute of Supply Management said its non-manufacturing purchasing managers’ index (PMI) fell to 56.1, its lowest since August 2018, due partly to concerns about labor market constraints.
The news followed on the heels of a separate report showing that private-sector job creation fell well short of expectations in March. The 129,000 new jobs created was the lowest monthly total since September 2017, according to payroll processor ADP.
""The non-manufacturing sector’s growth cooled off in March after strong growth in February,"" ISM Chair Anthony Nieves said. ""Respondents remain mostly optimistic about overall business conditions and the economy (but) they still have underlying concerns about employment resources and capacity constraints.""
A similar survey of the manufacturing sector released on Monday showed factory activity bounced back from a two-year low in the prior month. A reading above 50 for the index indicates expansion in the sector and a reading below signals contraction.
Among the sub-indices, the non-manufacturing business activity index slipped to 57.4 from 64.7. The new orders index, the most forward-looking element of the survey, fell to 59.0 from 65.2 the previous month. The employment index rose to 55.9 from 55.2 previously, while the prices index increased to 58.7 from 54.4."

U.S. private employers added just 129,000 jobs in March, down from 197,000 in February, according to a report by payrolls processor ADP (NASDAQ:ADP) released on Wednesday. Economists had expected a gain of 184,000 jobs.
""March posted the slowest employment increase in 18 months,"" said Ahu Yildirmaz, vice president and co-head of the ADP Research Institute.
Mark Zandi, chief economist of Moody's Analytics which contributes to the report, said employment gains were slowing significantly across most industries and company sizes.
“Businesses are hiring cautiously as the economy is struggling with fading fiscal stimulus, the trade uncertainty, and the lagged impact of Fed tightening,” he said. “If employment growth weakens much further, unemployment will begin to rise.”
The ADP figures come ahead of the Labor Department's more comprehensive non-farm payrolls report on Friday, which includes both public and private-sector employment.
February’s government employment report was also a negative surprise, showing the creation of just 20,000 jobs.
Economists had forecast that Friday’s government report will show the creation of 180,000 nonfarm payrolls, while the jobless rate is expected to hold steady at 3.8%. Most of the focus will likely be on average hourly earnings, which are expected to rise 3.4% from a year earlier, similar to the increase reported in February.
Allianz (DE:ALVG) chief economic adviser Mohammed El-Erian said that a confirmation of the weak ADP reading would indicate two things: “Unusually large monthly job creation is harder to maintain late-cycle; and the handoff to higher wages and labor participation is key.”
Joseph Brusuelas, chief economist at consulting firm RSM US LLP, said he was “sticking with” his previous forecast of 155,000 jobs in total employment for March.
Even though Brusuelas’ own forecast was lower than consensus, he warned that “slowing economic activity during the first quarter places downside risk on our top-line employment growth forecast.”"

Home sales in Canada’s biggest city totaled 7,187 in the month, one sale shy of the same month a year ago, the Toronto Real Estate Board reported Wednesday. Benchmark prices, which adjust for the type of home sold, rose 2.6 percent to C$779,100 ($584,164) from the same period last year. New listings declined 5.1 percent to 13,996 over the year.
The average price was C$788,335 in March, up from C$781,192 in February.
“Market conditions have remained tight enough to support a moderate pace of price growth,” Jason Mercer, TREB’s chief market analyst, said in the report. “Despite sales being markedly lower than the record levels of 2016 and early 2017, the supply of listings has also receded,” which is providing support for prices, he said.
TREB reiterated its plea that the government relax mortgage lending regulations and that amortizations be lengthened, saying new stress tests continue to impact buyers’ ability to qualify for a mortgage. And it slammed a proposal to increase the municipal land transfer tax on higher priced properties, as been done in Vancouver and New York.
The tax “is not a sustainable revenue source from which to fund municipal programs,” TREB Chief Executive Officer John Di Michele, said in the statement.
Toronto’s housing market has seen a decline in transactions over the past year after the federal government instituted harsher mortgage-lending rules, which include stress testing for higher interest rates. Last month, it gave some relief to first time buyers, outlining a plan to for its housing agency to spend up to C$1.25 billion to take equity positions in the purchases.
The townhouse segment was the best performer with sales rising 12 percent in March compared with last year; condos fell the most at 9.7 percent. Still, condo benchmark prices led the pack with a 7.2 percent gain to C$522,300.
The number of condos that were rented through the TREB system rose 7.7 percent in the first quarter compared with last year, with rent on the average one-bedroom jumping 7.4 percent to C$2,143.

1494,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 03, 2019 06:10AM ET</span>",UK headed for downturn as Brexit worries hammer services,"By David Milliken
LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's economy looks likely to shrink over the coming months, after Brexit worries caused the dominant services sector to contract for the first time in nearly three years, a survey showed on Wednesday.
The IHS Markit/CIPS Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI), a survey of services ranging from giant banks to high-street hairdressers, tumbled to 48.9 in March from 51.3 in February, weaker than all forecasts in a Reuters poll of economists. 
The PMI, a closely watched barometer of the economy's health, is now below 50 and in contractionary territory for the first time since July 2016, immediately after Britons voted to leave the European Union.
""Amid all the noise in Westminster, the latest Markit/CIPS PMI makes it clear the economy is being hit hard,"" ING economist James Smith said in a note.
Britain's economy has been sluggish since the 2016 Brexit referendum and saw its weakest expansion in six years in 2018, even though unemployment fell to its lowest in more than 40 years. 
The slowdown in the global economy has also weighed on growth. But until now few surveys have pointed to an outright contraction in the world's fifth-largest economy.
Britain had been due to leave the EU on March 29, but parliament repeatedly opposed the Brexit deal Prime Minister Theresa May had negotiated with Brussels.
""There were widespread reports that domestic political uncertainty had constrained demand in March, with clients hoping for clarity about Brexit outcomes before committing to new projects,"" IHS Markit said. 
Late on Tuesday, May said she would seek another Brexit delay to try to reach an agreement with Jeremy Corbyn, the opposition Labour Party leader, a last-ditch gambit to break an impasse over Britain's departure that enraged many in her party.
Sterling dipped after the PMI release, to $1.3156 compared with $1.3175 beforehand, but it quickly recouped losses as traders focused on the outcome of the talks between May and Corbyn. 
A broader PMI released this week, including manufacturing and construction data, also fell to its lowest since July 2016. It escaped outright contraction only because firms bought more raw materials to prepare for a potentially disorderly Brexit. 
""A stalling of the economy in the first quarter will ... likely turn into a downturn in the second quarter unless demand revives suddenly, which given the recent escalation of Brexit uncertainty, seems highly improbable,"" IHS Markit said.
But some economists cautioned that past PMIs had tended to be too downbeat when economic uncertainty has been high.
""GDP growth probably is holding up a little better than the PMIs imply,"" said Samuel Tombs at Pantheon Macroeconomics. 
Unlike in 2016, when demand rebounded rapidly after the initial shock of the referendum result, British businesses have now reported falling orders for the past three months, the longest such run since the depths of a recession in 2009.
Last week, the head of the British Chambers of Commerce said business was angry with politicians for ""chasing rainbows"" rather than accepting that some Brexit goals were unrealistic.
And in news likely to depress growth this month, carmakers BMW and Peugeot said May's delay to Brexit had come too late for them to cancel stoppages at their British factories, which they had planned because of fears of parts shortages after Brexit.
ING's Smith pointed to further uncertainties, including another extension of the Brexit date. 

""While this would give firms a temporary reprieve from the ‘no deal’ risk, we suspect companies will continue to make their preparations for this scenario,"" he said. ""All of this is costly, and we think under the scenario of a long extension, growth would continue to suffer.""

Eurostat said sales of clothes and shoes rebounded from a 0.6 percent slump in January to a 1.9 percent month-on-month rise in February and were 2.0 percent higher than a year earlier.

1496,By Investing.com,"<span>Apr 03, 2019 04:40AM ET</span>",Brexit Uncertainty Stalls U.K. Economy as Services Sector Contracts,"Investing.com - Activity in the U.K. service sector contracted for the first time in nearly three years last month as Brexit uncertainty hit the broader economy, threatening stagnation in the first quarter.
Research firm IHS Markit said its services purchasing managers’ index fell to 48.9 in March. That was its lowest reading since July 2016 and below the 50 point level that divides expansion from contraction.
“A drop in service sector activity indicates that U.K. GDP contracted in March, with the economy stalling over the first quarter as a whole and at risk of sliding into a deepening downturn in the coming months,” IHS Markit chief economist Chris Williamson said in the report.
The report indicated that companies had opted to delay spending decisions due to intense political uncertainty, while some responses showed that Brexit-related worries about the economic outlook had also held back household spending.
Data released earlier this week showed that construction activity contracted for a second consecutive month as a lack of clarity on Brexit deterred investment decisions.
Manufacturing activity rose to a 13-month high in March, but economists warned the rebound was due to stockpiling ahead of expected Brexit-related disruptions.
“A stalling of the economy in the first quarter will therefore likely turn into a downturn in the second quarter unless demand revives suddenly which, given the recent escalation of Brexit uncertainty, seems highly improbable,” Williamson said.
He added that the current consensus forecast of 1.3% growth in the U.K. for 2019 was “far too optimistic. IHS Markit currently expects to see just 0.8% growth in 2019, and even this modest performance is perhaps somewhat hopeful given the recent lack of any Brexit developments,” he concluded.
Others, however disagreed.
""Don't forget the PMIs only cover sectors accounting for 70% of GDP (retail, government and non-manufacturing sectors are excluded), and tend to be too downbeat during periods of high political uncertainty,"" Samuel Tombs, chief U.K. economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said via Twitter. The U.K. economy ""undoubtedly is struggling, but GDP growth likely didn't slow to zero in Q1,"" he added.


.
The U.K. had originally been due to leave the EU on March 29, but the deadline was pushed back to April 12 to allow parliament more time to approve the withdrawal agreement negotiated by Prime Minister Theresa May's government.
After that bill failed to receive approval, May said late Tuesday that she would ask the EU for an additional extension. May stressed the extension would be “as short as possible”, likely before May 22, to avoid the U.K. having to participate in European parliamentary elections.
Late on Tuesday, May offered bipartisan talks with the leader of opposition, Jeremy Corbyn, to break the Brexit logjam."

LONDON, (Reuters) - Business activity across the euro zone was lethargic last month, according to a survey which suggested a downturn in manufacturing is gradually infecting the bloc's dominant services industry.
IHS Markit's Euro Zone Composite Final Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI), considered a good measure of overall economic health, dipped to 51.6 in March from February's 51.9.
That was higher than an earlier flash reading of 51.3 but closer to the 50 mark separating growth from contraction.
""The final euro zone PMI for March confirms the sluggish end to the first quarter, with business growth ebbing to one of the most lethargic rates seen since 2014,"" said Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit.
Williamson said the PMI was consistent with economic growth of 0.2 percent in the first quarter, weaker than the 0.3 percent predicted in a Reuters poll last month. [ECILT/EU]
Signs of a slowdown are likely to concern policymakers at the European Central Bank, who last month pushed back the timing of an interest rate rise until at least 2020 and said they would offer banks a new round of cheap loans to help revive the economy.
Factories had their worst month for almost six years in March, a sister survey showed on Monday, and while services activity notched up a tad last month it remained weak.
A services PMI rose to 53.3 from 52.8, ahead of the flash estimate of 52.7.
""The service sector has managed to sustain a relatively resilient rate of growth but has also lost momentum in recent months. This should come as no surprise as history tells us that robust service sector growth usually depends on a healthy manufacturing economy,"" Williamson said.
But like their manufacturing counterparts, firms in the service industry generated some of that activity by running down old demand. The backlogs of work index fell below the breakeven mark to 49.4 from 51.0, indicating firms are operating with spare capacity.
With forward looking indicators providing little -- if any -- reason to cheer, overall optimism waned. The composite future output index dropped to 60.4 from 60.6.

1499,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 03, 2019 04:30AM ET</span>",Strong services PMI spotlights a tale of two German economies,"BERLIN, (Reuters) - Employment, prices and backlogs all grew in Germany's services sector in March, a survey showed, but failed to offset weakness in the manufacturing sector of Europe's largest economy.
Index provider Markit's services Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) inched up to 55.4 in March, its highest since September, from 55.3 in February, helped by strong domestic demand and a rise in customer numbers, though non-domestic clients were more cautious.
Growth was strong across the telecoms, rent and business activities and financials sectors, although levels of activity were slightly lower in the hospitality, transport and other services sectors.
Robust services employment drove up wages in the sector, which firms were able to pass on: output price inflation in March was the fastest since data collection began in 1997, Markit said.
Continuing weakness in the industrial sector meant that Markit's Composite PMI index -- which scores activity levels across both sectors -- nonetheless slipped slightly to 51.4 from 52.8. That was still above the 50 mark that separates growth from contraction, but the lowest reading since June 2013.
That weakness was underscored by the largest drop in goods production in almost seven years.
""The survey suggests that domestic demand is remaining resilient in the face of external headwinds,"" said Markit economist Phil Smith, ""with services firms seeing the strongest increase in overall new business for six months despite a drop in new work from abroad.""

1500,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 02, 2019 11:12PM ET</span>",China March services activity quickens to 14-month high in further sign of recovery: Caixin PMI,"BEIJING, (Reuters) - Activity in China's services sector picked up to a 14-month high in March as demand improved at home and abroad, a private business survey showed on Wednesday, adding to signs that government stimulus policies are gradually kicking in.
But analysts cautioned it is too early to tell if China's economy has turned the corner, with many businesses cautious on whether there will be much improvement in a year's time.
The Caixin/Markit services purchasing managers' index (PMI) rose to 54.4, the highest since January 2018 and up from February's 51.1, a fourth-month low. The 50-mark separates growth from contraction.
Survey respondents said activity was being buoyed by stronger demand, new state policies and improved access to financing. 
The findings were largely in line with those of an official gauge on the non-manufacturing sector released on Sunday, which showed services activity picked up in March as new orders rose more quickly. Construction, in particular, showed strength, likely reflecting government efforts to fast-track more infrastructure projects to kindle domestic demand.
Also, both official and private manufacturing surveys unexpectedly returned to growth in March, fueling hopes that China's downturn may be bottoming out.
""In general, China's economic fundamentals recovered in March, with domestic and external demand as well as manufacturing employment improving,"" Zhengsheng Zhong, Director of Macroeconomic Analysis at CEBM Group, said in a commentary released alongside the Caixin data. 
""However, business sentiment has remained cautious, and inflation was subdued ... More evidence is needed to determine whether the Chinese economy has stabilized,"" Zhang said. 
China has been banking on the services sector to cushion the slowdown in manufacturing, which is being hit by rising labor costs and the year-long U.S.-China trade war. But consumers have in recent months turned more cautious about spending on big-ticket items like cars and appliances as income growth slows amid the broader economic slowdown. 
The private services survey showed total orders rose to 14-month high, with solid growth in export sales for Chinese service providers.
But growth in operating costs continued to outpace prices charged by services firms, indicating persistent pressure on their profit margin.
Business confidence edged up, but remained weaker than longer-term trends. Only 18 percent of respondents anticipated business activity will be higher in a year.
Perhaps reflecting that lingering caution, job creation in the services sector also eased to only a marginal pace.
Caixin's composite manufacturing and services PMI, also released on Wednesday, picked up to a nine-month high of 52.9 in March from 50.7 in February. 
Since late last year, Bejing has implemented a flurry of tax and fee cuts to reduce the cost burdens on individuals and companies, while the central bank has guided borrowing costs lower. 
""The current economic slowdown in China is mainly due to insufficient domestic demand,"" Liu Xueliang, Associate Research Fellow at state think tank Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, was quoted as saying on Tuesday by the 21st Centry Business Herald.
More policy support measures are expected in coming months, 

though some relief for businesses might be in the offing if Beijing and Washington reach a deal to end their bruising trade war. Both sides have reported progress in the latest round of talks, although U.S. President Donald Trump cautioned that he would not accept anything less than a ""great deal"".

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - New orders for key U.S.-made capital goods slipped in February and shipments were unchanged, but data for January was revised slightly higher, which could support views that the manufacturing sector was stabilizing.
The Commerce Department's mixed report on Tuesday came on the heels of a survey showing a rebound in a measure of factory activity in March from a more than two-year low. Manufacturing has been hobbled in part by slowing global growth and a trade war between the United States and China.
""Manufacturing still needs a catalyst to lift activity levels and we think that will come once the trade deal with China looks to be ironed out,"" said John Ryding, chief economist at RDQ Economics in New York.
Orders for non-defense capital goods excluding aircraft, a closely watched proxy for business spending plans, fell 0.1 percent, pulled down by declining demand for machinery and computers and electronic products. These so-called core capital goods orders increased 0.9 percent in January, instead of rising 0.8 percent as previously reported. 
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast core capital goods orders unchanged in February. Core capital goods orders increased 2.6 percent on a year-on-year basis.
Shipments of core capital goods were unchanged in February after an upwardly revised 1.0 percent rise in the prior month. Core capital goods shipments are used to calculate equipment spending in the government's gross domestic product measurement. 
They were previously reported to have gained 0.8 percent in January. The February report was delayed by a 35-day partial shutdown of the federal government that ended on Jan. 25. The March report will be published on April 25 as scheduled.
U.S. financial markets were little moved by the data. The Institute for Supply Management said on Monday that its index of national factory activity rose to a reading of 55.3 in March from 54.2 in February, which had marked the lowest level since November 2016. The ISM reported strong order growth in March.
RISING INVENTORIES
While the strong ISM survey and the upward revisions to the core capital goods data were positive developments for manufacturing, some economists worried that a growing stockpile of unsold goods at factories could be a challenge for the sector that accounts for about 12 percent of the U.S. economy.
The Commerce Department report showed another month of inventory gains in February, which some economists said appeared to be unintended. The inventory glut is mostly concentrated in the auto and apparel industries. 
""The combination of overbuilt inventories plus a widespread desire among manufacturing customers to reduce inventories adds up to an impending manufacturing slowdown,"" said Chris Low, chief economist at FTN Financial in New York.
Still, the core capital goods data added to February's retail sales report, solid construction spending and January business inventory data in tempering expectations of a sharp slowdown in economic growth in the first quarter. 
Growth estimates for the first-quarter range from as low as a 1.2 percent annualized rate to as high as a 2.1 percent pace. The economy grew at a 2.2 percent pace in the fourth quarter, with growth in business spending on equipment accelerating.
The economy is losing momentum, largely as the stimulus from a $1.5 trillion tax cut fades. Fears of a disorderly exit by Britain from the European Union are also weighing on the economy and manufacturing sector. 
In February, orders for machinery dropped 0.3 percent after rising 2.0 percent in January. Energy firms have been reducing the oil rigs operating, despite a rebound in oil prices, to focus on growing earnings.
Overall orders for durable goods, items ranging from toasters to aircraft that are meant to last three years or more, tumbled 1.6 percent in February. That reflected a 4.8 percent drop in demand for transportation equipment. Durable goods orders gained 0.1 percent in January.

Orders for motor vehicles and parts dipped 0.1 percent in February. Orders for non-defense aircraft plunged 31.1 percent after rising 9.2 percent in January. Boeing (NYSE:BA) reported on its website that it had received only five aircraft orders in February compared to 46 in January.

Durable-goods orders fell 1.6% last month, the Commerce Department said, more than the 1.1% decline expected by economists.
Analysts had widely expected a drop in orders for civilian aircraft, a volatile number that had posted unusually solid gains in recent months. Along those lines, non-defense aircraft orders tumbled 31% in February, pushing the headline number lower. That sub-sector could stay under pressure next month too, given the reaction of airlines around the world to the Boeing (NYSE:BA) 737 Max 8 crash in Ethiopia.
Excluding the volatile transportation sector, orders gained 0.1%, although that still missed the 0.3% consensus forecast.
U.S. economic growth has been on a rough path in 2019, as declines in personal income have fed through to weak retail sales numbers, while the government shutdown also knocked confidence and disrupted activity. February’s employment report added to the pessimism, showing meager job creation of just 20,000 posts. The March labor report, due on Friday, will show whether that was just a blip or the start of a more ominous trend.
In a more positive sign on Monday, the  Institute of Supply Management said manufacturing activity staged a stronger-than-expected rebound in March after hitting a two-year low the previous month.

1503,By Investing.com,"<span>Apr 02, 2019 04:37AM ET</span>",U.K. Construction PMI Contracts for 2nd Straight Month on Brexit Indecision,"Investing.com - Activity in the U.K. construction sector contracted for a second month running in March as uncertainty over Brexit continued to deter investment, while the related weakness of sterling pushed up input prices.
Research firm IHS Markit said its construction purchasing managers’ index rose to 49.7 in March, a marginal improvement from February’s 11-month low but still a second consecutive contraction.
On the index, a reading above 50.0 indicates expansion, below indicates contraction.
IHS economist Joe Hayes noted that the data fueled fears that recent weakness in U.K. construction may represent ""a sustained soft patch"", rather than just a blip. “Brexit-related uncertainty continued to generate indecisiveness, ultimately hitting order book volumes,” he said.
Uncertainty surrounding the outcome of the U.K.’s departure from the European Union has had varying impacts on British business activity.
Another IHS Markit report released on Monday showed that manufacturing activity surged to a 13-month high in March due to stockpiling ahead of the Brexit date.
The U.K. had originally been due to leave the EU on March 29, but the deadline was pushed back to April 12 to allow the U.K. parliament more time to approve the withdrawal agreement negotiated by British Prime Minister Theresa May and EU authorities.
However, that bill has failed to gain parliamentary approval for a third time on Friday and no alternative proposals have been approved, leaving a no-deal exit as the default option.
May is scheduled to chair a five-hour cabinet meeting on Tuesday in an attempt to plot out the next course of action.
If May is unable to get parliamentary approval for her deal, then the U.K. will be left with a choice between leaving without a deal, calling an election or asking the EU for a long delay to negotiate a Brexit deal with a much closer relationship with the bloc.
“It is unlikely that next month will bring about any positive news given the challenges of a weaker UK economy, volatile pound and intense competition for new orders, as Brexit continues to cast a long shadow over the sector’s future,” Duncan Brock, Group Director at the Chartered Institute of Procurement & Supply that participates in the survey, said."

1505,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 02, 2019 01:11AM ET</span>",India's factory growth hits six-month low in March on weak demand: PMI,"BENGALURU, (Reuters) - Growth in India's manufacturing industry slowed to a six-month low in March as orders and output expanded at a weaker rate, but overall factory activity ran at a solid pace in the first quarter, a private survey showed on Tuesday.
The Nikkei Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index, compiled by IHS Markit, fell to a six-month low of 52.6 in March from February's 54.3, below a Reuters poll forecast of 53.9 but above the 50-mark separating growth from contraction for the 20th straight month.
Underscoring that long stretch of growth in the sector, factory activity in the first three months of 2019 increased at its quickest quarterly average rate in more than six years.
""Manufacturing sector expansion in India took a step back in March, with metrics for factory orders, production, exports, input buying and employment all moving lower. Still, growth was sustained on all fronts,"" noted Pollyanna De Lima, principal economist at IHS Markit.
""Although global headwinds and a general slowdown in trade present some concerns for the future health of Indian manufacturers' order books, so far companies have been able to weather the storm and secure healthy inflows of new work from abroad.""
But as new orders and output grew at their slowest pace since September - despite inflationary pressures easing - firms increased headcount at the weakest rate in eight months.
That should keep retail inflation from rising significantly in the near-term. It was below the Reserve Bank of India's medium-term target of 4 percent for a seven straight month in February, the latest official data showed.
Below-target inflation would give the central bank room to cut its benchmark repo rate for a second consecutive meeting, as is widely expected. It is due to announce its decision on April 4. [RBI/INT]
The latest survey also showed optimism amongst factories rose to its highest since August, supported by government policies announced ahead of this year's general election.

""Expansionary public policies such as fiscal stimulus and interest rate reduction should also assist the manufacturing sector in gaining some traction in the near term,"" said De Lima

1506,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 02, 2019 12:05AM ET</span>",Australia's central bank sets measured tone on rates before budget,"By Wayne Cole
SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia's central bank held interest rates steady on Tuesday and again highlighted the strength of employment, showing no immediate inclination to echo the outright dovish tone of some of its global peers. 
The measured message comes just hours before the country's conservative government is expected to release an annual budget larded with tax breaks and infrastructure spending, stimulus that might lessen the need for rate cuts this year.
The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) ended its April policy meeting with rates firmly lodged at 1.5 percent, where they have been since mid-2016. Neither did its statement smack of any urgency to act.
""The Australian labour market remains strong,"" said RBA Governor Philip Lowe in the statement. ""Further progress in reducing unemployment and having inflation return to target is expected, although this progress is likely to be gradual.""
Lowe said the central bank board would ""continue to monitor developments and set monetary policy to support sustainable growth.""
Just last week, the Reserve Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ) blindsided investors by abandoning its neutral stance and declaring the next move in interest rates would likely be down.
Markets reacted violently by pricing in not one but two quarter-point easings in its 1.75 percent cash rate.
The shift comes amid dovish turns by the Federal Reserve, European Central Bank and the Bank of Japan.
That in turn fed speculation the RBA would ultimately be forced to ease, if only to stop its currency from rising.
The market has moved to price in a quarter-point rate cut to 1.25 percent as early as September. Yields on three-year paper sank to an all-time low of 1.37 percent last week, well under the cash rate.
Futures slightly widened the odds of a cut in the wake of the meeting, while the local dollar held at $0.7104.
IN FAVOR OF FISCAL POLICY
The RBA made no mention of the budget, but analysts suspect it would prefer to juice a misfiring economy with fiscal stimulus rather than cut rates from already record lows.
The government of Prime Minister Scott Morrison has plenty of incentive to be generous given it faces an election in May and is running well behind in the opinion polls.
It also has the wherewithal as revenues from mining companies and households are handily ahead of forecasts, while a strong jobs market has limited welfare payments.
The prospect of sweeteners already seems to have had some impact with the public, which is smarting from sliding house prices and record levels of debt.
The ANZ-Roy Morgan index of consumer confidence out on Tuesday showed a 2.6 percent rise last week to near a one-month high, largely due to optimism on the economic outlook.
""Consumers head into the Budget with confidence above average and at the highest level for some weeks. Talk of additional tax cuts and spending may be supporting sentiment,"" said ANZ senior economist David Plank.
There was also better news on construction as data showed approvals to build new homes jumped 19.1 percent in February, when analysts had looked for a small drop.

The pickup came thanks to a 62 percent surge in multi-home approvals, which includes major apartment blocks. Some of that could be unwound in March but nonetheless indicates a solid pipeline of work to be done.

The national vacancy rate was 10.2 percent, unchanged from the fourth quarter, but marginally up from a year earlier.
The vacancy rates in 28 of 77 metros rose during the first quarter. 
""As the retail sector continues to undergo restructuring, a number of retail real estate markets face more vacancies and falling rents. This pattern is expected to continue as more stores will close this year,"" Reis said.
Both the national average asking rent and effective rent, excluding landlord concessions, increased 0.4 percent from the previous quarter, Reis said.
The regional mall vacancy rate marginally rose 0.3 percent to 9.3 percent in the wake of closure of over two dozen Sears stores. However, the average rent was flat during the first quarter.

For neighborhood and community shopping centers, net absorption, measured in terms of available space sold in the market, fell about 7.4 percent to 949,000 square feet in the first quarter from a year earlier. Also, new construction plunged about 53.9 percent to 832,000 square feet during the same period.

1508,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 01, 2019 08:45PM ET</span>",Japan Inc's inflation expectations stagnate in blow to BOJ,"By Stanley White
TOKYO (Reuters) - Japanese companies' expectations for inflation over the next year stagnated, a Bank of Japan survey showed on Tuesday, underlining the daunting challenge facing policymakers as they seek to boost growth and prices amid slowing global demand. 
Companies expect consumer prices to have risen 0.9 percent a year from now, unchanged from their projection three months ago, according to a quarterly survey by the BOJ. 
Firms expect consumer prices to have risen by an annual 1.1 percent three years from now, unchanged from the previous survey. Companies also saw inflation at 1.1 percent five years ahead, slightly below a 1.2 percent increase expected three months ago.
The discouraging inflation expectations reading comes in the face of increasing risks to Japan's economy as global trade slows in a blow to profits and consumption. 
There are also uncertainties over the government's plan to raise the sales tax later this year.
""There were signs that some companies would raise prices from April, but this survey shows this will not be a consistent policy,"" said Shuji Tonouchi, senior market economist at Mitsubishi UFJ  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) Securities.
""The labor market remains tight, so our main scenario is for no additional easing, but the sales tax hike is a source of concern.""
A separate survey from the BOJ on Monday showed business sentiment slumped to a two-year low in the March quarter, underscoring concerns that Sino-U.S. trade dispute and softening global demand were taking a toll on the export-reliant economy
The BOJ's next policy meeting ends on April 25. 
Recent data showed increased strains on Japan's trade-reliant economy. 
Core consumer prices rose an annual 0.7 percent in February, slower than a 0.8 percent increase in the previous month, while in the same period exports fell for a third month, suggesting the central bank might be forced to offer more stimulus eventually to temper the effects of slowing external demand and trade frictions.
Slowing global growth, the Sino-U.S. trade war and complications over Britain's exit from the European Union have already forced many policymakers to shift to an easing stance over recent months.
Many in the BOJ expect Japan's economy to emerge from the current soft patch in the second half of this year, assuming China's stimulus plans can revive demand there.
However, economists worry that global trade friction will not subside as the United States re-negotiates trade deals to lower its trade deficit, meaning Japan's economic slowdown could be prolonged.
The government plans to raise the nationwide sales tax to 10 percent from 8 percent in October to generate extra revenue for rising welfare costs.

Some economists and politicians worry that if this plan is not delayed then consumer spending will weaken after the tax hike.

SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea's headline inflation slowed to its weakest pace since July 2016 in March on declines in food prices and weaker service costs growth, adding pressure for policymakers to shift to an easing stance and ramp up stimulus.
The consumer price index rose 0.4 percent in March from a year earlier, Statistics Korea said on Tuesday, undershooting 0.9 percent price growth tipped in a Reuters survey.
The data adds to growing signs that Sino-U.S. trade tensions and slowing global demand are hurting sentiment in Asia's fourth largest economy, and supports money market bets that the Bank of Korea may cut interest rates for the first time in three years.
If the weakness in consumer price growth persist, the BOK may be forced to cut its inflation forecasts again at its next rate review on April 18, from current 1.4 percent for 2019.
From a month earlier, prices fell 0.2 percent, also missing the 0.35 percent increase tipped in the survey.
The inflation data comes after a recent batch of weak indicators, such as figures that showed exports contracted for a fourth month in March while February factory output shrank to a two-year low.
Core CPI, which excludes agricultural and oil-based products, rose 0.8 percent from a year ago, also slowing from 1.1 percent in February.
""Price growth in the service sector such as restaurants and travel agencies is weakening, in a sign of softer demand-side pressure,"" a Statistics Korea official said. 
A sub-index for fresh produce costs dropped 3 percent on-year after falling 5.2 percent in February. Service costs gained 1.1 percent, slower than 1.4 percent gain a month earlier. 
South Korea's central bank chief on Monday said the bank is not in a hurry to ease policy, contrary to bond market pricing, which implies the next move in BOK rates is likely to be a cut. The yield on South Korea’s three-year government bond, for example, has fallen below the 1.75 percent policy rate of since last week.
""We need to monitor further but it seems the situation doesn't warrant us to review an easing in policy interest rates now,"" Governor Lee Ju-yeol told reporters at a press conference in Seoul.

The BOK's current annual inflation target is at 2 percent.

LONDON (Reuters) - Fading exports and worsening finances spurred a darker outlook for British companies last month, hurt by a slowing global economy and political chaos around Brexit, a survey showed on Tuesday.
The British Chambers of Commerce's (BCC) Quarterly Economic Survey showed a familiar picture of weak investment ahead of Britain's departure from the European Union, across both the manufacturing and services sectors.
Britain had been due to leave the EU on March 29 but Prime Minister Theresa May was forced to ask the EU for a delay after the country's parliament refused to back the exit plans she had negotiated with Brussels.
Currently Brexit is due to take place at 2200 GMT on April 12, unless May comes up with another option. 
The BCC said growth in services exports, which account for about 45 percent of total exports, slowed to their weakest rate since 2009.
Its gauge of firms' cashflow turned negative for the first time since 2012 and investment intentions for both manufacturers and services firms were the weakest in over eight years.
Overall, the BCC report adds to a string of downbeat data from businesses ahead of Brexit, despite solid consumer spending and a robust labor market.
""Our findings should serve as a clear warning that the ongoing impasse at Westminster is contributing to a sharp slowdown in the real economy across the UK. Business is hitting the brakes hard,"" BCC director general Adam Marshall said.
Last week Marshall told politicians addressing the BCC's annual conference in London that they needed to stop ""chasing rainbows"" and instead find a consensus over Brexit.
The BCC survey, the largest of its kind, covered more than 7,000 companies between Feb. 18 and March 11.

Another closely-watched gauge of the economy, the IHS Markit/CIPS survey of the services sector for March, is due on Wednesday.

BRASILIA (Reuters) - Brazil posted a trade surplus of $4.99 billion in March, the Economy Ministry said on Monday, significantly smaller than the same month a year ago thanks to a strong rise in imports.
The trade surplus last month fell 22.3 percent to $4.99 billion from $6.42 billion a year ago, although that was up more than a third from February's surplus of $3.67 billion. 
Exports totaled $18.12 billion, down 1.0 percent from March last year, while imports totaled $13.13 billion, up 5.1 percent from the same month last year, Economy Ministry figures showed.
All else being equal, a shrinking trade surplus is a drag on economic growth. Last week, Brazil's central bank cut its 2019 growth forecast to 2.0 percent from 2.4 percent, noting that net trade is expected to shave 0.2 percentage points off overall growth. 
Foreign trade secretary Lucas Ferraz said on Monday he expects Brazil's trade surplus this year to total $50.1 billion, on exports of $245.9 billion and imports of $195.8 billion. 
That would be the third largest surplus on record, Ferraz noted, but crucially it would be some 15 percent down from last year's surplus of $58.66 billion, and 25 percent down from the year before that. 

The data for March showed a 13.0 percent jump in imports of capital goods, including autos, while commodities exports rose 7.9 percent. Exports of manufactured goods fell 6.5 percent.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. retail sales unexpectedly fell in February, the latest sign economic growth has shifted into low gear as stimulus from $1.5 trillion in tax cuts and increased government spending fades.
There was, however, some encouraging news on the economy. Other reports on Monday showed a pickup in manufacturing activity in March and the third straight monthly increase in construction spending in February. Still, the risks to economic growth in the first quarter remain tilted to the downside.
The loss of momentum also reflects higher interest rates, slowing global growth, Washington's trade war with China and uncertainty over Britain's departure from the European Union.
These factors contributed to the Federal Reserve's decision last month to abruptly end its three-year campaign to tighten monetary policy. The U.S. central bank abandoned projections for any interest rate hikes this year after increasing borrowing costs four times in 2018. 
""The consumer is lost in the woods and this makes for a gloomy economic outlook this year if they cannot find their way,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG in New York. ""The Fed was wise to move to the sidelines.""
Retail sales dropped 0.2 percent as households cut back on purchases of furniture, clothing, food and electronics and appliances, as well as building materials and gardening equipment. Data for January was revised higher to show retail sales increasing 0.7 percent instead of gaining 0.2 percent as previously reported. 
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast retail sales rising 0.3 percent in February. Retail sales in February advanced 2.2 percent from a year ago. 
The surprise drop in sales in February could partly reflect delays in processing tax refunds in the middle of the month. Tax refunds have also been smaller on average compared to prior years following the revamping of the tax code in January 2018. Cold and wet weather could also have hurt sales.
The February retail sales report was delayed by a 35-day partial shutdown of the federal government that ended on Jan. 25. March's retail sales report, which was scheduled for publication on April 16, will be released on April 18.
The dollar was trading lower against a basket of currencies, while Treasury prices were down. U.S. stocks rose.
Excluding automobiles, gasoline, building materials and food services, retail sales fell 0.2 percent in February after an upwardly revised 1.7 percent surge in January. These so-called core retail sales correspond most closely with the consumer spending component of gross domestic product.
DEMAND WEAKENING
They were previously reported to have rebounded 1.1 percent in January. Consumer spending accounts for more than two-thirds of economic activity. The sharp upward revision to core retail sales in January was insufficient to reverse December's more than 2.0 percent plunge, leaving expectations for tepid GDP growth in the first quarter intact. 
Growth estimates for the January-March quarter are as low as a 0.8 percent annualized rate. The economy grew at a 2.2 percent rate in the fourth quarter after expanding at a 3.4 percent clip in the July-September period.
But green shoots are emerging in some sectors of the economy. In a separate report on Monday, the Institute for Supply Management said its index of national factory activity rose to a reading of 55.3 in March from 54.2 in February, which had marked the lowest level since November 2016. 
The reading was slightly above expectations of 54.5 from a Reuters poll of 69 economists. A reading above 50 indicates expansion in the manufacturing sector and a reading below 50 indicates contraction.
Another report from the Commerce Department showed construction spending rose 1.0 percent to a nine-month high in February after surging 2.5 percent in January. 
The February retail sales report showed receipts at building materials and garden equipment and supplies dealers tumbled 4.4 percent, the biggest drop since April 2012. Receipts at clothing stores fell 0.4 percent and those at furniture outlets dropped 0.5 percent.
Sales at food and beverage stores declined 1.2 percent, the biggest drop since February 2009. Receipts at electronics and appliances stores fell 1.3 percent, the largest decline since May 2017. 
But consumers bought more motor vehicles, with sales at auto dealerships rebounding 0.7 percent after declining 1.9 percent in January. Households also spent more at service stations, likely reflecting higher gasoline prices.
Online and mail-order retail sales rose 0.9 percent. Sales at restaurants and bars edged up 0.1 percent and spending at hobby, musical instrument and book stores increased 0.5 percent.

Slowing demand was highlighted by a fourth report from the Commerce Department showing business inventories rose 0.8 percent in January.

The IHS Markit Mexico Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index slipped to 49.8 in March from 52.6 in February.
A reading above 50 signals expansion in the sector, while a reading below that threshold points to contraction.
The latest reading comes after the sector posted its strongest pace of growth in 13 months in February.
""The return to contraction of the manufacturing industry is a surprise and denotes a reversal to hopes that the Mexican economy can improve on the relatively modest rate of GDP growth in 2018,"" said IHS Markit economist Pollyanna De Lima, who wrote the report.
""The downturn also caused a dent in confidence among firms in the sector. The concern is that the underlying picture remains one of a segment that continues to struggle in the face of subdued demand, both domestically and externally,"" she added.
Mexico's economic activity expanded slightly in January after shrinking during the prior month, with economic activity growing 0.2 percent in January compared with the prior month in seasonally adjusted terms, data showed on March 25.
The IHS Markit survey showed that total inflows of new work stagnated and export sales increased at a marginal and slower pace, leading firms to reduce employment, input purchasing and output.
Mexico sends about 80 percent of its exports, which are mostly manufactured goods like cars and televisions, to the United States.
The PMI index is composed of five sub-indexes tracking changes in new orders, output, employment, suppliers' delivery times and stocks of raw materials.

Economists had forecast a reading of 54.5.
A reading above 50 for the index indicates expansion in the sector and a reading below 50 signals contraction.

The more forward-looking new orders index advanced to 57.4 in March from 55.5 a month earlier.
The employment index rose to 57.5 from 52.3, while the prices paid index rose more than expected to 54.3 from a previous reading of 49.4.

Growth estimates for the January-March quarter are as low as a 0.8 percent annualized rate. The economy grew at a 2.2 percent rate in the fourth quarter after expanding at a 3.4 percent clip in the July-September period.

Headline inflation in the 19 countries sharing the euro slowed to 1.4 percent in March from 1.5 percent a month earlier, short of market expectations for a steady rate and also well below the ECB's target of almost 2 percent.
In a more worrying sign, a closely watched underlying inflation figure that excludes volatile food and energy prices, slowed to 1.0 percent, its weakest reading since April 2018. 
Although wages are rising and employment is at a record high, consumer prices have repeatedly disappointed and underlying inflation remains weak, baffling policymakers and putting in doubt the central bank's ability to control prices.
ECB President Mario Draghi has long predicted a rise in underlying inflation, only for the data to disappoint and forcing the ECB to ask for even more time to lift prices.
""Today's price data should further depress inflation expectations in the market, all the more so as the headline inflation rate fell to 1.4 percent in March,"" Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) economist Christoph Weil said on Monday.
""It is likely to remain well below the ECB's inflation target of close to 2 percent over the rest of the year.""
Still, some of the core inflation drop may be reversed next month, some economists said, attributing the fall to seasonal factors as Easter is in April this year, suggesting that some price rise around the holiday are likely to come later. 
ENERGY PRICE RISE
Although the ECB ended its 2.6 trillion euro bond purchase scheme at the end of last year, it has put plans to ""normalise"" policy on hold, delaying a rate hike into next year.
It is also working on plans to give banks even more cheap loans, hoping to maintain the flow of credit to the economy.
Energy prices were the only major component of the index that accelerated in March, to a rise of 5.3 percent year-on-year from 3.6 percent in February. 
But an even more narrow core inflation reading, which also excludes alcohol and tobacco and is watched closely by market economists, decelerated to 0.8 percent from 1.0 percent in February, against the average expectation of 0.9 percent.

Eurostat data showed separately that the unemployment rate was unchanged at 7.8 percent of the workforce in February against January, but the number of people out of a job fell to 12.730 million from 12.807 million in January.

1517,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 01, 2019 06:29AM ET</span>",Global factory activity weak in March as clouds gather,"By Jonathan Cable and Marius Zaharia
LONDON/HONG KONG (Reuters) - Factory activity remained weak around the world last month, reinforcing worries of a global slowdown as forward-looking indicators pointed to gloomy times ahead, surveys showed on Monday.
Euro zone manufacturers had their weakest month for almost six years in March. While China showed a slight, surprising recovery last month, growth in new domestic and export orders was marginal, in a sign that stimulus already injected into Asia's growth engine may not be enough.
Factory activity in Germany, France, Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, and Taiwan shrank further, adding to expectations of a dovish turn from central bankers.
Britain was an anomaly, with manufacturing growth at an unexpected 13-month high, but that was driven by factories stockpiling for Brexit at an explosive rate, unlike anything seen before in a major rich economy.
""The jump in the UK manufacturing PMI in March largely reflects producers rushing to complete work before the Brexit deadline, rather than a strengthening of underlying demand,"" said Samuel Tombs at Pantheon Macroeconomics.
Figures from Germany and France, the euro zone's two biggest economies, showed manufacturing activity contracted, as it did in Italy. Growth returned in Spain after a brief dip in February but activity was still stagnating.
So IHS Markit's March final manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) for the euro zone declined for an eighth month, coming in at 47.5 from February's 49.3, its lowest reading since April 2013.
""The fall in the manufacturing PMI ... shows that the industrial recession is still deepening,"" said Holger Schmieding at Berenberg.
Casting a shadow over the bloc's outlook, new orders fell at their fastest rate in over six years, backlogs of work were run down at their fastest pace since late 2012 and factories curtailed purchases of raw materials as they stockpiled unsold products.
The weak global environment is feeding back into the U.S. economy, prompting the Federal Reserve to abruptly end its policy tightening last month and causing the Treasury yield curve to briefly invert last week - a potential signal of a looming recession.
A pause from the Fed has changed the game for many central banks and investors are betting on a growing list of potential rate cutters.
Last month, the European Central Bank changed its outlook. It pushed back the timing of an interest rate rise until 2020 at the earliest and said it would offer banks a new round of cheap loans to help revive the economy.
""The big picture is that with the economy performing poorly, pressure is soon likely to build on the ECB to increase its policy support,"" said Jack Allen at Capital Economics.

China's Caixin/Markit Manufacturing PMI expanded at the strongest pace in eight months in March, rising to 50.8 from 49.9, the highest level since July 2018.
An official survey released on Sunday also showed modest expansion.
Economists cautioned there were seasonal factors in play, with activity in March traditionally picking up markedly whenever the Chinese Lunar New Year holidays fell in February, as they did this year.
But if the trend is sustained, it could mark the turnaround China's policymakers had hoped for after some heavy fiscal and monetary stimulus, including five cuts in bank reserve requirements in the past year, although analysts say more measures may be in the pipeline.
Chinese Premier Li Keqiang said last month the government has additional monetary policy measures that it can take, and will even cut ""its own flesh"" to help finance large-scale tax cuts.
On the trade front, U.S. President Donald Trump said on Friday talks with China were going very well, but cautioned he would not accept anything less than a ""great deal"" after top U.S. and Chinese trade officials wrapped up two days of negotiations in Beijing.
""A set of better economic numbers on the Chinese side could raise the bargaining chips in negotiations with the U.S., as they could show that the Chinese economy can still bounce back from the tariffs imposed by the U.S. so far,"" said Kevin Lai, chief Asia ex-Japan economist at Daiwa Capital Markets.
The U.S.-China tariff war and slowing Chinese demand after a campaign to reduce financial risk-taking have caused broad damage, hurting everyone from small firms in the supply chains of Chinese manufacturers to global tech behemoths such as Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL).
Activity in Vietnam, Indonesia and the Philippines grew at a modest pace, but in economies with a larger impact on Asian growth the outlook remained bleak.
South Korea's factory activity in March contracted for a fifth straight month.

Japanese manufacturing activity contracted at a slower pace in March, but output fell at the sharpest rate in nearly three years. Japanese business confidence worsened to a two-year low in the first quarter of this year, a central bank survey showed.

1518,By Investing.com,"<span>Apr 01, 2019 05:05AM ET</span>",Euro Zone Inflation Slips in March ,"Investing.com - Inflation in the euro zone fell slightly in March, staying well below the European Central Bank's medium-term target, according to a flash reading of the data on Monday.
The consumer price index showed annual inflation fell to 1.4% from 1.5% in February, the bloc’s statistics agency Eurostat said.
Core inflation, which excludes energy, food, alcohol and tobacco prices, slowed to an annual rate of 0.8% from a revised 1% in February. That is well below the level targeted by the European Central Bank, which aims for an inflation rate of just under 2% in the medium term.
In a separate report, the unemployment rate in the bloc in February was steady at 7.8%, which was in line with the consensus.
Last month, the ECB pushed back its tentative timetable for a first interest rate hike 10 years and flagged a fresh round of cheap funding for banks, concerned about slowing growth in the bloc."
1519,By Investing.com,"<span>Apr 01, 2019 04:40AM ET</span>",U.K. Manufacturing PMI Jumps Unexpectedly to 13-Month High on Brexit Stockpiling,"Investing.com - Activity in the U.K. manufacturing sector surged unexpectedly to a 13-month high last month as stockpiling ahead of Brexit hit a fresh survey record.
Research firm IHS Markit said its manufacturing purchasing managers’ index rose to 55.1 in March, surprising economists who had forecast a drop to 51.2. That was its strongest level in the last 13 months.
“Manufacturers reported a surge of business activity in March as companies stepped up their preparations for potential Brexit-related disruptions,” IHS Markit director Rob Dobson said.
The U.K. had been due to leave the EU on March 29, but the deadline was extended by two weeks to give the U.K. parliament more time to approve the Withdrawal Agreement negotiated by the two sides. However, the bill failed in the House of Commons for a third time on Friday, while no alternative has yet to get a majority in the House.
Dobson said that output, employment and new orders all rose at increased rates as manufacturers and their clients raced to build “safety stocks” ahead of the U.K.’s upcoming departure from the European Union and noted that stocking of finished goods and input inventories both surged to new survey-record highs.
Duncan Brock, group director at the Chartered Institute of Procurement & Supply that collaborates in the report, referred to the intensified activity as “panic-buying”.
“The big worry is if the threat of uncertainty recedes, businesses will have to resort to heavy discounting on these stocks to free-up valuable operating expenses if normal order levels are not restored in the coming months,” he warned."
1520,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 01, 2019 04:35AM ET</span>",Stockpiling frenzy drives UK factories ahead of Brexit: PMI,"By Andy Bruce
LONDON, (Reuters) - Factories in Britain stockpiled for Brexit at an explosive rate last month, unlike anything seen before in a major rich economy, pushing manufacturing growth to an unexpected 13-month high, a survey showed on Monday.
The IHS Markit/CIPS UK Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) rose to 55.1 from 52.1 in February, confounding all forecasts in a Reuters poll that had pointed to a reading of 51.0.
The headline figure far exceeded readings from the euro zone, where a global slowdown has left factories in a slump.
But British manufacturers are increasingly worried that their surge of activity, fueled by preparations to leave the European Union, will make way for a sharp decline later, survey compiler IHS Markit said.
Lawmakers rejected Prime Minister Theresa May's Brexit deal for a third time on Friday, leaving Britain's withdrawal from the EU in turmoil on the very day it was supposed to leave the bloc.
British politicians now have until April 12 to come up with an alternative, after which the country could leave the EU without a deal to ease its transition -- something most economists think will harm the economy.
That risk prompted British factories to ramp up stocks of parts and finished products at a record pace in March to ease any disruption to supply lines.
The PMI's gauge of stocks of factory purchases, which feeds into the headline index, rocketed to 66.2 from 59.9 in February, the highest seen in a Group of Seven rich country since IHS Markit's records started in 1992.
IHS Markit said this would limit future growth.
""The stock-building boost introduces a major headwind for demand, output and jobs growth moving forward,"" Rob Dobson, director at IHS Markit, said. ""Manufacturers are already reporting concerns that future trends could be constrained as inventory positions across the economy are unwound.""
Stockpiling is also likely to reduce manufacturers' operating profit, leaving less money for investment even in the event that Brexit goes smoothly from here. 
Factories stemmed two months of job cuts and there was a small rebound in export orders after they fell in February. Still, IHS Markit said there were signs that customers in the EU were starting to switch away from British suppliers.

""It looks as if the impact of Brexit preparations, and any missed opportunities and investments during this sustained period of uncertainty, will reverberate through the manufacturing sector for some time to come,"" Dobson said.

1521,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 01, 2019 03:10AM ET</span>",Germany's manufacturing recession worsens: PMI,"BERLIN, (Reuters) - A weakening global economy, risks linked to Britain's possible departure from the European Union without a deal and trade disputes pushed activity in Germany's manufacturing sector to contract at its fastest rate since July 2012, a survey showed on Monday.
Markit's Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) for manufacturing, which accounts for about a fifth of the economy, fell to an 80-month low reading of 44.1, down from 47.6 in February and lower than the flash reading of 44.7.
It was the third successive month that the index was below the 50.0 mark that separates growth from contraction.
""Both total new orders and export sales are now falling at rates not seen since the global financial crisis, with more and more firms reporting lower demand linked to Brexit, trade uncertainty, troubles in the automotive industry and generally softer global demand,"" said IHS Markit's Phil Smith.
New orders posted their steepest drop since April 2009.
Weakening exports have translated into a slowdown in Europe's biggest economy, which posted its lowest growth rate in five years last year.
The economy has been relying on consumption for growth. A robust labor market, rising wages and low interest rates have been supporting the consumption-driven cycle.
""Manufacturing output fell markedly and at the fastest rate since 2012, with the consumer goods sector joining intermediate and capital goods producers in contraction,"" said Smith.
He added: ""The sustained solid growth in employment prior to March had been the sector's one remaining bright spot, but the latest survey indicated a fall in jobs for the first time in three years amid reports from a number of firms that some temporary contracts weren't being renewed.""

1522,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 01, 2019 03:10AM ET</span>",Euro zone factory activity contracts faster in March: PMI,"By Jonathan Cable
LONDON, (Reuters) - Factories in the euro zone had their worst month for almost six years in March and forward looking indicators pointed to gloomy times ahead, a survey found, grim reading for European Central Bank policymakers.
IHS Markit's March final manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index declined for an eighth month, coming in at 47.5 from February's 49.3, just below a flash estimate and its lowest reading since April 2013.
An index measuring output change, which feeds into a composite PMI due on Wednesday - seen as a good gauge of economic health - sank to 47.2 from 49.4, its lowest since April 2013 and the second straight month it has come in below the 50 level dividing growth from contraction.
The disappointing results come after the ECB changed its outlook last month. It pushed back the timing of an interest rate rise until 2020 at the earliest and said it would offer banks a new round of cheap loans to help revive the economy.
A Reuters poll last month found the ECB may have missed its opportunity to raise interest rates before the next downturn. 
Friday's PMI suggested that downturn was already underway - new orders fell at their fastest rate in over six years, backlogs of work were run down at their fastest pace since late 2012 and factories curtailed purchases of raw materials as they stockpiled unsold products.
""Looking at the forward-looking indicators, downside risks have intensified, and the trend could clearly deteriorate further in the second quarter,"" said Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit.
Optimism about the coming year deteriorated sharply. The future output index dropped to 55.5 from February's 56.7, its lowest since December 2012, and so factories barely increased headcount last month.

1523,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 01, 2019 01:05AM ET</span>",Russian manufacturing sector boosted by domestic demand in March: PMI,"MOSCOW, (Reuters) - Russian manufacturing activity expanded March, boosted by higher output and new business growth as domestic demand substituted demand from abroad, the Markit purchasing managers' index (PMI) showed on Monday.
The index's headline reading rose to 52.8 from 50.1 in the previous month, above the 50.0 mark that separates expansion from contraction.
""Russian manufacturers signaled a significant uptick in domestic demand and production in March, indicating a solid end to the first quarter of 2019 following relatively lackluster growth in February,"" said Sian Jones, an economist at IHS Markit, which compiles the survey.
The increase in new orders was the strongest since early 2017 despite a drop in foreign client demand for the third month in a row.
The degree of optimism among firms that took part in the survey reached the highest level since data collection began in 2012, while employment across the sector rose for the second consecutive month, the monthly PMI report showed.
Inflation in the sector kept on rising following an increase in value-added tax (VAT) to 20 percent from 18 percent.

""The ongoing impact of the recent hike in VAT and higher supplier costs continued to push input prices up. In response, firms raised factory gate charges sharply,"" Jones said.

1524,By Investing.com,"<span>Mar 31, 2019 11:48PM ET</span>",Chinese Manufacturing Activity Unexpectedly Rebounds in March,"Investing.com - China’s manufacturing activity unexpectedly rebounded in March, the Caixin/Markit Manufacturing Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) showed.
The Caixin PMI came in at 50.8 for March, higher than the expected 49.9, snapping three straight months of declines.
Results of the private sector survey came after the National Bureau of Statistics reported on Sunday that the official Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) rose to 50.5 in March from February’s three-year low of 49.2. It was the first expansion in four months.
A reading below 50 signals contraction, while a reading above that level indicates expansion.
The upbeat surveys came as China and the U.S. are caught in an unresolved trade war. The two sides continue discussions this week as Chinese Vice Premier Liu He and his team head to Washington later this week, days after U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer travelled to Beijing.
Chinese stocks jumped more than 2% on Monday following the release of the data.
By 11:40 PM ET (03:40 GMT), the Shanghai Composite gained 2.3% while the SZSE Component surged 3.2%. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index rose 1.8%."
1525,By Bloomberg,"<span>Mar 31, 2019 10:50PM ET</span>",China Leads Asia's Factory Activity Towards Stabilization,"(Bloomberg) -- Sentiment at Asia’s factories stabilized in March as a rebound in China buoys the region.
Japan’s Nikkei and IHS Markit manufacturing purchasing managers’ index for March rose to 49.2 from 48.9 in February, helped by a lift in new orders. South Korea’s PMI rose to 48.8 from 47.2 in the previous month. Still, both readings remain below 50, signaling contraction.
China’s official PMI, released on Sunday, rebounded to 50.5 from 49.2 in the prior month -- the biggest increase since 2012. A separate private PMI gauge published by Caixin Media and IHS Markit on Monday rose to 50.8 from 49.9 in February.
That improvement is lifting the rest of Asia too, said Hak Bin Chua, an economist at Maybank Kim Eng Research Pte in Singapore, underpinned by optimism of a U.S.-China trade deal and plans by China’s government to boost lending and cut taxes to spur demand.
“The China stimulus measures at least stabilize manufacturing activity,” Chua said. “There are signs that the hopes about a trade deal may have revived some optimism that the worst is probably over. Depending on the outcome of the trade negotiations, a deal could help revive manufacturing in the second half, and exports.”
Southeast Asia, where each of the six biggest economies count China as their biggest trading partner, also saw a bit of relief in March after manufacturing sentiment was battered at the start of 2019.
Indonesia improved to 51.2 in March from 50.1, Thailand returned to positive territory at 50.3 from 49.9, and Vietnam’s PMI also rose. Malaysia and the Philippines edged lower.
Still, there were grounds for caution elsewhere. Sentiment among Japan’s large manufacturers tumbled by the most in six years. At the same time, South Korea’s exports fell for a fourth straight month in March with shipments down 8.2 percent from a year earlier.
For any pickup in manufacturing to be durable, much depends on how the ongoing trade negotiations between the U.S. and China play out. While both governments have said progress is being made, they have also cautioned that key sticking points remain.
“The wild card here is really the outcome of the China-U.S. negotiations,” Corrine Png, regional head of equities research for AIA Investment Management, said on Bloomberg Television. “Kicking the can down the road is expected because there are just too many sticking points.”

1527,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 31, 2019 10:19PM ET</span>",China manufacturing returns to growth in March: Caixin PMI,"BEIJING (Reuters) - China's manufacturing sector unexpectedly returned to growth for the first time in four months in March, in a sign that government stimulus measures may be slowly gaining traction, a private business survey showed on Monday.
But growth in new domestic and exports orders was marginal, suggesting the economy will remain under pressure in coming months and will likely require more policy support before it can convincingly stabilize.
The Caixin/Markit Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) expanded at the strongest pace in eight months in March, rising to 50.8 from 49.9 in February, above the neutral 50-mark dividing expansion from contraction on a monthly basis and the highest level seen since July 2018.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the reading for March would stay unchanged at 49.9. The surprise expansion seen in the Caixin survey echoed that seen in the official PMI released on Sunday, which also showed factory activity defying expectations for another contraction in March.
""With a more relaxed financing environment, government efforts to bail out the private sector and positive progress in Sino-U.S. trade talks, the situation across the manufacturing sector recovered in March,"" Zhengsheng Zhong, director of macroeconomic analysis at CEBM Group, said in a commentary accompanying the data release. 
China has made proposals in talks with the United States on a range of issues that go further than it has before, including on forced technology transfer, as the two sides work to overcome obstacles to a deal to end their protracted trade war, U.S. officials told Reuters on Wednesday.
But sources close to the talks have stressed that a deal is by no means certain, and tit-for-tat tariffs on both sides have remained in place.
Zhang noted the employment situation improved significantly in March, a trend that may ease some government and investor concerns after the unemployment rate in urban areas for February rose to the highest since early 2017.
Caixin's findings showed factories hired workers in March for the first time in over four years, arresting a relentless spell of job shedding since October 2013. Some firms were hiring to support higher production and new business development, the release said.
New orders -- an indicator of future activity -- increased for the second month running, though the pace of growth was marginal. Output also grew for the second straight month.
New export orders expanded after contracting in the previous month. Though the rate of increase was fractional, Caixin said the broad trend appeared to have steadied in the first quarter.
Chinese manufacturers also signaled an improvement in pricing power in March, which could ease pressure on profit margins. Output charges edged up into expansionary territory and outpaced growth in input prices, reflecting reduced pressure from raw material costs. 
""The producer price index might have risen faster year-on-year in March, and increased month-on-month, compared with a monthly decline in February,"" Zhong added.
Optimism among businesses edged up to a 10-month high partly on expectations that market conditions, both at home and abroad, will improve, the statement said. 
But purchasing activity declined for the third straight month, suggesting some firms remain cautious.
Economists at Nomura have forecast that China's industrial production growth will moderate again in April and May after a brief rebound in March mainly due to last year's low base.

SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea's exports contracted for a fourth month in March but at a slower rate in a sign of continued strain on the trade reliant economy, putting pressure on policymakers to shift to an easing stance to ward off growing external risks. 
Overseas sales slid 8.2 percent in annual terms, slightly outperforming a 8.7 percent decline tipped in a Reuters survey but extending the contraction that begin in December.
Imports shrank by 6.7 percent in March from a year earlier, worse than a 4.9 percent fall seen in the survey. This produced a $5.22 billion trade surplus, nearly doubling the amount in February, the Korea Customs Service data showed on Monday.
A continued slide in exports puts increasing pressure on policymakers to offer stimulus or shift to an easing stance as slowing global growth and the China-U.S. trade war slows Asia's fourth largest economy. 
""It would be difficult to see a significant improvement in exports, unless the sluggish semiconductor and China-bound exports are resolved,"" said Park Sang-hyun, an economist at Hi Investment and Securities.
The trade data comes on top of a recent batch of weak indicators, such as February factory output that shrank to a two-year low, piling pressure on manufacturers across auto and petrochemical industries.
Bank of Korea Governor Lee Ju-yeol said last week the central bank may change its current neutral stance on monetary policy should ""recovery sentiment"" worsen significantly. 
Analysts say the fall in exports was led by a slump in semiconductor business, the country's key export, as well as cooling demand from China, its biggest market, amid the trade war with the United States, a Reuters poll showed on Wednesday.
The trade ministry is due to release a breakdown of trade data later on Monday. 

Some of South Korea's biggest exporters, including Samsung Electronics (KS:005930) Co Ltd, have flagged concerns about earnings as chip prices fall and demand slows in China.

1529,By Bloomberg,"<span>Mar 31, 2019 09:20PM ET</span>",Australian Business Confidence Drops to Six-Year Low,"(Bloomberg) -- Australian business confidence fell to the lowest level in almost six years last month in another sign the economy is losing momentum.
The index level dropped to 0 in March from 2 the previous month, the weakest reading since July 2013, a National Australia Bank Ltd. report showed Monday. Confidence fell across most industries, while manufacturing was flat and mining increased, according to the survey conducted March 15-22.
“With forward indicators still looking weak, we will be watching closely over the next few months to assess whether conditions in the business sector weaken further,” said Alan Oster, chief economist at NAB.
The conditions index -- measuring hiring, sales and profits -- climbed to 7 from 4 in February, the survey showed. Conditions represent what businesses are currently experiencing in their operations, while confidence reflects what they expect going forward.
Australia’s economy slowed in the second half of last year as a property slump deepened, spooking households out of spending. The Reserve Bank has remained on the sidelines for the past 2-1/2 years, but is coming under intensifying pressure to resume interest-rate cuts. It will be closely watching the government’s budget Tuesday -- expected to include tax cuts and cash handouts -- to assess the stimulus to the economy.
While all of this has been occurring, hiring has remained robust and the jobless rate dropped to 4.9 percent. The NAB report showed a gauge of employment climbed to 7 in March from 5 in February.
“For now the survey suggests labor market conditions have remained healthy, but we are also watching this closely given it may well be a lagging indicator,” Oster said. “Our overall assessment is that activity likely remained weak in the first quarter of 2019.”"
1530,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 31, 2019 08:40PM ET</span>",Japan March factory output falls at fastest rate in nearly three years: PMI,"TOKYO (Reuters) - Japanese manufacturing activity contracted at a slower pace in March than the previous month, but output fell at the sharpest rate in nearly three years, a private business survey showed on Monday, reflecting weak demand at home and abroad.
The latest survey bolstered the view the Japanese economy, the world's third largest, is hitting a soft patch as the Sino-U.S. trade war dents global demand, dealing a blow to export-reliant Japan and its business and consumer confidence.
The final Markit/Nikkei Japan Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) was a seasonally adjusted 49.2, up a tad from February's final 48.9, which was also the flash reading for March.
The index was below the 50 threshold that separates contraction from expansion for the second consecutive month.
The survey suggests the worst quarterly performance in the manufacturing sector in January-March since the second quarter in 2016, as Japanese manufacturers face a ""fiercely challenging"" situation, said Joe Hayes, economist at IHS Markit, which compiles the survey.
""The likelihood of the negative trend in output being stymied any time soon appears slim, with demand for goods from both domestic and international sources waning further,"" he said.
""Asian goods producers face headwinds from slowing growth in Europe and China, while global trade risks are yet to be mitigated by a breakthrough in US-Sino relations.""
The output component of the final PMI index stood at 47.0, just above a preliminary 46.9 but still down from a final 47.4 in February to show the fastest contraction since May 2016.
New orders from both domestic and international clients fell at the fastest pace since June 2016, the final survey showed.
New export orders fell for a fourth straight month in March, though at a slower pace. The decline contributed to pushing the rate of job creation to the weakest since late 2016, it also showed.
The trade war between the world's two largest economies has also had a negative effect on Japan's domestic growth, as a slowing Chinese economy curbed demand for mobile phone parts and chip-making equipment from Japan.

Growing uncertainty over the economic outlook leaves room for Prime Minister Shinzo Abe to put off a national sales tax hike - to 10 percent from 8 percent - planned for October. But that would put much-needed fiscal reform on the backburner.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japanese big manufacturers' business confidence worsened to a two-year low in the March quarter, a central bank survey showed, underscoring concerns that Sino-U.S. trade tensions and softening global demand were taking a toll on the export-reliant economy.
Big non-manufacturers' business sentiment also soured to a two-year low, keeping pressure on the Bank of Japan to maintain or even ramp up its massive stimulus program.
The headline index for big manufacturers' sentiment stood at plus 12 in March, worse than plus 19 marked three months ago and a median market forecast of plus 14, the BOJ's closely-watched quarterly ""tankan"" survey showed on Monday.
The index hit the lowest level since March 2017 and fell at the fastest pace since December 2012, as manufacturers felt the pinch from slumping demand for electronics parts, automobiles and machinery goods, the survey showed.
The index for non-manufacturers fell to plus 21 from plus 24 in the December survey, hitting the lowest level since March 2017 and undershooting a market forecast of plus 22.
Both big manufacturers and non-manufacturers expect business conditions to worsen further in the three months ahead, the survey showed, adding to recent growing woes for the world's third-largest economy.
The survey is among various data the BOJ will examine at its two-day rate review later this month, when it issues fresh quarterly economic growth and inflation projections.

The AIB manufacturing purchasing managers' index stood at 53.9 in March versus 54.0 in February, extending the run of consecutive monthly growth to almost six years.
The reading also remained above the more than two-year low the survey fell back to in January and well ahead of the flash March reading for the euro zone as a whole, which sank to a near six-year low of 47.6.
While Ireland's fast growing economy has weathered the uncertainty created by its near neighbor's decision to leave the European Union in 2016, February's survey showed that manufacturers were ramping up their preparations as Brexit approached by adding to their pre-production inventories.
The sub index measuring stocks of purchases rose further to 56.4 in March from 55.6 in February, another fresh high in the 21-year history of the survey as its authors pointed to anecdotal evidence from panelists that they had brought forward stock purchases to secure supplies in the event of disruption.
That all but made up for the dip in the level of output growth last month, although new business from abroad also increased at the fastest pace in four months, amid some reports of greater demand from UK firms.
""Overall, the continued strength of the Irish Manufacturing PMI is very notable given the loss of momentum in the sector globally in recent months, especially in Europe,"" AIB Chief Economist Oliver Mangan said.
""It augurs well for the growth prospects of the Irish economy this year.""

1533,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 30, 2019 11:51PM ET</span>","China March factory activity grows for first time in four months, but exports weak","By Yawen Chen and Ryan Woo
BEIJING (Reuters) - Factory activity in China unexpectedly grew for the first time in four months in March, an official survey showed on Sunday, suggesting government stimulus measures may be starting to take hold.
If sustained, the improvement in business conditions could suggest the ailing manufacturing sector is on a path to recovery, easing fears that China could slip into a sharper economic downturn.
But many analysts remained cautious on the growth outlook, citing seasonal distortions caused by the long lunar New Year break in February. They argue that real investment and consumer demand remained soft and pushed up inventories at a sharper rate, potentially adding pressure to the sector.
The official Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) rose to 50.5 in March from February's three-year low of 49.2, marking the first expansion in four months, according to data released by the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) on Sunday. The 50-mark separates growth from contraction on a monthly basis.
Analysts surveyed by Reuters had forecast the manufacturing gauge would pick up slightly to 49.5, as factories ramped up production after the Lunar New Year holidays and rebuilt inventories ahead of a seasonal pickup in activity in spring. 
Factory output grew at its fastest pace in six months in March, reversing a brief contraction in the previous month. It rose to 52.7 from February's 49.5, the highest level seen since September 2018. 
Total new orders also grew at a quicker pace, driving up factory-gate prices to a five-month high of 51.4, ending four months of contraction. 
""The jump will likely give a big boost to stock markets and could delay a cut in the reserve requirement ratio (RRR),"" said Ting Lu, chief China economist at Nomura. 
China has announced five RRR cuts in the past year to free up more cash for banks to boost lending to private firms, and further cuts are widely expected.
Ting said there is limited room for manufacturing PMI to rise further and the chance for another dip is ""not small"".
""Overall, although the manufacturing PMI in March can somewhat alleviate the pessimistic expectations of the economy, we believe that the actual situation may not be so optimistic as reflected in this indicator,"" Lianxun Securities said in a note.
Export orders shrank for the 10th straight month, suggesting external demand remained sluggish and further policy cushion may be needed if trade tensions escalate. China's trade-oriented neighbors Japan, South Korea and Taiwan have seen more signs of slackening demand, both in China and elsewhere.
""Construction work starting at the beginning of the year has led to strong domestic demand, but external demand is still weak, and the outlook on imports and exports is still not optimistic,"" economists at Huatai Securities said.
Tit-for-tat tariffs imposed by Washington and Beijing remain in place as talks continue to end a trade war that has disrupted the flow of billions of dollars of goods between the world's two largest economies. It's unclear if a deal acceptable to both sides can be done.
U.S. President Donald Trump said on Friday that talks with China were going very well, but added he would not accept anything less than a ""great deal"" after top trade officials wrapped up two days of discussions in Beijing.
China's Vice Premier Liu He will head to Washington on April 3 for more talks. 
SPECTER OF LAYOFFS
Chinese factories shed more staff in March, with the employment sub-index edging up to 47.6 from 47.5 in February.
Amid rising labor costs and weaker sales, a growing number of foreign companies from car makers to electronics manufacturers have decided to shut plants in China in recent months, raising the specter of more layoffs. The jobless rate in February rose to 5.3 percent, nearing a two-year high.
Sony Corp (T:6758) is closing its Beijing smartphone plant and production will stop by the end of the month, while Samsung Electronics (KS:005930) ceased operations at one of its mobile phone manufacturing plants in China last year.
The PMI survey showed small and mid-sized manufacturers still fared worse than large companies, many state-controlled, although their activity improved from the previous month, suggesting that policymakers' efforts to channel affordable financing to the private sector are gradually working.
Policymakers have acknowledged the economy is under pressure. Multi-year campaigns to curb debt risks and pollution have deterred fresh investment, while the U.S.-China trade war is hurting China's export sector, threatening even more jobs.
In response, Beijing plans more spending on roads, railways and ports, along with nearly 2 trillion yuan ($297.27 billion) in tax cuts to ease the pressure on corporate balance sheets.
The measures will take time to kick in, say analysts who believe economic activity may not stabilize until the middle of the year. Data on Wednesday showed industrial profits fell 14 percent, the sharpest drop since at least late 2011.
Growth in China's services industry - accounting for over half of the economy - picked up in March as new orders rose more quickly. The official non-manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) rose to 54.8 from 54.3.
Construction activity swung back into high gear in March with the return of warm weather. A sub-reading for construction activity stood at 61.7 in March, up from 59.2 in February.

The official non-manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) rose to 54.8 in March from 54.3 in February, well above the 50-point mark that separates growth from contraction.
The fast-growing services sector accounts for more than half of China's economy and has helped buffer the impact of slowing manufacturing. But it softened late last year amid a cooling property market and faltering consumer demand for products from cars to mobile phones.

1535,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 29, 2019 12:55PM ET</span>","U.S. consumer spending soft, inflation benign as economy slows","By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. consumer spending barely rose in January and income increased modestly in February, suggesting the economy was fast losing momentum after growth slowed in the fourth quarter.
The report from the Commerce Department on Friday also showed price pressures muted in January, with a measure of overall inflation posting its smallest annual increase in nearly 2-1/2 years. The Federal Reserve last week brought its three-year campaign to tighten monetary policy to an abrupt end. 
The U.S. central bank abandoned projections for any interest rate hikes this year after increasing borrowing costs four times in 2018, in a nod to the slowing economy, low inflation and rising headwinds to growth. The economy is losing steam as the stimulus from $1.5 trillion in tax cuts as well as increased government spending dissipates.
""Unless some positive shock hits the economy, by the fall, we are likely to be back to where we were before the tax cut bill was passed,"" said Joel Naroff, chief economist at Naroff Economic Advisors in Holland, Pennsylvania.  
Consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, edged up 0.1 percent as households cut back on purchases of motor vehicles. Spending fell 0.6 percent in December.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast consumer spending increasing 0.3 percent in January. The release of the January consumer spending figures was delayed by a five-week partial shutdown of the federal government that ended on Jan. 25.
When adjusted for inflation, consumer spending gained 0.1 percent in January after dropping 0.6 percent in December.
The dollar slipped against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices fell, while stocks on Wall Street rose. 
WEAK DATA STREAM
The weak consumer spending report extended the run of soft data ranging from housing starts to manufacturing that have flagged a sharp slowdown in growth early in the first quarter. The economy's outlook is also being overshadowed by slowing global growth, Washington's trade war with China and uncertainty over Britain's departure from the European Union. 
Gross domestic product forecasts for the first quarter are as low as a 0.9 percent annualized rate. The economy grew at a 2.2 percent pace in the fourth quarter after expanding at a brisk 3.4 percent rate in the July-September period.
But the Fed's decision to shelve further monetary policy tightening could prop up the interest-rate-sensitive housing market. A second report on Friday from the Commerce Department showed new home sales rose 4.9 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 667,000 units in February, the highest level since March 2018.
The housing market, however, accounts for a small fraction of the economy. A recovery in the sector, which hit a soft patch last year, will probably not be enough to blunt the impact on growth from slowing consumer spending and manufacturing.
A third report from the University of Michigan showed a rise in consumer sentiment in March. Economists, however, did not expect this to translate into stronger consumer spending as other confidence measures softened during the month.
""Spending will downshift to the slowest pace in a year in the first quarter,"" said Sal Guatieri, a senior economist at BMO Capital Markets in Toronto.
In January, spending on goods fell 0.2 percent after dropping 2.4 percent in December. It was the second straight monthly decline in spending on goods and reflected a decrease in motor vehicle purchases.
Outlays on services rose 0.2 percent as consumers paid more for financial services and insurance, after increasing 0.3 percent in December.
With demand softening, inflation pressures were tame in January. The personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index fell 0.1 percent, reversing December's 0.1 percent gain. 
In the 12 month through January, the PCE price index rose 1.4 percent, the smallest rise since September 2016 after increasing 1.8 percent in December. 
Excluding the volatile food and energy components, the PCE price index ticked up 0.1 percent in January after rising 0.2 percent in the prior month. That lowered the year-on-year increase in the so-called core PCE price index to 1.8 percent from 2.0 percent in December.
The core PCE index is the Fed's preferred inflation measure. It hit the U.S. central bank's 2 percent inflation target in March last year for the first time since April 2012.
In February, personal income increased 0.2 percent after dipping 0.1 percent in January. Incomes have been volatile in recent months because of one-off factors, including government payments to farmers caught in the U.S.-China trade war.
Wages rose 0.3 percent in February, matching January's gain. Savings decreased to $1.19 trillion last month from $1.22 trillion in January.

The Commerce Department said on Friday that new home sales rose 4.9% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 667,000 units last month from a revised 636,000 in January.
Economists had forecast new home sales hitting a pace 620,000 units last month. New home sales, which are drawn from permits, are volatile from month to month.
The housing sector has shown mixed signals and volatility in recent months. Housing starts tumbled in February after a surge at the beginning of the year, while homebuilders’ sentiment held steady in March after having hit a three-year low at the start of 2019.
Pending homes sales unexpectedly declined in February, also following a surge in January.
Analysts expect the recent promise from the Federal Reserve to be patient with rate hikes will put a cap on mortgage rates, coupled with a solid labor market and increasing incomes to improve affordability for would-be homebuyers.
""The expectation is no change at all in the current monetary policy, which will help mortgage rates stay at attractive levels,"" Larry Yun, chief economist at the National Association of Realtors, said."

The Commerce Department said on Friday new home sales rose 4.9 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 667,000 units last month, the highest level since March 2018. January's sales pace was revised up to 636,000 units from the previously reported 607,000 units.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast new home sales, which account for about 11 percent of housing market sales, increasing 1.3 percent to a pace of 620,000 units in February.
New home sales are drawn from permits and tend to be volatile on a month-to-month basis. They rose 0.6 percent from a year ago. New home sales tend to respond more quickly to changes in mortgage rates.
The 30-year fixed mortgage rate tumbled to a more than one-year low of 4.06 percent last week from an average of 4.28 percent in the previous week, according to data from mortgage finance agency Freddie Mac. 
Mortgage rates have been declining since the Federal Reserve signaled a long pause in interest rates increases this year. Lower borrowing costs, slowing house price inflation and rising wages have improved housing affordability. 
But expensive lumber as well as land and labor shortages remain a challenge for builders. Investment in homebuilding contracted 0.3 percent in 2018, the biggest drop since 2010.
New home sales in the South, which accounts for the bulk of transactions, rose 1.8 percent in February to their highest level since July 2007. Sales surged 26.9 percent in the Northeast and jumped 28.3 percent in the Midwest. They were, however, unchanged in the West.
The median new house price fell 3.6 percent to $315,300 in February from a year ago. There were 340,000 new homes on the market last month, down 0.6 percent from January. 
At February's sales pace it would take 6.1 months to clear the supply of houses on the market, down from 6.5 months in January. Just under two-thirds of the houses sold last month were either under construction or yet to be built.

1541,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 29, 2019 08:20AM ET</span>","UK's payments gap widens as global slowdown, Brexit weigh","By Andy Bruce and Jonathan Cable
LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's balance of payments shortfall grew in the last few months of 2018, exacerbated by disappointing trade numbers as the world economy slowed and Brexit neared.
The difference between money flowing in and out of Britain was negative to the tune of 23.7 billion pounds ($30.9 billion)in the fourth quarter, bigger than a 23.0 billion-pound deficit in the third quarter, the Office for National Statistics said.
Bank of England Governor Mark Carney has said the big current account deficit leaves Britain reliant on ""the kindness of strangers"".
That could be a risk as the country prepares to leave the European Union still with no clarity on whether it can smooth its exit with a transition period. 
At 4.4 percent of economic output, the shortfall in late 2018 was the biggest since just after the Brexit vote more than two years earlier, dashing hopes that the fall in the value of the pound after the referendum could boost Britain's economy. 
Prime Minister Theresa May said on Wednesday she would step down after her Brexit divorce deal is secured. But it remains unclear if the deal she agreed with other EU leaders can pass parliament and lawmakers have so far rejected alternatives.
The balance of payments not only includes trade of goods and services, but also the money flowing in and out of the country in the form of investments. 
The larger current account deficit was due to weaker earnings for British investors from overseas holdings, and a deteriorating trade deficit, which widened for the fourth quarter in a row, the ONS said on Friday.
Both drivers of the deficit probably reflected a marked slowdown in the world economy over the last couple of quarters.
""An elevated shortfall is a potential source of vulnerability for the UK economy -- particularly if there was any major loss of investor confidence in the UK for any reason, most obviously Brexit concerns,"" economist Howard Archer, from the EY ITEM Club Consultancy, said.
SLOW BUT GROWING ECONOMY
Britain's economy has slowed since the 2016 Brexit referendum and lost more of its momentum late last year as the departure from the EU approached.
For 2018 as a whole, the ONS confirmed the economy grew by 1.4 percent, the weakest expansion for any year since 2012.
Companies in particular have shown nervousness about the lack of clarity.
The ONS data showed business investment fell by 0.9 percent in the fourth quarter, a shallower drop than a previous estimate of a 1.4 percent fall but still the fourth quarter in a row to show a contraction. 
That was the worst such run since the financial crisis a decade ago.
Consumers appear to be less fazed.
Data from the Bank of England showed household spending stayed subdued but still growing in early 2019.
Mortgage lender Nationwide said house prices picked up a little bit of speed this month but the market remained weak. 
The ONS confirmed a previous estimate that Britain's economy grew by a quarterly 0.2 percent in the October-December period. 

Growth was driven by spending by the government and households although the latter grew at the weakest quarterly pace in a year, up just 0.3 percent.

The annual growth rate in unsecured consumer lending slowed to 6.3 percent from 6.5 percent in January, its weakest rise since September 2014, the BoE figures showed.
British consumers reined in their spending in late 2018 and have remained in a cautious mood in early 2019, faced with the possibility of the country leaving the European Union without a deal to smooth the economic shock.
However, there were some signs that consumers are not reining in their spending sharply.
Figures for unsecured lending in February alone showed a 1.145 billion-pound increase, higher than economists' forecasts of a rise of 900 million pounds.
The BoE said the number of mortgages approved for house purchase fell to 64,337 in February from 66,696 in January, compared with a median forecast of 65,000 in a Reuters poll of economists.
Britain's housing market has weakened in the run-up to Brexit with price growth at around five-year lows.
Earlier on Friday, lender Nationwide said house prices rose by an annual 0.7 percent in the 12 months to March. While picking up slightly from a month earlier, it compared with increases of about 5 percent a year at the time of the Brexit referendum in 2016.
The BoE data showed net mortgage lending, which tends to lag behind approvals, at 3.457 billion pounds in February, down from 3.587 billion pounds in January. Economists taking part in the Reuters poll had expected a rise to 3.7 billion pounds.
Net credit card lending rose to 442 million pounds, picking up from 384 million pounds in January.

That was an upward revision from the preliminary estimate of 1.3% which had been the weakest growth since the second quarter of 2012. On a quarterly basis, Britain registered meager growth of 0.2%, which was also in line with expectations for no change from the preliminary reading.
Ongoing political turmoil regarding Brexit negotiations continues to hamper confidence in British economic growth. In its last policy statement, the Bank of England emphasized that “the economic outlook will continue to depend significantly on the nature and timing of EU withdrawal, in particular: the new trading arrangements between the European Union and the United Kingdom; whether the transition to them is abrupt or smooth; and how households, businesses and financial markets respond.""
Brexit uncertainty has kept the BoE on hold since August 2018 as policymakers wait to see the final outcome and its impact on the economy. Despite the weak fourth-quarter reading, price pressures may not be far below the surface, given that earnings are rising at their fastest pace in 10 years. 
Economists broadly agree with the BoE that improvement in growth depends on achieving an orderly Brexit, which could help the economy pick up in the second half of this year."

Domestic demand is expected to be the sole driver of growth this year in Germany, traditionally an export-driven economy, as exporters face a global slowdown, trade disputes and uncertainty related to Britain's expected departure from the European Union.
Data from the Labour Office showed the unemployment rate dropped to 4.9 percent in March from 5.0 percent, hitting the lowest since German reunification in 1990.
The number of people out of work decreased by 7,000 to 2.231 million, seasonally-adjusted data showed. That compared with the forecast for a drop of 10,000.
Separate data from the Federal Statistics Office showed retail sales - a volatile indicator often subject to revision - rose by 0.9 percent on the month in February, confounding expectations for a drop of 0.9 percent. They increased by 4.7 percent on the year.
Record-high employment, hefty pay hikes, moderate inflation and low borrowing costs have been encouraging Germans to splash their cash.
But a GfK survey earlier this week dampened spirits by showing consumer morale deteriorated unexpectedly heading into April, with propensity to buy dropping to its lowest level in more than two years.
The economy narrowly avoided a recession last year and the Ifo institute earlier this month slashed its 2019 growth forecast for the German economy to 0.6 percent from 1.1 percent due to weaker foreign demand for industrial goods and increased headwinds for exporters.

The Economy Ministry has said the economy had a subdued start to 2019 and probably grew only moderately in the first quarter.

BEIJING (Reuters) - Home prices in China are expected to rise more this year than predicted just a few months ago, as Beijing urges banks to ramp up lending and lower interest rates to boost the slowing economy, a Reuters poll showed. 
Strong underlying demand for housing and the relaxation of home purchase restrictions in some cities are also likely to support prices, even though sales are still expected to slow.
China's average residential property prices are forecast to rise 5 percent in 2019 from a year earlier, up sharply from a gain of just 0.5 percent expected in the previous survey in December, according to the poll of 17 property analysts and economists.
Property investment is now expected to rise by 7 percent for the year, from 4 percent in the last poll, as some developers have shown more confidence in the market as domestic financing conditions improve.
Resilience in the property market would provide some cushion for the economy as Beijing works to revive the ailing manufacturing sector and restore flagging consumer confidence.
New home prices in China grew at their slowest pace in 10 months in February in a sign of slackening demand as the economy cools further. But prices have risen for 46 straight months, and year-on-year growth was a solid 10.4 percent. 
In a bid to boost economic activity, some local governments have tacitly loosened restrictions on home purchases introduced in recent years to deter speculation, which is reviving talk of potential property bubbles. But the country's biggest cities are widely expected to keep curbs in place unless the economy sharply deteriorates, which analysts do not expect. 
""It is expected that the marginal relaxation of local policies will begin to take effect in the second half of 2019, which will form a certain support for demand and price,"" said Daniel Yao, head of research for China at JLL, a commercial property services provider.
Betty Wang, senior China economist with ANZ bank, expects more regional policy adjustments.
""Reducing mortgage rates, withdrawing previous controls over home purchases and loosening requirements for provident-backed mortgage could be possible steps,"" she said.
Few analysts believe there is a risk of major price declines due to tight government control over the market. Still, housing sales are expected to fall 5 percent in 2019, in line with the previous poll. 
""This is a centrally managed market no matter how diverse it is. Also, overall there is large demand for (better) housing,"" said David Ji, Head of Research & Consultancy, Greater China for Knight Frank.
The biggest risks facing the sector this year include lower government spending on its massive slum redevelopment programme, financing issues facing property developers and a chilling effect on confidence if the Sino-U.S. trade war drags on, the poll showed.
None of the analysts polled expected a property tax to be implemented this year, given the complex approval process and the still significant downward pressure on the economy.
Earlier this month, policymakers told parliament that work on a draft property tax is ""steadily advancing"".
Asked to rate the affordability of Chinese housing on a scale, with 1 being the cheapest and 10 the most expensive, analysts' median answer was 7, up from 6 in the last poll.

House prices were rising by about 5 percent a year at the time of the Brexit referendum in 2016, according to Nationwide.
In monthly terms, prices rose by 0.2 percent after falling by 0.1 percent in February.
Economists in a Reuters poll had expected prices to rise by an annual 0.6 percent and to be flat on the month.
Last week, official data, covering more transactions than other surveys, showed prices in January rose by an annual 1.7 percent, the smallest increase since 2013, when Britain was trying to shake off the effects of the global financial crisis.
Nationwide said London was the weakest performing region in the United Kingdom in the first quarter of 2019 with prices falling by an annual 3.8 percent, the biggest drop since 2009.
It was the seventh consecutive quarter to show falling prices in the capital.
Nationwide said factors behind the fall in London included unaffordable prices for many buyers and tax changes affecting the buy-to-let market. 
Howard Archer, an economist with EY Item Club, a forecasting firm, said a prolonged Brexit delay could lead to house prices stagnating or falling slightly in 2019.

The National Association of Realtors said its pending home sales index, which measures signed contracts for homes where transactions have not yet closed, fell 1.0% to a reading of 101.9.
That was compared to a gain of 4.3% in January.
Economists had forecast pending home sales rising 0.1% last month.
NAR chief economist Larry Yun downplayed the reading, saying that the 1% drop after the surge in January was “not a sign of concern”.
""As a whole, these numbers indicate that a cyclical low in sales is in the past, but activity is not matching the frenzied pace of last spring,” he added.
Housing data has been painting a volatile mixed picture in recent months, with housing starts tumbling in February after a surge at the beginning of the year.
Yet sentiment among U.S. homebuilders held steady in March, sustaining a rebound from a three-year low on improvement in sales and a brighter outlook for the next six months, according to a survey by the National Association of Home Builders released last week.
Analysts expect the recent promise from the Federal Reserve to be patient with rate hikes will put a cap on mortgage rates, coupled with a solid labor market and increasing incomes to improve affordability for would-be homebuyers.
""The expectation is no change at all in the current monetary policy, which will help mortgage rates stay at attractive levels,"" Yun said."
1552,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 28, 2019 08:45AM ET</span>",U.S. weekly jobless claims unexpectedly fall,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The number of Americans filing applications for unemployment benefits unexpectedly fell last week, suggesting labor market conditions remained solid, despite slowing job growth. 
Initial claims for state unemployment benefits dropped 5,000 to a seasonally adjusted 211,000 for the week ended March 23, the Labor Department said on Thursday. Data for the prior week was revised to show 5,000 fewer applications received than previously reported.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast claims rising to 225,000 in the latest week. The Labor Department said no states were estimated. The government revised the claims data and the so-called seasonal factors from 2014 through 2018. It also updated the seasonal factor for 2019. 
The four-week moving average of initial claims, considered a better measure of labor market trends as it irons out week-to-week volatility, fell 3,250 to 217,250 last week.
Job growth has slowed after last year's robust gain. The pace, however, remains more than enough to keep up with growth in the working age population. The unemployment rate is currently at 3.8 percent. The moderation in job growth also reflecting a shortage of workers and softening economic growth as the stimulus from a $1.5 trillion tax cut package fades.
Thursday's claims report showed the number of people receiving benefits after an initial week of aid rose 13,000 to 1.76 million for the week ended March 16. The four-week moving average of the so-called continuing claims fell 4,250 to 1.75 million.

The continuing claims data covered the survey week for March's unemployment rate. The four-week average of continuing claims rose slightly between the February and March survey periods, suggesting little change in the unemployment rate.

1553,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 28, 2019 08:40AM ET</span>",U.S. fourth-quarter GDP revised down; profits weak,"WASHINGTON, (Reuters) - - The U.S. economy slowed more than initially thought in the fourth quarter, keeping growth in 2018 below the Trump administration's 3 percent annual target, and corporate profits failed to rise for the first time in more than two years.
Gross domestic product increased at a 2.2 percent annualized rate, the Commerce Department said on Thursday in its third reading of fourth-quarter GDP growth. That was down from the 2.6 percent pace estimated in February.
The economy grew at a 3.4 percent pace in the third quarter. The expansion will be the longest on record in July. 
The revisions to the fourth-quarter GDP reading reflected markdowns to consumer and business spending, as well as government outlays and investment in homebuilding.
For all of 2018, the economy grew 2.9 percent as previously reported, despite the White House's fiscal stimulus of $1.5 trillion in tax cuts and more government spending. Growth last year was the strongest since 2015 and was an acceleration from the 2.2 percent logged in 2017.
Compared to the fourth quarter of 2017, the economy expanded 3.0 percent, revised down from the 3.1 percent reported last month. President Donald Trump has highlighted the year-on-year growth figure as proof that fiscal stimulus, which has contributed to a swelling of the federal government deficit, has put the economy on a sustainable path of strong growth.
Trump likes to showcase the economy as one of the biggest achievements of his term, declaring last July that his administration had ""accomplished an economic turnaround of historic proportions."" On the campaign trail, Trump boasted he could boost annual GDP growth to 4 percent, a goal analysts always said was unrealistic given low productivity, among other factors.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast GDP in the fourth quarter being revised down to a 2.4 percent. 
There are signs the slowdown in growth persisted early in the first quarter, with retail sales rising modestly and manufacturing production and homebuilding tepid. 
That was underscored by weak profits in the fourth quarter. After tax corporate profits were unchanged for the first time since the third quarter of 2016, after growing at a 3.5 percent rate in the third quarter. A profit measure that corresponds to S&P 500 profits fell $34.2 billion in the fourth quarter.
The economy is facing headwinds from the fading stimulus, slowing global growth, Washington's trade war with China and uncertainty over Britain's departure from the European Union.
These contributed to the Federal Reserve's decision last week to bring its three-year campaign to tighten monetary policy to an abrupt end. The U.S. central bank abandoned projections for any interest rate hikes this year after increasing borrowing costs four times in 2018. 
Growth in consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, increased at a 2.5 percent rate in the fourth quarter instead of the previously reported 2.8 percent pace. Consumer spending remains underpinned by a strong labor market.
Growth in business spending on equipment was revised down to a 6.6 percent pace from a 6.7 percent rate. Investment in intellectual products was lowered to a 10.7 percent rate from the 13.1 percent pace reported in February.
Investment in residential construction was revised to show it contracting at 4.7 percent rate instead of at a 3.5 percent rate, marking the fourth straight quarterly decline. 
Government investment fell at a 0.4 percent rate, instead of growing at a 0.4 percent pace as previously reported.
But exports were revised up to show them rising at a 1.8 percent pace instead of the 1.6 percent rate reported last month. Imports were revised down, leading to a smaller trade deficit that cut one-tenth of a percentage point from fourth-quarter GDP growth. 
The trade deficit was previously estimated to have subtracted 0.22 percentage point from output. Inventories increased at a $96.8 billion rate in the fourth quarter instead of the $97.1 billion reported last month. 

Inventory investment added one-tenth of percentage point to GDP growth last quarter as estimated last in February.

1554,By Investing.com,"<span>Mar 28, 2019 08:36AM ET</span>",U.S. Q4 GDP Growth Revised Down as Economy Loses Steam,"Investing.com - The U.S. economy grew less than thought in the fourth quarter, according to data published on Thursday that underlined the ongoing slowdown that has extended into 2019.
The third estimate of fourth-quarter gross domestic product (GDP) showed that the economy grew at an annual rate of 2.2%, downwardly revised from a preliminary estimate of 2.6%, and a sharp slowdown from the 3.4% reported in the third quarter of last year.
Economists had expected growth of 2.4%.
U.S. futures turned negative after the release, falling about 0.1% across the board. The U.S. dollar briefly pared gains against major rivals, but quickly returned to levels seen just prior to the report.
Looking forward, economists widely expect growth to slow further in 2019 as the stimulus from a $1.5 trillion tax cut package and increased government spending fades. A trade war between the U.S. and China, softening global growth and uncertainty over Britain's exit from the European Union are clouding the outlook.
Joseph Brusuelas, chief economist at accountancy firm RSM US LLP, pointed to the softer dynamic in consumption and gross private investment, along with the downward revisions to real final sales and gross domestic income.
“All reflect slowing in overall economic activity in December which spilled over into current quarter,” Brusuelas said.
Official forecasts indicate there is worse to come in the short term. The latest forecasts from the Atlanta and New York Federal Reserve Banks show that they expect first-quarter growth to slow further to around 1.2%.
The Federal Reserve cut its forecast for growth in 2019 at its policy meeting earlier in March. It now expects GDP to grow 2.1%, rather than the 2.3% it expected in December. 
After that meeting, Fed chair Jerome Powell insisted that “underlying economic fundamentals are still very strong,” pointing to the labor market, rising incomes, low unemployment, and strong business and household confidence."

Economists had expected weekly jobless claims to rise by 4,000 to 220,000 from the previous week’s downwardly revised total of 216,000.
The four-week moving average was 217,250, a decline of 3,250 from the previous week. The monthly average is seen as a more accurate gauge of labor trends because it reduces volatility in the week-to-week data.
Continuing jobless claims rose to 1.756 million from 1.743 million in the preceding week, compared to expectations for an increase to 1.750 million.

Corporate lending expanded by 3.7 percent in February, picking up from 3.4 percent in January, even if the reading remains well short of its post-crisis peak of 4.3 percent hit in September.
With growth slowing on weak export demand for manufactured goods, the ECB has already reversed course, putting plans to normalize policy on hold, announcing instead further stimulus measures to aid a still limping economy. 
Fearing that banks will shut the flow of credit to firms amid a slowdown, the ECB unveiled plans to give lenders a new line of ultra cheap loans with the ultimate aim of getting cash to firms so they will continue to invest. 
Credit growth to households meanwhile rose to 3.3 percent in February from 3.2 percent a month earlier, suggesting that the slowdown has yet to significantly dent consumer confidence.
The annual growth rate of the M3 measure of money supply, which often foreshadows future activity, surged to 4.3 percent from 3.8 percent a month earlier and beating expectations for 3.9 percent.

1557,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 28, 2019 03:55AM ET</span>",China March factory activity seen contracting for fourth month,"BEIJING (Reuters) - Factory activity in China likely contracted for a fourth straight month in March, a Reuters poll showed, suggesting the economy is still losing steam and adding to worries about faltering global growth.
A downbeat reading, coming on the heels of the sharpest fall in industrial profits in at least 7 years, would underline the need for more stimulus as Beijing struggles to right the economy and end a bruising trade war with the United States.
The official Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) is forecast at 49.5, up slightly from February's 49.2 but still below the 50 level separating expansion from contraction on a monthly basis, according to the median forecast of 24 economists.
Seasonal factors likely drove the uptick in the factory gauge in March as factories ramped up activity after long Lunar New Year holidays in February, analysts said. Some steel mills have also started increasing output as winter smog restrictions end.
While weakness in the headline reading is widely expected, investors and policymakers are likely to focus on whether there is any improvement in domestic orders in response to a series of growth boosting measures in recent months.
Regulators have fast tracked billions of dollars in infrastructure investment, but construction is only beginning to pick up with the return of warmer weather.
Export orders are likely to remain weak, as China's trade-oriented neighbors Japan, South Korea and Taiwan have all seen further signs of slackening demand, both in China and elsewhere.
Tit-for-tat tariffs imposed by Washington and Beijing remain in place as they continue negotiations. But eight months into the trade war that has disrupted the flow of billions of dollars of goods between the world's two largest economies, it is unclear if a deal acceptable to both sides can be done.
U.S. officials told Reuters on Wednesday that the United States and China have made progress in all areas under discussion in trade talks, with unprecedented movement on the touchy issue of forced technology transfers.
MORE SUPPORT MEASURES EXPECTED
Much of the data China reported for the first two months of the year pointed to a further weakening in the economy, though officials have largely attributed the declines to distortions created by the long holidays.
Growth in China's industrial output slumped to a 17-year low in January-February from a year earlier, while investment in the manufacturing sector cooled. Data on Wednesday showed industrial profits fell 14 percent, the sharpest drop since late 2011.
But Premier Li Keqiang said on Thursday that earlier policy support measures were gaining traction, while adding that China will cut real interest rate levels and lower financing costs for Chinese companies. He did not elaborate on which interest rate he was referring to.
Earlier this month, Li announced more spending on roads, railways and ports, along with tax cuts of nearly 2 trillion yuan ($297.27 billion) to relieve pressure on strained corporate balance sheets and limit job losses.
Still, both analysts and officials have noted the measures will take some time to be felt.
Beijing is targeting economic growth of 6.0-6.5 percent this year. Actual growth cooled to 6.6 percent last year - the slowest in 28 years.
A private business survey - the Caixin/Markit Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' index (PMI) - which focuses more on small and medium-sized Chinese firms - is expected to show a milder contraction. 
The Caixin PMI is forecast to remain at 49.9 for a second month, only marginally below the neutral mark. The private survey is believed to cover smaller, private firms, which have been a key focal point for Beijing's business support efforts. 

The official PMI survey is due out ‪on March 31, along with a sister survey on services. The Caixin manufacturing PMI will come out ‪on April 1 and its services PMI ‪on April 3.

1559,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 27, 2019 12:40PM ET</span>",U.S. current account deficit hits 10-year high; firms bring back more foreign profits,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. current account deficit increased more than expected in the fourth quarter amid declining exports, pushing the overall shortfall in 2018 to its highest level in 10 years, and U.S. companies repatriated a record amount of foreign earnings last year following the Republican tax overhaul.
The Commerce Department said on Wednesday the current account deficit, which measures the flow of goods, services and investments into and out of the country, rose 6.1 percent to $134.4 billion. The quarterly current account gap was the largest since the fourth quarter of 2008.
Data for the third quarter was revised to show the deficit rising to $126.6 billion from the previously reported $124.8 billion. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the current account deficit rising to $130.0 billion in the fourth quarter.
The current account gap represented 2.6 percent of gross domestic product in the fourth quarter, the largest share since the second quarter of 2012. It was up from 2.5 percent in the July-September period.
The deficit increased 8.8 percent in 2018 to $488.5 billion, the highest level since 2008. For all of 2018, the current account deficit averaged 2.4 percent of GDP, the biggest share since 2012, from 2.3 percent in 2017.
The deficit on the current account has shrunk from a peak of 6.2 percent of GDP in the fourth quarter of 2005, in part because of a significant increase in the volume of oil exports.
In the fourth quarter, exports of goods fell 0.9 percent to $416.1 billion, while imports were unchanged at $649.1 billion.
Meanwhile, the flow of foreign profits repatriated by U.S. companies slowed to $85.9 billion in the fourth quarter from an upwardly revised $100.7 billion in the prior period, reflecting a diminishing impact from corporate tax overhaul that went into effect last January. 
Earnings repatriation peaked at $294.7 billion in the first quarter immediately after the law took effect but has tailed off each quarter since. Even so, it remains well above pre-tax cut levels.

For the full year, foreign profits brought back to U.S. shores by American companies surged to a record $664.9 billion, more than four times the $155.1 billion logged in 2017 and more than twice the previous record in 2005.

1560,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 27, 2019 10:27AM ET</span>",Soybean exports help to shrink U.S. trade deficit in January,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. trade deficit narrowed by the most in 10 months in January likely as China boosted purchases of soybeans, leading to a rebound in exports after three straight monthly declines.
The better-than-expected improvement in the trade deficit reported by the Commerce Department on Wednesday offered some good news for the economy after a raft of weak data, including retail sales, manufacturing and homebuilding, left economists anticipating a sharp slowdown in growth in the first quarter.
""At a minimum, the U.S. trade deficit softens some of the blow from all of the other negative figures,"" said Jennifer Lee, a senior economist at BMO Capital Markets in Toronto.
Still, the trade deficit remains large despite President Donald Trump's ""America First"" policies to significantly shrink it. The White House's protectionist trade tariffs have left the United States mired in a bruising trade war with China and provoked retaliatory tariffs from other trading partners. 
The Commerce Department said the trade deficit declined 14.6 percent, the largest drop since March 2018, to $51.1 billion also as increased domestic oil production and lower crude prices curbed the import bill. 
Data for December was revised slightly down to show the trade gap widening to $59.9 billion instead of the previously reported $59.8 billion. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the trade gap narrowing to $57.0 billion in January. 
Washington last year imposed tariffs on $250 billion worth of goods imported from China, with Beijing hitting back with duties on $110 billion worth of American products, including soybeans and other commodities. 
Trump has delayed tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese imports as negotiations to resolve the eight-month trade war continue, with Beijing pledging to resume bulk purchases of soybeans after cancellations at the height of the trade fight. 
U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin are in China this week for another round of talks with Chinese Vice Premier Liu He.
The politically sensitive trade deficit with China fell 6.4 percent to $34.5 billion in January.
U.S. financial markets were little moved by the data.
LOW GDP ESTIMATES
When adjusted for inflation, the goods trade deficit decreased $7.8 billion to $83.8 billion in January. The drop in the so-called real goods trade deficit could see economists bump up their very low first-quarter gross domestic product growth estimates. 
The Atlanta Federal Reserve is forecasting GDP rising at a 1.3 percent annualized rate in the January-March quarter. The government reported last month that the economy grew at a 2.6 percent pace in the fourth quarter. 
But that estimate is likely to be lowered when the government publishes a revision on Thursday as some economic data for December was weaker than had been previously assumed. 
The trade deficit in January was pushed down by a 0.9 percent increase in exports to $207.3 billion. Soybean exports rose by $0.9 billion in January. Exports of motor vehicles and parts increased by $1.2 billion.
Export growth, however, continues to be constrained by slowing global demand and the dollar's strength last year, which is making U.S.-made goods less competitive on foreign markets. That is putting pressure on the current account. 
In January, exports of capital goods decreased by $0.8 billion, led by a $1.3 billion decline in civilian aircraft shipments. Despite the rise in soybean shipments, exports to China were the smallest since September 2010.
Imports fell 2.6 percent to $258.5 billion in January, the lowest level since last June. Imports previously had surged, likely as businesses stocked up in anticipation of further duties on Chinese imports. 
Capital goods imports dropped by $3.0 billion in January, led by a $0.9 billion decline in imports of computer accessories. There were also decreases in imports of semiconductors and civilian aircraft. 
The weakness in capital goods imports likely suggests a slowdown in business spending on equipment. A drop in imports normally suggests cooling domestic demand. There were, however, increases in imports of consumer goods, as well as motor vehicles and parts in January.
Crude oil imports dropped by $1.4 billion, reflecting both lower volumes and prices. Imported oil prices averaged $42.59 per barrel in January, the cheapest since December 2016. 
In second report on Wednesday, the Commerce Department said the current account deficit, which measures the flow of goods, services and investments into and out of the country, rose 6.1 percent to a 10-year high of $134.4 billion in the fourth quarter. 
The current account gap represented 2.6 percent of gross domestic product in the fourth quarter, the largest share since the second quarter of 2012, up from 2.5 percent in the July-September period.

The deficit increased 8.8 percent in 2018 to $488.5 billion, the highest level since 2008. For all of 2018, the current account deficit averaged 2.4 percent of GDP, the biggest share since 2012, from 2.3 percent in 2017.

OTTAWA (Reuters) - Canada's trade deficit shrank slightly to C$4.25 billion ($3.17 billion) in January, the second highest on record, as low crude prices continued to eat into the value of exports, Statistics Canada said on Wednesday.
Analysts in a Reuters poll had forecast a shortfall of C$3.50 billion. Statscan revised December's deficit to C$4.82 billion from an initial C$4.59 billion.
Exports grew 2.9 percent to C$47.58 billion - the first increase since July 2018 - as the value of oil shipments jumped by 36.5 percent due to higher prices. Even so, crude export prices remained 40.1 percent below their July peak.
Export Development Canada chief economist, Peter Hall, said he was ""still looking at the overall picture with some concern.""
Hall noted, though, that exports of industrial machinery, equipment and parts climbed 4.7 percent on the month while shipments of electronic and electrical equipment and parts were up by 1.9 percent.
""To me, they are a bellwether of underlying strength in the U.S. economy,"" he said in a telephone interview.
Exports of other crop products sank 25.4 percent, as soybean shipments to China slipped after a record year in 2018.
Imports gained 1.5 percent to a record C$51.82 billion, as imports of aircraft soared six-fold from December, reflecting the arrival of airliners from the United States.
The Canadian dollar extended its decline on the news, slipping to C$1.3427 to the U.S. dollar, or 74.48 U.S. cents.
Canada sent 71.5 percent of all its goods exports to the United States in January. Exports to the United States rose by 1.1 percent while imports edged up by 1.8 percent and as a result, the bilateral trade surplus shrank to C$1.56 billion from C$1.77 billion in December.
The Bank of Canada, which has put interest rate hikes on hold until data shows the economy recovering from a slump caused in part by low oil prices, is widely expected to sit on the sidelines at its next policy announcement on April 24. 
""Over the first quarter as a whole, net trade is on track to weigh on GDP growth for the first time in a year,"" said Stephen Brown, senior Canada economist at Capital Economics.
Publication of the January data was delayed from March 7 due to a partial U.S. government shutdown.

The Confederation of British Industry said some of the fall in its monthly sales balance to -18 -- meaning more retailers reported falling sales than rising sales -- might have been caused by the later timing of Easter this year versus last year.
But the poor run in the data -- the balance has not been positive for four months -- showed an underlying caution among Britain's shoppers whose spending helps drive the economy.
""While real wage growth is picking up, consumer confidence has been hit by escalating uncertainty over Brexit and concern over the economy's future,"" Anna Leach, CBI head of economic intelligence, said.
""The pain currently being felt on the high street is yet another reason why it is so vitally important politicians agree a deal in parliament that is acceptable to the EU and protects our economy. No-deal must be averted at all costs.""
A Reuters poll of economists had pointed to a reading of +5.

The CBI said retailers thought sales would pick up in April but the scale of the expected recovery was smaller than a month earlier.

1564,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 27, 2019 05:15AM ET</span>",Dubai economic growth at its slowest since 2009 debt crisis,"By Saeed Azhar
DUBAI (Reuters) - Dubai's economy grew 1.94 percent in 2018, the government said on Wednesday, slowing down from a 2.8 percent growth rate in 2017 and hitting its slowest pace since a contraction in 2009 when the economy was hobbled by a debt crisis.
Dubai, which has a diversified economy that focuses on tourism and international business services, has been hurt by a rough patch amid a downturn in its real estate market.
""A weakening external backdrop, a strong U.S. dollar and the ongoing correction in the property market are headwinds for a number of vital sectors,"" said Monica Malik, chief economist at Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank.
Property prices in Dubai have fallen by more than a quarter from their peak in 2014. S&P said last month it expects prices to fall another 5-10 percent this year due to a continued gap between supply and demand, before steadying in 2020.
Dubai needed a $20 billion bailout from oil-rich Abu Dhabi to escape a debt crisis in 2009 caused by collapsing property prices, which had threatened to force some state-linked companies to default on billions of dollars of debt.
Analysts expect some economic recovery for Dubai ahead of 2020 when the city hosts the World Expo event.
The government said GDP growth was largely driven by the performance of trade related activities, which grew by 1.3 percent in 2018 from a year earlier, representing 18.1 percent of the total growth achieved last year.
It said real estate activity grew 7 percent in 2018 and accounted for nearly 25 percent of total economic growth.
In 2017 real estate grew 7.3 percent.
Growth in the transport and storage sector slowed down to 2.1 percent last year from 4.5 percent in 2017.
London-based Capital Economics in a report said the property sector is likely to remain in the doldrums while a weakness in the global economy will weigh on Dubai’s manufacturing and logistics sectors. 
But this should be more than offset by a stepup in preparations for, and the hosting of the 2020 World Expo, it said.
Officials have previously estimated that Expo will provide a boost to the economy equal to $38 billion, or 33 percent of GDP. 
Capital Economics is forecasting GDP growth of 3.8 percent this year before a pick-up to 4.5 percent in 2020.
But it also warned main risks to the outlook stem from long-standing debt problems, citing IMF data that show that the debt of Dubai’s government-related entities (GREs) – which were at the heart of the Dubai's debt crisis in 2009 – amounted to $60 billion, equal to 50 percent of Dubai’s GDP.
""Debt restructurings in 2014 have masked the problems in recent years. But around half of GRE debt is due to mature between now and 2021,"" said Jason Tuvey, senior emerging markets economist at Capital Economics. 
""We’ve warned before that the risk of overcapacity after the World Expo means that the GREs could face weaker-than-expected revenues, harming their ability to service these debts,"" he said.

Abu Dhabi is expected to roll over for the second time $20 billion of debt, due this month, that it extended to Dubai during its financial crisis a decade ago, Reuters reported last month citing three sources familiar with the matter said.

1565,By Investing.com,"<span>Mar 27, 2019 12:16AM ET</span>",China’s Industrial Profits in January-February Slump At Fastest Pace Since 2011,"Investing.com - Profit at large Chinese industrial firms dropped at the fastest pace since 2011 in the January-February period, official data from the National Bureau of Statistics showed on Wednesday.
Profits dropped 14% year-on-year to 708.01 billion yuan ($105.50 billion), their worst contraction since late 2011.
The fall in profits was mainly due to price contractions in key industrial sectors such as auto, oil processing, steel and chemical industries, Zhu Hong of the statistics bureau said in a statement accompanying the data.
He also noted that the timing of Lunar New Year holidays this year also had a more significant negative impact on the business environment than in 2018.
The fall came even after Chinese Premier Li Keqiang announced tax cuts and infrastructure spending earlier this month that are worth hundreds of billions of dollars.
Uncertainty surrounding the Sino-U.S. trade war might have a negative impact on China’s economic growth.
While officials from the U.S. and China have publicly said trade talks between the two sides have been going well, the optimism of a quick trade deal faded somewhat earlier this month after U.S. President Donald Trump said tariffs on Chinese export could stay in place for a “substantial period of time.”
His comments caused some confusion among analysts who have been following the trade developments. Earlier this month, it was reported that some officials from Beijing are not happy with the lack of assurance that tariffs on Chinese goods would be lifted.

1566,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 27, 2019 12:11AM ET</span>",China's industrial profits shrink most since late 2011 as economy cools,"BEIJING (Reuters) - China's industrial firms posted their worst slump in profits since late 2011 in the first two months of this year, data showed on Wednesday, as increasing strains on the economy in the face of slowing demand at home and abroad took a toll on businesses.
The sharp decline in profits suggests further trouble for the world's second largest economy, which expanded at its slowest pace in almost three decades last year. The government has already lowered the economic growth target this year to 6.0-6.5 percent, from the actual rate of 6.6 percent in 2018. 
Profits notched up by China's industrial firms in January-February slumped 14.0 percent year-on-year to 708.01 billion yuan ($105.50 billion), the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) said on its website on Wednesday. It marked the biggest contraction since Reuters began keeping records in October 2011. 
The data combines figures for January and February to smooth out distortions caused by the week-long China's Lunar New Year. 
The drag was mainly due to price contractions in key industrial sectors such as auto, oil processing, steel and chemical industries, Zhu Hong of the statistics bureau said in a statement accompanying the data, adding that production and sales are slowing as well. 
Profits in the auto sector were down 37.1 billion yuan from a year earlier, while those in the oil processing industry fell 31.7 billion yuan, according to official data. 
Zhu said the timing of Lunar New Year holidays that fell in early February also had a bigger negative impact on business operations this year than in 2018. 
The trade war with the United States has put a dent on factory activity, corporate earnings, business sentiment and overall consumption in a blow to the economic outlook.
Growth in China's manufacturing output slumped to a 17-year low in January-February, while factory-gate inflation remained subdued in the same period in a reflection of the deepening strains across the economy.
""Although it's possible U.S. and China could come to a trade deal in the near future, it still remains a question that it will help reverse the decline in China's exports,” said Betty Wang, senior China economist at ANZ, adding that waning global demand remains a concern as well.
Policymakers have acknowledged the country's economy is facing increasing downward pressure, hurt by multi-year campaigns to curb debt risks and pollution, while the trade war with the United States took a toll on export orders and employment. 
Beijing is beefing up measures to support the manufacturing industry by cutting the value-added tax, increasing infrastructure spending and reducing direct government intervention.
TAX CUTS TO THE RESCUE?
The profit margin in the manufacturing sector is less than 5 percent and many companies are suffering losses, Li Dongsheng, CEO of TCL Corp told a Guangdong delegation meeting on the sidelines of an annual parliament meeting in March. 
""I advise the government to further lower value-added tax, and if implemented, it will effectively boost the profit-making ability of the manufacturing industry,"" said Li.
Lots of other firms are already facing margin pressure. Jiangsu Shagang, China's biggest private-owned steel mill, expects its first quarter net profit to decline as much as 68.6 percent year-on-year. 
Industry data out on Monday also showed China's automobile sector in reverse gear, with sales down 13.8 percent in February year-on-year, marking the eighth consecutive month of decline in the world's largest auto market.
Earlier this month, Beijing announced hundreds of billions of dollars in additional tax cuts, which included a 3 percentage point reduction in value-added tax for the manufacturing industry that has been grappling with rising costs and lower profit margins in the face of the economic slowdown.
The country's customs agency said on Wednesday that the VAT cuts will help reduce the tax burdens of importers by 225 billion yuan. 
Yet, the support measures are taking time to kick in. Most analysts believe economic activity may not convincingly stabilize until the middle of the year.

1567,By Bloomberg,"<span>Mar 26, 2019 10:20PM ET</span>","China’s First Quarter Recovery Is Unmistakable, Beige Book Says","(Bloomberg) -- China’s economy showed “an unmistakable first-quarter recovery” after a weak end to 2018, though the level of new borrowing casts doubt on the sustainability of the rebound, according to the China Beige Book.
“The recovery extends across both sectors and geographies, with every major sector and each one of our regions showing better revenue results than Q4,” CBB International said in a report based on survey data. “Yet this rally didn’t appear out of nowhere, and there are at least three compelling reasons to doubt its staying power: credit, credit, and credit.”
Economists had forecast a bottoming-out of the economy’s growth slide as early as the first quarter, on the back of a string of government stimulus measures including credit easing since last year. At the same time, a deteriorating global trade outlook and falling factory prices pose risks even as domestic consumption remains relatively robust.
Reports of company borrowing matched the highest level since mid-2013, while loan applications continued to rise and rejection rates plumbed all-time lows, the report said.
The Beige Book authors point to a resurgence in shadow-bank financing, which Beijing had previously been trying to curb, as one reason behind the uptick in activity. The cost of credit is however surging, according to the report, with firms reporting the second-highest overall interest rates in CBB data going back to 2012.

More firms were downbeat about the outlook for jobs and investment than were optimistic for the first time since the Recruitment and Employment Confederation began its surveys in June 2016, the month of the Brexit referendum.
Nearly three years on, it remains unclear how, when or even if Brexit will happen.
The REC report added to other surveys showing companies feeling the strain of Brexit uncertainty, even though employment growth has been strong.
Wednesday's survey raised questions about the strength of the labor market.
""For months, businesses have told us that they were concerned about the general outlook for the economy. It is clear to us that this concern is now closer to home,"" REC Chief Executive Neil Carberry said.
While more employers planned to increase rather than cut permanent staff, hiring intentions weakened sharply. For temporary staff, the survey showed outright cuts were likely. 
""Lower use of temporary labor is a sign of lower demand,"" Carberry said.

The REC survey of 600 employers took place between Dec. 11 and Feb. 21.

The quarterly survey of thousands of Chinese firms by China Beige Book International (CBB) painted a surprising picture of a turnaround in business conditions after a poor fourth quarter that saw the weakest economic growth since the financial crisis.
CBB's findings were in contrast to mostly downbeat official data for January and February and other business surveys which suggest recent stimulus measures are only slowly kicking in. Most analysts have also warned of a rocky first quarter, and do not expect China's economic downturn to bottom out until mid-year. 
However, the U.S.-based consultancy questioned whether the first-quarter's ""credit-soaked"" recovery was sustainable, noting riskier types of shadow banking were on the rise again.
While companies said access to credit was improving, the survey also found some firms were reporting higher interest rates, despite the central bank's efforts to lower financing costs.
""Credit is surprisingly expensive... Credit costs need to be further stabilized or the current rally will falter,"" CBB said in a statement, saying shadow lenders were charging sky-high rates.
Chinese banks lent a record 3.23 trillion yuan ($477 billion) in January as policymakers tried to jumpstart sluggish investment and prevent a sharper slowdown in the world's second-largest economy.
Authorities have urged banks to keep lending to struggling small and private firms in particular, even though such companies are considered higher credit risks.
""Even traditionally disadvantaged firms in the credit markets are no longer so - at least for a quarter: private firm borrowing outpaced state-owned enterprises in the first quarter,"" CBB said.
In early March, Premier Li Keqiang announced billions of dollars in additional tax cuts and infrastructure spending this year.
Along with a growing list of government support measures, signs of progress in U.S.-China trade talks may also have been a factor behind the improvement in business confidence, CBB added.

China will release March and first-quarter economic data around mid-April.

1570,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 26, 2019 11:52AM ET</span>","U.S. housing, consumer confidence data point to slowing economy","By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. homebuilding fell more than expected in February as construction of single-family homes dropped to near a two-year low, offering more evidence of a sharp slowdown in economic activity early in the year.
Concerns over the economy were also underscored by other data on Tuesday showing consumer confidence ebbing in March, with households a bit pessimistic about the labor market. The economy is facing rising headwinds, including slowing global growth, fading fiscal stimulus, trade tensions and uncertainty over Britain's departure from the European Union.
Those concerns contributed to the Federal Reserve's decision last week to bring its three-year campaign to tighten monetary policy to an abrupt end, as it abandoned projections for any interest rate hikes this year.
""The sugar high is just about over,"" said Joel Naroff, chief economist at Naroff Economic Advisors in Holland, Pennsylvania. ""The risks are more toward the downside than the upside."" 
Housing starts decreased 8.7 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.162 million units last month, the Commerce Department said. The percent decline was the largest in eight months, and bad weather could have contributed to the sharp drop in homebuilding last month. 
Homebuilding fell in three of the four regions in February. Housing starts data for January and December were revised higher. Building permits fell 1.6 percent to a rate of 1.296 million units in February. While that was the second straight monthly drop in permits, they are now outpacing starts, which suggests a pickup in homebuilding in the months ahead.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast housing starts falling to a pace of 1.213 million units in February. 
The housing market hit a soft patch last year, squeezed by higher mortgage rates, pricier lumber, and land and labor shortages, which led to tight inventories and more expensive homes. But borrowing costs have eased in the wake of the Fed's signaling of a long pause in hiking rates.
The 30-year fixed mortgage rate dropped to an average of 4.28 percent last week, the lowest in more than a year, from 4.31 in the prior week, according to data from mortgage finance agency Freddie Mac. House price inflation is also slowing.
A report from S&P/Case-Shiller on Tuesday showed house prices in the 20-metro area increased 3.6 percent from a year ago in January, the smallest gain since September 2012, after rising 4.1 percent in December.
The moderation in mortgage rates and house prices is likely to improve affordability, especially for first-time homebuyers who have been largely priced out of the market. But homebuilders remain constrained in their ability to construct more homes for the lower end of the market. 
A survey last week showed confidence among homebuilders was steady in March, with builders still complaining about the scarcity of skilled workers and land, as well as zoning restrictions in many major metro areas.
STORM CLOUDS
""The run-up in interest rates last year did some real damage,"" said Mark Vitner, a senior economist at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) Securities in Charlotte, North Carolina. ""Even with the recent slide in interest rates, which reflects weakening economic conditions, we do not feel we will see a rebound in housing demand until the storm clouds emanating from slower global economic growth clear later this year."" 
The dollar was little changed against a basket of currencies, while U.S. Treasury prices fell. Stocks on Wall Street were trading higher.
Single-family homebuilding, which accounts for the largest share of the housing market, tumbled 17.0 percent to a rate of 805,000 units in February, the lowest level since May 2017. The percentage drop in single-family homebuilding was the largest since February 2015. 
Permits to build single-family homes were unchanged in February at a pace of 821,000. Starts for the volatile multi-family housing segment jumped 17.8 percent to a rate of 357,000 units in February. Permits for the construction of multi-family homes fell 4.2 percent to a pace of 475,000 units last month.
The weak housing data strengthens the view that the economy lost considerable momentum early in the first quarter. Retail sales rose moderately in January after tumbling in December, and the manufacturing sector is struggling, with output falling in February for a second straight month. 
The Atlanta Fed is forecasting gross domestic product rising at a 1.3 percent annualized rate in the first quarter. The economy grew at a 2.6 percent in the October-December period.
A third report from the Conference Board on Tuesday showed its consumer confidence index fell 7.3 points to a reading of 124.1 in March. While noting that consumer confidence has been volatile in recent months, the Conference Board said ""the overall trend in confidence has been softening since last summer, pointing to a moderation in economic growth.""
Consumers' assessment of both current business and labor market conditions weakened in March. The survey's so-called labor market differential, derived from data about respondents who think jobs are hard to get and those who think jobs are plentiful, fell to an eight-month low.
It was the second straight monthly decline in this measure, which closely correlates to the unemployment rate in the Labor Department's employment report. The unemployment rate is at 3.8 percent and job growth decelerated sharply in February.

""It does suggest that we may see the very low jobless rate become a little less low in March,"" said Jennifer Lee, a senior economist at BMO Capital Markets in Toronto. ""It all comes down to the job market. It is the single most important factor underpinning confidence and spending.""

The Conference Board said Tuesday its consumer confidence index fell to 124.1 in March, below expectations for a reading of 132. That's down from 131.4 in February and just slihgtly higher than its recent low of 120.2 in January.
“Confidence has been somewhat volatile over the past few months, as consumers have had to weather volatility in the financial markets, a partial government shutdown and a very weak February jobs report,” Lynn Franco, director of economic indicators at The Conference Board, said in the report.
The government’s employment report showed the creation of just 20,000 jobs in February.
Reflecting the more pessimistic outlook for a labor market that is losing momentum, the CB survey showed that the proportion expecting more jobs in the months ahead decreased to 16.4% from 19%, while those anticipating fewer jobs increased to 13.4% from 12.3%.
While Franco recognized that consumers remained confident that the economy will continue expanding in the near term, she noted that the overall trend has softened, suggesting “a moderation in economic growth”.
Other data released on Tuesday revealed that housing starts and building permits declined sharply in February. The weakness in the American real estate sector, along with the sputtering strength of consumer confidence, may foreshadow the loss of economic momentum.
U.S. economic growth slowed toward the end of 2018 and appeared to be off to weak start at the beginning of this year. Financial markets have focused on the slowdown in the broader global economy, particularly in China and Europe, while ongoing trade tensions between Washington and Beijing add to concerns."

Power and LMC Automotive.
The consultancies expect total U.S. vehicle sales of about 1.56 million units in March.
Retail sales are expected to touch 1,195,000 units in March, a 3.4 percent decline from a year earlier, the consultancies said on Tuesday.
The first-quarter sales are off to its slowest start since 2013, according to the industry consultants, who estimate retail sales in the quarter to be about 2.94 million vehicles - a decline of 4.9 percent compared to the same period a year ago.
""This is the first time in six years that Q1 sales will fall short of 3 million units.

Housing starts tumbled 8.7% to a seasonally-adjusted annual rate of 1.162 million units last month, the Commerce Department said, well below a consensus forecast for 1.213 million units.
New construction data have been volatile in recent months. They flattened out at the end of last year after a long expansion that goes all the way back to 2010, then rebounded sharply in January before snapping back again last month.
Building permits, a key indicator of demand in the real estate market, also came in below consensus at 1.296 million units, the Commerce Department said. Analysts had forecast 1.32 million.
The data suggest the market may need more time to respond to the Federal Reserve's shift to a looser monetary policy stance. Although Fed officials had signaled in February they would wait before hiking interest rates further, it was only this month that updated models showed it no longer expects to raise rates at all this year.
The Fed's shift has effectively put a cap on mortgage rates and, coupled with signs of solid earnings growth, has spurred expectations that people will be able to tackle the cost of purchasing homes. Data released last Friday showed the largest gain in existing-home sales stateside since December 2015 thanks to lower mortgage rates, more inventory, higher income levels and improved consumer confidence.
Sentiment among U.S. homebuilders held steady in March, sustaining a rebound from a recent three-year low on improvement in sales and a brighter outlook for the next six months, according to a survey by the National Association of Home Builders released last week.

The INSEE statistics agency said the euro zone's second-biggest economy grew 0.3 percent in the three months to the end of December from the previous quarter, when it also grew at the same rate.
As a result the economy grew 1.6 percent over the course of last year, marginally better than the 1.5 percent flagged in a previous estimate.
Strong exports, as companies such as Airbus rushed to complete shipments before the end of the year, helped offset weak consumer spending.
Many stores in central Paris had to close on peak pre-holiday shopping days as the capital faced some of the worst rioting and vandalism in decades as the protests initially over the high cost of living spiraled out of control.
French households squirreled away cash, instead of spending money resulting from a surge in extra income at the end of last year, boosted by the scrapping of a payroll tax for unemployment insurance.
INSEE said the households' real disposable income growth accelerated to 1.3 percent in the fourth quarter from 0.7 percent in the previous three months while the savings rate jumped to 15.2 percent from 14.3 percent.
Meanwhile, consumer spending growth was flat after growing 0.4 percent in the previous quarter.

Domestic demand is expected to be the sole driver of growth this year in Europe's largest economy as exporters struggle with a global slowdown, trade disputes and Brexit uncertainty.
Record-high employment, hefty pay hikes, moderate inflation and low borrowing costs have helped household spending to replace exports as the most important pillar of economic growth.
The GfK market research group said its consumer sentiment indicator fell to 10.4 points heading into April from a revised 10.7 the previous month. That undershot the forecast of 10.8.
The survey of around 2,000 Germans showed that income expectations fell slightly and propensity to buy dropped to its lowest level in more than two years.
""Despite these losses, consumer mood among Germans remains decidedly positive,"" GfK researcher Rolf Buerkl said.
Germany's robust labor market and rising employment should ensure that consumers continue to spend their money, especially as low interest rates make saving unattractive, Buerkl added.
Buerkl said he expected private consumption to remain an important pillar of economic expansion in Germany this year.
""However, this is reliant on the assumption that the uncertainty caused by Brexit and the trade conflict does not increase further,"" Buerkl said, adding that any encroachment of this uncertainty on job market expectations should be avoided.
The survey followed Ifo's business climate index on Monday which showed that business morale improved unexpectedly in March after six consecutive drops and helped to dispel concerns about the risk of a recession in Germany. 

The GfK survey was conducted from March 1 to 15.

However, it corroborated the gloomy mood in the country's key manufacturing sector, and noted that any improvement in sentiment was due largely to domestic-focused sectors such as retail and construction.
The Munich-based Ifo economic institute said its business climate index, based on a monthly survey of companies, edged forward to 99.6 from 98.5 in February. February’s reading had been the lowest level since November 2014. 
The reading beat economists’ expectations for 98.7 and was the first improvement in seven months. The subindexes for expectations and current business conditions both improved.
“The German economy is showing resilience,” Ifo president Clemens Fuest said in a statement. 
Germany, the world's second-largest exporter, is exposed to a downturn in global demand, not least through the risks of a trade war between U.S. and China, the U.K.’s departure from the European Union and threats of higher tariffs on German-made vehicles from U.S. President Donald Trump.
""In view of declining demand, companies are hardly planning any increases in production,"" the institute said. By contrast, conditions in retail and wholesale trade improved to their best since May 2018.
Data released last Friday showed that Germany’s activity in the country’s manufacturing sector contracted at its sharpest pace in nearly six years in March, while hard data on output and orders for January - the latest month available - also fell short of expectations. In Ifo's survey, too, responses from manufacturers continued to deteriorate, with expectations falling to their lowest level since November 2012, Ifo said. 
Carsten Brzeski, ING's chief economist in Germany, called the news a ""tentative signal of relief"" for the motor of the euro zone's economy.
""Looking ahead, today’s Ifo index ends a period of pessimism and suggests that not all is bad in the German economy... the first quarter for the German economy might not be as weak as some have expected,"" he said.
The German Council of Economic Experts, also referred to as the “Five Sages”, last week slashed their 2019 German growth forecast to just 0.8% from their November forecast of 1.5%.
The German economy underwent a marked slowdown in the fourth quarter, narrowly avoiding a second straight quarterly decline, the technical definition of a recession."

The core inflation rate was 1.5 percent on a year-on-year basis, data showed on Monday, its lowest since May 2018, and below the median forecast in a Reuters poll for a 1.7 percent rise.
""The lower than-expected inflation print basically reinforces our call for MAS to stay unchanged (in April),"" UOB economist Barnabas Gan said, referring to the Monetary Authority of Singapore, the city-state's central bank.
The MAS tightened policy at each of its semi-annual meetings in 2018, the first tightening in six years. Its meeting next month comes against the backdrop of a raft of underwhelming domestic data and concerns over the health of the global economy. 
The core inflation measure - closely watched by central bankers - excludes changes in the prices of cars and accommodation, which are more heavily influenced by government policies.
Meanwhile, Singapore's headline consumer price index edged up 0.5 percent in February from a year earlier, due to more gradual declines in private road transport and accommodation costs.
The median forecast in the poll was for all-items CPI to rise 0.5 percent. In January, headline CPI rose 0.4 percent year-on-year.

Singapore will release February industrial production data on Tuesday. Factory output shrank to its lowest in two-and-a-half years in January.

MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexico's annual inflation continued to slow in the first half of March, the statistics institute said on Friday, raising expectations the nation's central bank will loosen monetary policy later in the year.
Mexican consumer prices rose 3.95 percent in the year through February, slightly below the 3.99 percent increase registered in the second half of February. 
Inflation was in line with estimates from a Reuters survey, in which the median forecast of 13 specialists predicted an increase of 3.96 percent. 
Fitch Ratings this week said it believed Mexico's cycle of raising rates was over for now. The central bank will announce its next decision on interest rates on Thursday. The bank held the benchmark lending rate at 8.25 in February after a series of hikes.
Central Bank Governor Alejandro Diaz de Leon said at a banking convention on Friday that it would be important for the entity to consider not only cyclical factors in its decisions on rates, but also other risks including shocks and structural factors. 
Diaz de Leon has called for maintaining the central bank's independence as key to the economic health in Mexico, where President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador took office in December. 
He also has advocated for keeping the central bank's focus on inflation. In an interview on Thursday, he noted that Lopez Obrador's decision in late October to cancel a partly-built new Mexico City airport had fanned market volatility in Mexico, as well as concern over the financial health of state oil firm Pemex. [nL1N219025] 
Responding to the inflation data, Capital Economics said it expected the headline rate would decline during the second half of the year, paving the way for monetary loosening. 
""We expect 75bp of interest rate cuts this year, which is more than markets are currently pricing in,"" Capital Economics said in a note.
Core inflation, which strips out some volatile food and energy prices, rose 3.51 percent in the year through the first half of the month.
Consumer prices rose 0.26 percent in the first half of March compared with the previous month.
The data showed that prices for gasoline, lemons and tomatoes rose. Declines in prices for foodstuffs such as potatoes and eggs helped lower prices overall.
Last month, Mexico's central bank held its benchmark interest rate steady at 8.25 percent, its highest level in more than a decade. 

This week, the U.S. Federal Reserve said it does not anticipate rate hikes in 2019, easing pressure on the Mexican central bank to raise the benchmark interest rate in its decision on monetary policy next Thursday.

1582,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 22, 2019 03:39PM ET</span>","In foreboding sign for U.S. economy, factory sector softens","By Jason Lange
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. manufacturing activity unexpectedly cooled in March, a troubling sign for the economy although the housing market showed signs lower interest rates were giving it a boost.
Financial data firm Markit's purchasing managers index for U.S. manufacturing fell to 52.5 in March, its lowest level since June 2017. Both new orders and output softened. 
Analysts polled by Reuters had expected the gauge to strengthen to 53.6 from 53.0 in February. Readings above 50 point to growth in the sector.
The slowdown in U.S. manufacturing is part of a global trend in which international trade tensions appear to be leaving their mark on factory output. Markit also released PMI reports showing factory activity contracted in the euro zone and in Japan.
The reports helped push the spread between three-month Treasury bills and 10-year note yields to invert for the first time since 2007. The inverted yield curve is widely understood to be a leading indicator of recession. U.S. stock prices also fell.
If the U.S. were to fall into recession, some economists have argued that the federal government's giant budget deficit could limit its ability to support growth.
The federal government posted a $234 billion deficit in February, the widest monthly deficit on record, Treasury data showed in a monthly report. 
The fiscal situation has deteriorated following a large tax cut enacted in 2018, with the government running nearly $1 trillion into the red during the 12 months through February. 
Already, signs of a global slowdown have played a significant role in the Federal Reserve's signaling in recent months that it will pause and possibly end its interest rate hiking cycle, which began in 2015. 
Some economists are concerned the Fed may have already lifted rates too high. The U.S. housing market spent much of 2018 in a dismal state, held back by higher rates.
On Friday, however, a report from the National Association of Realtors showed U.S. home sales surged in February to their highest level since March 2018. 
Existing home sales jumped 11.8 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.51 million units last month, the NAR said. 
That was above analysts' expectations and could be a sign that the Fed's pause on rate hikes is helping home sales. 
""Declines in mortgage rates are beginning to provide some support,"" economists at Oxford Economics said in a note to clients.
However, the U.S. economy is already slowing, partly due to the fading of a major fiscal stimulus in 2018. 
The New York Federal Reserve said one of its forecasting models pointed to a 1.29 percent growth rate in the first quarter. That's well below the 2.9 percent growth clocked in 2018, which was just below U.S. President Donald Trump's 3 percent growth target.
In another potential ding for the economic outlook, Commerce Department data showed U.S. wholesale inventories increased by the most in more than six years in January.
While that could boost the standard measure of economic growth during the first quarter, it could also be a sign that lackluster consumer purchases are leading goods to pile up on businesses' shelves.
""(This) points to some weakness in final demand,""  Barclays  (LON:BARC) said in a note to clients.

Companies signed up for $5.9 billion in new loans, leases and lines of credit last month, down from $7.7 billion a year ago. The fall was 18 percent, when compared to the previous month.
""Monthly new business volume declined for the first time in almost two years... Fundamentals in the U.S. economy appear to be holding up,"" ELFA Chief Executive Officer Ralph Petta said in a statement.
""With the Fed holding interest rates unchanged, these and other economic data bear monitoring in the coming months to better understand the dip in equipment financing volume for February.""
Washington-based ELFA, a trade association that reports economic activity for the $1 trillion equipment finance sector, said credit approvals totaled 76 percent in February, marginally down from 76.1 percent in the previous month.
The data on U.S. business borrowing was based on a survey among 25 members including Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC), BB&T Corp (NYSE:BBT), CIT Group Inc and the financing affiliates of  Caterpillar  Inc (NYSE:CAT), Deere & Co,  Verizon Communications  Inc (NYSE:VZ),  Siemens  AG (DE:SIEGn), Canon Inc and Volvo AB.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The spread between three-month Treasury bills and 10-year note yields inverted on Friday for the first time since 2007 after U.S. manufacturing data missed estimates. 
The three-month 10-year yield spread, the Federal Reserve's preferred measure of the yield curve, narrowed to minus 0.56 basis points. An inverted yield curve is widely understood to be a leading indicator of recession. 
The Markit Purchasing Managers' Index report, which tracks activity in the U.S. manufacturing sector, on Friday disappointed investors, with the headline index down 0.5 percent to 52.5 versus the expected 53.6. Earlier, Germany reported that domestic manufacturing contracted further in March, driving the benchmark 10-year U.S. government bond below zero and adding to fears of a global slowdown in growth. 
The soft data exacerbated a trend that began on Wednesday after the Fed issued a statement showing policymakers foresaw no further rate hikes for 2019 given the slowdown in the American economy.
""The reality is the market is now expecting lower rates on average over the next 10 years than we have currently. And it's a combination both of a dovish Fed and also ongoing global growth concerns,"" said Jon Hill, U.S. rates strategist at BMO Capital Markets. 

""We're clearly beginning to see green shoots of the end of this cycle. It's now a question of timing and if the Fed's dovish pivot will be sufficient to either delay or moderate the recession.""

LONDON (Reuters) - Manufacturers in Europe, Japan and the United States suffered in March as surveys showed trade tensions had left their mark on factory output, a setback for hopes the global economy might be turning the corner on its slowdown.
Factory activity in the 19-country euro zone contracted at the fastest pace in nearly six years.
In Japan, manufacturing output shrank the most in almost three years, hurt by China's economic slowdown.
And a measure of U.S. manufacturing was its weakest since June 2017 while forecasters at the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia slashed their estimate for economic growth in early 2019.
German 10-year bond yields, which plunged on Thursday after the U.S. Federal Reserve signaled no more rate hikes this year, dived again to fall below zero.
European shares and the euro also fell on Friday.
In New York, the spread between the three-month U.S. Treasury bill yield and the 10-year note yield narrowed to a 12-year low -- a sign of concern among investors about the growth outlook.
""No other factor shapes the euro zone business cycle more than the ups and downs of global trade,"" economists at Berenberg, a bank said.
The United States and China are due to resume face-to-face talks next week, but it is unclear if the two sides can narrow their differences and end the trade war between the world's two largest economies.
European officials are also worried about the risk of U.S. tariffs on car imports from Europe.
RISKS - U.S. CHINA TENSIONS, BREXIT, ITALY
The drop in the euro zone's manufacturing purchasing managers index to a 71-month low of 47.7 from 49.4 in February raised the risk trade flows could turn even more negative in the short term, the Berenberg economists said.
The manufacturing downturn was partly offset by stable -- but relatively weak -- growth in the euro zone's dominant services industry.
But the surveys suggested the bloc's economy had a poor start to 2019.
IHS Markit, which published the surveys, said the PMIs pointed to first-quarter economic growth of 0.2 percent in the euro zone, below the 0.3 percent predicted in a Reuters poll last week. 
The euro zone grew 0.2 percent in the final three months of 2018, its slowest pace in four years. 
Earlier this month, the European Central Bank changed tack by pushing out the timing of its next rate increase until 2020 at the earliest and said it would offer banks a new round of cheap loans to help revive the economy.
""We highlight downside risks mainly stemming from the external side – e.g. trade tensions, a Chinese-led global slowdown,""  Barclays  (LON:BARC) economists Radu-Gabriel Cristea and Francois Cabau said about the euro zone.
""The protracted weakness in manufacturing remains a lingering risk, and overall growth concerns are likely to intensify should the industrial backdrop further deteriorate. At the same time, Italy and Brexit woes remain non-negligible, the uncertainty a further drag on sentiment.""
The headline Flash Markit/Nikkei Japan Manufacturing Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) was a seasonally adjusted 48.9, the same as February's final reading.
The index was below the 50 threshold that separates contraction from expansion for the second consecutive month.
""Concern of weaker growth in China and prolonged global trade frictions kept business confidence well below its historical average in March,"" Joe Hayes, an economist at IHS Markit, said.
The flash index for total new orders - domestic and foreign - fell to its lowest since June 2016, the survey showed.

Japan is exposed to the dispute between Washington and Beijing as it ships to China big volumes of electronics items and heavy machinery used to make finished goods destined for the United States.

1587,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 22, 2019 10:58AM ET</span>","UK economy dodges no-deal Brexit hit, for now","By William Schomberg
LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's economy has struggled beneath the weight of Brexit uncertainty for nearly three years, but many business leaders would probably be relieved just to have more of the same for the next few months.
The risk of a damaging no-deal exit by the world's fifth-biggest economy from the European Union on March 29 has been averted by the reprieve granted to Prime Minister Theresa May by other EU leaders on Thursday.
But the possibility could return as soon as April 12. Or the delay could stretch into May or beyond, depending on the prime minister's ability to break the Brexit impasse in parliament.
Employers took some comfort from the postponement, even if it did little to settle the wide range of Brexit outcomes that has led to many of them putting their expansion plans on hold. 
""Businesses will accept a short extension because it’s a better alternative to no deal,"" Seamus Nevin, chief economist at Make UK, an engineering trade group, said.
""But we really need to make decisions soon. Prolonged uncertainty just means the investment decline of recent months will continue and companies will be forced to decide whether to move production elsewhere.""
Carmakers have reduced expansion plans in Britain and many financial firms have set up operations in other EU countries. 
Overall business investment fell throughout 2018, the longest such run since the global financial crisis, and another fall is expected in 2019, threatening to worsen the country's weak productivity growth. 
Britain's economy lost momentum after the 2016 referendum decision to leave the EU. 
The slowdown deepened last year as the Brexit deadline approached, with no guarantee of a transition to smooth the shock, but also reflecting the weakening of the world economy.
While Britain would bear the brunt of a no-deal Brexit hit, U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has said it is a risk for the slowing U.S. economy, along with Washington's trade war with China.
The shock would also be felt in Europe where Britain's closest trading partners are struggling.
""It would be a material shock for the EU at a difficult time,"" Brian Coulton, chief economist at ratings agency Fitch Ratings, said. ""Among the things that could tip the euro zone into a recession, it might be a candidate.""
""NATIONAL EMERGENCY"" 
Even the strongest Brexit supporters say a no-deal divorce would deliver a shock. But they believe the economy would adjust and flourish once it is free of the constraints of EU rules and can strike its own trade deals around the world.
Gerard Lyons, a pro-Brexit economist, said weak business investment was a long-standing British problem, not just a Brexit one, and he pointed to strong jobs growth and tax revenues as a sign of underlying resilience in the economy.
While his preferred option was for Britain to leave EU with a transition and then hammer out a trade deal, he said a no-deal Brexit would not be a disaster because progress has been made to prepare Britain's finance industry, ports and logistics.
""It’s like a kick in the groin. It depends how hard the other side wants to kick you, and how well you maneuver yourself,"" Lyons said. 
The Bank of England said on Thursday that about 80 percent of almost 300 companies it surveyed felt they were as ready as they could be for a no-deal, no-transition Brexit, up from 50 percent in January.
The BoE has said a worst-case no-deal Brexit scenario -- in which Britain loses the confidence of global investors and chaos hits transport and ports -- could mean that the economy is 5 percent smaller in three years' time than if the country stayed in the EU.
A more managed no-deal Brexit could reduce the hit to about 2.5 percent, still a material hit at a time when the economy is struggling to grow by more than 1.5 percent a year.
Most economists say the higher the barriers for British firms to do business in the EU, the bigger the drag will be on economic growth stretching out into the decades ahead.
Any gains from free trade deals with countries such as China or the United States would be ""relatively modest"", Britain's independent budget forecasters have said.
It is small wonder therefore that many employers are hoping for a change of the Brexit plan, even if it means yet more sapping uncertainty.
""Our country is facing a national emergency,"" the Confederation of British Industry, a major employers group, and the Trades Union Congress umbrella group said on Thursday in a rare joint letter to May, urging her to avoid a no-deal Brexit.

""The shock to our economy would be felt by generations to come.""

After nine successive years of growth, the German economy is facing trade conflicts between the United States and both China and the European Union as well as weakening economic activity in the euro zone.
IHS Markit's flash composite Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) measuring activity in services and manufacturing, which together account for more than two-thirds of the economy, fell to 51.5, it lowest reading since June 2013.
The fall was mainly driven by the weakest activity in manufacturing since August 2012. That sub-index fell to 44.7, remaining below the 50.0 mark separating growth from contraction for a third straight month.
Growth in services slowed to 54.9, after rebounding to 55.3 in February. 
Markit economist Chris Williamson said the diverging trends raised the question of how long services can continue to provide impetus for the economy and help it avoid a recession.
""As long as you get growth in the services sector you can avoid a wider recession,"" he said.
""When you look at the employment trend and new orders, they pose a downside to the outlook. They look like they will subdue business confidence further and lead to a further retrenchment of spending by businesses and consumers, raising the risk of a recession.""
The survey showed that manufacturers had laid off people in March, the first such development in three years. New orders contracted for the sixth time in a row.
Williamson said manufacturing contracted 1 percent in the first quarter, compared with a 1.7 percent expansion in services. That suggested the economy grew by 0.2 percent in the first quarter, he said.
In addition to trade hostilities, manufacturing is also facing the risk of Britain leaving the European Union without an agreement on the terms of its departure.
Germany narrowly avoided a recession in the fourth quarter, when growth stagnated after contracting in the third quarter.

The economy has been relying on consumption for growth. A robust labor market, rising wages and low interest rates have been supporting the consumption-driven cycle.

LONDON (Reuters) - Businesses across the euro zone performed much worse than expected this month as factory activity contracted at the fastest pace in nearly six years, hurt by a big drop in demand, a survey showed on Friday.
While a downturn in manufacturing was partly offset by stable - yet relatively weak - growth in the euro zone's dominant services industry, the surveys suggested the bloc's economy had a poor first quarter. 
That supports the European Central Bank's change of tack earlier this month. It pushed out the timing of its next post-rate increase until 2020 at the earliest and said it would offer banks a new round of cheap loans to help revive the economy.
IHS Markit's Flash Composite Purchasing Managers' Index, which is considered a good guide to economic health, dropped to 51.3 this month from a final February reading of 51.9, missing a Reuters poll median expectation for 52.0.
""Manufacturing is clearly the main area of weakness and concern at the moment. The manufacturing downturn is gaining momentum and will act as an increasing drag on the economy in the second quarter,"" said Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit.
""To what extent can the services sector come to the rescue? It certainly helped prop up the economy in the first quarter but is in one of its slowest growth spells since 2016. Forward looking indicators aren't looking particularly encouraging.""
Williamson said the PMIs pointed to first-quarter GDP growth of 0.2 percent, below the 0.3 percent predicted in a Reuters poll last week. [ECILT/EU]
The flash manufacturing PMI sank to 47.6 from February's 49.3, its lowest reading since April 2013 and well below the 50 mark that separates growth from contraction.
A Reuters poll had predicted a modest rise to 49.5 and even the most pessimistic economist surveyed had predicted a reading of 48.4.
An index measuring output, which feeds into the composite PMI, plummeted to a near six-year low of 47.7 from 49.4.
Highlighting the struggles faced by factories, the new orders index dropped to 44.5 from 46.3, a level not seen since the end of 2012. Casting more shadows on the outlook, companies ran down old orders and raw materials and built up stocks of completed goods.
Growth in the services industry slowed in line with a Reuters poll. Its PMI dipped to 52.7 from 52.8.

And some of that activity came from completing old work. The backlogs of work index fell to 49.0 from 51.0, only the second time it has been sub-50 in almost three years.
Adding to the melancholy picture, services slowed their hiring.
So with forward-looking indicators turning increasingly downbeat, optimism about the year ahead waned. The composite future output index dropped to 59.9 from 60.6.

1593,By Investing.com,"<span>Mar 22, 2019 05:01AM ET</span>",Euro Zone Set for Stagnation As Weak PMIs Rattle Markets,"Investing.com - The Eurozone economy ended the first quarter on a low note as the two largest manufacturing sectors in the region contracted in March.
A preliminary reading for manufacturing activity in the euro zone fell to its lowest level since 2013, and the worst is probably still to come, IHS Markit said in surveys published on Friday.
“Forward-looking indicators such as business optimism and backlogs of work suggest that growth could be even weaker in the second quarter,"" said IHS economist Chris Williamson. ""Worryingly, with order book backlogs shrinking at the steepest rate since late-2014, more and more companies are pulling back on hiring, and likely reviewing their investment spending.""
The news shook European stock and bond markets, and pushed the eurobelow $1.13 for the first time in 10 days. The Euro Stoxx 600 fell 0.5% to its lowest in a week, while the yield on the benchmark 10-year German government bond fell briefly below 0% for the first time since the autumn of 2016. It was at 0.00% by 05:30 AM ET (09:30 GMT)
The surveys suggest that the downturn in the Eurozone economy could be deeper and longer than feared, and cast doubt over whether the European Central Bank's recent announcement of new long-term loans for banks would be enough to turn the situation around.
""The ECB is unlikely to hit the panic button based on these data, even if the numbers will add to downside risks,"" said Nordea Markets' Jan van Gerich in a blog post. He pointed to the consolation that services had held up better than the manufacturing sector during the month. All the same, he said, ""If the outlook continues to weaken, the ECB will need to do much more"" than provide new two-year loans to banks.
At its last policy meeting on March 7, the European Central Bank pushed back its timeline for raising interest rates and announced a new round of low-cost funding to banks, known as TLTROs. It acknowledged that the downside risks to the economy had clearly risen on a combination of concerns ranging from new vehicle licensing rules in Germany to Brexit and the U.S.-trade war. Of those factors, only the first can confidently be said to have been largely resolved.

The Eurozone Composite Output Index, which measures the combined output of both the manufacturing and service sectors, fell to 51.3 this month, from 51.9 in February. That's because the services index only fell to 52.7 from 52.8 in February, in line with expectations.

1595,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 22, 2019 04:15AM ET</span>","BOJ tankan to show big manufacturers' mood weakest in two years, trim capex: Reuters poll","TOKYO (Reuters) - Confidence among Japan's big manufacturers likely weakened to the lowest in two years in the three months to March and it is seen worsening further over the next quarter, a Reuters poll showed on Friday, as China's economic slowdown added to worries about sluggish global demand.
The Bank of Japan's quarterly tankan business sentiment survey is expected to show the headline index for big manufacturers' confidence worsened to plus 14 in March from plus 19 in December, the poll of 18 economists found.
The sentiment index for big non-manufacturers slipped to plus 22 in March from plus 24, according to the poll, though a positive number means optimists still outnumber pessimists. 
""If the data shows worsening corporate sentiment and weak capital spending plans, market expectations for additional BOJ easing will increase,"" said Tsuyoshi Ueno, senior economist at NLI Research Institute.
Big manufacturers' business sentiment is seen worsening in the coming quarter to plus 12 and non-manufacturers' sentiment is likely to deteriorate to plus 20, the Reuters poll found.
Big companies were forecast to cut their capital spending plans by 0.4 percent for new fiscal year from April, the poll showed.
The Bank of Japan will publish its tankan survey at 8:50 a.m. Japan time on Monday April 1. (2350 GMT on March 31).
Reuters' monthly Tankan poll, which tracks the BOJ's closely watched tankan quarterly survey, found confidence among Japanese manufacturers hit its weakest in two-and-a-half years in March.
FACTORY OUTPUT AND RETAIL SALES 
Factory output is expected to rise 1.0 percent in February from the previous month, the first gain in four months, the poll showed. 
Recent drops in exports and industrial output prompted the BOJ to downgrade its views on them and the government cut its assessment on the economy for the first time in three years. 
""Factory output likely rebounded after it dropped in January due to the Lunar New Year Holiday, but the pace of recovery is weak on sluggish foreign demand for semiconductor-related items,"" said Takumi Tsunoda, senior economist at Shinkin Central Bank Research Institute.
Retail sales, which track performance of firms such as department stores, supermarkets and convenience stores, were seen rising 1.2 percent in February from a year earlier, twice the pace in January.
The trade ministry will publish the factory output and retail sales at 8:50 a.m. on Friday March 29, Japan time (2350 GMT March 28).
The poll also showed Tokyo's core consumer price index (CPI), which includes oil products but excludes fresh food prices, rose 1.1 percent in March from a year earlier, the same pace as in February and January. 
Price of electricity, city gas and oil related products likely supported Tokyo's core CPI, analysts said.
The nation's jobless rate likely remained steady at 2.5 percent in February and the jobs-to-applicants ratio stood at 1.63 last month, unchanged from January, the poll found. 
The government will release Tokyo's core CPI and jobs market data at 8:30 a.m. on Friday.

The annual all-items inflation rate was 0.4 percent in January.
A deflation in transport costs may have eased in February as both oil prices and vehicle quota premiums were higher on a month-on-month basis, said Jonathan Koh, an economist with  Standard Chartered  (LON:STAN). Food prices could also rise due to festive spending during the Lunar New Year. 
The poll of 11 economists also forecast the Monetary Authority of Singapore's (MAS) annual core inflation measure increased 1.7 percent in February, unchanged from the previous month.
The central bank's core inflation measure excludes changes in the prices of cars and accommodation, which are more heavily influenced by government policies.
Last month, Singapore cut its 2019 headline inflation forecast to 0.5-1.5 percent from 1-2 percent, citing an expected decline in global oil prices this year.
However, the core inflation forecast - a closely-watched indicator for monetary policy - was kept unchanged at 1.5-2.5 percent.

Singapore's central bank is due to make the first of its semi-annual policy announcements next month.

1597,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 21, 2019 11:25PM ET</span>",Japan's slowing inflation leaves BOJ fighting tough price battle,"By Leika Kihara
TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's annual core consumer inflation slowed in February as gasoline costs fell for the first time in more than two years, keeping the central bank under pressure to maintain, or even ramp up, stimulus to accelerate price growth to its 2 percent target.
The data adds to growing signs that Sino-U.S. trade tensions and slowing global demand are hurting Japan's economic expansion and business sentiment.
If the weakness persists, the Bank of Japan (BOJ) may be forced to cut its inflation forecasts again at next month's rate review, analysts say, though policymakers are wary of expanding an already massive stimulus program any time soon.
The nationwide core consumer price index (CPI), which includes oil products but excludes volatile fresh food costs, rose 0.7 percent in February from a year earlier, government data showed on Friday, falling short of a median market forecast for a 0.8 percent gain.
The slowdown from January's 0.8 percent increase was due largely to a 1.3 percent drop in gasoline prices, which was the first year-on-year decline since November 2016, the data showed.
""As overseas economies begin to weaken, it's hard to project inflation hitting the BOJ's 2 percent target,"" said Takeshi Minami, chief economist at Norinchukin Research Institute.
""The BOJ is likely to maintain its current policy at next month's rate review,"" though it could ponder additional easing at some point given the recent weak data, he said.
An index the BOJ focuses on - the so-called core-core CPI that strips away the effect of both volatile food and energy costs - rose 0.4 percent in February, unchanged from the previous month's gain.
The costs of labour and shipping are pushing up prices of food items such as soft drinks, yoghurt, ramen noodles and ice cream. However, frugal consumers are resisting price hikes, capping retail prices and underscoring an entrenched deflationary mindset that Japan has been trying to overcome for decades.
Companies like Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) Bottlers Japan Holdings Inc, Suntory Beverage & Food and potato chips maker Calbee Inc, have warned of falls in profits as the planned price hikes fail to cover rising upstream costs.
BOJ IN A BIND
The BOJ faces a dilemma. Years of heavy money printing have dried up market liquidity and hurt commercial banks' profits, stoking concerns over the rising risks of prolonged easing.
And yet, subdued inflation has left the BOJ well behind its U.S. and European counterparts in dialling back crisis-mode policies, and with a dearth of ammunition to battle an abrupt yen spike that could derail an export-driven economic recovery.
Further complicating the BOJ's struggle with low inflation, falling global bond yields in the wake of the U.S Federal Reserve's move to pause interest rate hikes for the rest of this year, have sent the JGB yield to 2-1/2 year lows.
The benchmark 10-year government bond yield fell below minus 0.050 percent to the lowest level since November 2016, making it more difficult for the central bank to ease policy further given the side-effects on financial institutions and market functions. 
BOJ Governor Haruhiko Kuroda has stressed the central bank will no longer ease policy just to fire up inflation, and focus instead on the momentum generated by the economy to push up prices.
The central bank earlier this month maintained its view that Japan's economy is expanding moderately, signaling that it was in no hurry to expand stimulus.

Yet that view is becoming increasingly tenuous. In March, the government downgraded its economic assessment for the first time in three years, nodding to growing signs of weakness in exports and output.

The economy also shrank 6.2 percent in the fourth quarter of the year, in line with analyst forecasts, but still the weakest quarterly performance since 2009. That followed a 3.5 percent dip in the quarter before.

1599,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 21, 2019 12:35PM ET</span>",U.S. services data suggests downward revision to fourth-quarter GDP,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. economic growth for the fourth quarter is likely to be revised lower after data on Thursday showed less consumer spending on services and business investment in intellectual property products than previously estimated.
The findings of the Commerce Department's quarterly services survey, or QSS, follow recent data showing a bigger trade deficit in December and weaker construction outlays than had been assumed in the government's initial fourth-quarter GDP report published last month. December retail sales were also softer than previously reported.
Before the QSS data, economists had expected that GDP growth for the October-December quarter would be cut to between a 2.0 percent and 2.3 percent annualized rate from the 2.6 percent pace reported last month.
Based on the QSS data, economists at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) estimated that fourth-quarter GDP could be cut to a 1.8 percent rate when the government publishes its revision next Thursday. According to JPMorgan economist Daniel Silver the revisions to fourth-quarter GDP would be centered around consumer spending and investment in intellectual property products.
""Within consumption, it appears that spending at nonprofit hospitals, which alone accounts for about five percent of consumption, is set to be revised down noticeably,"" said Silver.
Should economists' predictions prove correct, this would suggest a considerable loss of momentum in the economy that appears to have persisted early in the first quarter. Growth estimates for the first quarter are as low as a 0.4 percent rate.
The economy is losing speed as stimulus from a $1.5 trillion tax cut and increased government spending fades. Slowing global economies, a strong dollar and a trade war between the United States and China are weighing on exports.
""The U.S. economy enjoyed a banner year in 2018, juiced up by massive deficit-financed tax cuts for individuals and businesses and increases in government spending,"" said Abhilasha Singh, an economist at Moody's Analytics in West Chester, Pennsylvania.
""By late 2019, the fading effects of the fiscal stimulus, higher interest rates, slower immigration, and more limited trade will weigh on the economy and spending gains.""

1600,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 21, 2019 11:40AM ET</span>",U.S. labor market solid; manufacturing sector slowing,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The number of Americans filing applications for unemployment benefits fell more than expected last week, pointing to still strong labor market conditions, though the pace of job growth has slowed after last year's robust gains. 
Other data on Thursday showed a measure of factory activity in the mid-Atlantic region rebounding sharply this month after falling into negative territory in February for the first time in more than 2-1/2 years. But manufacturers' perceptions about the outlook were the least favorable in three years and their expectations for capital spending were also less upbeat.
These findings support the view that the manufacturing sector is slowing in line with softening economic growth.
The Federal Reserve held interest rates steady on Wednesday and its policymakers abandoned projections for further rate increases this year, noting that ""growth of economic activity has slowed from its solid rate in the fourth quarter.""
""The U.S. economy has clearly slowed and will cause job growth to moderate, which isn't alarming as long as it is orderly,"" said Ryan Sweet, a senior economist at Moody's Analytics in West Chester, Pennsylvania.
Initial claims for state unemployment benefits dropped 9,000 to a seasonally adjusted 221,000 for the week ended March 16, the Labor Department said on Thursday. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast claims falling to 225,000 in the latest week. Claims have been drifting in the middle of their 200,000-253,000 range this year.
The four-week moving average of initial claims, considered a better measure of labor market trends as it irons out week-to-week volatility, rose 1,000 to 225,000 last week.
The claims data covered the survey week for the nonfarm payrolls portion of March's employment. The four-week average of claims fell 11,000 between the February and March survey periods, suggesting a pickup in job growth after hiring almost stalled last month. 
Nonfarm payrolls increased by only 20,000 jobs in February, the fewest since September 2017. The slowdown followed big gains in December and January. Average job growth has moderated to about 165,500 per month from 223,250 per month in 2018. 
Despite the slowdown in employment growth, the labor market remains solid. The unemployment rate is at 3.8 percent and annual wage growth in February was the strongest since 2009.
The step-down in hiring reflects a shortage of workers and softening economic growth as the stimulus from a $1.5 trillion tax cut package fades. A trade war between the United States and China, slowing global growth and uncertainty over Britain's exit from the European Union are also hurting domestic activity.
EBBING MOMENTUM
The slow growth theme was also underscored by another report on Thursday from the Conference Board showing its leading economic index, which measures future U.S. economic activity, rose in February for the first time in five months. 
February's 0.2 percent increase in the leading indicator followed an unchanged reading in January. 
The leading indicator's growth rate has slowed in the past six months, which the Conference Board said suggested ""that while the economy will continue to expand in the near-term, its pace of growth could decelerate by year end.""
Gross domestic product estimates for the first quarter are as low as a 0.4 percent annualized rate. The economy grew at a 2.6 percent pace in the fourth quarter.
The dollar firmed against a basket of currencies while stocks on Wall Street rose. U.S. Treasury prices were generally higher.
In a third report on Thursday, the Philadelphia Fed said its business conditions index jumped to 13.7 in March from -4.1 in February, which was the first negative reading since May 2016.
But the survey's measure of new orders received by factories in the region, which covers eastern Pennsylvania, southern New Jersey and Delaware, rebounded moderately from negative territory in February and unsold goods piled up. 
In addition, the survey's six-month business conditions index dropped to a reading of 21.8 this month, the lowest since February 2016, from 31.3 in February. Its six-month capital expenditures index fell to a reading of 19.5 in March from 31.7 in the prior month. The index dropped below 20 for the first time since 2016.
""The details within the report were much more of a mixed bag, and more downbeat than one might think given the solid improvement in the headline reading,"" said Daniel Silver, an economist at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) in New York.
These readings are in line with other surveys showing signs of slowing national factory activity. A report from the New York Fed last week showed a gauge of factory activity in New York state dropped to a two-year low in March. 
The Philadelphia Fed survey also showed more factories experiencing difficulty finding workers, which could weigh on production in the future. Nearly 74 percent of the firms reported labor shortages, up from 63.8 percent last year. 

Just over half of the companies also reported they had positions that have remained vacant for more than 90 days. That compared to 47.8 percent in 2018.

The Philadelphia Federal Reserve said its manufacturing index rose in March, to a reading of 13.7 from -4.1 in February, which had been its lowest reading in two and a half years.
The consensus forecast had been for a reading of 4.6. Any reading above zero indicates improving conditions and below indicates worsening conditions.
“Most of the survey’s indexes for future conditions continued to moderate, but the firms remained generally optimistic about growth over the next six months,” the report noted.
With regard to future activity in the sector, new orders advanced to 1.9 in March, while the employment index was at 9.6 from last month’s reading of 14.5, indicating a slower pace of hiring.
Meanwhile, the prices paid index fell to 19.7 this month from 21.8.

Claims for the prior week were revised up to 230,000.
The four-week moving average was 225,000, a rise of 1,000 from the previous week. The monthly average is seen as a more accurate gauge of labor trends because it reduces volatility in the week-to-week data.
The report said continuing jobless claims for the week ended March 9 fell to 1.750 million from 1.777 million in the preceding week. These claims reflect people who recently lost their jobs and are already receiving benefits and are reported with a one-week lag."

While many U.K. data continue to show signs of strength, the Bank remains reluctant to raise interest rates while the risk of a disorderly Brexit remains. Prime Minister Theresa May will ask for a three-month extension of the U.K.’s plans to leave the European Union at today's EU summit but whether or not the EU will grant an extension remains to be seen.
""The economic outlook will continue to depend significantly on the nature and timing of EU withdrawal, in particular: the new trading arrangements between the European Union and the United Kingdom; whether the transition to them is abrupt or smooth; and how households, businesses and financial markets respond,"" the Bank said in its statement.
Looking through the Brexit uncertainty, the Bank indicated an ongoing bias to tightening policy “at a gradual pace and to a limited extent,"" while admitting that its response to Brexit “could be in either direction”.
Recent data have shown inflation still below the BoE target rate, although the consumer price index rose unexpectedly in February to 1.9%.

OSLO (Reuters) - Norway's central bank raised its main interest rate on Thursday, as expected, and said its next hike may come earlier then previously planned, strengthening the crown currency against the euro.
The bank raised its key policy rate to 1.0 percent from 0.75 percent previously, in line with the forecast of 23 out of 26 economists in a Reuters poll.
Norges Bank's approach stands in contrast to those of the U.S. Federal Reserve, the European Central Bank and others in Europe, which are keeping rates on hold due to rising uncertainty about the prospects for the global economy. 
""Our current assessment of the outlook and balance of risks suggests that the policy rate will most likely be increased further in the course of the next half-year"", said Governor Oeystein Olsen.
""The rate path shows a greater probability of a rate hike than of an unchanged rate in June,"" he added. 
The new rate path shows the bank sees rates averaging 1.1 percent in 2019, against 1.0 percent seen previously, and 1.6 percent in 2020, against 1.4 percent before.
Following the unanimous decision, Norway's currency, the crown, surged over one percent against the euro to trade at 9.6010 at 0913 GMT and was pushing toward its biggest one-day gain in over a year. 
""As expected Norges Bank hiked the key rate today. The rate path was lifted in the front and indicates the next hike already at the June meeting,"" Nordea Markets analyst Joachim Bernhardsen said in a note.
Oil-rich Norway stands alone among other developed economies in tightening monetary policy, thanks to rising crude prices and higher-than-anticipated economic growth and inflation. 
On Wednesday, the U.S. Federal Reserve brought its three-year drive to tighten monetary policy to an abrupt end, abandoning projections for any interest rate hikes this year amid signs of an economic slowdown, and saying it would halt the steady decline of its balance sheet in September.
On Thursday, the Swiss National Bank kept in place its ultra-loose monetary policy, as anticipated by economists, and later in the day the Bank of England is also expected to announce unchanged rates amid continued uncertainty over Brexit.
Norges Bank raised its growth forecasts for 2019 and 2020 while predicting a sharper slowdown in the two following years, from 2.7 percent expansion this year to just 1.1 percent growth in 2022.

""How to balance global vs domestic factors? Front-load rate hikes in the path and take a wait-and-see approach regarding the long-end. Well done Norges Bank!"" tweeted Erica Blomgren, fixed income strategist at SEB.

LONDON (Reuters) - British retailers racked up surprisingly strong sales last month, reinforcing how spending by consumers is a bright spot for the economy ahead of Brexit.
Retail sales grew by an annual 4.0 percent in February, the top end of a range of forecasts by economists in a Reuters poll, and down only slightly from January's two-year high of 4.1 percent, official data showed on Thursday.
Mild weather last month boosted spending at garden centers and on sporting equipment, offsetting a fall in spending at supermarkets and in clothing stores after sales promotions in January, the Office for National Statistics said.
Sterling pared some early losses on the news.
""It is possible that some consumers brought forward purchases amid concern prices could rise if a disruptive Brexit at the end of March sees sterling weaken sharply,"" Howard Archer of economic consultancy EY ITEM Club said.
Consumer spending has been a source of strength for the world's fifth-largest economy at a time when businesses say that Brexit uncertainty is forcing them to postpone investment and a slower global economy is hurting export demand. 
Prime Minister Theresa May urged lawmakers on Wednesday to back her Brexit plan, which they have rejected twice. If she fails again next week, Britain could leave the EU on March 29 without a transition deal to cushion the economic shock. 
Thursday's data showed sales volumes in February alone rose 0.4 percent versus a forecast of a decline in the Reuters poll.
Annual sales growth for the three months to February was its strongest in over two years.
Falling inflation, a steady rise in wages and the lowest unemployment since 1975 have all boosted household incomes over the past year, though wages are still below their peak before the financial crisis after factoring in inflation.
Earlier on Thursday, British clothing chain Next reported a small fall in annual profit, hurt by lower store sales, and it forecast another decline for this year, but said Brexit was not to blame.
PUBLIC BORROWING FALLS
Separate figures from the ONS showed the government was likely to meet its updated borrowing goals for the 2018/19 financial year, as Britain's jobs boom boosted income tax revenue.
Public borrowing for February, the 11th month of the tax year, fell to 0.2 billion pounds ($0.3 billion) from 1.2 billion pounds a year earlier, below economists' average forecast of 0.6 billion pounds in a Reuters poll.
With just one month remaining of the current financial year, government borrowing totaled 23.1 billion pounds, down 44 percent from the same point in 2017/18 and the lowest since 2001/02, though these figures are likely to be revised further.
Last week Britain's official budget forecasters cut their 2018/19 borrowing forecast to 22.8 billion pounds or 1.1 percent of GDP from 25.5 billion pounds.
Finance minister Philip Hammond said at the time that if Brexit went smoothly there would be more money available at a multi-year spending review due late this year.

""Hammond has capacity to increase spending on under-pressure public services, while potentially also cutting taxes.... However he, like the rest of us, is waiting to see what happens with Brexit,"" said Martin Wheatcroft, an advisor to the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales (ICAEW).

1606,By Bloomberg,"<span>Mar 21, 2019 06:00AM ET</span>",SNB Cuts Inflation Forecast Amid Dovish Tilt by Central Banks,"(Bloomberg) -- The Swiss National Bank kept interest rates at rock bottom, cut its inflation forecasts again and warned that the global slowdown could worsen.
A dramatic change in fortune for the world economy is making it harder for policy makers across major economies to boost price pressures. In Switzerland, the franc’s strength against the euro has exacerbated the issue, which the central bank has sought to counter with the world’s lowest interest rates and occasional currency interventions.
On Wednesday, U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell called the battle with anemic inflation “one of the major challenges of our time.” The European Central Bank said in its economic bulletin on Thursday that underlying euro-area inflation remains “muted.”
The SNB, which held its deposit rate at minus 0.75 percent, cut its inflation outlook for a fourth straight meeting, reiterated its intervention pledge and again labeled the franc “highly valued.” It forecasts that price growth will average just 0.3 percent percent this year and 0.6 percent in 2020.
“With this low inflation forecast, the SNB is sending a very dovish signal and is adopting the same course as the Fed and the ECB,” said Daniel Hartmann, an economist at Bantleon Bank in Zug. “An increase in the policy rate is not to be expected in Switzerland for the foreseeable future.”
Coupled with stubbornly weak price pressure, soft economic data have prompted central banks around the world to rethink their next policy steps. Powell predicts that U.S. interest rates could be on hold for “some time” and the ECB has committed to keeping borrowing costs unchanged at least through the end of this year.
The franc was little changed at 1.13235 per euro as of 10:35 a.m. Zurich time.
For the past two months, it’s mostly traded within a range of 1.13-1.14, though increased investor anxiety about a cliff-edge Brexit or other political tensions could boost it again. The SNB spent 2.3 billion francs ($2.3 billion) intervening in currency markets in 2018, a fraction of the 48 billion francs spent the previous year.
Despite the downbeat outlook for inflation and warnings about global risks, the SNB kept its 2019 growth prediction at around 1.5 percent. Unemployment was low, production capacity well utilized and data suggested a moderate expansion, it said.

Sales had risen 1% in January and economists polled by Investing.com had forecast a reading of -0.4% for the month.
Retail sales were up 4% from a year earlier, the Office for National Statistics said on Thursday, also ahead of expectations for a rise of 3.3%
A fall in food sales was offset by growth in other sectors, the ONS said. Food stores had the strongest decline since December 2016, falling -1.5% after an increase of 0.9% in January. 
Analysts at Capital Economics in London said there was ""little sign"" of a Brexit effect on retail sales. ""The monthly 0.4% increase means that even if there is a large 1% (monthly) fall in March, retail sales will contribute more to GDP in (the first quarter) than in the final quarter of last year,"" Capital said via its Twitter account.



The strong data come ahead of the Bank of England’s monetary policy decisions later in the day, where it is expected to leave interest rates unchanged against a backdrop of rising uncertainty over Brexit. Prime Minister Theresa May will ask for a three-month extension of the U.K.’s plans to leave the European Union at today's EU summit but whether or not the EU will grant an extension remains to be seen.
Inflation in the U.K. rose in February but still remains below the BoE’s inflation target. However, the labor market still appears strong. U.K. jobs data released earlier this week showed job creation at its strongest since 2015 in January, while wages rose at their fastest pace since the financial crisis. The retail sales data appear to be consistent with those from the labor market, but both sets are at odds with anecdotal reports of declining confidence as Brexit approaches."

“Our current assessment of the outlook and balance of risks suggests that the policy rate will most likely be increased further in the course of the next half-year,” central bank Governor Oystein Olsen said in a statement on Thursday. Norges Bank, which is based in Oslo, raised its deposit rate by a quarter point to 1 percent, as expected by most economists.
The krone soared as much as 1.1 percent against the euro after the announcement, as markets took note of the very different monetary trajectory that Norway appears to be on versus its western counterparts.
Breaking Away
The picture in Norway is far removed from that in the euro zone and even neighboring Sweden, where central banks have had to take a more cautious approach toward tightening amid mixed economic signals. On Wednesday, the U.S. Federal Reserves signaled it won’t tighten policy at all in 2019, reflecting concerns over slowing growth.
Norway’s economy, which is backed by the world’s biggest sovereign wealth fund, is growing faster than a lot of its peers. Unemployment is below 4 percent and inflation is above target. What’s more, the krone has so far remained weak despite the country’s economic strength, which has given the central bank room to raise interest rates without hurting exports.
“The upturn in the Norwegian economy appears to be stronger than anticipated earlier,” the central bank said. “On the other hand, there are prospects for weaker growth and lower interest rates abroad.” The bank’s forecast for the pace of monetary tightening in Norway “indicates a slightly faster rate rise in 2019 and a somewhat lower policy rate further out” than signaled previously, it said.
“The Norwegian economy is expanding at a solid pace, and capacity utilization now appears to be slightly above a normal level,” Norges Bank said. “Underlying inflation is a little higher than the inflation target.”
“The uncertainty surrounding global developments and the effects of monetary policy suggests a cautious approach to interest rate setting,” the bank also said. “Overall, the outlook and the balance of risks imply a gradual interest rate increase ahead.”

JAKARTA (Reuters) - Indonesia's central bank, welcoming the Federal Reserve's forecast of no U.S. rate hikes this year, on Thursday kept its benchmark on hold to maintain financial stability while tweaking some rules to try to encourage more lending.
Bank Indonesia (BI) held its 7-day reverse repurchase rate steady at 6.00 percent, where it has been since November, as expected by all 20 analysts in a Reuters poll.
The decision came hours after the Fed abandoned projections for any rate hikes this year, sending the rupiah up 0.4 percent on Thursday.
Governor Perry Warjiyo told reporters after the meeting that global developments, including the Fed's latest statement, ""will be more positive for capital inflows to emerging markets, including Indonesia.""
BI was one of Asia's most aggressive central banks last year, raising the benchmark rate six times by 175 basis points to respond to the Fed's four rate hikes and to counter outflows that kept the rupiah under pressure for most of 2018. 
This year, the rupiah has been generally appreciating due to inflows to Indonesia's equity and bond markets as major central banks around the world turned dovish.
BI still expected one more rate hike by the Fed through 2020, but sees the rupiah being stable this year, Warjiyo said.
""This is a 'dovish hold', said Satria Sambijantoro, an economist at Bahana Sekuritas in Jakarta. ""BI signaled its readiness to support credit expansion, with tweaks on some macroprudential policy measures to support liquidity in the banking system."" 
BI will raise the guidance for where it wants banks to maintain its financing-to-funding ratio to a 84-94 percent range, from 80-92 percent range, effective July 1.
Warjiyo said the measure, which allows banks to manage a slightly higher liquidity ratio without being penalized, was aimed at getting banks to lend more.
LENDING LIFT
Meanwhile, he said BI had also been adding liquidity to the financial system since December through open market operations, estimating the cash injected so far at 459 trillion rupiah ($32.51 billion).
While banks on aggregate had ""more than enough"" liquidity, he said smaller banks were facing difficulties to expand lending due to funding constraints.
Warjiyo said the new moves would help accelerate lending growth to the upper end of the 10-12 percent outlook in 2019, without hurting stability.
Even so, BI still sees economic growth this year remaining in a range of 5.0-5.4 percent. 
The latest measures announced by BI indicated it ""was in little hurry to change interest rates,"" Capital Economics said, predicting no change in the benchmark rate this year.
In February, the annual inflation rate cooled to 2.57 percent, the slowest in nearly a decade and just above the lower end of BI's 2.5-4.5 target range for 2019. Warjiyo said inflation will remain within target until the end of the year.

The Philippine central bank, the second Southeast Asian one holding a policy meeting right after the Fed's, also kept its benchmark rate on hold, as expected.

1610,By Bloomberg,"<span>Mar 21, 2019 12:30AM ET</span>","New Zealand's Economic Growth Picks Up, Easing Rate-Cut Bets","(Bloomberg) -- New Zealand’s economy expanded at a faster pace in the fourth quarter, easing concerns of a pronounced slowdown that could force the central bank to cut interest rates.
Gross domestic product rose 0.6 percent, driven by construction and services spending and up from 0.3 percent in the third quarter, Statistics New Zealand said Thursday in Wellington. While the growth matched economists’ median forecast, the annual pace slowed more than expected to 2.3 percent, the weakest since 2013.
New Zealand’s dollar climbed almost half a U.S. cent after the release as investors scaled back bets on a cut to the official cash rate later this year. The Reserve Bank has said it isn’t planning to raise borrowing costs until early 2021 amid benign inflation and slowing global growth.
“The economy lost some momentum over the second half of last year, but not to the extent that we thought,” said Michael Gordon, senior economist at Westpac Banking Corp. in Auckland, which expected a quarterly expansion of just 0.3 percent. “That gives us a bit more comfort about our view that the growth momentum will pick up again this year.”
The kiwi dollar bought 69.20 cents at 1:19 p.m. in Wellington, compared with about 68.70 before the report. The currency had already surged just hours earlier as the U.S. Federal Reserve surprised markets by signaling it would pause interest-rate increases this year after previously projecting two hikes.
The chance of an RBNZ rate cut by November edged down to 48 percent from 52 percent, according to swaps data compiled by Bloomberg.
Quarterly growth was slower than the 0.8 percent projected by the Reserve Bank in its February policy statement.
“With GDP growth slowing over 2018 by more than the RBNZ had expected, and with downside risks to 2019 growth accumulating, there is still the risk of an OCR cut in 2019,” said Jane Turner, senior economist at ASB Bank in Auckland. Still, “the next likely move is a hike in 2021,” she said.

1611,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 20, 2019 10:20PM ET</span>","Australian jobless rate hits near eight-year low, tempering rate cut bets","SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia's jobless rate fell to a near eight-year low in February as a bumper run in employment extended, sending the local dollar sharply higher on expectations the country's central bank won't cut interest rates any time soon.
A total 4,600 net new jobs were created in February with all of the increase led by part-time work, according to the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) report on Thursday.
Although February's performance was a pale shadow to the downwardly revised 38,300 employment growth recorded the previous month, the data showed the overall trend in the labor market was still positive.
Australia is creating jobs at a brisk annual pace of 2.3 percent, faster than the 1.6 percent rise in population.
Even so, the participation rate fell to 65.6 percent from 65.7 percent as fewer people went looking for work. That sent the jobless rate to the lowest since June 2011 at 4.9 percent.
The Australian dollar jumped 0.6 percent to $0.7155, near a one-month high as the data tempered market expectations that the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) would cut the benchmark interest rate from its current record low.
The employment report has become increasingly important for monetary policy as the country's central bank is counting on labor market strength for a long-awaited pick up in wage growth and inflation in the face of a property market downturn. 
The RBA has held the cash rate at an all-time low of 1.50 percent for 2-1/2 years now and just last month switched away from its long-held tightening bias to a more neutral stance.
Yet, leading indicators of labor demand point to a slowdown in employment growth. Business confidence and conditions have pulled back from peaks touched last year and the number of job advertisements have declined.
Separate data out on Wednesday showed an index of vacancies released by Australia's department of jobs and small business eased in February for the second consecutive month, although there still was a healthy 179,100 skilled job vacancies advertised across the country.
For now, the RBA will take solace from the lower unemployment rate and still-strong jobs growth, even though the overall economy has hit a soft patch.

British wage growth rose to its highest in a decade at the end of last year at 3.5 percent, and the Bank of England sees only a slight slowdown in 2019 as employers struggle to find staff in the face of the lowest unemployment in decades.
XpertHR, a company that collates data on pay settlements at large employers, said firms it surveyed expected on average to award pay rises of 2.5 percent this year.
Before 2018, 2 percent was the standard pay rise offered.
Britain's official measure of average weekly earnings growth usually exceed typical pay settlements as it also includes pay rises workers get through job moves and promotions. 
""Based on the pay activities of employers so far this year and the increases planned, 2.5 percent looks set to be the benchmark pay award across the economy for 2019,"" XpertHR pay and benefits editor Sheila Attwood said.
The BoE cites a tight labor market and weak productivity growth as the main reasons why it will need to raise interest rates over the medium term, though for now Brexit is keeping its rate rise plans on hold.
XpertHR said firms were offering higher pay in order to match their competitors and to tackle recruitment and retention issues, while higher mandatory employer pension contributions and Brexit uncertainty were factors weighing on pay.
""Some (staff) will have to wait until beyond their normal review date as a number of employers are delaying a decision until the impact of Brexit on their business can be fully assessed,"" the report said.

Prime Minister Theresa May asked the European Union on Wednesday to allow Britain to delay Brexit until June 30 and EU leaders are expected to discuss the matter at a summit on Thursday. The decision must be taken unanimously by all remaining 27 EU members.

BRASILIA (Reuters) - Brazil's central bank kept its benchmark interest rate at a record low 6.50 percent on Wednesday, as expected, while noting that recent economic data has been weaker than expected and that inflation risks are no longer skewed to the upside. 
The bank's nine-member monetary policy committee, known as Copom, voted unanimously to keep the benchmark Selic rate unchanged for the eighth straight meeting, as forecast by all 21 economists in a Reuters poll. [BR/INT]
In a sign that new central bank chief Roberto Campos Neto will stay the steady course set out by his predecessor, Copom repeated a line from recent policy statements that policy is best determined with ""caution, serenity and perseverance.""
In a shift from its February statement, however, Copom said on Wednesday that risks to inflation are symmetrical. Six weeks ago the committee said inflation risks were skewed to the upside but moderating. 
""Recent data on economic activity came in below expectations,"" policymakers said in their statement.
""On the one hand, the high level of economic slack may lead to a lower-than-expected prospective inflation trajectory. On the other hand, frustration of expectations regarding the continuation of reforms...may affect risk premia and increase the path for inflation over the relevant horizon,"" they said

Copom has long stressed the importance of economic reforms and adjustments - the biggest of which is an overhaul of social security recently presented in Congress - to keep inflation anchored and improve the outlook for Brazil's economy.

1614,By Investing.com,"<span>Mar 20, 2019 02:54PM ET</span>","Fed Holds Rates Steady, Eyes End to Balance Sheet Unwind in September","Investing.com - The Federal Reserve left interest rates unchanged on Wednesday and said it would stop its balance-sheet reduction program in September amid concerns over slowing growth both domestically and abroad.
The Federal Open Market Committee left its overnight funds rate in a range of 2.25% to 2.5%.
The decision on rates was widely expected as Federal Reserve members, including Chairman Jerome Powell, have repeatedly stressed that a wait-and-see approach was needed to assess the health of the U.S. economy.
But in an unexpected move the Federal Reserve also signaled that no rate hikes would be appropriate for 2019.
Members of the rate-setting committee reduced their 2019 median forecast for interest rates to 2.4% from a previous estimate of 2.9%, hinting at no rate hikes for 2019. That's below the two rate hikes previously indicated in the Fed's December projections. Fed watchers had only expected the Federal Reserve to lower its expectations to a single rate hike for this year.
The interest-rate outlook for both 2020 and 2021 were lowered to 2.6% from 3.1% previously, while the longer-run interest rate was maintained at 2.8%. That has raised investor expectations the central bank may be close to reaching neutral, a level of rates that neither stimulates nor restricts the economy.
On the balance sheet, the Fed said it will begin in May to reduce the amount of proceeds -- received from securities on its balance sheet -- it allows to roll off each month and will halt the program in September.
The Fed has been allowing as much as $50 billion a month of maturing securities to roll off its balance sheet, which peaked at roughly $4.5 trillion in Jan. 2015, but has now narrowed to about $4 trillion.
""The FOMC more than reinforced market expectations of an extended pause, if not possible end, to the tightening cycle,"" BMO said in a note.
The dovish outlook on monetary policy was attributed to signs of slowing U.S. economic growth even as the labor market remains strong. Fed policymakers cut their outlook on U.S. economic growth for 2019 and beyond.
""Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in January indicates that the labor market remains strong but that growth of economic activity has slowed from its solid rate in the fourth quarter,"" the Fed said in a statement.
The economy is expected to grow by 2.1% in 2019, down from a previous estimate of 2.3%, and by 1.9% in 2020, down from 2% previously, the Fed's Summary of Economic Projections showed.
In the run-up to the Fed decision, some market participants had called on the Fed to consider cutting rates as the central bank's two-pronged mission - to achieve maximum employment and stable inflation - shows signs of vulnerability.
The central bank estimates the pace of inflation, meanwhile, to cool to a rate of 1.8% in 2019, down from a previous estimate of 1.9%. While core-PCE inflation for both 2019 and 2020 is expected to meet the Fed's 2% target.
The unemployment rate for 2019 was raised to 3.7% from 3.5%.
The most recent nonfarm payroll report showed the U.S. economy created just 20,000 jobs in February, though the unemployment rate at 3.8% remains near its lowest level in five decades.
Core PCE, the Fed's preferred measure of inflation, has remained shy of the central bank's 2% target for at least three months."

The Washington-based industry group's seasonally adjusted index on mortgage activity edged up 1.6 percent to 390.0 in the week ended March 15. This was the highest reading since 400.6 in the week of Jan. 18. 
Interest rates on 30-year fixed-rate mortgages with conforming loan balances of $484,350 or less decreased to 4.55 percent, the lowest since the Feb. 2, 2018 week. They averaged 4.64 percent a week earlier.
The decline in the average conforming mortgage rate was the steepest in about 2-1/2 months. 
Other mortgage rates that MBA tracks fell 2 basis points to 10 basis points from the previous week.
Domestic home borrowing costs fell in step with lower U.S. Treasury yields. 
""Mortgage rates declined once again, as concerns about the slowing global economy and status of Brexit continued to drive investors’ demand for U.S. Treasuries, ultimately pushing yields lower,” Joel Kan, associate vice president of economic and industry forecasting, said in a statement, referring to Britain's exit from the European Union.
Benchmark 10-year Treasury yields were at 2.589 percent in early Wednesday trading, 2 basis points lower than on Tuesday and a week ago, Refinitiv data showed.
The bulk of the pickup in applications stemmed from demand for home refinancing.
MBA's index on refinancing rose 3.5 percent to 1,146.8 last week, which was the strongest since the week of Jan. 11.
The share of refinancing versus total applications grew to 39.3 percent from 38.6 percent a week earlier.
On the other hand, MBA's barometer on loan applications for home purchases, seen as a proxy on future housing activity, ticked up only 0.3 percent to 251.5, the highest since the week of Feb. 1.
“Entry-level housing supply remains weak and is likely hindering some would-be first-time buyers from finding a home,"" Kan said.

1617,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 20, 2019 06:02AM ET</span>","UK inflation ticks up, house prices in London fall by most since 2009","LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's main inflation rate ticked up last month but stayed close to January's two-year low, helping consumers maintain their spending power even as Brexit remained uncertain.
Wednesday's official data also showed house prices rose at the weakest annual pace seen in five-and-a-half years, dragged by London prices falling by the most since September 2009 -- just after the low point of the global financial crisis.
Consumer prices rose at an annual rate of 1.9 percent in February after a 1.8 percent increase in January, the Office for National Statistics said. A Reuters poll of economists had pointed to a rate of 1.8 percent. 
But core inflation, which strips out volatile food and energy prices, edged down, leaving the overall picture of domestic price pressures in Britain muted ahead of Brexit.
The weakening of inflation, combined with the lowest unemployment rate in 44 years and rising wages, has taken the edge off the uncertainty about Brexit for many households whose spending drives Britain's economy.
Data due for release on Thursday are expected to show retail sales grew by an annual 3.3 percent last month, weaker than immediately before the Brexit referendum in 2016 but above its average for much of the last decade.
Britain's modest inflation rate is also helping the Bank of England as it holds off on fresh interest rate hikes while it waits for the outcome of Britain's Brexit impasse.
A group of officials at the central bank have said over the past couple of weeks that they want to see firm evidence of domestic inflation pressure building before they vote to raise rates.
""The rate of inflation is stable, with a modest rise in food as well as alcohol and tobacco offset by clothing and footwear prices rising by less than they did a year ago,"" ONS statistician Mike Hardie said.
The ONS said house prices in January rose by an annual 1.7 percent across the United Kingdom as a whole, the smallest increase since June 2013, when Britain was still struggling to shake off the effects of the global financial crisis.
Prices in London alone fell by 1.6 percent, marking 11 months where prices have not risen. The ONS said prices in the capital were down 3.3 percent from their recent peak in June 2017.

U.K. CPI increased 1.9% from the year before, surprising economists who had forecast it to hold steady at January’s reading of 1.8%, which had been its lowest since December 2016.
Although current levels of inflation, coupled with the political and economic uncertainty surrounding the U.K.’s departure from the European Union, underline the case for the BoE to leave monetary policy unchanged on Thursday, a solid labor market is illustrating that there is a case for raising them, too.
Jobs data released this week showed not only the strongest job creation since 2015 in January but confirmed that wages rose at their fastest pace since the financial crisis.
ING chief international economist James Knightley referred to the jobs data as “astonishingly strong” on Tuesday. “If the government gets a long Brexit extension, a Bank of England rate hike is clearly on the table for the summer,” he said."

SEOUL (Reuters) - Confidence among Asian companies held near three-year lows in the first quarter as a U.S.-China trade dispute dragged on, pulling down a global economy that is already on a downward path, a Thomson Reuters/INSEAD survey found.
The Thomson Reuters/INSEAD Asian Business Sentiment Index tracking firms' six-month outlook was flat in the March quarter from the previous quarter's 63, compared with a near three-year low of 58 set in the September quarter.
A reading above 50 means optimistic respondents outnumbered pessimists, but the latest index still marks one of the five worst since the world started its recovery from the 2008-2009 global financial crisis.
""Things have not gotten worse but a lot of uncertainty is putting companies in wait-and-see mode,"" Antonio Fatas, a Singapore-based economics professor at global business school INSEAD, said of U.S.-China talks on trade relations.
""In one week, it looks like they are promising and the week after it looks like they are going nowhere, and so there's a lot of wait-and-see attitude,"" he added, saying the uncertainty is forcing companies to put off investment decisions.
A global trade war was cited as the chief business risk by respondents for the third quarter in a row, though by a smaller margin. Higher interest rates emerged as the second-biggest risk, outpacing a slowing Chinese economy.
A total of 100 companies from a range of sectors responded to the survey, conducted from March 1-15 in 11 Asia-Pacific countries where 45 percent of the world's population live and 32 percent of global gross domestic product is generated.
RECESSION UNLIKELY, POLITICS A RISK
The United States and China have put on hold a planned escalation of their trade war pending negotiations, but the much-awaited conclusion of the latest round of talks has also been delayed even though remarks from the two sides have been optimistic.
Global agencies including the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) have said failure to resolve trade tension could further slow a downward-trending global economy.
Regional powerhouses China, Japan and South Korea all saw exports fall last month, with China and South Korea suffering their worst annual declines in overseas sales in around three years.
The index staying above the neutral point of 50 suggests companies in Asia are not expecting an imminent global recession, but languishing near multi-year lows indicates companies are exerting caution.
""We don't see a global hard landing as a likely scenario when we look at economic factors such as inflation and credit conditions,"" said Young Sun Kwon, economist at Nomura in Hong Kong. ""But there are big uncertainties in politics.""
Lessons from the 2008-2009 global financial meltdown have forced countries to strengthen economic defenses, but factors such as Britain's planned exit from the European Union and the U.S. Federal Reserve's uncertain path are posing threats.
With less than two weeks before the March 29 divorce date, British Prime Minister Theresa May's government is still struggling to push a departure deal with the EU through the British parliament.
In the United States, the Fed has declared a pause in its tightening campaign, but economists foresee at least one more increase later this year despite increasing signs of slowdown in major economies.
Respondents to the survey included Canon Inc, Suzuki Motor Corp, Thai Beverage PCL, Metropolitan Bank and Trust Co and Delta Electronics Thailand PCL.

1620,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 19, 2019 08:05PM ET</span>",Australia's falling home prices not yet a threat to banks: RBA,"By Wayne Cole
SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia's falling home prices and high levels of household debt are not yet a threat to financial stability, a top central banker said on Wednesday, though there were risks to developers from a glut of new apartments.
In a speech in Perth, Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) Assistant Governor Michele Bullock also cautioned banks not to go too far in curbing the supply of credit to the economy.
""From a financial stability perspective, prudent lending standards are a good thing,"" Bullock told a conference on urban planning. ""But there needs to be a balance.""
""The regulators are not proposing any further tightening in lending standards,"" she added. ""And the appropriate amount of credit risk is not zero – banks need to continue to lend and that will inevitably involve some credit losses.""
The banks use of stricter standards on mortgages has been blamed for exacerbating a downturn in home prices, in large part by curbing investment loans.
However, Bullock said evidence suggested it was not so much tighter credit that was driving down prices as a weakening in demand for loans.
Since peaking in mid-2017, house prices across Australia have dropped by around 7 percent, with steeper falls in Sydney and Melbourne.
Bullock said the decline in prices coupled with record high levels of household debt were not as yet a threat to financial stability more broadly.
""The impacts are not large enough to result in widespread problems in the financial sector,"" she said.
Most of the debt was well secured against property, even with the decline in house prices, and repayments as a share of income remained steady. Arrears rates were low and banks were well capitalized.
""Broadly, the debt is held by households that can afford to service it,"" said Bullock.
One area of risk was in apartments, where a large amount of new supply was coming on the market that could put further downward pressure on prices.
""Currently, the risks here appear to be elevated but contained,"" said Bullock. 

The bank's liaison suggested that settlement failures had not increased much and some developers were in a position to hold and rent unsold apartments, she added.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Confidence among Japanese manufacturers hit its weakest in two-and-a-half years in March, a Reuters poll showed, as global trade friction fueled concerns that a postwar record growth cycle driven by Abenomics may be over.
The monthly poll, which tracks the Bank of Japan's (BOJ) closely watched tankan quarterly survey, found confidence fell for a fifth straight month while sentiment in the service sector held steady, suggesting domestic demand is unlikely to offset external risks such as the trade war and China's slowdown.
Both manufacturers' and service-sector morale is expected to rise just slightly over the coming three months, underscoring a bumpy road ahead for the world's third largest economy, according to the Reuters Tankan.
The central bank will closely read the results of its official tankan due out April 1 for clues on strength of sentiment and capital expenditure at its policy meeting next month when it issues fresh economic and price projections.
The BOJ stood pat at its policy review last week, citing an economy posting gradual growth, but cut its views of exports and output due to increasing headwinds from overseas.
Slowing growth in Europe and China, the Sino-U.S. trade war and uncertainty surrounding Britain's exit from the European Union have strained businesses around the world.
While U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping appear to be closer in striking a truce in the U.S.-China trade war, Japan's export sector remains vulnerable to the fallout from trade friction between the world's two largest economies.
In the Reuters poll of 479 large- and mid-sized companies, completed by 250 firms on the condition of anonymity over the March 4-15 period, managers also complained about costs of raw materials squeezing profits.
Sluggish consumer spending makes it difficult to pass on such costs to thrifty customers, they wrote in the survey.
""Our clients are turning cautions on capital expenditure due to the U.S.-China trade war, spreading protectionism and political jitters in emerging countries,"" a manager of a machinery maker wrote in the survey.
The Reuters Tankan sentiment index for manufacturers fell three points to 10 in March, with exporters of electronics, precision equipment, steel and nonferrous metals especially gloomy.
The manufacturers' index was down 13 points from three months ago, indicating the possibility of a similarly sharp decline in the BOJ tankan. The Reuters Tankan index is expected to inch up to 11 in June.
The service-sector index held steady at 22 in March from a month earlier but was down from 31 seen three months ago, indicating a likely decline for the sector in the official tankan, which measures confidence on a quarterly basis.
The service-sector index is seen edging up to 23 in June.
The BOJ's last tankan out in December found the business mood held steady from three months ago, but business conditions were seen worsening ahead amid trade war and slowdown in China.

The Reuters Tankan indexes are calculated by subtracting the percentage of pessimistic respondents from optimistic ones. A positive figure means optimists outnumber pessimists.

The euro zone's second-biggest economy is set to post growth of 0.4 percent in both the first and second quarters, up from 0.3 percent in the final three months of last year, INSEE forecast in its quarterly economic outlook.
The economy would have grown 0.4 percent at the end of last year as well if it were not for the impact of the yellow vest anti-government unrest, which INSEE estimated at 0.1 percentage point.
Protests in December saw some of the worst street violence in Paris in decades with rioters rampaging through upmarket neighborhoods, smashing store windows and burning cars.
With the exception of a flare-up last weekend, the violence has largely subsided since President Emmanuel Macron offered concessions in December worth more than 10 billion euros ($11.3 billion) in a package intended to boost the incomes of the poorest workers and pensioners.
INSEE said higher incomes would help consumer spending rebound 0.5 percent in the first quarter after flatlining at the end of last year in the face of the unrest, which forced many stores in central Paris to be boarded up during the peak holiday shopping period.
Business investment was also expected to recover in the first half of the year as confidence firmed albeit not to rates seen before a slowdown at the end of last year.
INSEE saw a limited impact to the French economy from Britain's departure from the European Union, in theory still planned for the end of the month.
It estimated an orderly Brexit would knock a cumulative 0.3 percent off French growth over several quarters, while the impact could be as much as 0.6 percent if London failed to reach a Brexit deal with the EU and tariffs were raised.

That was much less than impact INSEE estimated for Ireland (-1.4 to -4.1 percent) and Germany (-0.5 percent to -0.9 percent), as both countries are closer trade partners with Britain that France.

1623,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 19, 2019 12:05PM ET</span>",U.S. factory orders barely rise; shipments fall further,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - New orders for U.S.-made goods rose less than expected in January and shipments fell for a fourth straight month, offering more evidence of a slowdown in manufacturing activity.
Factory goods orders edged up 0.1 percent, the Commerce Department said on Tuesday, held back by decreases in orders for computers and electronic products, after rising by the same margin in December.
There were also declines in demand for primary metals and fabricated metal products. 
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast factory orders rising 0.3 percent in January. Factory orders increased 3.8 percent compared to January 2018. 
Shipments of factory goods fell 0.4 percent after dropping 0.2 percent in December. They have now declined for four consecutive months, the longest streak since mid-2015.
Factory orders are likely to remain soft as unfilled orders rose only 0.1 percent in January after dropping for three straight months. 
Stocks at manufacturers jumped 0.5 percent in January after edging up 0.1 percent in the prior month.
The release of the report was delayed by a 35-day partial shutdown of the federal government that ended on Jan. 25. U.S. financial markets were little moved by the data.
Reports last Friday showed manufacturing output fell for a second straight month in February and factory activity in New York state hit nearly a two-year low this month. 
Manufacturing, which accounts for about 12 percent of the economy, is losing momentum as the stimulus from last year's $1.5 trillion tax cut package fades. Activity is also being hampered by a trade war between the United States and China as well as by last year's surge in the dollar and softening global economic growth, which are hurting exports.
In January, orders for machinery rose 1.5 percent after falling 0.4 percent in December. Orders for mining, oil field and gas field machinery fell 2.7 percent after tumbling 8.2 percent in December. 
Orders for electrical equipment, appliances and components rebounded 1.4 percent after dropping 0.3 percent in December. Computers and electronic products orders fell 0.9 percent after decreasing 0.4 percent in December. 
Orders for primary metals declined 2.0 percent and fabricated metal products orders fell 0.6 percent. Transportation equipment orders increased 1.2 percent in January, slowing from the prior month's 3.2 percent rise.
Orders for civilian aircraft and parts increased 15.6 percent in January. Motor vehicles and parts orders gained 0.4 percent. 
The Commerce Department also said January orders for non-defense capital goods excluding aircraft, which are seen as a measure of business spending plans on equipment, rose 0.8 percent as reported last week. Orders for these so-called core capital goods dropped 0.8 percent in December.

Shipments of core capital goods, which are used to calculate business equipment spending in the gross domestic product report, also increased 0.8 percent in January as previously reported. Core capital goods shipments edged up 0.1 percent in December.

In a report, the U.S. Census Bureau said factory orders increased by a seasonally adjusted 0.1% in January, compared to expectations for a gain of 0.3%.
January data on durable goods orders released last week showed its third-consecutive increase, while new orders for nondefense capital goods excluding aircraft, an underlying measure of business investment, had showed its strongest growth rate since last summer. 
And the meager gain on factory orders provides some economic relief given signs that manufacturing in the U.S. is benefitting from solid domestic demand despite worries of a slowdown in the global economy.
Tuesday’s data comes as the Federal Reserve kicks off its two-day policy meeting.
While no changes to policy are expected, attention will center on updated economic forecasts, including the “dot plot” that details policymakers’ projections for interest rates.
Expectations are leaning towards a reduction of the Fed’s prior projection of two rates hikes this year to just one, while some analysts believe that the central bank could align its outlook to current market expectations by ruling out an increase all together this year."

The group that advises the German government on economic policy had in November forecast that Europe's largest economy would expand by 1.5 percent this year.
The panel said on Tuesday economic growth had slowed significantly, partly due to problems in the chemical and auto sectors and warned that a spiral of protectionist measures had the potential to push the economy into recession.
But Christoph Schmidt, one of the advisers, said: ""The German economic boom is over but a recession is not currently expected due to the robust domestic economy.""

The group predicted the economy would grow by 1.7 percent in 2020.

1627,By Investing.com,"<span>Mar 19, 2019 06:01AM ET</span>","German ZEW Index Hits 1-Year High, But '5 Sages' Still Fear for Economy","Investing.com – A closely-watched measure of Germany’s economic mood improved to a one-year high in March, but concerns over the health of the euro zone's largest economy lingered after the government's council of economic advisors slashed their growth forecast for this year.
The ZEW Center for Economic Research said that its index of German economic sentiment rose to -3.6 points this month from a reading of -13.4 in February, above analysts' expectations for a rise to -11 points.
But any relief was tempered by comments from Germany's so-called ""5 sages"", who cut their forecast for German growth this year to only 0.8%, from an estimate of 1.5% in November. They cited temporary problems with key sectors such as chemicals and autos, weak demand from key export markets and capacity constraints at home.
Even so, domestic demand, helped by the construction sector and public-sector spending, is still strong enough to ensure that the country doesn't fall into recession, the council's chairman Christoph Schmidt said in a statement.
The German economy narrowly avoided a recession at the end of last year, as Brexit woes and global trade tensions with the U.S. weighed on it. Business confidence has also lagged, hitting its weakest level in five years in February, according to the Ifo research institute.
ZEW's report, meanwhile, hinted at a bottoming out in the short term.
“The significant increase in the ZEW Indicator of Economic Sentiment shows that major economic risks are considered to be less dramatic than before,"" ZEW President Achim Wambach said in a press release. ""The possible delay in the Brexit process as well as the renewed hope for a deal on the UK’s withdrawal from the EU seem to have given rise to more optimism among financial market experts.""
ZEW's Current Conditions Index fell to 11.1 from 15.0, compared to expectations for a reading of 11.7.
An index level above 0.0 notionally indicates optimism, whereas a level below 0.0 indicates pessimism. In reality, the ZEW index is more useful as a gauge of turning points in the economic mood, rather than as a measure of absolute levels.
Germany’s central bank, Deutsche Bundesbank, is concerned that smaller companies are not prepared for the U.K.’s exit from the European Union later this month, the Financial Times reported on Tuesday. Many companies rely on London for derivatives clearing and currency swaps. Shifting such activities to other cities in Europe is a slow process and even if Brexit is postponed, companies aren’t prepared, according to the FT.
Germany's trade with the U.K. amounts to around 120 billion euros ($136 billion) a year, according to the BDI industry association. A recent survey found that nearly a quarter of German companies expect to lay workers off in the event of a no-deal Brexit. BDI President Joachim Lang said in February that a disorderly Brexit could take at least half a percentage point off gross domestic product growth this year.

The jobless rate unexpectedly fell to 3.9% in the three months to January, its lowest level since January 1975, while the number of people in work rose 222,000, its largest increase since 2015.
Average earnings, excluding bonuses, continued to rise at their fastest pace since the financial crisis over 10 years ago, jumping 3.4% in the three months to January. That was above forecasts for a 3.2% rise.
The data, which was unexpectedly released 12 minutes ahead of the scheduled time, did little to move the pound despite the strong numbers amid the uncertainty surrounding the next steps in the Brexit process ahead of the current March 29 deadline.
Given the lack of clarity surrounding the U.K.’s departure from the EU, the solid labor market data is unlikely to sway expectations that the Bank of England will leave its monetary policy unchanged when it announces its interest-rate decision on Thursday.
""Rapid job gains and wage growth continue to make the case for rate hikes,"" Samuel Tombs, chief U.K. economist with Pantheon Macroeconomics in London, said via Twitter. 

.
Before the approach of Brexit and the broader global slowdown started to weigh on the economy, the BoE had indicated that ‘several’ interest rate increases may be necessary to bring policy back to a neutral rate.

The CPI index for February fell 2.2 percent from a year earlier, as prices for housing, water and energy all dropped, government data showed on Tuesday.
The index fell 0.2 percent from January, according to data from the General Authority for Statistics. In January, it dropped 1.9 percent from a year earlier, the first decline since 2017, as the effect faded of last year's implementation of a value-added tax..
In February, the housing, water, electricity and fuel component of the index dropped 8.2 percent from a year earlier. Clothing and footwear slid 1.2 percent.
The restaurant and hotel category rose 1.5 percent and education went up 1.2 percent from a year earlier.
""A key factor for the deflationary outlook for 2019 is the fall in rental prices, which is dragging down the housing and utility sub-component of the inflation basket,"" said Monica Malik, chief economist at Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank.
""We continue to see further downward pressure with additional expatriate job losses, though likely not as high as in 2018."" ADCB had projected a 0.9 percent drop in CPI in 2019

1630,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 18, 2019 11:27PM ET</span>",Asia firms spend less and save more as China economy slows,"By Patturaja Murugaboopathy and Gaurav Dogra
BENGALURU (Reuters) - Corporate spending in Asia is likely fall for the first time in three years, a Reuters analysis of Refinitiv data showed, as businesses conserve cash in the face of a stalling Chinese economy, an unresolved trade dispute and Brexit uncertainty.
Capital expenditure (capex) at 2,137 Asian companies is likely to slip an average 4 percent this year, according to the data, which is based on analyst estimates. The pace of revenue growth is likely to be flat at 3.3 percent, the data showed.
By comparison, capex - or money spent on maintenance and investment - at the same firms grew nearly 8 percent last year.
""We are seeing several factors working against capex growth,"" said Joseph Devine, chief investment officer, global ex-U.S. equity at Macquarie Investment Management.
""Credit conditions have tightened and the U.S. dollar is strong. In India and some other markets, the bank lending cycle may have peaked. Auto demand in China is slowing.""
(For an interactive graphic on Asian firms' capex, click here https://tmsnrt.rs/2FewW3C.)
Capex refers to money used to acquire or upgrade equipment, buy property or build plants, in order to aid expansion or stay competitive. Cutting capex could slow future revenue growth but is often considered prudent at times of economic uncertainty.
In Asian engine China, the world's second-biggest economy, growth slowed to a near three-decade low last year and is widely expected to further decelerate this year as the government continues a campaign against excessive corporate debt and works to resolve a trade dispute with the United States.
Meanwhile, its tumbling imports and exports has tempered optimism toward factory output in neighboring Japan where private-sector machinery orders - a capex barometer - fell in January at the fastest pace in four months.
""Uncertainty in trade and policy makes companies cautious while investing,"" said Herald Van der Linde, head of Asia equity strategy at HSBC. Yet Asia needs more ""hard infrastructure"" so low investment is not sustainable in the longer term, he said.
INCREASED CASH FLOW
Real estate companies and those that depend on government infrastructure spending will likely be most frugal, the data showed, while technology firms allocate less on upgrading equipment as global demand for smartphones falters.
Capex is likely to be lower than last year by 7 percent at industrial materials suppliers and 9 percent at tech firms.
""We are seeing a sharp slowdown in electronic exports over the past year and that is likely to pass through to investment growth as well,"" said senior economist Gareth Leather at Capital Economics.
Some tech firms including SK Hynix Inc and Nanya Technology Corp have already axed capex budgets.
On the flip side, falling capex is likely to raise Asian firms' median cash flow position to its highest in at least five years, at $1.80 per share versus $1.30 last year. Companies with high cash reserves are, for instance, attractive to investors seeking steady dividends in times of economic turmoil.
(For an interactive graphic on the performance of Asian firms, click here https://tmsnrt.rs/2FhrKvO.)
A breakdown by economy showed firms in China, Hong Kong, Japan, South Korea and Taiwan are likely to cut capex by 2 to 9 percent.
China's government is shoring up its economy through tax cuts and infrastructure spending, and on Friday announced steps to prevent a sharper slowdown. Analysts, however, said the measures are unlikely to lift corporate spending this year.
""We must recall China is coming from the back of a deleveraging stint,"" said Vishnu Varathan, head of economics and strategy at Mizuho Bank in Singapore. ""Any monetary relief we see is purely to take away some of the pain.""

Struggling with unexpected weakness in among its car manufacturers, Germany barely escaped a recession last quarter. Fresh indicators suggest any recovery will be slow, at best, a drag on growth across the entire euro zone. 
Car manufacturing suffered this quarter from a strike at a key engine plant, but a drop in export orders from outside the euro zone suggests deeper issues, rather than one-off factors, as has been suggested earlier. 
""Manufacturing sector could therefore drag down overall economic growth for the third straight quarter,"" the Bundesbank said in a regular monthly economic report.
Still, a boom in construction and buoyant private consumption should support the economy during the first quarter, the bank said, noting that employment continues to rise, despite the growth weakness.

""Private consumption, as signaled by the strong increase in retail sales, could pick up again significantly,"" the Bundesbank said.

IHS Markit's Household Finance Index slipped slightly to 43.3, its lowest since February 2018, adding to a series of falls since August last year.
Markit said households were showing some resilience to the chaotic Brexit process unfolding in Britain's parliament.
Respondents said they said they were a bit less worried about their job security and about the outlook for their financial wellbeing.
The lowest unemployment rate since 1975, rising wages and weak inflation are helping to offset the uncertainty about Brexit for many people in Britain.
But the appetite among households for making major purchases, for example on cars or holidays, fell at the fastest pace since September 2017, Markit said.
""A sharp drop in UK households' appetite for major purchases was the main signal that Brexit uncertainty had some impact on consumer spending,"" Tim Moore, associate director at IHS Markit, said.
Similarly, many companies are cutting back on investment.
The Markit survey of 1,500 people was conducted between March 7 and 12, before parliament voted on March 14 in favor of Prime Minister Theresa May seeking a delay to the scheduled Brexit date of March 29.

1634,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 17, 2019 11:34PM ET</span>","Japan's exports slump again on weak external demand, puts BOJ on notice","By Tetsushi Kajimoto
TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's exports fell for a third month in February in a sign of growing strain on the trade-reliant economy, suggesting the central bank might be forced to offer more stimulus eventually to temper the effects of slowing external demand and trade frictions. 
Slowing global growth, the Sino-U.S. trade war and complications over Britain's exit from the European Union have already forced many policymakers to shift to an easing stance over recent months.
Japan is in a similar situation to much of the rest of the world, where factories have slammed on the brakes and business confidence has plummeted in the wake of rising global economic uncertainty.
Ministry of Finance data showed on Monday exports fell 1.2 percent year-on-year in February, more than a 0.9 percent decrease expected by economists in a Reuters poll.
It followed a sharp 8.4 percent year-on-year drop in January, marking a third straight month of falls due to drops in shipments of cars, steel and semiconductor production equipment.
""Exports to advanced nations like the United States and Europe still held firm, but China- and Asia-bound shipments were clearly sluggish,"" said Takeshi Minami, chief economist at Norinchukin Research Institute.
""Exports will remain in a declining trend for the time being, which could curb capital spending and wages. Domestic economy will face a severe situation ahead of October's sales tax hike.""
The trade data comes on top of a recent batch of weak indicators, such as factory output and a key gauge of capital spending, which have raised worries that Japan's record run of postwar growth may come to an end.
Some analysts say a recession cannot be ruled out.
The Bank of Japan last week cut its view on exports and output, while keeping policy unchanged. Yet, extended weakness in exports could put it under pressure to deliver more easing, especially as inflation remains well off its 2 percent target and pressure on businesses and consumers continues to rise.
In the post-policy press conference last week, BOJ Governor Haruhiko Kuroda acknowledged the challenges the economy faced but gave no indication there would be any additional stimulus.
But Kuroda may have to change tack in the face of a run of weak economic indicators.
Many in the BOJ expect Japan's economy to emerge from the current soft patch in the second half of this year, assuming China's stimulus plans can revive demand there.
The biggest worry among BOJ policymakers is that weakening exports and output will hurt corporate sentiment, prompting firms to delay capital expenditure and wage hikes.
FRAGILE BOUNCE
The trade war between the United States and China - Japan's largest export markets - has already curbed global trade.
Monday's trade data showed exports to China, Japan's biggest trading partner, rose 5.5 percent year-on-year on shipments of semiconductor production equipment and cars, rebounding from a 17.4 percent drop in January.
However, overall trade to the Asian giant remained weak, as even after averaging effects of the Lunar New Year holiday, China-bound shipments declined 6.3 percent in the January-February period from a year earlier.
Seasonally-adjusted overall trade values rose 6.7 percent month-on-month in February, the strongest rise in two years. Export volumes fell 0.6 percent in the year to February after the previous month's 9.0 percent decline.
""Shifts in the timing of Chinese New Year partly explain the sharp swings in trade volumes at the start of the year so the recent strength in export volumes may unwind before long,"" said Marcel Thieliant, senior Japan economist at Capital Economics.
""We still think that net trade will remain a drag on GDP growth both in the first quarter and throughout 2019.""
Japan's shipments to Asia, which account for more than half of overall exports, fell 1.8 percent, down for a fourth straight month.
U.S.-bound exports rose 2.0 percent, but imports from the United States grew 4.9 percent, resulting in Japan's trade surplus with the country declining 0.9 percent year-on-year to 624.9 billion yen ($5.60 billion) in February.
Yet, Japan's still-large surplus with the United States raises concerns among Japanese policymakers and auto exporters that Washington may impose hefty duties on its imports.
Imports of Japanese cars make up about two-thirds of Japan's $69 billion annual trade surplus with the United States, making Tokyo and Beijing targets of criticism by Trump.

In February, Japanese auto exports to the United States rose just 0.5 percent year-on-year to 152,198 units in February, with the value of shipments down 6.8 percent.

1635,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 15, 2019 12:21PM ET</span>",U.S. manufacturing sector slowing as economy loses steam,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. manufacturing output fell for a second straight month in February and factory activity in New York state hit nearly a two-year low this month, offering further evidence of a sharp slowdown in economic growth early in the first quarter.
The reports on Friday extended the streak of weak data and underscored the Federal Reserve's ""patient"" stance towards further interest rate increases this year. Fed officials are scheduled to meet next Tuesday and Wednesday to assess the economy and deliberate on the future course of monetary policy. The U.S. central bank raised rates four times last year. 
""The economy is spinning its wheels and not gaining any traction yet in this soft patch produced by trade wars and stock market turbulence and the government shutdown,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG in New York.
""Thank God Fed officials were smart enough to take their foot off the rate hikes accelerator.""
The Fed said manufacturing production dropped 0.4 percent last month, held down by declines in the output of motor vehicles, machinery and furniture. Data for January was revised up to show output at factories falling 0.5 percent instead of slumping 0.9 percent as previously reported. 
It was the first back-to-back decline since mid-2017.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast manufacturing output rising 0.3 percent in February. Production at factories increased 1.0 percent in February from a year ago. Manufacturing accounts for about 12 percent of the economy.
Motor vehicles and parts output slipped 0.1 percent last month after tumbling 7.6 percent in January. Excluding motor vehicles and parts, manufacturing output fell 0.4 percent last month, the largest decrease in nearly a year.
February's drop in manufacturing production added to soft reports ranging from retail sales to housing in suggesting the economy lost significant momentum early in the first quarter.
The Atlanta Fed is forecasting gross domestic product will rise at a 0.4 percent annualized rate in the first quarter. GDP grew at a 2.6 percent pace in the fourth quarter.
The economy is losing steam as the stimulus from last year's $1.5 trillion tax cut package fades. Activity is also being crimped by a trade war between the United States and China as well as by last year's surge in the dollar and softening global economic growth, which are hurting exports. 
These factors, together with a 35-day partial shutdown of the U.S. government that ended on Jan. 25, have spilled over to the manufacturing sector. 
In a separate report on Friday, the New York Fed said its general business conditions index fell 5.1 points to a reading of 3.7 in February, the lowest since May 2017. It was the third consecutive monthly reading below 10, which the New York Fed said suggested ""that growth has remained quite a bit slower so far this year than it was for most of 2018.""
A reading above zero indicates expansion in the region's manufacturing sector. The survey's new orders index fell 4.5 points to 3.0 in March. The weakness reported by the New York Fed also suggests that national factory activity remained sluggish this month after slowing sharply in February.
The Institute for Supply Management (ISM) reported this month that its measure of national manufacturing activity dropped to more than a two-year low in February, with a steep decline in the new orders component. 
The dollar was weaker against a basket of currencies on Friday, while U.S. Treasury prices rose. Stocks on Wall Street were trading higher.
JOB OPENINGS RISE
But there was some good economic news.
In a third report on Friday, the University of Michigan said its consumer sentiment index rose to a reading of 97.8 in early March from 93.8 in February. Strong consumer sentiment bodes well for consumer spending in the months ahead after spending appeared to have retrenched early in the first quarter.
A fourth report from the Labor Department showed job openings, a measure of labor demand, rose by 102,000 to a seasonally adjusted 7.58 million in January. That was not far from the record high 7.63 million in November.
The high level of vacancies suggests a shortage of workers that could further boost wage growth. Annual wage growth in February was the best since 2009. But the scarcity of workers could be another constrain for manufacturing and economy.
""In addition to trade, risks to manufacturing stem from the labor market, as the scarce supply of workers will also limit growth,"" said Stephen Ciccarella, a senior economist at Moody’s Analytics in West Chester, Pennsylvania. ""We expect this headwind to intensify over the next few quarters as the labor market continues to tighten.""
The drop in manufacturing output last month was offset by gains in utilities and mining, leading to a 0.1 percent rise in industrial production. In January, industrial output fell 0.4 percent.
Capacity utilization for the manufacturing sector, a measure of how fully firms are using their resources, fell to a nine-month low of 75.4 percent in February from 75.8 percent in January.

Overall capacity use for the industrial sector dipped to 78.2 percent from 78.3 percent in January, keeping inflation in check. Officials at the Fed tend to look at capacity use measures for signals of how much ""slack"" remains in the economy — how far growth has room to run before it becomes inflationary.

1637,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 15, 2019 10:35AM ET</span>","U.S. job openings increase by 102,000 in January","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. job openings in January increased in January, led by vacancies at wholesalers, real estate and information sectors, suggesting that a near-stall in hiring in February was probably in part because of a shortage of qualified workers.
Job openings, a measure of labor demand, rose by 102,000 to a seasonally adjusted 7.58 million, the U.S. Labor Department said in its monthly Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey, or JOLTS, on Tuesday. That was not too far from a record high of 7.63 million touched in November. 
The job openings rate rose to 4.8 percent from 4.7 percent in December. Hiring rose to 5.80 million from 5.72 million in December. Anecdotal evidence has been growing of companies experiencing difficulties finding workers, a phenomenon that economists expect will slow down job growth this year.

The government reported last week that nonfarm payrolls increased by only 20,000 jobs in February, the weakest since September 2017. Job gains are expected to slow to around 150,000 per month this year as workers become more scarce.

1638,By Investing.com,"<span>Mar 15, 2019 10:05AM ET</span>",Michigan Consumer Sentiment Climbs Further Away from 2-Year Low,"Investing.com - Confidence among U.S consumers strengthened further in March as they recovered from a government shutdown that had pushed sentiment to a two-year low at the beginning of the year.
The University of Michigan's preliminary measure of consumer sentiment for March increased to 97.8 this month, compared to a forecast for 95.3 by economists.
The measure had fallen to 91.2 in January, its lowest level since October 2016, before rising to 93.8 in February.
The index is closely watched by economists because consumer spending accounts for about 70% of U.S. economic activity. The more upbeat attitude among consumers adds to evidence that a dismal drop in December retail sales, the worst in nine years, may have been an outlier. However, it contrasts sharply with figures released earlier Friday showing that the manufacturing sector's year-end slowdown is taking longer than expected to turn around. Manufacturing output fell by 0.4% in February, while the New York Federal Reserve's Empire State Index of manufacturing activity fell short of forecasts, hitting its lowest level in nearly two years.
The UMich survey’s chief economist Richard Curtin indicated that the gain in sentiment was entirely due to households with incomes in the bottom two-thirds of the distribution. “Lower-income households expressed much more positive assessments,” Curtin said.
Households with incomes in the top third account for more than half of all consumer expenditures, and Curtin said they recorded even higher levels of confidence. He argued this suggested that there is still no end in sight to the current cycle of economic expansion.
""The data indicate that real consumption will grow by 2.6% in 2019 and that the expansion will set a new record length by mid-year,"" Curtin concluded."

Output inched up 0.1% last month after declining 0.4% in January, according to Federal Reserve data released Friday. Economists had forecast an increase of 0.4%.
In year-on-year terms, the rate of output growth fell to 3.5% from 3.8% in January. That’s the smallest increase since May 2018.
Meanwhile, manufacturing production declined 0.4%, disappointing estimates for a 0.3% gain.
Industrial output has been slowing around the world in recent months on fears of an escalation of the trade war between China and the U.S. and a disorderly departure from the European Union by the U.K.

1640,By Investing.com,"<span>Mar 15, 2019 08:30AM ET</span>",Empire State Index Fell in March to Lowest Since 2017,"Investing.com - Manufacturing activity in the New York area fell unexpectedly in March, in another sign that the U.S. economy is weakening as the effects of the 2017 tax cut fades while worries about the prolonged trade dispute with China mount.
The Empire State manufacturing index fell to a reading of 3.70, its third consecutive monthly reading below 10 and the lowest since May 2017.
“Growth has remained quite a bit slower so far this year than it was for most of 2018,” the New York Fed said in the report.
Despite the weaker reading, the New York Fed did note that “firms remain fairly optimistic” about the outlook, although it said confidence had deteriorated from February.
The weakness in manufacturing mirrors other signs of a slowing U.S. economy. Jobs growth nearly stalled in February, and initial jobless claims hit a four-week high last week. 
The trade dispute between the U.S. and China has been blamed for slowing the global economy, dampening activity around the world, as factories wait to see if Washington and Beijing can reach an agreement that would avoid a sharp rise in U.S. import tariffs on Chinese goods, and likely retaliatory measures from Beijing."
1641,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 15, 2019 06:25AM ET</span>",Euro zone inflation confirmed at 1.5 percent year-on-year in February,"BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Euro zone inflation edged higher as expected in February, the European Union's statistics office confirmed on Friday, mainly because of more expensive services, food, alcohol an tobacco.
Eurostat confirmed its earlier estimates that consumer prices in the 19 countries sharing the euro rose 0.3 percent month-on-month for a 1.5 percent year-on-year gain, accelerating from 1.4 percent year-on-year in January.
The European Central Bank wants to keep inflation below, but close to 2 percent over the medium term, but inflation has been well below that target since 2013. 
Finnish central bank chief Olli Rehn said the bank needed to review its policy since it failed to boost inflation back to target despite years of extraordinary stimulus.
The ECB has kept record low interest rates and pumped 2.6 trillion euros into the banking system through bond purchases and several rounds of ultra-cheap funding for banks. 
Eurostat said price rises of services contributed 0.61 points to the overall year-on-year result in February, while food alcohol and tobacco added another 0.44 points and more expensive energy 0.35 points.

Without the volatile energy and unprocessed food components, or what the ECB calls core inflation and looks at in monetary policy decisions, prices grew 0.3 percent on the month and 1.2 percent in annual terms, the same as in January.

The consumer price index rose 1.5% in February from the same month a year earlier, the bloc’s statistics agency Eurostat said. That was higher than the 1.4% recorded in January and confirmed a preliminary reading. Prices for the month rose 0.3%, after falling 1.0% in January.
Core inflation, which excludes energy, food, alcohol and tobacco prices, slowed to an annual rate of 1% from a revised 1.1% in January. That is well below the level targeted by the European Central Bank, which aims for an inflation rate of close to, but just below, 2% in the medium term.
Last week the central bank pushed back rate hikes from the end of the summer to at least the end of the year and introduced fresh stimulus funding for banks amid worries over slowing growth in the bloc."
1643,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 15, 2019 04:30AM ET</span>","Japan exports seen falling at slower pace in February, core CPI steady: Reuters poll","TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's exports in February likely fell at a much slower pace than the previous month, but weak global demand and U.S.-China trade frictions continue to cloud the outlook, a Reuters poll showed on Friday.
Exports are expected to have slipped 0.9 percent in February from a year earlier, the poll of 17 economists found, after slumping 8.4 percent in January, the biggest decline in more than two years.
Imports, however, likely declined at a sharper pace of 5.8 percent in February after falling 0.6 percent in January, according to the poll.
""We expect exports in February made up for some of their losses (in January) caused by the Lunar New Year holiday,"" said Takumi Tsunoda, senior economist at Shinkin Central Bank Research Institute. The holiday, which causes significant business disruptions across much of Asia, began in early February this year and in mid-February in 2018.
""But the nation's exports to Asia, especially shipments of IT-related items, are expected to have stayed weak.""
The trade balance likely swung back to a surplus of 310.2 billion yen ($2.78 billion) from a deficit of 1.41 trillion yen in January, the poll showed.
Global trade has slowed amid weaker Chinese and European economic growth and as Washington and Beijing remain locked in a tit-for-tat tariff battle, which is taking an increasing toll on Japan's export-reliant economy. 
The Finance Ministry will release trade data at 8:50 a.m. Japan time on Monday, March 18 (2350 GMT, March 17).
On inflation, Japan's core consumer price index, which includes oil products but excludes volatile fresh food costs, is forecast to have risen 0.8 percent in February, the same pace as in January.
""Energy bills likely supported core CPI, while prices of gasoline and telecommunications weighed on,"" said Shinichiro Kobayashi, senior economist at Mitsubishi UFJ Research and Consulting.
""Core CPI will likely stay lackluster for a while as falls in oil prices will start to appear and mobile carriers are expected to cut phone charges."" 
The Internal Affairs Ministry will publish data on consumer prices at 8:30 a.m. Tokyo time on March 22 (2330 GMT on March 21)
The Bank of Japan kept monetary policy settings steady on Friday but tempered its optimism that robust exports and factory output will underpin growth, in a nod to heightened overseas risks that threaten to derail a fragile economic recovery.

The economy contracted a sharper than expected 3 percent in the fourth quarter of 2018, its worst performance in nearly a decade, indicating last year's near 30 percent slide in the lira had tipped it into recession. 
The number of people registered as unemployed jumped to 4.3 million in the three months to January, a surge of more than one million from a year earlier when the jobless rate stood at 12.7 percent, data from the Turkish Statistical Institute showed. 
In the last three months of 2018, the unemployment rate was 12.3 percent. 
In February, the government and Union of Chambers and Commodity Exchanges launched a campaign to boost employment, which they say will provide jobs for 2.5 million people.
Both President Tayyip Erdogan and his son-in-law Finance Minister Berat Albayrak have said Turkey has left the worst of its economic troubles behind. 

Non-agricultural unemployment stood at 15.6 percent in the November-January period, the data showed, up from 14.3 percent during October-December.

1645,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 15, 2019 12:58AM ET</span>","China's home price growth slips to 10-month low, raises policy challenge","By Yawen Chen and Ben Blanchard
BEIJING (Reuters) - New home prices in China grew at their slowest pace in 10 months in February in sign of slackening demand as the economy cools further, leaving authorities walking a tight rope between loosening some existing curbs and flushing out speculators.
Consumer and business confidence has slipped over recent quarters in the wake of heightened economic uncertainty and a yet-unresolved Sino-U.S. trade dispute, discouraging residential investment. 
Average new home prices in China's 70 major cities rose 0.5 percent in February, slowing from a 0.6 percent gain in January and marked the lowest growth rate since April 2018, according to Reuters calculation of data released by the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) on Friday. 
On the whole, it logged the 46th straight month of price increases. Most of the 70 cities surveyed by the NBS still reported monthly price increases for new homes, though the number was down to 57 from 58 in January. 
Xining, the capital of Qinghai province in central China by the Tibetan Plateau, was the top performer last month with a monthly price increase of 2.3 percent. 
On an annual basis, home prices rose 10.4 percent in February, accelerating from a 10.0 percent gain in January.
Analysts say the overall price growth in the property market is still relatively healthy and note that the slowdown hasn't reached alarming proportions despite the pressure on demand stemming from a cooling economy.
Growth in the world's second-biggest economy slumped to near three-decade lows last year hit by the tariff row with the United States and Beijing's multi-year crackdown on debt. 
""The data suggests some cities resorted to price-cutting to promote sales under the pressure of meeting sales targets amid a traditionally off-season for the market,"" said Yan Yuejin, director of the E-house China Research and Development Institution.
But Yan said some markets have showed signs of a rebound in February. 
Prices growth in China's four top-tier cities - Beijing, Shanghai, Shenzhen and Guangzhou - rose 0.3 percent from a month earlier, slowing from a 0.4 percent gain in January, the statistics bureau said in a statement accompanying the data. 
Tier-2 cities, which include most of the larger provincial capitals, increased 0.7 percent in February on a monthly basis, in line with the previous month, while in tier-3 cities they rose 0.4 percent, easing from 0.6 percent in January, the statistics bureau said. 
FINE-TUNING POLICY 
""For popular cities in the first- and second-tier cities, there is some possibility of a market recovery in March,"" said Zhang Dawei, an analyst with Hong Kong-based Centaline, a property consultancy.
Policymakers appear keen to avoid dealing a sharp knock to the real estate market as it directly influences 40 other business sectors in China and is key to tempering the economic slowdown. 
Credit conditions have been on the looser side in recent months as China has cut the amount of cash banks keep as reserves five times since last year to boost lending to companies. 
Some analysts say the extra liquidity will inevitably flow into the highly speculative property market. But policymakers have vowed to flush out speculators and prevent big fluctuations in housing values as they try to ensure that first-home buyers aren't completely priced out of the market.
New household loans, mainly mortgages, totaled 919.2 billion yuan ($136.69 billion) in February, accounting for 22.36 percent of total new loans last month, central bank data showed last week. 
Some smaller cities have also quietly loosened curbs to prop up sentiment and demand, and Beijing appears to be showing a bigger tolerance as it emphasizes on a ""city-based"" approach that gives local governments more autonomy in policymaking. 
Data on Thursday showed China's property investment quickened in the January-February period driven by strong demand in smaller cities. The upturn was likely supported by an acceleration in property construction as developers rush to meet pre-sale standard to put more projects into the sales market.
""Looking into the future we expect more cities will take measures to stabilize their own markets, but we don't expect Beijing to lift the curbs across the board,"" said Daniel Yao, head of research at JLL China, a property services and investment management company.

The central bank also modified its view on Japan's overall economy, pointing to the impact from slowing overseas growth.
In a widely expected move, the BOJ maintained its short-term interest rate target at minus 0.1 percent and a pledge to guide 10-year government bond yields around zero percent.
The decision on maintaining its interest rate targets was made by a 7-2 vote with board members Goushi Kataoka and Yutaka Harada dissenting.
The central bank said exports were showing some weakness recently. At its previous review in January, it had said they were ""increasing as a trend.""

BOJ Governor Haruhiko Kuroda will hold a news conference at 3:30 p.m. (0630 GMT) to explain the policy decision.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The number of Americans filing applications for unemployment benefits increased more than expected last week, suggesting the labor market was slowing, but probably not to the extent implied by a near-stall in job growth in February.
While other data on Thursday showed import prices rising by the most in nine months in February, the trend in imported inflation remained weak. Import prices dropped on a year-on-year basis for a third straight month in February. 
News on the housing market remained downbeat, with new home sales falling more than expected in January. The stream of data remains broadly supportive of the Federal Reserve's pledge to be ""patient"" before raising interest rates further this year. 
""If the Fed is reading the tea leaves the economic brew of data are distinctly on the weak side today, and will keep Fed policy cemented in place at next week's meeting,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG in New York. 
Fed officials are scheduled to meet next Tuesday and Wednesday to decide on monetary policy. The U.S. central bank increased borrowing costs four times last year.
Initial claims for state unemployment benefits rose 6,000 to a seasonally adjusted 229,000 for the week ended March 9, the Labor Department said. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast claims rising to 225,000 in the latest week. 
Claims have been hovering in the middle of their 200,000-253,000 range this year. The labor market is slowing as workers become more scarce. 
Hiring is also being constrained by a weakening economy as stimulus from a $1.5 trillion tax cut diminishes. Washington's trade war with Beijing, slowing demand overseas and uncertainty over Britain's exit from the European Union are also hurting economic activity. 
The government reported last week that nonfarm payrolls increased by only 20,000 jobs in February, the weakest since September 2017, in part as payback after hefty gains in the prior two months. But the unemployment rate dropped two-tenths of a percentage point to 3.8 percent and annual wage growth was the strongest since 2009..
Separately on Thursday, the Commerce Department said new home sales declined 6.9 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 607,000 units in January. Economists had forecast new home sales, which account for about 11 percent of housing market sales, slipping 0.6 percent to a 620,000-unit pace in January.
Cold weather and a five-week partial shutdown of the government that ended on Jan. 25 probably weighed on sales, economists said. 
Still, affordability remains a challenge, especially at the lower end of the market, even as mortgage rates have dropped to 13-month lows and house price inflation has slowed. 
Expensive lumber as well as land and labor shortages are constraining builders from ramping up construction of homes in this market segment. There are concerns that lower house prices could encourage builders to cut back on new projects. The median new home price fall 3.8 percent in January from a year ago.
DEFLATIONARY IMPULSE
""Given the rising cost pressures builders are facing, this could suggest continued difficulty for new homes and new construction ahead,"" said Danielle Hale, chief economist at realtor.com.
The dollar rose against a basket of currencies, while U.S. Treasury prices fell. Stocks on Wall Street were higher.
In third report on Thursday, the Labor Department said import prices rose 0.6 percent last month, boosted by increases in the costs of fuels and consumer goods. That was the biggest gain since May and followed a 0.1 percent rise in January. 
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast import prices rising 0.3 percent in February. 
In the 12 months through February, import prices fell 1.3 percent. That followed a 1.6 percent decline in January.
The report came on the heels of data showing tame producer and consumer inflation readings in February. The jump in the monthly import prices did not change economists' views that inflation will remain moderate through the first half of 2019. 
""A deflationary impulse from abroad is putting slight downward pressure on domestic prices at the start of 2019,"" said Jake McRobie, a U.S. economist at Oxford Economics in New York.
Last month, prices for imported fuels and lubricants rose 4.9 percent after increasing 4.1 percent in January. Prices for imported petroleum increased 4.7 percent after rebounding 7.1 percent in January.
But food prices fell 0.8 percent in February after decreasing 0.4 percent in the prior month. Excluding fuels and food, import prices rebounded 0.2 percent last month after falling 0.3 percent in January. 
The so-called core import prices fell 0.3 percent in the 12 months through February. Increases in core import prices have been curbed by last year's strength in the dollar. Prices for imported consumer goods excluding automobiles rose 0.3 percent in February, reversing January's drop.

The cost of goods imported from China was unchanged in February after dropping 0.3 percent in the prior month. Prices of Chinese imports dropped 0.7 percent in the 12-months through February, the biggest decline since October 2017.

The Commerce Department said on Thursday new home sales declined 6.9 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 607,000 units. December's sales pace was revised higher to 652,000 units from the previously reported 621,000 units.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast new home sales, which account for about 11 percent of housing market sales, slipping 0.6 percent to a pace of 620,000 units in January.

Affordability remains a challenge, especially at the lower end of the market, even as mortgage rates have dropped from last year's highs and house price inflation has slowed.
Expensive lumber as well as land and labor shortages continue to constrain builders.
Economists expect the housing market, which hit a soft patch last year, to remain sluggish through the first half of 2019. Investment in homebuilding contracted 0.2 percent in 2018, the weakest performance since 2010.
The release of the January new home sales report was delayed by a 35-day partial shutdown of the federal government that ended on Jan. 25. February's new home sales report, which was scheduled for release on March 25, will now be published on March 29. 
New home sales in the South, which accounts for the bulk of transactions, tumbled 15.1 percent in January. Sales dropped 11.4 percent in the Northeast. Sales in the Midwest plunged 28.6 percent to the lowest level since January 2014. But sales rose 27.8 percent in the West to a 10-month high.
The median new house price fell 3.8 percent to $317,200 in January from a year ago. There were 336,000 new homes on the market in January, down 1.5 percent from December. Supply is, however, just over half of what it was at the peak of the housing market boom in 2006.
At January's sales pace it would take 6.6 months to clear the supply of houses on the market, up from 6.3 months in December. Just under two-thirds of the houses sold last month were either under construction or yet to be built.

Economists had expected initial claims to rise by only 2,000 to 225,000.
The four-week moving average was 223,750, a decline of 2,500 from the previous week, the U.S. Department of Labor said. The monthly average is seen as a more accurate gauge of labor trends because it reduces volatility in the week-to-week data. 
Continuing jobless claims rose to 1,776,000 from 1,758,000, a thousand more than forecast.
Although February’s employment report showed a sharp slowdown in job creation, the American labor market still shows signs of strength with the jobless rate falling and wage inflation on the rise.

1653,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 14, 2019 04:11AM ET</span>","China industrial output growth falls to 17-year low, more support steps expected","By Kevin Yao and Stella Qiu
BEIJING (Reuters) - Growth in China's industrial output fell to a 17-year low in the first two months of the year and the jobless rate rose, pointing to further weakness in the world's second-biggest economy that is likely to trigger more support measures from Beijing.
But a mixed bag of major data on Thursday also showed property investment was picking up, while overall retail sales were sluggish but steady, suggesting the economy is not in the midst of a sharper slowdown.
China is ramping up assistance for the economy as 2019 growth looks set to plumb 29-year lows, but support measures are taking time to kick in. Most analysts believe activity may not convincingly stabilise until the middle of the year.
Premier Li Keqiang last week announced hundreds of billions of dollars in additional tax cuts and infrastructure spending, even as officials vowed they would not resort to massive stimulus like in the past, which produced swift recoveries in China and strong reflationary pulses worldwide. 
""The latest data should partially ease concerns about a sharp slowdown at the start of the year. But the near-term outlook still looks downbeat,"" Capital Economics said in a note.
In particular, Capital Economics and others noted that infrastructure investment has not improved as much as hoped after the government began fast-tracking road and rail projects last year, raising the risk of a milder-than-expected bounce in construction when work resumes in warmer weather. 
Pressured by weak demand at home and abroad, China's industrial output rose 5.3 percent in January-February, less than expected and the slowest pace since early 2002. Growth had been expected to cool to 5.5 percent from December's 5.7 percent. 
China combines January and February activity data in an attempt to smooth distortions created by the long Lunar New Year holidays early each year, but some analysts say a clearer picture of the economy's health may not emerge until first-quarter data is released in April.
If the seasonal distortion was removed, output rose 6.1 percent in the two months, the National Bureau of Statistics said.
China's own official factory survey, which is seasonally adjusted, showed manufacturing output contracted in February for the first time since January 2009. 
Data last week showed exports tumbled the most in three years in February, suggesting U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods and cooling global demand were taking a greater toll.
President Donald Trump said on Wednesday he was in no rush to complete a trade pact with China and insisted that any deal include protection for intellectual property, a major sticking point between the two sides during months of negotiations.
Job shedding by export-oriented companies led to a jump in the unemployment rate last month, said Li Xiru, an official with the statistics bureau.
China's survey-based jobless rate rose to 5.3 percent in February, from 4.9 percent in December, though it was below the government's target of 5.5 percent this year.
Many migrant workers also quit their jobs to go home before the holidays, Li said.
Reuters reported in January that some factories in Guangdong - China's export hub - had shut earlier than usual ahead of the holidays, and some were expected to close for good as the trade war curtailed orders.
INVESTMENT PICKING UP
Growth in fixed-asset investment, a major growth driver in the past, quickened to 6.1 percent in the first two months of this year, slightly more than analysts had expected and edging up marginally from 5.9 percent in 2018. 
Much of the gain appeared due to a bounce in property investment, which quickened to a five-year high of 11.6 percent, though home sales fell.
Infrastructure investment, which the government is relying on heavily to drive an economic recovery, rose 4.3 percent on-year. But several analysts including Nomura estimated growth momentum may have eased despite Beijing's push. 
Private sector fixed-asset investment also lost a step, rising 7.5 percent versus an increase of 8.7 percent in 2018. Private investment accounts for about 60 percent of overall investment in China, and Beijing has spent considerable effort trying to ease financial strains on smaller, private firms.
RETAIL SALES WOBBLY
Retail sales were also marginally better than expected, with the headline figure rising 8.2 percent in January-February from a year earlier, in line with December.
But the rate of growth remains stuck around 15-year lows, highlighting concerns that consumers are growing less confident as the economy slows.
Industry data this week showed automobile sales in China fell for the eighth consecutive month in February.
China's state planner announced measures in January to boost consumption of goods ranging from eco-friendly appliances to big-ticket items such as cars, but the size and scope of the subsidy scheme is still unclear.
Thursday's data showed sales of appliances and furniture softened considerably early in the year, possibly linked to worries about the cooling property market and a 3.6 percent drop in home sales.
MORE SUPPORT EXPECTED 
In addition to fiscal stimulus such as higher local government spending and tax cuts, more monetary policy support is also expected this year.
The People's Bank of China (PBOC) has already cut banks' reserve requirements five times over the last year, most recently in January, and more reductions are expected from the coming quarter to free up more funds for lending.
Regulators have ordered big banks to increase loans to smaller firms by more than 30 percent this year, despite the risk of more bad loans. Total new bank lending hit a record in 3.23 trillion yuan ($481 billion) in January.
The central bank is also expected to continue to guide borrowing costs lower. But sources have told Reuters that a benchmark interest rate cut is considered a last resort if other measures fail to stem the broader economic decline. 
Even with additional support, China's economic growth is still expected to cool to around 6.2 percent this year from 6.6 percent in 2018, according to Reuters polls.

1654,By Investing.com,"<span>Mar 13, 2019 11:35PM ET</span>",China’s Industrial Output Grows At Slowest Pace in 17 Years; Retail Sales Improve,"Investing.com - China’s industrial output grew at the slowest pace in 17 years for the first two months in 2019, while retail sales and fixed-asset investment came in marginally above estimates.
Industrial output rose 5.3% year-on-year in January and February, the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) reported on Thursday, the lowest since 2002. Factory output growth had been expected to slow to 5.5% from December’s 5.7%.
Meanwhile, fixed-asset investment improved slightly compared to the same period in 2018. The growth was 6.1% in the January-February period, marginally higher than the expected 6%.
Retail sales growth in January-February came in at 8.2%, in line with growth in December and just above the 8.1% increase forecast.
The NBS combines January and February activity data due to the long Lunar New Year holidays early each year, when factories and businesses across the country shut down.
“The latest data should partially ease concerns about a sharp slowdown at the start of the year. But the near-term outlook still looks downbeat… Meanwhile, the lack of a hoped-for pick-up in infrastructure investment suggests that fiscal loosening is still struggling to gain much traction,” said Julia Evans-Pritchard, senior China economist for Capital Economics, in a Financial Times report.
“With credit growth yet to see a meaningful turnaround, we think economic growth will remain under pressure until at least the middle of this year,” he added.
Chinese stocks traded lower on Thursday morning following the release of the data, with the Shanghai Composite and the SZSE Component down 1.1% and 1.8% respectively by 11:00 PM ET (03:00 GMT). Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index also slipped 0.4%."

1656,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 13, 2019 12:29PM ET</span>",U.S. core capital goods orders rebound; inflation muted,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - New orders for key U.S.-made capital goods rose by the most in six months in January and shipments increased, but the trend in both measures of business spending on equipment remained soft, leaving forecasts for weak first-quarter economic growth intact.
The slowing economy is helping keep inflation tame, with other data on Wednesday showing producer prices barely rising in February, resulting in the smallest annual increase in more than 1-1/2 years. This environment supports the Federal Reserve's wait-and-see approach to further interest rate hikes this year.
""There is still a strong case for the Fed to remain patient,"" said Michael Pearce, a senior U.S. economist at Capital Economics in New York. ""The rebound in underlying capital goods orders is still consistent with a slowdown in business equipment investment growth, and producer price figures show few signs of a pick-up in inflation in the pipeline."" 
Orders for non-defense capital goods excluding aircraft, a closely watched proxy for business spending plans, rebounded 0.8 percent, the biggest gain since July. These so-called core capital goods orders fell 0.9 percent in December.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast core capital goods orders edging up 0.1 percent in January. Core capital goods orders increased 3.1 percent on a year-on-year basis.
Core capital goods orders in January were boosted by orders for machinery, which rebounded 1.4 percent after dropping 0.6 percent in December. Orders for electrical equipment, appliances and components jumped 1.7 percent after falling 0.2 percent in the prior month. 
But orders for computers and electronic products declined 1.3 percent, the biggest drop since March 2017. There were also decreases in orders for primary metals while orders for fabricated metal products were unchanged.
Shipments of core capital goods jumped 0.8 percent in January after edging up 0.1 percent in the prior month. Core capital goods shipments are used to calculate equipment spending in the government's gross domestic product measurement. 
The January report was delayed by a 35-day partial shutdown of the federal government that ended on Jan. 25. The February report, which was scheduled for release this month, will now be published on April 2.
LOW GROWTH ESTIMATES
The strong core capital goods shipments in January prompted some economists to raise slightly their estimates for first-quarter business equipment spending. Investment in equipment by businesses accelerated in the fourth quarter of last year after slowing in the July-September period. 
The first-quarter GDP growth forecast also got another small lift from a second report from the Commerce Department on Wednesday showing construction outlays jumped 1.3 percent in January as investment in public projects hit a more than eight-year high. Construction spending had dropped for two straight months.
The Atlanta Fed bumped up its growth estimate for the January-March quarter by two-tenths of a percentage point to a 0.4 percent annualized rate. The economy grew at a 2.6 percent pace in the fourth quarter of 2018 after expanding at a brisk 3.4 percent rate in the July-September period. 
The dollar was trading lower against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices fell, and stocks on Wall Street rose.
The economy is losing steam as the stimulus from a $1.5 trillion tax cut fades. A trade war between the United States and China, slowing global economies and uncertainty over Britain's exit from the European Union are other factors hurting activity.
The ebb in activity is helping keep price pressures under wraps. A third report from the Labor Department on Wednesday showed its producer price index for final demand edged up 0.1 percent in February, lifted by a rebound in the cost of gasoline. The PPI had dropped for three straight months.
In the 12 months through February, the PPI rose 1.9 percent. That was the smallest gain since June 2017 and followed a 2.0 percent increase in January. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the PPI rebounding 0.2 percent in February and advancing 1.9 percent on a year-on-year basis.
A key gauge of underlying producer price pressures that excludes food, energy and trade services rose 0.1 percent last month after climbing 0.2 percent in January. 
The so-called core PPI increased 2.3 percent in the 12 months through February, the smallest rise since December 2017, after advancing 2.5 percent in January.
Data on Tuesday showed consumer prices rising moderately in February, with the consumer price index posting its smallest annual gain in nearly 2-1/2 years. 
February's tepid producer and consumer inflation readings suggest the Fed's preferred inflation measure, the core personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index, likely retreated further from the U.S. central bank's 2 percent target. 
The core PCE price index increased 1.9 percent on a year-on-year basis in December after a similar gain in November.
""We think that this will moderate to a high-side 1.8 percent reading in January and then a low-side 1.8 percent reading in February, with risks that the February figure rounds to 1.7 percent,"" said Daniel Silver, an economist at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) in New York.
The Commerce Department is scheduled to release January PCE price data on March 29. Publication was delayed by the government shutdown.

The Commerce Department said on Wednesday that construction spending jumped 1.3 percent, the largest increase since last April, after a revised 0.8 percent drop in December.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast construction spending rising 0.4 percent in January after a previously reported 0.6 percent drop in December. 
Construction spending increased 0.3 percent on a year-on-year basis in January. The release of the January report was delayed by a five-week partial shutdown of the government that ended on Jan. 25. The February construction spending report will be published on April 1 as scheduled.
In January, investment in public construction projects increased 4.9 percent to its highest level since September 2010. The percent increase was the largest since March 2004 and followed a 1.0 percent drop in December.
Spending on federal government construction projects increased 4.2 percent to the highest level since October 2017 after plunging 1.9 percent in December. Investment in state and local government construction projects jumped 4.9 percent to a 9-1/2-year high after falling 1.0 percent in the prior month. 
Spending on private construction projects rose 0.2 percent in January after declining for two straight months. Investment in private residential projects dropped 0.3 percent, falling for the sixth straight month. 
The housing market has been weighed down by higher mortgage rates, expensive building materials as well as land and labor shortages. Investment in homebuilding contracted 0.2 percent in 2018, the weakest performance since 2010.

The Labor Department said its producer price index (PPI) increased 0.1% last month, while the core PPI, which excludes food and energy costs, also rose 0.1%.
In the 12 months through February, prices rose 1.9% and 2.5%, respectively.
Coupled with Tuesday’s equally benign report on consumer prices, the data indicated little need for the Federal Reserve to shift its most recent guidance on interest rates, which said it would “be patient as it determines what future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate may be appropriate.”
The Fed watches this data because higher costs for producers often lead to them passing that cost on to consumers.

1662,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 13, 2019 06:10AM ET</span>",Euro zone industrial output stronger than expected in January,"BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Euro zone industrial production was stronger than expected in January, data showed on Wednesday, mainly thanks to a strong contribution from energy and despite a drop in German output.
The European Union's statistics office Eurostat said production in the 19 countries sharing the euro rose 1.4 percent month-on-month in January for a 1.1 percent year-on-year fall.
Economists polled by Reuters had expected a 1.0 percent monthly increase and a 2.1 percent annual decline.
The January result was mainly influenced by a 2.4 percent monthly and 4.0 percent year-on-year jump in energy output, which helped offset or mitigate the weaker results for intermediate and capital goods production.
Output went up despite a drop in Germany, the bloc's largest economy. Eurostat estimated industrial production in Germany fell 0.9 percent on the month, a higher drop than the 0.8 percent fall estimated by the German statistics agency earlier this week.

Large increases in France and Italy, the second and third biggest economies in the euro zone, more than offset the German data. Eurostat said output grew in France by 1.3 percent on the month, and in Italy by 1.7 percent.

1663,By Bloomberg,"<span>Mar 12, 2019 10:00PM ET</span>",Jobs Growth at 13-Month High Is a Boost for South Korea's Moon,"(Bloomberg) -- Jobs data provided some surprisingly good news for South Korean President Moon Jae-in, who is under fire over his economic policies -- particularly his aggressive minimum wage hikes.
The unemployment rate in February fell to 3.7 percent, the lowest in eight months and better than economists’ forecast of 4.2 percent. The economy added 263,000 new jobs last month, the most since January last year. The hiring was mainly in services.
Moon has faced growing pressure as the economy has lost steam. Exports have slumped in recent months, a result of cooling external demand. But hiring has been weak for about a year, and many blame the president’s minimum-wage increases.
On Monday, a delegation from the International Monetary Fund expressed concern about the pace of the wage hikes during a visit to Seoul, and called for a substantial supplementary budget to support growth.
Moon pledged to be a ""jobs president"" and to support growth by addressing growing inequality.
Last week, a poll by Gallup Korea showed his approval rate fell to 46 percent, near his all-time low of 45 percent reached in December. South Korea’s worst air pollution in years and the breakdown of the U.S.-North Korea nuclear talks are also weighing on his popularity.

1664,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 12, 2019 08:40PM ET</span>",Japan's core machinery orders point to more investment weakness,"By Stanley White
TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's machinery orders fell in January at the fastest pace in four months due to a decline in orders from auto and telecommunications equipment makers and as the U.S.-China trade war dented global demand.
The 5.4 percent decline month-on-month in core machinery orders, a leading indicator of capital expenditure, was more than the median estimate for a 1.7 percent decrease and followed a revised 0.3 percent decline in the previous month. It was also the fastest month-on-month decline since September last year.
Capital expenditure is likely to remain weak for some time as exports fall and inventories pile up due to tit-for-tat tariffs between Washington and Beijing, which threaten to slow Japan's economic growth.
Orders from manufacturers fell 1.9 percent month-on-month in January after a revised 4.4 percent decline in December, Cabinet Office data showed on Wednesday.
Orders from non-manufacturers slumped 8.0 percent in January from the previous month, also the fastest decline in four months.
Highlighting the weakness in the global economy, machinery orders from overseas fell 18.1 percent in January, matching the decline in the previous month.
""Core"" machinery orders exclude those for ships and from electricity utilities.
The United States and China are seeking to narrow their differences over trade but are yet to agree to a deal that would unwind punitive tariffs and restore global trade flows.
Economists say uncertainty over trade policy will discourage Japanese companies from increasing capital expenditure, which will act as a curb on economic growth.
Another risk for Japan's economy is the government's plan to raise the nationwide sales tax to 10 percent from 8 percent in October. The government needs the extra revenue for rising welfare costs, but the tax hike could also weaken consumer spending.
The Bank of Japan will likely maintain its view the export-reliant economy is expanding moderately but warn of heightening overseas risks at a policy meeting ending Friday, sources say, as China's slowdown and trade tension cloud the outlook.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. consumer prices rose for the first time in four months in February, but the pace of the increase was modest, resulting in the smallest annual gain in nearly 2-1/2 years.
The report from the Labor Department on Tuesday also showed benign underlying inflation last month, which together with slowing economic growth support the Federal Reserve's ""patient"" approach towards further interest rate increases this year.
""We view the risks to the inflation outlook as weighted to the downside as the domestic economy has slowed more quickly than we had expected,"" said Ryan Sweet, a senior economist at Moody's Analytics in West Chester, Pennsylvania. ""The Fed is on pause for the foreseeable future.""
The Consumer Price Index increased 0.2 percent, lifted by gains in the costs of food, gasoline and rents. The CPI had been unchanged for three straight months. 
In the 12 months through February, the CPI rose 1.5 percent, the smallest gain since September 2016. The CPI increased 1.6 percent on a year-on-year basis in January.
Excluding the volatile food and energy components, the CPI edged up 0.1 percent, the smallest increase since August 2018. The so-called core CPI had increased by 0.2 percent for five straight months. 
In the 12 months through February, the core CPI rose 2.1 percent. The core CPI had increased by 2.2 percent for three consecutive months on an annual basis. 
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the CPI and the core CPI edging up 0.2 percent in February.
The Fed, which has a 2 percent inflation target, tracks a different measure, the core personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index, for monetary policy.
The core PCE price index increased 1.9 percent on a year-on-year basis in December after a similar gain in November. It hit the U.S. central bank's 2 percent inflation target in March last year for the first time since April 2012.
The economy lost momentum at the end of last year, a trend that appears to have persisted through early 2019, with manufacturing production plunging and retail sales rising slightly in January after December's sharp drop. 
First-quarter growth estimates have been cut to as low as a 0.2 percent annualized rate. The economy grew at a 2.6 percent pace in the fourth quarter. 
Slowing domestic and global growth are keeping inflation in check even as a tight labor market is driving up wages. Annual wage growth jumped 3.4 percent in February, the biggest increase since April 2009, from 3.1 percent in January.
""That is partly because a modest pick-up in productivity growth has kept a lid on unit labor costs and partly because the rising dollar has started to put downward pressure on imported goods prices,"" said Paul Ashworth, chief U.S. economist at Capital Economics in Toronto.
Stocks on Wall Street were trading higher, but Boeing's fall for a second straight session pressured the Dow Jones Industrial Average and capped gains in broader markets. The dollar slipped against a basket currencies, while U.S. Treasury prices rose.
DECLINING INFLATION EXPECTATIONS
A New York Fed survey of consumer expectations published on Monday showed a drop in inflation expectations in February.
In a wide-ranging interview with CBS's 60 Minutes television news program, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell on Sunday reiterated the central bank's wait-and-see approach to further monetary policy tightening this year. Powell said the Fed did ""not feel any hurry"" to change the level of interest rates again.
The Fed hiked rates four times in 2018. The January PCE price data will be released on March 19 after being delayed by a 35-day partial shutdown of the federal government that ended on Jan. 25.
In February, gasoline prices rose 1.5 percent after three straight monthly declines. Food prices increased 0.4 percent, the biggest rise since May 2014, after gaining 0.2 percent in January. Food consumed at home rose 0.4 percent last month, boosted by more expensive dairy products, fresh vegetables, cereals and meat.
Owners' equivalent rent of primary residence, which is what a homeowner would pay to rent or receive from renting a home, increased 0.3 percent in February, as it did in January.
Apparel prices rose 0.3 percent after surging 1.1 percent in January. Consumers paid more for motor vehicle insurance, airline fares, household furnishings and personal care products.
But consumers got some relief from healthcare costs, which fell 0.2 percent after five straight monthly increases. Healthcare costs were held down by a record 1.0 percent decline in the price of prescription medication and a 0.7 percent drop in the cost of hospital services. 
Prices for new motor vehicles, used cars and trucks, as well as recreation fell. Some economists believed the declines in healthcare and motor vehicle prices were temporary, noting that these two categories tended to be volatile, and expected the core CPI to tick higher in the months ahead.

""I don't think the softness this month is a harbinger of slower inflation in the next few months,"" said Eric Winograd, senior economist at AllianceBernstein in New York.

1666,By Bloomberg,"<span>Mar 12, 2019 08:40AM ET</span>","U.S. Core Inflation Unexpectedly Cools on Autos, Drug Prices","(Bloomberg) -- A key measure of underlying U.S. inflation unexpectedly eased in February amid falling prices for autos and prescription drugs, giving the Federal Reserve more room to stick to its plan for being patient on raising interest rates.
Excluding food and energy, the so-called core consumer price index rose 0.1 percent from the prior month and 2.1 percent from a year earlier, according to a Labor Department report Tuesday. Those figures trailed the median estimates of economists. The broader CPI rose 0.2 percent from January, the first increase in four months, though the 1.5 percent annual gain missed projections and was the smallest rise since 2016.
The data suggest there’s a greater chance that inflation won’t hold up around the Fed’s 2 percent objective, a development that could add to calls for policy makers to hold off on additional rate increases amid rising risks from weakening global growth.
Fed Chairman Jerome Powell made clear Friday that he and his colleagues are in no hurry to adjust interest rates as growth slows and inflation stays subdued. “With nothing in the outlook demanding an immediate policy response and particularly given muted inflation pressures, the committee has adopted a patient, wait-and-see approach,’’ he said in a speech in California.
Responding to questions, Powell said inflation in the U.S. is low, stable and doesn’t react much to slack in the economy. Policy makers will release updated quarterly projections for interest rates as well as inflation, growth and employment when they gather March 19-20.
Fed Target
The Fed has a 2 percent target for a separate inflation gauge from the Commerce Department that’s linked to consumer spending. That index tends to run slightly below the Labor Department’s CPI, and January figures are due March 29.
The CPI report showed prices of new vehicles fell for the first time in four months while used-car prices dropped 0.7 percent from January, the biggest drop since September.
Prescription-drug prices fell 1 percent on a monthly basis, the most on record, bringing the annual decline to 1.2 percent -- the largest drop since 1972.
Shelter costs, which account for about a third of CPI and mainly include housing expenses, continued to hold up, with the fourth straight monthly increase of 0.3 percent. Owners-equivalent rent, one of the categories designed to track rental prices, rose 0.3 percent, as did rent of primary residence.
The slowdown in overall inflation is giving Americans more spending power. A separate Labor Department report on Wednesday showed that average hourly earnings, adjusted for inflation, rose 1.9 percent in February from a year earlier. That compares with 1.6 percent in the previous month and is the fastest pace since 2015.

1667,By Investing.com,"<span>Mar 12, 2019 08:31AM ET</span>",U.S. Inflation Supports Fed Patience with Rate Hikes,"Investing.com - Growth in U.S. consumer prices rose only marginally in February, further supporting the case for the Federal Reserve to hold off from further increases in interest rates in the near term.
The consumer price index rose 1.5% from a year ago, while core inflation, that excludes volatile food and energy costs, increased 2.1%. That compared to consensus forecasts for them to remain stable at 1.6% and 2.2%, respectively.
For the month, the CPI and core CPI were up 0.2% and 0.1%, respectively.
As the Federal Reserve seeks to keep core inflation close to 2%, the reading poses little threat to its most recent guidance, which said it would “be patient as it determines what future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate may be appropriate.""
The dollar extended modest losses on the news, while yields on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury bond inched higher to 2.654%. Stock index futures also pared losses following the data.
Speaking last Friday, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell justified the Fed's “wait-and-see approach”, given that there was “nothing in the outlook demanding an immediate policy response and particularly given muted inflation pressures.”
Markets remain skeptical that the Fed could move forward with a rate hike this year, particularly after the employment report showed weak job creation in February.
Fed fund futures reflect no expectations for any such move and imply the probability that the next move will in fact be a cut at above 10%.
But policymakers are keeping a close eye on wage inflation, given its ability to put upward pressure on prices. The latest employment report showed wages rising at their fastest annual pace in 10 years,

Gross domestic product grew 0.5% in the three months to January, the Office for National Statistics reported on Tuesday, a slight uptick from the 0.4% expansion seen in the three months to December, and above analysts' forecasts for an increase of 0.2%.
“Across the latest three months, growth remained weak with falls in manufacture of metal products, cars and construction repair work all dampening economic growth,"" said Rob Kent-Smith, head of national accounts at the ONS. ""These were offset by strong performances in wholesale, IT and health services.”
“This sluggish growth came despite the economy bouncing back from a weak December,” he added.
In a separate report, manufacturing production rose 0.8% in January, while industrial production increased 0.6%. 
There was no mention in the ONS's release of the phenomenon of stockpiling by manufacturers ahead of Brexit, something that has figured prominently in IHS Markit's closely-watched business surveys in recent months.
With just over two weeks until the U.K. is set to leave the European Union, British Prime Minister Theresa May is still struggling to get Parliament to approve her withdrawal agreement. Parliament is expected to vote on the measure later in day.
In talks with EU Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker Monday, May had secured a number of changes and additions to the withdrawal agreement, hoping to persuade dissenting lawmakers that it won’t leave the U.K. permanently trapped in a customs union with the EU with no influence over its rules.
It’s not clear yet whether the changes will be enough to get the deal through parliament. The original version was defeated by a margin of 230 votes and most dissenting lawmakers have yet to say they will back the new version.
A smooth Brexit – or the cancellation of it altogether - are both widely viewed as positive for the U.K. economy. Either outcome would remove a key constraint on the Bank of England, which has indicated it would like to raise interest rates. Sterling has risen 1.5% against the dollar in the last two days, while the yield on the benchmark 10-year government bond rose by 7 basis points to 1.25% on the back of Monday night’s news."

The Finance Ministry’s quarterly business survey, released Tuesday, showed a reading of minus 7.3 for conditions among Japan’s largest manufacturers, the worst result since the second quarter of 2016.
The survey also showed sentiment among medium-sized manufacturers was the poorest in nearly five years, while that of small manufacturers was the worst in six years.
The readings are the latest in a raft of data pointing to a weak start to 2019 for Japan as China’s slowdown, U.S. trade protectionism and softness in tech demand push down on global growth. Japan’s exports and factory output logged deeper falls in January, while machine tool orders continued their plunge in February.
Still, the survey showed that not all firms are fretting yet. Large non-manufacturers had a positive view of conditions.

1670,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 11, 2019 01:31PM ET</span>",U.S. retail sales rebound but not enough to jolt slowing economy,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. retail sales rose modestly in January after a December drop that was even larger than originally estimated, but the recovery was not seen strong enough to alter the course of a U.S. economy that was losing momentum in early 2019.
The report from the Commerce Department on Monday was welcome news for the economy after a raft of weak December data, as well as a sharp moderation in the pace of job growth in February. Still, January's increase in retail sales recouped only a fraction of December's plunge, leaving expectations for a slowdown in consumer spending in the first quarter intact.
""Sales managed only a tepid reversal in January from December's deep freeze,"" said Douglas Porter, chief economist at BMO Capital Markets in Toronto. ""While we expect some further comeback in the next couple months, the big story is that the economy's big engine is cooling.""
Retail sales rose 0.2 percent as increased purchases of building materials and more discretionary spending offset the biggest decline in motor vehicle sales in five years. Data for December was revised to show sales tumbling 1.6 percent instead of decreasing 1.2 percent as previously reported. 
The drop in December was the biggest since September 2009 when the economy was emerging from recession. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast retail sales to be unchanged in January. Sales in January increased 2.3 percent from a year ago. 
The January retail sales report was delayed by a 35-day partial shutdown of the federal government that ended on Jan. 25. February's retail sales report, which was scheduled for publication on Thursday, will be released on April 1.
Excluding automobiles, gasoline, building materials and food services, retail sales rebounded 1.1 percent in January after a downwardly revised 2.3 percent plunge in December, the largest drop since 2000. These so-called core retail sales correspond most closely with the consumer spending component of gross domestic product. 
They were previously reported to have decreased 1.7 percent in December. Consumer spending accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity.
Coming on the heels of a deterioration in the trade deficit in December and weak construction spending, the downward revision to the core retail sales suggested gross domestic product growth slowed more than the government initially estimated in the fourth quarter. 
The government reported last month that the economy grew at a 2.6 percent annualized rate in the October-December quarter after expanding at a brisk 3.4 percent in the third quarter.
Economists now expect GDP growth will be lowered to a 2.1 percent pace when the government publishes its revision later this month.
FADING FISCAL STIMULUS
The weaker December core retail sales also set consumer spending on a weaker growth path in the first three months of the year, leading the Atlanta Federal Reserve to cut its January-March quarter GDP growth forecast by three-tenths of percentage point to a 0.2 percent rate. 
Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) lowered its first-quarter growth estimate by four-tenths of a percentage point to a 0.5 percent rate. 
Consumer spending, which increased at a 2.8 percent rate in the fourth quarter, is seen rising modestly in the first three months of the year as the stimulus from a $1.5 trillion tax cut package fades. In addition, 2018 tax refunds have on average been smaller than in the previous years. 
But spending remains supported by strong wage growth and higher consumer confidence. The government reported on Friday annual wage growth increased 3.4 percent in February, the biggest gain since April 2009, from 3.1 percent in January.
Slowing economic growth supports the Federal Reserve's ""patient"" approach toward further interest rate hikes this year. 
Fed Chairman Jerome Powell reiterated the U.S. central bank's stance on Sunday in a wide-ranging interview with CBS's 60 Minutes news show. Powell said the Fed did ""not feel any hurry"" to change the level of interest rates again..
""Weak first-quarter GDP will be another factor that keeps the Fed 'patient' at the March meeting and beyond,"" said Andrew Hollenhorst, an economist at  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) in New York.
The dollar was little changed against a basket of currencies, while U.S. Treasury prices fell. Stocks on Wall Street rose after five straight sessions of declines, but a sharp drop in Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co shares after a second deadly crash of one of its planes in just five months capped gains on the blue-chip Dow.
In January, online and mail-order retail sales increased 2.6 percent, the biggest gain since December 2017. Sales at building material stores increased 3.3 percent, the most since September 2017. But receipts at auto dealerships tumbled 2.4 percent in January, the largest drop since January 2014, after gaining 0.3 percent in the prior month. 
Receipts at service stations fell 2.0 percent reflecting cheaper gasoline prices. There were also declines in sales at clothing and furniture stores, as well as electronics and appliance shops.

Discretionary spending rose in January, with sales at restaurants and bars advancing 0.7 percent and purchases at hobby, musical instrument and book stores jumping 4.8 percent, the largest increase since January 2013. Sales at food and beverage stores gained by the most since April 2016.

BERLIN (Reuters) - Plunging car output drove an unexpected drop in production of German goods in January and an industry body cut its 2019 growth forecast, adding to signs that trade tensions and unease about Brexit are weighing on Europe's largest economy.
A global slowdown, tariff disputes sparked by U.S. President Donald Trump's 'America First' policies and a potentially chaotic British departure from the EU threaten to bring a decade-long expansion in export-reliant Germany to an end.
The same factors are impacting the rest of the European Union, and Monday's data added weight to a dovish policy shift by the European Central Bank last week as safe-haven bonds rose.
""Industrial production is hard data and it is really cementing the impression that the European economy is slowing down,"" said Mizuho rates strategist Antoine Bouvet.
""It is lending credibility to the view that the slowdown is not temporary.""
Germany's BDI industry association cut its 2019 economic growth forecast to 1.2 percent from 1.5 percent.
""The economy is continuing to lose momentum, mainly for reasons related to the external environment,"" its managing director Joachim Lang said. ""Disruptions in trade with Britain or the United States could bring us dangerously close to zero growth.""
German business daily Handelsblatt said on Monday the federal government had cut its in-house GDP growth outlook to 0.8 percent from 1.0 percent, the second reduction in less than two months.
The Economy Ministry and the Finance Ministry declined to comment. The government is expected to update its forecast in April.
GATHERING CLOUDS
Industrial output dropped 0.8 percent in January, well below market expectations for a rise of 0.5 percent, Germany's Statistics Office said.
The figure for December was sharply revised up, however, to a 0.8 percent increase from a previously reported 0.4 percent drop, and the euro recovered ground after a brief dip.
Automobile production fell by 9.2 percent on the month in January, separate data from the Economy Ministry showed. It blamed special factors such as strikes at suppliers and a switch to new brands for the weak performance.
German carmakers are also at the sharp end of a sectoral dip driven by a slowdown in China, a plunge in demand for diesel vehicles and costly investments in electric as well as self-driving cars.
""The headwinds from abroad are hitting the German economy particularly hard,"" Sophia Krietenbrink from the DIHK Chambers of Industry and Commerce said. 
Seasonally adjusted exports were flat month-on-month in January - compared to a forecast 0.5 percent contraction - while imports rose 1.5 percent, the data showed. That meant the trade surplus narrowed to 18.5 billion euros ($20.80 billion).
The unexpectedly weak data suggests the German economy is likely to post only meager growth in the first quarter after it barely avoided a recession - defined as two consecutive quarters of contraction - in the second half of last year.
The slowing economy means tax revenues are likely to be lower than expected this year, which could increase tensions in Chancellor Angela Merkel's governing coalition over spending priorities.
ING economist Carsten Brzeski said that the sharp revisions of monthly data, stabilizing domestic orders and solid fundamentals suggested the industrial slowdown was reaching its low point.

""But if the search for a bottom takes too long, the German government should start considering additional fiscal stimulus,"" he said.

The Commerce Department said on Monday that business inventories rose 0.6 percent after being unchanged in November.
Inventories are a key component of gross domestic product. December's increase was in line with economists' expectations.
The December business inventory report was delayed by a five-week partial shutdown of the federal government that ended on Jan. 25. The January report, which was scheduled to be published on Thursday, will now be released on April 1. 
Retail inventories rebounded 0.9 percent in December as previously reported in an advance report last month. Retail inventories fell 0.4 percent in November. 
Motor vehicle inventories rose 0.6 percent rather than the 0.7 percent rise reported last month. That followed a similar gain in November. Retail inventories excluding autos, which go into the calculation of GDP, increased 1.0 percent in December as reported last month. 
Wholesale inventories jumped 1.1 percent in December and stocks at manufacturers were unchanged.
The government reported last month that inventory investment added 0.13 percentage point to the fourth quarter's 2.6 percent annualized growth rate. December trade and construction spending data have led economists to expect that the government will lower the fourth-quarter GDP estimate when it publishes revisions to the data later this month.
Business sales tumbled 1.0 percent in December, the most since December 2015, after dropping 0.6 percent in November. Retail sales plunged 1.8 percent in December. Sales at wholesalers dropped 1.0 percent while those at manufacturers fell 0.2 percent. 

At December's sales pace, it would take 1.38 months for businesses to clear shelves, the most since August 2017, up from 1.36 months in November.

The Commerce Department said that retail sales rose 0.2% in January, above analysts’ expectations for a flat reading. But the figures offer only modest reassurance over the health of the U.S. consumer: December's figures, which were already the worst in a decade, were revised to show a drop of 1.6% in the final month of 2018, down from initial drop of 1.2%.
Taking account of everything, the figures show a ""weak start"" to consumer spending in 2019 and are consistent with expectations of a generally weak first quarter for the first quarter, Liz-Ann Sonders, chief investment strategist with  Charles Schwab  (NYSE:SCHW) & Co., said via 

.
Yields on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury bond inched down two basis points to a session low of 2.63% on the news.
Core retail sales - which exclude automobiles, gasoline, building materials and food services and more closely correspond to the U.S. consumer spending component of gross domestic product - increased by 0.9%. Economists had forecast core growth of 0.4%.
The data come after a mixed employment report on Friday that showed solid wage growth and a drop in the unemployment rate in February, even though the headline nonfarm payrolls number fell short of expectations with the creation of just 20,000 new jobs.
The data overlapped with the U.S. government shutdown that lasted until Jan. 25 and had driven the University of Michigan’s consumer sentiment to its lowest level since Donald Trump was elected president.
The same index bounced in February, but the relief from the end of the government shutdown faded toward near the end of the month, the survey’s chief economist Richard Curtin said when the report was released."

Net FDI in 2017 had hit an all-time high of $10.26 billion.
Equity capital investment in 2018 dropped to $2.3 billion from $3.4 billion the year before. A bulk of these inflows came from Singapore, the United States, Hong Kong, Japan, and China, and channelled mainly to manufacturing, financial, real estate, and a few other sectors.
Investment in debt instruments rose 11 percent to $6.7 billion from $6.0 billion in 2017.
Despite it being one of Asia's fastest-growing economies, the Philippines lags regional peers in terms of attracting foreign direct investments because of foreign ownership restrictions, high power costs and poor infrastructure.
The Philippines' 2018 FDI figure pales in comparison with the $29.3 billion and $19.1 billion that Indonesia and Vietnam respectively received last year.
Late last year, President Rodrigo Duterte signed an executive order further liberalizing investment rules to lure much needed foreign capital and help boost economic growth.
The order removed ownership restrictions and further opened up certain sectors and activities such as construction and repair of locally-funded public works projects to foreigners.

BEIJING (Reuters) - China's automobile sales fell 13.8 percent in February from the same month a year earlier, the country's biggest auto industry association said on Monday, marking the eighth consecutive month of decline in the world's largest auto market.
The China Association of Automobile Manufacturers (CAAM) said sales fell to 1.48 million vehicles last month, after declines of 16 percent in January and 13 percent in December.
Sales of new energy vehicles, such as electric cars, rose 53.6 percent year-on-year in February, the group said. 
""The trend experienced last year has continued into this year, and the economic situation has also been weak. This has dragged down consumption,"" CAAM's Deputy Secretary General Shi Jianhua told reporters at a news briefing in Beijing. 
""Consumers are also waiting for more government policies,"" he said.
China plans billions of dollars in tax cuts and infrastructure spending to support an economy growing at its slowest pace in almost 30 years due to softer domestic demand and a trade war with the United States.
It has promised subsidies to boost rural sales of some vehicles as well as demand for new energy vehicles, after China's auto market contracted last year for the first time in more than two decades.
The major task for dealers in the first half of 2019 is to reduce vehicle inventories amid rising funding pressures, said Chen Shihua, CAAM's assistant secretary general.
The sales performance for some Chinese automakers has been mixed so far. Great Wall Motor Co Ltd reported 18 percent growth in February compared to the same month last year, while Geely Automobile Holdings Ltd said sales fell 24 percent in the same period.
Car sales in January and February tend to be affected by the Lunar New Year holiday -- which this year took place in the first week of February -- when consumers often delay purchases, auto executives have said.

1678,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 10, 2019 09:00PM ET</span>",Pre-recession signals lurk in UK jobs data: research,"LONDON (Reuters) - Beneath the headline figures showing a strong British labor market, the ebb and flow of jobs and businesses being created and destroyed is showing a pattern associated with the onset of recession, research suggested on Monday.
Employers in Britain created almost 400,000 jobs last year, pushing the jobs rate to a new record high - a bright spot in a slowing economy weighed down by Brexit worries and weakening global trade.
But academics at the Enterprise Research Centre, a research network, said there were some unpromising signals when looking at the jobs data split between new and existing firms.
Start-up businesses contributed roughly 1 million jobs in 2018, cancelling out a net 613,000 drop in employment across established companies.
This looks unlikely to be sustained, with the rates of business ""births"" and ""deaths"" now converging - often a poor omen for the economy, particularly if the death rate overtakes the birth rate.
The authors of the report said this trend should be viewed in a longer-term context, rather than as a result of temporary Brexit uncertainty sweeping the economy.
Mark Hart, professor of entrepreneurship at Aston Business School, said the official data showing record employment could lull policymakers into a false sense of security.
""Even if our headline employment figures are being propped up by start-ups creating new jobs, we are already witnessing a severe slowdown in hiring by the established firms that are vital to the health of our economy,"" Hart said.
Recent short-term business surveys have pointed to a fall in employment, although most attribute this to uncertainty ahead of Brexit.
Britain is due to leave the European Union on March 29, although Prime Minister Theresa May has opened up the possibility of a delay given her inability to secure parliamentary ratification of the deal so far.

Amid the uncertainty, the world's fifth-biggest economy has shown signs of slowing and the Bank of England expects the weakest growth in 2019 since the global financial crisis, even if May manages to clinch a Brexit transition deal.

Analysts say China needs to revive weak credit growth to help head off a sharper economic slowdown this year, but investors are worried about a further jump in corporate debt and the risk to banks as they relax their lending standards.
Chinese banks made 885.8 billion yuan in net new yuan loans in February, according to data released by the People's Bank of China (PBOC) on Sunday.
That was down sharply from a record 3.23 trillion yuan in January, when several other key credit gauges also picked up modestly in response to the central bank's policy easing.
But February's tally was still 5.5 percent higher than 839.3 billion yuan a year earlier.
Analysts polled by Reuters had predicted new yuan loans of 975 billion yuan in February.
A pull-back in February's tally had been widely expected as Chinese banks tend to front-load loans at the beginning of the year to get higher-quality customers and win market share.
Broad M2 money supply grew 8.0 percent in February from a year earlier, missing forecasts, the central bank data showed. Analysts had expected a 8.4 percent rise in M2 - unchanged from January.
Outstanding yuan loans grew 13.4 percent from a year earlier, matching expectations and unchanged from January's rise.
FURTHER EASING SEEN ON CARDS
China's central bank is widely expected to ease policy further this year to spur lending and lower borrowing costs, especially for small and private firms vital for growth and job creation.
But policymakers have repeatedly vowed not to open the credit floodgates in an economy already saddled with piles of debt - a legacy of massive stimulus during the global financial crisis in 2008-09 and subsequent downturns.
Corporate bond defaults hit a record last year, while banks' non-performing loan ratio notched a 10-year high.
Premier Li Keqiang told parliament on Tuesday that Beijing will step up targeted cuts in the reserve requirement ratio (RRR) for smaller and medium-sized banks with an aim to boost lending to small companies by large banks by more than 30 percent.
He also said monetary policy would be ""neither too tight nor too loose"". Li also pledged to push for market-based reforms to lower real interest rates.
The central bank has already cut RRR - the amount that banks need to set aside as reserves - five times over the past year, most recently in January. Further cuts are widely expected.
Sources have told Reuters the central bank is not ready to cut benchmark interest rates just yet, but is likely to cut market-based rates.
Growth of outstanding total social financing (TSF), a broad measure of credit and liquidity in the economy, slowed to 10.1 percent in February from January's 10.4 percent, versus a record low of 9.8 percent in December.
TSF growth is a rough gauge of credit conditions.
TSF includes off-balance sheet forms of financing that exist outside the conventional bank lending system, such as initial public offerings, loans from trust companies and bond sales.
In February, TSF fell to 703 billion yuan from 4.64 trillion yuan in January.
Analysts note there is a time lag before a jump in lending will translate into growth, suggesting business conditions may get worse before they get better. And, there is a risk that more firms are borrowing merely to refinance existing debt, rather than for fresh investment needed to fuel an economic turnaround.
Past credit spreads have also invariably led to speculation in property and financial markets. The country's banking watchdog has punished two lenders for illegally channeling money into the stock market, the official Securities Times said on Friday.
China's economic growth is expected to cool to around 6.2 percent this year, a 29-year low, according to Reuters polls.
Most economists expect a rocky first half before conditions begin to stabilize around mid-year as support measures begin to have a greater impact.
Growth slowed to 6.6 percent last year, with domestic demand curbed by higher borrowing rates and tighter credit conditions and exporters hit by the escalating trade war with the United States.

1681,By Investing.com,"<span>Mar 08, 2019 10:05AM ET</span>",Is the U.S. Jobs Report too Bad to Be True?,"Investing.com - For traders obsessed with job creation as a reflection of the American labor market, Friday’s release of the monthly employment report was a dismal message for the U.S. economy. But if cooler heads prevail, one-off data with a background of escalating wages could well paint quite another picture for Federal Reserve policymakers struggling to stay on hold.
“Yes, only 20,000 jobs were added in February, but please do not start freaking out about a recession. One month does not make a trend,” Heidi Shierholz, director of the Economic Policy Institute, said.
She explained that harsh weather contributed to weakness in February with depressing job growth in construction, hotels and restaurants and noted that average job growth for the last three months was 186,000, “a much better reflection of underlying trends”.
James Knightley, ING chief international economist, also put into question Friday’s report. “While the U.S. economy is clearly facing some headwinds, this report seems very odd since it completely contradicts other evidence such as the ISM employment indices, the ADP (NASDAQ:ADP) report and the NFIB jobs number,” he said.
In any case, a long expansion in the American labor market has been reducing slack, providing less and less room for further job creation in an economy that is near full employment.
That is starting to be felt in wage growth which the Fed is closely watching as it keeps open the possibility of a rate hike in the second half of the year.
Average hourly earnings rose 0.4% on the month, above forecasts for a 0.3% rise, and by 3.4% on an annualized basis, its highest in 10 years. For most of the expansion, wage increases have lagged an otherwise healthy labor market.
Former New York Fed president William Dudley warned earlier this week that investors should not assume the pause in policy tightening meant that the U.S. central bank was done raising rates.
“People should be careful about jumping to such conclusions. Although the Fed is likely to stay on hold for the next few months, after that it’s anybody’s guess,” he wrote in an opinion piece for Bloomberg published on Wednesday.
Using Dudley’s “few months” as a guideline, that leaves the U.S. central bank three meetings - March 20, May 1 and June 19 - to keep an eye on developments, including the progress on U.S.-China trade negotiations, the global slowdown and an increasingly tight labor market stateside.
Knightley in the meantime emphasized his call for one more Fed rate hike this year, noting the solid health of Corporate America, potential for the global growth outlook to improve if the U.S. and China resolve their trade dispute and the increase in inflation pressures on the back of rising wage growth.
“Consequently, we still think there is a strong case for another interest rate rise this summer, which is clearly at odds with a market pricing the next move as being a cut,” Knightley concluded."
1682,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 08, 2019 09:21AM ET</span>","U.S. economy gains paltry 20,000 jobs in February","By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. job growth almost stalled in February, with the economy creating only 20,000 jobs as construction and retail payrolls dropped, which could raise concerns about a sharp slowdown in economic activity.
The job growth reported by the Labor Department on Friday was the weakest since September 2017, but it probably understated the health of the labor market as other details of the closely watched employment report were strong. 
The unemployment rate fell back to below 4 percent and annual wage growth was the best since 2009. In addition, data for December and January were revised to show 12,000 more jobs created than previously reported. 
Still, the economy that in July will mark 10 years of expansion, the longest on record, is slowing and the weakening job gains support the Federal Reserve's ""patient"" approach toward further interest rate increases this year.
""The sharp slowdown in payroll employment growth in February provides further evidence that economic growth has slowed in the first quarter,"" said Michael Pearce, senior U.S. economist at Capital Economics in New York. ""That adds weight to our view that the Fed will not be raising interest rates this year.""
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast non farm payrolls rising by 180,000 jobs last month and the unemployment rate falling to 3.9 percent. 
The slowdown likely reflected the fading weather-related boost in the prior two months and workers becoming more scarce. A stock market selloff and jump in U.S. Treasury yields in late 2018, which tightened financial market conditions, were also likely factors.
About 390,000 workers stayed at home in February because of the bad weather, not much different from previous years. The length of the average workweek fell to 34.4 hours from 34.5 hours in January.
U.S. stock index futures extended losses and yields on U.S. Treasuries plummeted after the release of the data. The dollar held earlier losses.
SLOWING ECONOMY
The moderation in hiring was flagged by first-time applications for jobless benefits, which were elevated in February. Also, Institute for Supply Management surveys showed measures of manufacturing and services sectors employment dropped in the month, while the Fed on Wednesday reported ""modest-to-moderate gains"" in employment in a majority of the U.S. central bank's districts. 
Though the economy grew 2.9 percent in 2018, its strongest performance in three years, it lost momentum as the year ended. Retail sales, homebuilding, business spending and exports all declined in December, setting the economy on a slower growth path. 
Despite the weakness in hiring last month, the unemployment rate fell two-tenths of a percentage point to 3.8 percent in February as federal government workers who were temporarily unemployed during a 35-day partial shutdown returned to work. The longest shutdown in U.S. history ended on Jan. 25.
A broader measure of unemployment, which includes people who want to work but have given up searching and those working part-time because they cannot find full-time employment, dropped to 7.3 percent after hitting an 11-month high of 8.1 percent in January because of the government shutdown. 
Average hourly earnings rose 11 cents, or 0.4 percent, in February, partly because of a calendar quirk, after gaining 0.1 percent in January. That raised the annual increase in wages to 3.4 percent, the biggest gain since April 2009, from 3.1 percent in January. Overall, wage inflation remains moderate.
A report on Thursday showed labor costs rising only 1.4 percent in 2018, the smallest gain since 2016, after increasing 2.2 percent in 2017.
Economists say employers have kept hiring at a strong pace despite low unemployment as more people returned to the labor force, including students, women and people who had dropped out to collect disability benefits. They, however, say that source of labor supply is dwindling.
The labor force participation rate, or the proportion of working-age Americans who have a job or are looking for one, was unchanged last month at more than a five-year high of 63.2 percent.
Last month, employment at construction sites fell by 31,000 jobs, the biggest drop since December 2013, after increasing by 53,000 in January. The leisure and hospitality sector added no jobs last month after payrolls increased by 89,000 in January.
The manufacturing sector added 4,000 jobs in February after hiring 21,000 workers in the prior month. Retail payrolls fell by 6,100 jobs. There were also job losses in the utilities as well as transportation and warehousing industries. Government payrolls declined by 5,000 jobs last month.

Professional and business services employment increased by 42,000 jobs in February. The education and health care sector added only 4,000 jobs.

1683,By Investing.com,"<span>Mar 08, 2019 09:05AM ET</span>",U.S. Labor Market Tightened in February Despite Sharp Drop in Job Creation,"Investing.com - The U.S. labor market in February presented a mixed picture as job creation ground to a near-halt, while the unemployment rate dropped by more than expected and wage inflation accelerated beyond forecasts.
Nonfarm payrolls (NFP) rose by 20,000 in February, a sharp slowdown from the 311,000 posts created the prior month and well below consensus expectations of 181,000. Employment in professional and business services, health care, and wholesale trade continued to trend up, while construction employment fell, the Bureau of Labor Statistics said.
Markets reacted negatively to that headline number, before trimming losses as they absorbed the significance of the more positive elements. The jobless rate dropped to 3.8%, further than analysts' estimates for 3.9%. Meanwhile, wage inflation grew 3.4% on an annualized basis, up from 3.1% in the year through January and topping expectations for a 3.3% increase.
""Don't hit (the) panic button,"" said Dean Baker, an economist with the Center for Economic Policy Research in Washington, via 

.
Baker said that a sharp drop in hours worked was potentially even more worrying than the headline jobs number, but added that ""bad weather could have been a factor.""
At 8:55 AM ET (13:55 GMT), S&P 500 futures were down 0.73%, having been down 0.47% before the release. The benchmark 10-year Treasury yield fell initially but then rebounded, to be down only 1 basis point from before the release at 2.63%.
The dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of major currencies, dipped slightly to 97.310, but was still up sharply from 24 hours earlier.
Over the first two months of the year, nonfarm employment rose by a total of 331,000, or an average of 165,500 a month. That's a little more than 10% below the average rate of 186,000 for the last three months, the BLS said.
The slowdown in jobs creation, although worse than expected, seems to finally have caught up with economic theory. A long expansion in the American labor market has been reducing slack, providing less and less room for further job creation in an economy that is near full employment.
That is starting to be felt in wage growth. Average hourly earnings rose 0.4% on the month, above forecasts for a 0.3% rise, and by 3.4% on an annualized basis. For most of the expansion, wage increases have lagged an otherwise healthy labor market.
The Federal Reserve is closely watching the increase in wage inflation and - although currently on hold - has kept open the possibility of a rate hike in the second half of the year.
Former New York Fed president William Dudley warned earlier this week that investors should not assume the pause in policy tightening meant that the U.S. central bank was done raising rates.
“People should be careful about jumping to such conclusions. Although the Fed is likely to stay on hold for the next few months, after that it’s anybody’s guess,” he wrote in an opinion piece for Bloomberg published on Wednesday.
Using Dudley’s “few months” as a guideline, that leaves the U.S. central bank three meetings - March 20, May 1 and June 19 - to keep an eye on developments, including the progress on U.S.-China trade negotiations, the global slowdown and an increasingly tight labor market stateside."
1684,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 08, 2019 08:40AM ET</span>",U.S. housing starts increase more than expected in January,"WASHINGTON, March 8 - U.S. homebuilding increased more than expected in January as construction of single-family housing rebounded after four straight monthly declines, but building permits for these units fell to the lowest level since mid-2017.
Housing starts jumped 18.6 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.230 million units in January, the Commerce Department said on Friday. Data for December was revised down to show starts declining to a rate of 1.037 million units instead of the previously reported pace of 1.078 million units.
Building permits rose 1.4 percent to a rate of 1.345 million units in January, driven by an increase in permits for the volatile multi-family housing segment. 
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast housing starts rising to a pace of 1.197 million units in January. The release of the January housing starts and building permits report was delayed by a five-week partial shutdown of the federal government that ended on Jan. 25.
The housing market hit a soft patch last year amid higher mortgage rates, expensive lumber as well as land and labor shortages, which led to tight inventories and less affordable homes. Investment in homebuilding contracted 0.2 percent in 2018, the weakest performance since 2010.
Single-family homebuilding, which accounts for the largest share of the housing market, surged 25.1 percent to a rate of 926,00 units in January, the highest since May 2018. The increase followed four straight monthly declines. Single-family homebuilding rose in all four regions. 
Permits to build single-family homes fell 2.1 percent in January to a pace of 812,000 units, the lowest level since August 2017, suggesting weakness in single-family homebuilding in the months ahead. 

Starts for the multi-family housing segment rose 2.4 percent to a rate of 304,000 units in January. Permits for the construction of multi-family homes increased 7.2 percent to a pace of 533,000 units.

1686,By Bloomberg,"<span>Mar 08, 2019 12:20AM ET</span>","China's GDP Growth Pace Was Inflated for Nine Years, Study Finds","(Bloomberg) -- China over-reported its economic growth between 2008 and 2016 by an average of 1.7 percentage points, according to a recent study by researchers at the Chinese University of Hong Kong and the University of Chicago.
The discrepancy came from local governments who are rewarded for meeting growth and investment targets, the authors say in a draft paper published by the Brookings Institution. The Beijing-based National Bureau of Statistics, knowing such manipulation well, has been adjusting the local numbers but hasn’t done so sufficiently since 2008, authors Wei Chen, Xilu Chen, Chang-Tai Hsieh and Zheng Song wrote.
“Local statistics increasingly misrepresent the true numbers after 2008, but there was no corresponding change in the adjustment made by the NBS,” they wrote. They instead use numbers such as tax revenue, satellite night lights, electricity consumption, railway cargo flow, exports and imports -- less likely to be fudged, to predict the actual gross domestic product of the world’s second largest economy.
The revised numbers “indicate that the slowdown in Chinese growth since 2008 is more severe than suggested by the official statistics,” they wrote.
China’s NBS didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.
China’s GDP has long been criticized for either over- or under-estimating growth, or for smoothing out the fluctuations in real economic activities. Local authorities, eager to achieve economic growth goals so as to improve their own chances of promotion, used to report regional GDP figures that when summed would be more than 10 percent larger than the official national figure.
In recent years, the national authority has cracked down on fudging statistics by collecting data directly from firms, naming and shaming officials as well as setting up a specific inspection arm. The head of the statistics bureau claimed last year that the problems were all in the past, and from 2019, it will start to compute GDP for the 31 domestic regions.
Tom Orlik, chief economist for Bloomberg Economics and author of ""Understanding China’s Economic Indicators"" says he is “cautious” about the paper’s conclusions.
The NBS has made ""determined efforts"" to squeeze out the impact of local exaggeration since the 1990s, and the argument that local officials have overstated investment is hard to square with the well-known narrative that China’s capital spending rose too much, he wrote. The authors base their estimate of the “true” rate of GDP on tax revenue, but that may have reflected a larger services sector, and should not be taken as more accurate than other official indicators, according to Orlik.

1687,By Investing.com,"<span>Mar 08, 2019 12:00AM ET</span>",China Exports Tumble in February,"Investing.com – China’s exports for February tumbled 20.7% year-on-year, data from the National Bureau of Statistics showed on Friday.
The export reading in February came in much lower than market expectations of a 4.8% drop. It also reversed January gains of 9.1%.
Imports were also down 5.2%, while the market estimated a 1.4% decline only.
The decrease has left China with a trade surplus in February of $4.12 billion, much smaller than the expected $26.38 billion.
The February export data represented the biggest tumble in three years, and imports also fell for a third straight month.
This data came at a time when China was already showing signs of a slowing economy.
On Tuesday, Chinese policymakers lowered GDP growth targets to between 6% to 6.5%. Last year, China expanded by 6.6%, which was its slowest growth rate since 1990.
China’s Finance Minister Lui Kun said on Thursday that the country would use tax cuts to prop up the slowing economy.
While an economic slowdown in China might be behind the worse-than-expected data in February, seasonal factors might also have contributed to the rosy data in January. Exporters tend to load their shipments ahead of the week-long annual Lunar New Year festive period that takes place in February.
The ongoing U.S.-China trade war was also cited as negatively impacting Chinese factories, though both sides are reported to want to conclude the trade talks soon.
“Right now, I think there’s just a lot of work in getting words down ... a contract or agreement, and that’s the current status,” Ted McKinney, undersecretary for U.S. Trade and Foreign Agricultural Affairs, told a press call.
Bloomberg reported that U.S. President Donald Trump is pushing for negotiators to close a Sino-U.S. trade deal ahead of the 2020 campaign.
The worse-than-expected export data sent Chinese stocks further down on Friday afternoon. By 11:03 PM ET (04:03 GMT), the Shanghai Composite was down 2.90% and the Shenzhen Component lost 1.55%.

Gross domestic product grew at an annualized pace of 1.9 percent in the three months through December, revised Cabinet Office data showed Friday.

1689,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 07, 2019 07:18PM ET</span>",Japan fourth-quarter GDP revised up on investment rebound but trade clouds outlook,"By Stanley White
TOKYO (Reuters) - The Japanese economy grew faster than initially estimated in the fourth quarter as capital expenditure staged a quick recovery from a series of natural disasters in the previous quarter.
However, despite the upward revision to growth, economists are likely to temper their optimism on the outlook given a recent batch of disappointing data on exports and factory output and the economy expected to weaken due to the Sino-U.S. trade war.
Japan's gross domestic product rose at an annualized rate of 1.9 percent in October-December, more than the initial estimate of a 1.4 percent annualized expansion and more than the median estimate for a 1.8 percent annualized increase, revised data from the Cabinet Office showed.
That followed a revised 2.4 percent annualized contraction in the third quarter, which was the biggest decline in more than four years.
Economists warn that capital expenditure and overall economic growth are likely to weaken in the first half of this year as exports dwindle and inventories pile up due to a slowdown in global trade.
The revised figure translates into a quarter-on-quarter expansion of 0.5 percent in real, price-adjusted terms. This is more than a preliminary reading of a 0.3 percent expansion and economists' median estimate of a 0.4 percent increase.
The capital expenditure component of GDP rose 2.7 percent in October-December from the previous quarter to mark the fastest expansion since January-March 2015. That compares with the median forecast for a 2.8 percent increase and a preliminary 2.4 percent expansion.
Private consumption, which accounts for roughly 60 percent of GDP, rose 0.4 percent in the fourth quarter, less than the preliminary estimate of a 0.6 percent increase.
Net exports - or exports minus imports - contributed minus 0.3 percentage point, unchanged from preliminary data.
Domestic demand added a revised 0.8 percentage point to GDP, more than a preliminary reading of a 0.6 percentage point contribution.
Separate data on Friday showed household spending rose 2.0 percent year-on-year in January, more than the median estimate for a 0.4 percent annual contraction, which may ease concerns about domestic demand.
Real wages in January rose 1.1 percent year-on-year in January, matching the same pace of growth in the previous month, the labor ministry said on Friday.
The United States last year imposed tariffs on $250 billion worth of goods imported from China, with Beijing hitting back with duties on $110 billion worth of American products, including soybeans and other commodities.
U.S. President Donald Trump has delayed tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese imports as negotiations to resolve the eight-month trade war show signs of progress.

Even if the two sides resolve their differences, the damage to global trade and Japan's economy may take some time to repair with uncertainty about trade policies hurting sentiment and disrupting manufacturers' supply chains.

1690,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 07, 2019 08:59AM ET</span>",U.S. weekly jobless claims fall; productivity improves,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The number of Americans filing applications for unemployment benefits unexpectedly fell last week, pointing to strong labor market conditions despite signs that job growth was slowing.
While other data on Thursday showed an improvement in worker productivity in the fourth quarter, the trend remained sluggish. Labor costs continued to rise at a moderate pace in the last quarter, suggesting benign inflation pressures that support the Federal Reserve's ""patient"" stance towards further interest rate increases this year. 
Initial claims for state unemployment benefits slipped 3,000 to a seasonally adjusted 223,000 for the week ended March 2, the Labor Department said. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast claims would be unchanged at 225,000 in the latest week. 
The four-week moving average of initial claims, considered a better measure of labor market trends as it irons out week-to-week volatility, fell 3,000 to 226,250 last week, the lowest level in a month.
The claims data has no bearing on February's employment report, which is scheduled for release on Friday, as it falls outside the survey period. There are indications that employment growth is slowing after last year's robust gains. Part of the moderation in job growth is because of a shortage of workers. 
Recent Institute for Supply Management surveys showed measures of manufacturing and services sectors employment dropping in February. A report from the Fed on Wednesday showed ""modest-to-moderate gains"" in employment in a majority of the U.S. central bank's districts in February.
The Fed's ""Beige Book"" report of anecdotal information on business activity collected from contacts nationwide showed notable worker shortages in information technology, manufacturing and construction industries as well as trucking businesses and at restaurants. 
The Fed said contacts reported labor shortages were restricting employment growth in some areas.
The pace of job growth, however, remains more than enough to keep pushing the unemployment rate down. According to a Reuters survey of economists, non farm payrolls likely increased by 180,000 jobs in February after surging by 304,000 in January.
The unemployment rate is forecast to fall one-tenth of a percentage point to 3.9 percent in February.
The U.S. dollar extended gains after the release of the data on Thursday while U.S. stock index futures were little changed. Prices of U.S. Treasuries were trading higher.
MODERATE LABOR COSTS
In another report on Thursday, the Labor Department said non farm productivity, which measures hourly output per worker, increased at a 1.9 percent annualized rate in the last quarter.
But data for the third quarter was revised down to show productivity rising at a pace of 1.8 percent instead of the previously reported 2.2 percent rate. 
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast fourth-quarter productivity advancing at a 1.6 percent rate, following a moderation in gross domestic product growth for that period. 
The economy grew at a 2.6 percent rate in the October-December period after a robust 3.4 percent growth pace in the third quarter.
The release of the full fourth-quarter productivity report was delayed by a 35-day partial shutdown of the U.S. government that ended on Jan. 25. The lapse in funding affected the collection and processing of economic data by the Commerce Department.
Compared to the fourth quarter of 2017, productivity increased at a rate of 1.8 percent. Productivity grew 1.3 percent in 2018, the strongest since 2010, after rising 1.1 percent in 2017. 
Tepid productivity is one of the constraints to keeping the economy on a path of strong growth on a sustained basis.
Unit labor costs, the price of labor per single unit of output, rose at a 2.0 percent pace in the fourth quarter. 

Unit labor costs in the July-September period grew at a 1.6 percent rate. Labor costs increased at a 1.0 percent rate compared to the fourth quarter of 2017. They increased 1.4 percent in 2018, the smallest gain since 2016, after rising 2.2 percent in 2017.

The four-week moving average was 226,250, a decline of 3,000 from the previous week. The monthly average is seen as a more accurate gauge of labor trends because it reduces volatility in the week-to-week data.

It left its main refinancing rate, which determines the cost of credit in the economy, unchanged at 0%, where it has been since March 2016, as expected. However, the other announcements were a surprise to most in the market.
""The Governing Council expects the key ECB interest rates to remain at their present levels “at least through the end of 2019,” the ECB said in a slight change of phrasing. Until January, it had said rates would be on hold “at least through the summer.”
Its previous guidance had left the door open for a hike any time from September onward – a timeline that now seems ambitious, given that Germany and Italy, which account for over 40% of the currency area’s economy - didn’t grow at all in the fourth quarter and have also started 2019 weakly.
The euro fell around half a cent on the news and was down 0.2% on the day at 1.1270 by 8:15 AM ET (13:15 GMT), compared to 1.1311 ahead of the release. Against the pound, the single currency decreased to 0.8596 from 0.8612.
European bond yields also moved lower as rate hike expectations receded. The yield on the benchmark Italian 10-year bond fell to 2.58% from the prior 2.62%, although the 10-year German Bund only edged down to 0.11% from 0.12%.
The ECB also announced the launch of a new series of quarterly targeted longer-term refinancing operations, starting in September 2019 and ending in March 2021, each with a maturity of two years. They will be indexed to the refinancing rate, meaning that their cost will go up if the ECB does hike rates next year.
“These new operations will help to preserve favorable bank lending conditions and the smooth transmission of monetary policy,” the central bank said in its policy statement.
The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development Wednesday cut its forecast for Eurozone growth this year to a mere 1%. The ECB will present its own new forecasts at President Mario Draghi’s press conference at 08:30 AM ET (13:30 GMT) where he will likely explain the decision to offer new long-term loans to banks which are expected to help to anchor interest rates and ensure enough excess euro liquidity to stop the euro from rising in the foreign exchange markets."

ATHENS (Reuters) - Greece's economy shrank in the last three months of 2018 after expanding for nine consecutive quarters, government data showed on Thursday, with the annual pace of growth also slowing.
Seasonally adjusted data released by the country's statistics service showed gross domestic product contracted by 0.1 percent in the fourth quarter from the third, when it expanded by 1.0 percent.
Despite the slight contraction, the data showed Greece's recovery remains largely on track after a lengthy recession that shrank its economy by a quarter.
""The growth of the Greek economy, for a second year in a row, is a first positive step on the way to normality,"" said Eurobank chief economist Tassos Anastasatos.
""Deceleration of economic activity in Q4 2018, mainly due to a decline in fixed investments, reflects remaining uncertainties.""
On an annual basis, economic expansion decelerated to 1.6 percent in the fourth quarter from a downwardly revised 2.1 percent clip in the previous quarter.
""Private consumption along with net exports were the main drivers, but continuing weakness in investment spending - gross capital formation - was a drag,"" said National Bank economist Nikos Magginas.
Looking at 2018 as a whole, the data pointed to a 1.9 percent growth rate, slightly below initial estimates.
Other data released on Thursday showed unemployment in December fell to 18.0 percent from 18.3 percent in November, the lowest reading since July 2011 but still the highest in the euro zone.
In its latest enhanced surveillance report, issued last month, the European Union Commission projected real GDP growth of 2.0 percent in 2018, picking up to 2.2 percent this year and to 2.3 percent in 2019.
It sees domestic growth drivers - private consumption and investment - strengthening, but the contribution from the external sector moderating as imports rise and the EU's economic growth slow.

""Looking at this year, we expect private consumption to remain a pillar, helped by a rise in disposable incomes,"" Magginas said. ""Net exports will likely contribute positively but at a softer pace due to a slowdown in the euro area.""

The Food and Agriculture Organization's (FAO) food price index, which measures monthly changes for a basket of cereals, oilseeds, dairy products, meat and sugar, averaged 167.5 points last month, up 1.7 percent on January.
Despite the rise, the index was still 2.3 percent below its level of this time last year.
The FAO dairy price index jumped 5.6 percent from January's value, driven by strong import demand for skim milk powder, whole milk powder and cheese.
FAO's vegetable oil price index rose 1.8 percent from the previous month, while its sugar index rose 1.2 percent and its cereal index made marginal gains on January. The meat price index was also slightly stronger.
FAO lowered its latest world cereal production forecast for 2018 to 2.609 billion tonnes, against the 2.611 billion it forecast a month ago.
""The latest revision rests almost entirely on a lower estimate for the United States' maize output and reinforces an overall year-on-year decrease in global cereal production,"" FAO said.

The U.N. agency also made its first forecast for world wheat production in 2019, estimating it at 757 million tonnes -- four percent above the 2018 level but short of the record high registered in 2017.

1696,By Bloomberg,"<span>Mar 07, 2019 12:40AM ET</span>",BOE's Saunders Sees No Rush to Hike Rates as Brexit Fog Persists,"(Bloomberg) -- The Bank of England doesn’t need to rush to raise interest rates until the uncertainty of Brexit lifts, according to policy maker Michael Saunders.
In a speech in London Wednesday, Saunders, considered one of the most hawkish members of the Monetary Policy Committee, said that tame inflation and a slowdown in growth meant officials could adopt a wait-and-see approach as Brexit plays out.
BOE officials voted unanimously last month to hold interest rates at 0.75 percent, but Saunders’s comments may damp some speculation that he’s a candidate to dissent against that view before the U.K.’s future is clearer.
Still, Saunders indicated he’s not entirely in line with all his colleagues. He said that he was “genuinely unsure” on the path ahead for policy after a no-deal Brexit in contrast to his colleague Gertjan Vlieghe, who last month indicated he thought a rate cut would be more likely in such a scenario. Saunders said he was “more agnostic” about the correct response.
Should the U.K. avoid a chaotic exit, economic growth is likely to strengthen again, meaning limited and gradual interest-rate increases will be needed to keep inflation in check, he said. A “gradual” rate of tightening doesn’t mean “fantastically slow,” he said in response to questions following the speech.
“The possibility that monetary tightening might be needed in the future does not necessarily mean we need to tighten now,” Saunders said. “Given that at present economic growth is probably not strong enough to create excess demand and inflation is reasonably well behaved, for now it makes sense to wait and to see how Brexit developments unfold.”
The U.K. is currently due to exit the European Union, with or without a deal, on March 29, but a delay to the process is looking more likely, potentially extending uncertainty. If it were to be delayed, the reaction of households and businesses would determine the BOE’s response, Saunders said. It’s possible growth may pick up during the extension period, he said.
The comments on policy came in a speech that mainly focused on the pass through of the BOE’s interest rate increases to households and businesses. The link, he said, is less effective when policy rates are low, something that has been evidenced by the 50 basis point increase in the benchmark since 2017 being barely reflected in households mortgage and deposit rates.
That may mean officials need to adjust monetary policy “slightly more actively,” cutting or raising further than it would usually need to, he said."

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australian retailers suffered another bleak month in January, pointing to a tepid start for the new year after economic momentum slowed last quarter.
Retail sales rose 0.1 percent in January, figures from the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) showed on Thursday, picking up from a shock 0.4 percent decline the previous month but missing expectations for a 0.3 percent increase.
The Aussie dollar went as low as $0.7020 in the aftermath of the data.
The currency was already nursing losses from the previous day when gross domestic product (GDP) figures showed Australia's $1.3 trillion economy slowed sharply in the second half of last year.
The soft number increases the risk that economic growth in the first quarter will remain weak, and adds pressure on the central bank to ease policy. Household spending accounts for around 57 percent of Australia's annual GDP. 
""After yesterday's disappointing GDP print there was no real relief in the retail turnover figure for January,"" said Sarah Hunter, chief economist for Australia at BIS Oxford Economics.
""This is broadly in line with the underlying pace of growth seen over the last three months, and suggests that while conditions for households haven't worsened significantly, they also haven't improved.""
Consumer spending has been weighed down by record-high household debt and sluggish wage growth, one reason investors believe the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) could now consider cutting interest rates from an all-time low of 1.50 percent.
Calls from some analysts for the RBA to ease policy this year have intensified after Wednesday's GDP data. 
Futures markets predict a full 25-basis-point cut in October, a remarkable turnaround from just a couple of months ago when investors were positioned for a rate hike.
Thursday's figures showed consumers chose to eat out and spend on food in general rather than splurging on new clothes, shoes or household goods. New South Wales, of which Sydney is the capital, was the best performing state in January.
Worryingly, online sales plunged 23 percent in original terms in January, after rising a meager 2.2 percent in December. 
Less saving and weak spending has already slowed hit some of Australia's biggest businesses.
Grocers Coles Group Ltd and Woolworths Group Ltd had disappointing sales in the half to Dec. 31; sales are down at electronics retailer Harvey Norman Holdings Ltd; and, on Wednesday the country's biggest department store chain, Myer Holdings Ltd, posted its fifth consecutive half-year drop in revenue. 
Separate data showed Australia's exporters were enjoying boom times as the country's trade surplus swelled beyond all expectations to A$4.5 billion ($3.16 billion) in January, the second highest on record.
That was far above the A$3.0 billion forecast and owed much to a surge in gold exports, which more than doubled. In all, exports jumped 5 percent in January from the previous month, and were up 16 percent from a year earlier.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. goods trade deficit surged to a record high in 2018 as strong domestic demand fueled by lower taxes pulled in imports, despite the Trump administration's ""America First"" policies, including tariffs, aimed at shrinking the trade gap.
President Donald Trump is pursuing a protectionist trade agenda to shield U.S. manufacturing from what he says is unfair foreign competition. Trump, who has dubbed himself ""the tariff man,"" pledged on both the campaign trail and as president to reduce the deficit by shutting out more unfairly traded imports and renegotiating free trade agreements.
The Commerce Department said on Wednesday that a 12.4 percent jump in the goods deficit in December had contributed to the record $891.3 billion goods trade shortfall last year. The overall trade deficit surged 12.5 percent to $621.0 billion in 2018, the largest since 2008.
""The trade deficit exploded last year despite the Trump administration efforts to make America great again, and the trend is unlikely to get any better in 2019,"" said Chris Rupkeychief economist at MUFG in New York. 
The White House has argued that reducing the trade deficit would boost annual economic growth to its goal of 3 percent on a sustainable basis. The government also sought to stimulate the economy with a $1.5 trillion tax cut package, which jolted both consumer and business spending, helping to lift imported goods to a record $2.6 trillion in 2018.
The United States last year imposed tariffs on $250 billion worth of goods imported from China, with Beijing hitting back with duties on $110 billion worth of American products, including soybeans and other commodities. Trump has delayed tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese imports as negotiations to resolve the eight-month trade war continue.
Businesses likely stocked up on imports in anticipation of further duties on Chinese goods, which ironically contributed to the deterioration in the trade deficit last year. 
The goods trade deficit with China increased 11.6 percent to an all-time high of $419.2 billion in 2018. The United States, which also slapped duties on imported steel, aluminum, solar panels and washing machines, had record imports from 60 countries in 2018, led by China, Mexico and Germany.
""Perhaps Donald Trump will now discover that tweets and bluster alone won't dramatically shrink the trade deficit,"" said Scott Paul, president of the Alliance for American Manufacturing in Washington. ""The administration's fiscal policies have helped to boost the trade deficit.""
While goods exports hit a record $1.7 trillion in 2018, they declined in the last three months of the year, weighed by the U.S.-China trade dispute, slowing global demand and a strong dollar, which is making American-made goods less competitive on the international market.
The dollar was little changed against a basket of currencies, while U.S. Treasury prices rose. Stocks on Wall Street were trading lower as investors awaited fresh developments on the trade negotiations.
LABOR MARKET SLOWING
Economists expect exports to remain weak even if Washington and Beijing strike a trade deal.
""That will take time and if the Chinese growth is as soft as most economists believe, it is hard to see how they can ramp up demand for U.S. products very much this year,"" said Joel Naroff, chief economist at Naroff Economic Advisors in Holland, Pennsylvania.
A 1.9 percent drop in exports of goods and services drove the trade deficit in December to $59.8 billion, the largest since October 2008. Imports of goods and services increased 2.1 percent to $264.9 billion in December. 
When adjusted for inflation, the goods trade deficit surged $10.0 billion to a record $91.6 billion in December. 
The jump in the so-called real goods trade deficit suggests that the drag from trade on fourth-quarter gross domestic product growth was probably bigger than the 0.22 percentage point estimated by the government last week. Economists expect the government will revise down fourth-quarter GDP growth to a 2.3 percent annualized rate from the 2.6 percent it reported last Thursday.
Other data on Wednesday suggested some slowing in the labor market, though the pace of job gains remains more than enough to drive the unemployment rate down. The ADP (NASDAQ:ADP) National Employment Report showed private payrolls increased by 183,000 in February after surging 300,000 in January. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast private payrolls advancing 189,000 in February.
The ADP report, which is jointly developed with Moody's Analytics, was published ahead of the government's more comprehensive employment report for February scheduled for release on Friday.
The ADP report is not considered a reliable predictor of the private payrolls portion of the government's employment report because of differences in methodology. 
February's report was, however, in line with other labor market data, including weekly applications for unemployment benefits and manufacturing and services sector surveys that have suggested some moderation in job growth following hefty gains in January.
""It looks broadly consistent with our view that job growth remained solid in February despite cooling from the boomy figures reported for the prior several months,"" said Daniel Silver, an economist at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) in New York. 

According to a Reuters survey of economists, nonfarm payrolls likely increased by 180,000 jobs in February after jumping 304,000 in January. The unemployment rate is forecast falling to 3.9 percent in February from 4.0 percent in January.

The central bank’s Beige Book economic report, based on anecdotal information collected on or before Feb. 25, highlighted that while most Districts reported ""slight-to-moderate"" growth, ""about half of the 12 Districts noted that the government shutdown had led to slower economic activity in some sectors.""
The report also offered an assessment on the health of the consumer following the weaker retail sales data reported last month.
""Consumer spending activity was mixed across the country, with contacts from several Districts attributing lower retail and auto sales to harsh winter weather and to higher costs of credit.""
On inflation and the labor market, which together form part of the Fed's dual mandate, the Beige Book noted ""labor markets remained tight for all skill levels"" and ""prices continued to increase at a modest-to-moderate pace.""
Ahead of the crucial nonfarm payroll report due Friday, in which wage growth is expected to come into focus, the report said most districts were reporting an uptick in wages as businesses compete for talent.
""Wages continued to increase for both low- and high-skilled positions across the nation and a majority of Districts reported moderately higher wages,"" the report said. Contacts in about half of the districts ""noted rising non-wage forms of employee compensation, including bonuses, relocation assistance, vacation time, and flexible work arrangements.""
The struggles in the U.S. housing market persisted as residential home sales were ""generally lower,"" even as construction activity remained steady, the report said.
""Several real estate contacts noted that inventories had risen slightly but remained historically low, while home prices continued to appreciate but at a slightly slower pace. Agricultural conditions remained weak, and energy activity was mixed across Districts."""
