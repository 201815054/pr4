The Office for National Statistics said that the rate of unemployment dropped to a hit a new 11-year low of 4.7% in the three months to January, beating expectations for it to remain steady at the prior 4.8%.
The claimant count decreased by a seasonally adjusted 11,300 in February, compared to expectations for a decline of 5,000 people and following a fall of 41,400 a month earlier, whose figure was revised from a previously reported reduction of 42,400.
Meanwhile, the average earnings index, including bonuses, rose by a seasonally adjusted 2.2% in the three months to January, compared to forecasts for it to decline to only a 2.4% increase after rising 2.6% in the prior month.
Excluding bonuses, wages rose by 2.3%, missing forecasts for a 2.5% gain and compared to a 2.6% increase in the three months to January.

Central government spending rose 8.1 percent from a year earlier, while spending by local governments jumped by 19.1 percent, the ministry said in a statement on its website.
China relied heavily on infrastructure spending to stabilize growth last year as private companies pulled back on investment.
Beijing cut its growth target to around 6.5 percent this year, as policymakers turned to tackling a build-up in debt and containing financial risks.
Spending on public housing rose the fastest with a 34.5 percent gain from a year ago, while social welfare and employment expenses - the biggest category by value - rose 25.9 percent, it said.
Fiscal revenues rose 14.9 percent, compared to an increase of 6.3 percent in the same period of 2016, due to higher commodity and producer prices, better economic fundamentals and distortions caused by an earlier Chinese new year holiday, the Ministry said.
That implied a fiscal surplus of 659.4 billion yuan ($95.42 billion) in the January-February period, according to Reuters calculations.
China is aiming for a 3 percent fiscal deficit in 2017.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. producer prices increased more than expected in February as the cost of services such as hotel accommodation pushed higher and the year-on-year gain was the largest in nearly five years, pointing to steadily rising inflation pressures.
Firming inflation, together with a tightening labor market, which is expected to generate strong wage growth, could allow the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates on Wednesday.
""Steadily rising inflation gives the Fed more reason to lift rates tomorrow,"" said Jennifer Lee, a senior economist at BMO Capital Markets in Toronto.
The Labor Department said on Tuesday that its producer price
index for final demand increased 0.3 percent last month after rising 0.6 percent in January. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast a 0.1 percent uptick.
In the 12 months through February, the PPI jumped 2.2 percent, the biggest advance since March 2012 and ahead of the 2.0 percent gain forecast in the Reuters poll. It followed a 1.6 percent increase in January.
The fairly strong producer inflation readings came as Fed officials gathered on Tuesday for a two-day policy meeting. The dollar was trading higher against a basket of currencies, while U.S. stocks were lower ahead of the Fed meeting. Prices for U.S. Treasuries rose. 
Producer prices are rising as the prior weak readings, induced by cheap oil, drop out of the calculation. Crude oil prices have risen above $50 per barrel. 
Also boosting price pressures are the dollar's 1.5 percent drop against the currencies of the United States' main trading partners since January and overall commodity price gains in tandem with a firming global economy.
CORE PPI RISING
A key gauge of underlying producer price pressures that excludes food, energy and trade services increased 0.3 percent in February, the biggest gain since April 2016. The so-called core PPI rose 0.2 percent in January. 
Core PPI increased 1.8 percent in the 12 months through February after advancing 1.6 percent in January. 
The Fed has a 2 percent inflation target and tracks a measure that is currently at 1.7 percent. The U.S. central bank is expected to raise its overnight benchmark interest rate by 25 basis points to a range of 0.75 percent and 1.00 percent on Wednesday. It increased borrowing costs last December and has projected three rate hikes in 2017.
In February, prices for final demand services increased 0.4
percent, accounting for more than 80 percent of the rise in the PPI. That was the biggest increase since June 2016 and followed a 0.3 percent gain in January. 
The increase in the cost of services was driven by a 4.3 percent surge in hotel accommodation. There were also increases in the prices of chemicals, legal services, wholesale apparel and architectural and engineering services.
Healthcare costs rose 0.2 percent after a similar gain in January. Inpatient healthcare services increased 0.3 percent last month, while the cost of outpatient care rose 0.2 percent.
Those costs feed into the Fed's preferred inflation measure, the core personal consumption expenditures index. As a result of last month's increase,  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) economist Ted Wieseman said he expected a 0.16 percent gain in PCE medical services in February after an unchanged reading in January. 
Medical services accounts for 19 percent of core PCE.
The cost of energy products increased 0.6 percent last month, slowing from January's 4.7 percent surge. Wholesale food prices increased 0.3 percent after being unchanged in January.

""Inflation pressures are continuing to build in the U.S. economy,"" said Rob Martin, an economist at  Barclays  (LON:BARC) in New York. ""With labor markets continuing to tighten, and the dollar and commodity prices broadly stable, we see inflation firming this year and next.""

In a report, the Commerce Department said that producer prices increased by a seasonally adjusted 0.3% last month, higher than the forecast for a 0.1% advance and compared to the 0.6% gain seen in January.
Year-over-year, the producer price index (PPI) rose 2.2% in February, compared to expectations for a gain of 2.0% and following a 1.6% increase in the preceding month.
The core producer price index, that excludes food and energy, advanced by 0.3% in February, higher than forecasts for a gain of 0.2% and compared to the prior month’s 0.4% increase.
Core producer prices increased at an annualized rate of 1.5% last month, in line with forecasts and compared to a gain of 1.2% in the preceding month.
Core prices are viewed by the Federal Reserve as a better gauge of longer-term inflationary pressure because they exclude the volatile food and energy categories. Furthermore, when producers pay more for goods, they are more likely to pass price increases on to the consumer, so PPI could be considered a leading indicator of inflation.

Mannheim-based ZEW said its monthly survey showed its economic sentiment index rose to 12.8 from 10.4 points in the previous month. This undershot the Reuters consensus forecast for rise to 13.1.
A separate gauge measuring investors' assessment of the economy's current conditions edged up to 77.3 points from 76.4 in February. This was also slightly weaker than the Reuters consensus forecast which predicted a reading of 78.0.
ZEW President Achim Wambach said the fact that sentiment only improved slightly reflected the current uncertainty surrounding the future economic development.
""With regard to the economic situation in Germany, no clear conclusions can be drawn from the most recent economic signals for January 2017,"" Wambach said.
German industrial output and exports rose more than expected in January, data showed last week, suggesting Europe's economic powerhouse started into 2017 on a solid footing despite the threat of rising protectionism.
The surprisingly strong figures gave some reassurance that Germany's economic upswing is likely to continue in 2017 after industrial orders in January posted their biggest monthly slump in eight years and retail sales also disappointed. 
ZEW said investors' assessment of the current economic situation in Germany remained at a very high level compared to many previous years, but the research group also pointed to political risks clouding the outlook.
""The political risks resulting from upcoming elections in a number of EU countries are keeping uncertainty surrounding the German economy at a relatively high level,"" Wambach added. 
Far-right parties are expected to make a strong showings in elections in the Netherlands on Wednesday and in France next month.
Geert Wilders, who wants to ""de-Islamicise"" the Netherlands, hopes clashes between Turkish-Dutch protesters and the police, along with Ankara's accusations of Dutch ""fascism"", will help bolster his chances of finishing first.
Wilders' Party for Freedom (PVV) has virtually no chance of forming a government, given the splintered political landscape. Other parties have ruled out a coalition with a party they view as racist, but a PVV win would nevertheless send shock waves across Europe.

21,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 14, 2017 06:10AM ET</span>",Euro zone industry output rises less than expected in January,"BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Euro zone industrial output increased less than expected in January as firms' higher investment in machinery was partially offset by a drop in the production of consumer goods, estimates from the European Union statistics office showed on Tuesday.
Eurostat said industrial production in the 19-country single currency bloc rose in January by 0.9 percent compared to the previous month, and by 0.6 percent year-on-year.
Both figures were lower than market expectations. A Reuters poll of economists had forecast an average monthly rise of 1.3 percent and a 0.9 percent increase year-on-year.
The lower-than-expected January figures were partly counterbalanced by upwardly revised data for December when industrial production fell by 1.2 percent on the month, less than the 1.6 percent drop initially estimated by Eurostat.
On a yearly basis output went up by 2.5 percent in December, more than the 2.0 rise previously estimated.
The monthly output rise in January was mostly due to a surge in production of capital goods, like machinery, which went up by 2.8 percent, fully offsetting an equal drop in the previous month, in a sign of firms' improved prospects of future sales.
Energy output also rose by 1.9 percent on the month.
But production of durable and non-durable consumer goods decreased. Output of durable goods, such as cars or refrigerators, went down by 0.4 percent in January, after a 3 percent surge in December.
Production of non-durable consumer goods was down by 0.7 percent, compounding a 0.2 percent December fall.
Output of intermediate goods went also down by 0.4 percent.

At national level, a 3.3 percent surge in the monthly output of Germany, the bloc's largest economy, was partly offset by production falls in France (-0.3 percent) and Italy (-2.3 percent), respectively the second and third biggest economies in the euro zone.

BEIJING (Reuters) - China issued a raft of upbeat data on Tuesday showing the economy got off to a strong start to 2017, supported by strong bank lending, a government infrastructure spree and a much-needed resurgence in private investment.
Solid growth is welcome news for China's policymakers as they turn their focus to containing risks from a sharp build-up in debt ahead of a major leadership reshuffle later this year.
But economists are not sure how long the pace can be sustained as the central bank takes a tighter stance on credit and exporters brace for a surge in U.S. protectionism.
Fixed-asset investment expanded more strongly than expected in the first two months of the year as growth in private investment more than doubled from 2016, while surging demand for steel for new roads, bridges and homes lifted factory output.
That added to readings last week showing robust imports, particularly of commodities such as iron ore, and a sharp rise in producer prices which is boosting industrial profits.
""Today's data appeared to be mainly driven by infrastructure spending and a rebound in the real estate sector,"" said Zhou Hao, a Singapore-based economist at Commerzbank (DE:CBKG).
China has cut its growth target to around 6.5 percent this year to give policymakers more room to push through painful reforms to reduce financial risks created by years of debt-fueled stimulus. The world's second-largest economy grew 6.7 percent last year, the slowest pace in 26 years.
China's first-quarter economic growth could accelerate to 7 percent year-on-year, from 6.8 percent in the last quarter, economists at OCBC wrote in a note last week.
But OCBC and many other China watchers expect that pace will begin to slow starting in spring as the payoff from last year's stimulus spree begins to fade.
""This strength remains heavily reliant on rapid investment growth that will be difficult to sustain given clear signals that the fiscal and monetary policy stance will be less supportive this year,"" says Julian Evans-Pritchard, a Singapore-based China Economist at Capital Economics.
China's new loans fell sharply in February from near-record levels the previous month but were still higher than expected.
ANZ said the rapid credit expansion might trigger further hikes in short-term interest rates, following two early this year, as policymakers remain concerned about high leverage in the economy.
ENCOURAGING SIGNS
Analysts singled out an unexpectedly strong rebound in investment as particularly encouraging for China's outlook.
Fixed-asset investment growth accelerated to 8.9 percent in January and February from the same period last year, largely due to strong property and infrastructure construction.
Economists had expected investment growth of 8.2 percent, quickening from 8.1 percent in the whole of 2016.
Growth in private investment quickened to 6.7 percent, more than twice the pace of last year, suggesting private firms are growing more optimistic about the business outlook.
Sheng Laiyun, a spokesperson for the statistics bureau, attributed the rebound largely to better implementation of Public-Private Partnership (PPP) projects, which the government has been pushing to attract more private capital into traditionally state-dominated areas.
Private investment had cooled sharply last year, with many smaller firms facing tough access to financing, tight profit margins and a crowding out by big state companies. Private investment accounts for about 60 percent of overall investment in China.
Industrial output rose 6.3 percent, slightly more than expected and the best pace in nearly a year.
China's steel mills are churning out as much metal as possible, enjoying their best profits in years, even as they worry that a year-long rally in prices is running out of steam, executives said.
China combines January and February activity data in a bid to smooth out seasonal distortions caused by the timing of the long Lunar New Year holidays, which began in late January this year but fell in February last year.
QUESTION MARKS
While activity data suggested generally resilient growth, analysts pointed out two potential areas of concern.
Real estate data was mixed, with some hints that the sector may be showing signs of heating up again, despite a slew of government curbs since October to tame sharp home price rises.
China's property sales by area surged 25.1 percent in the first two months from a year ago, well above the annual rate last year which was the fastest in seven years. It was also a marked surge from December.
Real estate investment growth moderated but only slightly, to 8.9 percent from 11.1 percent in December, according to Reuters' calculations. It rose 6.9 percent in all of 2016.
A rebound in the sector could risk another round of cooling measures which could drag on broader growth.
Retail sales also disappointed.
Sales grew 9.5 percent in the first two months of the year, the slowest pace in nearly two years and cooling from 10.9 percent in December.
But the statistics bureau's Sheng told reporters ""there is no problem with consumption in China"", stressing weaker growth is mainly due to a slowdown in auto sales after the government rolled back tax breaks on small cars.
TRADE TENSIONS
China's economic outlook is also being clouded by increasing fears of protectionism under U.S. President Donald Trump.
Trump plans to host President Xi Jinping at a summit next month, according to media, as his administration seeks to smooth relations which have got off to a rocky start.
During the election campaign, Trump had threatened to label China a currency manipulator and impose huge tariffs on imports of Chinese goods.
He has not followed through on either move yet, but the U.S. Treasury will issue its semi-annual currency report in April.

A net 52 percent of firms expected activity to grow in the next 12 months, the first time the reading has been above 50 since June 2015.
A reading of 39 percent in October was the lowest since 2012 and had marked the fourth straight fall in business confidence in the survey which is conducted three times a year.
Markit said the latest figures reflected greater optimism among manufacturers and service firms as Britain prepares to start negotiations on its departure from the European Union.
Although official data published on Friday showed manufacturing and industrial output slipped in January, on a three-month basis factory output had its strongest performance since mid-2010.
The signs of a recovery in manufacturing have come as Britain's consumers turn more cautious because of a rise in inflation caused in large part by the fall in sterling since last year's Brexit referendum.
Monday's Markit survey showed the balance of private sector firms expecting greater input prices over the next 12 months hit its highest level for six years.
Despite that, optimism over profits made firms the most upbeat about hiring expectations since late 2015. 

Data for the survey was collected between Feb. 10-24 and polled around 12,000 manufacturers and service providers.

The survey of consumer expectations, an increasingly influential gauge of prices for the U.S. central bank, showed that year-ahead inflation expectations were flat at 3 percent last month. The three-year ahead reading edged up to 3 percent, from 2.9 percent in January.
Both measures are at their highest levels since mid-2015. The survey, which started three and a half years ago, hit its lowest price levels last year.
Inflation has remained below the Fed's preferred 2 percent target for a few years, but expectations have shot up since Donald Trump won the Nov. 8 presidential election. 

The internet-based survey is done by a third party and taps a rotating panel of 1,200 household heads.

WELLINGTON (Reuters) - New Zealand's economy, which surged in 2016's third quarter, likely cooled in the final three months, as heavy spring rain cut dairy production and a deadly earthquake struck.
Economists polled by Reuters expect gross domestic product (GDP) grew 0.7 percent in the fourth quarter from the third, when output jumped 1.1 percent.
Annual growth in the economy is seen around 3.1 percent, down from 3.5 percent the previous quarter but rapid by rich world standards. [NZ/POLL]
The Reserve Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ) has been looking for a increase of around 1 percent from the previous quarter, so it might be slightly disappointed by the figure to be reported on Wednesday.
Softer-than-expected data for manufacturing and sales, published last week, is partly responsible. The net effect of the 7.8 magnitude quake centered around Kaikoura, a popular tourist area, also remains a question mark.
""Recent developments signal a little less momentum in the economy than we had previous been expecting,"" Westpac bank economists said in a research note, though adding that the headwinds are seen as temporary.
Still, the central bank is unlikely to waver on its determination to keep rates at a record low of 1.75 percent when it meets next week.
RACING ALONG
The RBNZ had previously signaled it could hold the official cash rate <NZINTR=ECI> steady for this year and next to try to increase the inflation rate and cope with increasing offshore risks from global protectionism.
New Zealand's economy has raced along for the past few years courtesy of an influx of migrants and tourists plus robust house construction activity.
""The wild card for the quarter will be the impact of the Kaikoura earthquake and associated disruption throughout the top of the South Island and bottom of the North Island,"" said ASB senior economist Jane Turner.
A major drag on growth was reduced production of milk, the largest goods export earner, as wet spring weather curbed collection.
Data released last week showed falling volumes in dairy processing had contributed to a 1.8 percent drop in manufacturing activity in the fourth quarter.
But those factors are seen as temporary, with the migration boom expected to drive more spending on everything from education to health and rising demand for housing likely to fuel growth.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's core machinery orders unexpectedly fell in January from the previous month and dipped the most in five months, adding to worries about whether recent signs of economic recovery will be sustainable.
Japanese policymakers hope a recovery in capital spending will help drive growth in the world's third-largest economy and pull it out of deflation and stagnation.
Core machinery orders fell 3.2 percent in January, sharply undershooting the economists' median estimate of a 0.5 percent increase, Cabinet Office data showed on Monday. That followed a rebound in December, when core orders rose 2.1 percent.
While the data series can fluctuate widely, it is regarded as a leading indicator of capital spending in the coming six to nine months.
""The results were weak. I am somewhat worried, but machinery orders are volatile so it's necessary to watch for a while longer,"" said Hidenobu Tokuda, senior economist at Mizuho Research Institute.
Compared with a year earlier, core orders, which exclude those of ships and electrical equipment, fell 8.2 percent in January - the biggest fall in eight months and larger than the analyst estimate for a 3.3 percent decrease.
The Cabinet Office maintained its assessment of machinery orders, saying the pick-up was stalling.
Manufacturers surveyed by the Cabinet Office forecast core orders to rise 1.5 percent in January-March from the previous quarter. The figure was seasonally adjusted from the previously estimated 3.3 percent increase.
While recent Japanese data has been largely upbeat, the readings were still subdued and growth is still not solid enough to generate the sustained inflation that the Bank of Japan needs to meet its 2 percent price target.
Capital expenditure grew at the fastest pace in almost three years in the fourth quarter, but private consumption has remained stubbornly sluggish. Exports have crept back into expansionary territory but are facing the risk of a rise in U.S. trade protectionism.
With the outlook still murky, the BOJ is expected to keep its policy settings unchanged at a board meeting later this week.
Economists polled by Reuters expect the central bank will keep the short-term policy interest rate at minus 0.1 percent and the 10-year government bond yield target at around zero percent.
While overseas protectionist policies do dampen capital spending, the global economy is recovering, said Mizuho's Tokuda.
""The two factors will pull against each other so capital spending won't keep rising a lot,"" he said.
U.S. President Donald Trump and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe agreed last month to launch a bilateral economic dialogue to discuss issues such as macroeconomic policies, trade and infrastructure investment.
By sector, core orders from manufacturers fell 10.8 percent in January from the previous month, following a 0.8 percent rise in December.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. employers hired workers at a robust pace in February, beating expectations, and wages grinded higher, which could give the Federal Reserve the green light to raise interest rates next week despite slowing economic growth.
Nonfarm payrolls increased by 235,000 jobs last month as the construction sector recorded its largest gain in nearly 10 years due to unseasonably warm weather, the Labor Department said on Friday. January's employment gains were revised up to 238,000 from the previously reported 227,000.
Fed Chair Janet Yellen signaled last week that the U.S. central bank would likely hike rates at its March 14-15 policy meeting.
Job gains averaged 209,000 per month over the past three months, well above the 75,000 to 100,000 needed to keep up with growth in the working-age population.
""The report seals the deal for a rate hike next week. The labor market is where the Fed wants it to be,"" said Gus Faucher, deputy chief economist at PNC Financial (NYSE:PNC) in Pittsburgh.
Last month's brisk clip of hiring was accompanied by steady wage growth, with average hourly earnings rising 6 cents, or 0.2 percent. January's wage growth was revised up to 0.2 percent from the previous 0.1 percent gain. That lifted the year-on-year increase in wages to 2.8 percent from 2.6 percent in January.
The unemployment rate fell one-tenth of a percentage point to 4.7 percent, even as more people rushed into the labor market, encouraged by the hiring spree. Economists had forecast employment increasing by 190,000 jobs last month.
U.S. stocks rose, but gains were curbed by the prospect of higher borrowing costs. 
The dollar (DXY) fell against a basket of currencies amid disappointment that wages were only growing gradually. The greenback was also hurt by news that the European Central Bank had discussed the possibility of raising interest rates before the end of its quantitative easing program.
Prices for U.S. government bonds rose, with the yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note retreating from a 12-week high. 
With the labor market near full employment, wage growth could speed up as companies are forced to raise compensation to retain employees and attract skilled workers. A proxy for take-home pay rose a solid 0.5 percent in February. 
The annual wage increase is close to the 3 percent to 3.5 percent range that economists say is needed to lift inflation to the Fed's 2 percent target. Inflation is already firming, in part as commodity prices rise.
Rising inflation, together with a tighter labor market, stock market boom and strengthening global economy, has left some economists expecting that the Fed could increase rates much faster than currently anticipated by financial markets.
The U.S. central bank lifted its benchmark overnight rate in December and has forecast three rate increases for 2017.
PARTICIPATION RATE UP
""We continue to expect the Fed to raise its policy rate by an above-consensus four times this year,"" said Paul Ashworth, chief U.S. economist at Capital Economics in Toronto. 
Job growth has averaged more than 186,000 per month since January 2010. While Donald Trump's victory in last November's presidential election sparked a stock market rally and jumps in consumer and business confidence, there has been no surge in either business or consumer spending.
Data ranging from trade to consumer and business spending suggest the economy slowed further early in the first quarter after growing at a 1.9 percent annualized rate in the final three months of 2016. The Atlanta Fed is forecasting gross domestic product growing at a 1.2 percent rate this quarter.
""It's important to remember that President Trump inherited an economy that was already making steady progress towards full employment,"" said Elise Gould, a senior economist at the Economic Policy Institute in Washington.
The labor force participation rate, or the share ofworking-age Americans who are employed or at least looking for ajob, increased one-tenth of a percentage point to 63 percent in February, the highest level since March 2016. 
The employment-to-population ratio rose to an eight-year high of 60 percent from 59.9 percent in January. 
A broad measure of unemployment that includes people who want to work but have given up searching and those working part-time because they cannot find full-time employment fell two-tenths of a percentage point to 9.2 percent last month.
All sectors of the economy, with the exception of retail and utilities, expanded payrolls in February. Manufacturing employment increased 28,000, the largest gain since August 2013, as rising oil prices fueled demand for machinery. 
Construction payrolls surged 58,000, the biggest increase since March 2007, as warmer weather pulled forward hiring at building and civil engineering sites. The mining sector added 7,700 jobs last month, led by oil field hiring. Mining employment has risen by 20,000 jobs since October. 
Retail sector employment fell 26,000, the biggest decline since December 2012, after a gain of 39,900 jobs in January. Retailers including J.C. Penney Co Inc (N:JCP) and Macy's Inc (N:M) have announced thousands of layoffs as they shift toward online sales and scale back on brick-and-mortar operations. 
Utilities shed 1,000 jobs last month because of the milder weather. Government payrolls increased by 8,000 jobs, with federal employment rising 2,300 despite a freeze on the hiring of civilian workers that went into effect in January.

The budget deficit was $193 billion in February 2016, according to Treasury's monthly budget statement.
The fiscal 2017 year-to-date deficit was $349 billion compared with $353 billion in the same period of fiscal 2016.
When accounting for calendar adjustments, the deficit last month was $181 billion.

Receipts last month came to $172 billion, a 2 percent increase from February 2016, while outlays stood at $364 billion, up 1 percent from the same month a year earlier.

BRASILIA (Reuters) - Brazil's inflation rate eased much more than expected in February to its lowest level since 2010 amid a deep recession, data showed on Friday, strengthening the case for a steeper interest rate cut by the central bank next month.
Consumer prices rose 4.76 percent in the 12 months through February, according to government statistics agency IBGE's IPCA index, slowing from an increase of 5.35 percent in January.
February's inflation came in below expectations of all 24 economists polled by Reuters. The index also undershot expectations for a seventh straight month.
For the first time since 2009, annual inflation is lower in Brazil than in emerging market peer Mexico, where price increases shot up to their highest rate in nearly seven years after the U.S. presidential election sparked a sharp drop in the Mexican currency.
Brazil's sudden inflation slowdown highlights the unprecedented severity of the country's two-year recession and is helping President Michel Temer's economic team to restore the credibility of fiscal and monetary policy to curb price rises.
""That's the kind of inflation rate that every central banker would like to see,"" said Marco Caruso, an economist with Banco Pine in São Paulo. ""But it's a good outcome of something that is really bad: a very poor economic situation.""
Yields on interest rate futures fell sharply on Friday as investors saw a greater likelihood that the central bank would cut its benchmark interest rate by 100 basis points in April.
The bank reduced the rate by 75 basis points at its last monetary policy meeting in February.
Most economists expect Brazil's inflation to fall below the official goal of 4.5 percent this year, which would likely lead the government to cut the target for 2019 and beyond, according to Reuters surveys.

The IPCA index rose 0.33 percent in February, the smallest increase for the month since 2000.

Non-farm payrolls (NFP) rose 235,000 in February, compared to the rise of 238,000 in the first month of the year that was revised from the initial increase of 227,000. The data beat the consensus estimate for the creation of 200,000 jobs.

The increase in wages is being closely monitored by the Federal Reserve for evidence of diminishing slack in the labor market and upward pressure on inflation.
Additionally, the private sector created more of the new job contracts than expected in February with a total of 227,000, compared to consensus expectations for 193,000. January’s number was revised down to 221,000 private nonfarm payrolls, from the prior reading of 237,000.

BERLIN (Reuters) - German imports soared more than expected in January, outperforming a surprisingly strong rise in exports in a further sign that Europe's biggest economy fired on all cylinders at the start of 2017.
Data released by the Federal Statistics Office on Friday, also showed the current account surplus fell sharply on the month suggesting vibrant domestic demand is helping to slowly re-balance Germany's traditionally export-driven economy.
""Germany's domestic demand will remain strong this year and we expect imports to rise faster than exports in 2017,"" said Sal. Oppenheim economist Ulrike Kastens.
""This should help to contain the trade surplus, although it is likely to remain high,"" Kastens said, adding that German companies would have to invest more to further fuel imports and significantly reduce the trade surplus.
""But many firms are still holding off investments due to a series of political risks and uncertainties,"" she added, pointing to the threat of a protectionist U.S. trade policy and the unclear outcome of several major elections in Europe.
Seasonally adjusted imports rose by 3.0 percent on the month, while exports increased by 2.7 percent, the data showed. Both figures came in much stronger than expected. 
A breakdown of unadjusted trade figures showed that exports to countries outside the European Union rose the sharpest while imports were particularly strong from EU countries outside the euro zone.
""After their lacklustre performance in the past year, exports are rebounding in 2017,"" DIHK economist Volker Treier said, adding demand from emerging markets such as China, Brazil, Russia and India was rising.
Despite the jump in imports, the seasonally adjusted trade surplus stood at 18.5 billion euros ($19.6 billion), up slightly from 18.3 billion euros in December. Analysts put the discrepancy mainly down to one-off factors at the turn of the year
The wider current account surplus nearly halved, however, to 12.8 billion euros after a revised 24.8 billion euros in December, the data showed. On the year, it shrank by 1.8 billion euros.
WAR OF WORDS
In 2016, German exports rose 1.2 percent on the year to hit a record 1.2 trillion euros while imports edged up 0.6 percent to reach an all-time high at 955 billion euros. This propelled the trade surplus to 252.9 billion euros, also a record high.
The European Commission and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) have repeatedly urged Germany to take advantage of record-low borrowing costs and increase investment as a measure to reduce the country's large trade and current account surpluses.
U.S. President Donald Trump's trade adviser on Monday described the U.S. trade deficit with Germany as ""one of the most difficult"" issues, calling for bilateral discussions to reduce it outside of European Union restrictions. Peter Navarro's comments followed his complaints that Germany was exploiting a weak euro to gain a trade advantage.
The criticism was firmly rejected by Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble on Tuesday who said Germany's trade surplus was the result of high demand for its products and this had nothing to do with any form of currency manipulation.
The war of words has set the stage for a heated debate on trade and tax policies when G20 decision-makers meet in the German town of Baden-Baden next week.

On an annualized basis, manufacturing production increased at rate of 2.7% in January, below forecasts for a 3.0% advance and after rising at a rate of 4.2% in December, which was revised from an initial 4.0% gain.
The report also showed that industrial production declined by a seasonally adjusted 0.4% in January, in line with forecasts and compared to the 0.9% advance in the preceding month. December’s reading was revised lower from an initial 1.1% rise.
Year-on-year, industrial production gained 3.2% in January, below expectations for a 3.3% rise and following the 4.3% advance registered a month earlier.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's core machinery orders likely rose for a second straight month in January but at a much slower pace, adding to views the Bank of Japan will keep policy unchanged next week as it waits for more evidence of a modest economic recovery.
Core machinery orders, a highly volatile data series regarded as a leading indicator of capital spending, probably rose 0.5 percent in January after a 6.7 percent gain in December, a Reuters poll of 14 economists found.
From a year earlier, core orders, which exclude those for ships and electrical equipment, were seen falling 3.3 percent in January, which would be the first fall in three months.
While monthly growth likely ebbed, analysts maintained their views that machinery orders are slowly recovering amid signs of improvement in global manufacturing. A weaker yen is also making Japanese exports more attractive.
""Corporate profits are on the recovery trend thanks to a weak yen, so there is a chance that capital spending is picking up going ahead,"" said Yoshiki Shinke, chief economist at Dai-ichi Life Research Institute.
Still, analysts cautioned that fears of growing trade protectionism under President Donald Trump may sap firms' willingness to make fresh investments. 
""If machinery orders turn out to be weak, that will raise views that companies are refraining from making investment because of uncertainty over the Trump administration's trade policy,"" said an analyst at SMBC Nikko Securities in the survey.
The Cabinet Office will announce the core orders at 8:50 a.m. on Monday (Sunday 2350 GMT).
The poll also found that the central bank is expected to keep its policy settings unchanged at its next meeting on March 15-16.
While recent Japanese data has been largely upbeat by recent standards, it is still subdued, and inflation while picking up remains well below the BOJ's 2 percent target.
The BOJ is seen keeping its short-term policy interest rate at minus 0.1 percent and the 10-year government bond yield target at around zero percent.
Analysts also expect the BOJ will keep the current pace of its Japanese government bond buying, with the annual increase in holdings maintained at around 80 trillion yen ($694.81 billion).
But markets are growing nervous that healthier economic readings may soon prompt the board to start debating the unwinding of its massive stimulus program.
""The currency market is stable and upward pressure on long-term bond yields has calmed down because the economic recovery remains moderate,"" said Atsushi Takeda, chief economist at Itochu Economic Research Institute.
""In addition, the political situation in Europe stays uncertain, so the BOJ will likely wait and see.""
The BOJ's February corporate goods price index (CGPI), which measures the prices companies charge each other for goods and services, likely rose an annual 1.0 percent from a year ago, the poll showed.
It would be the second straight month of gains for the index, helped by a recovery in oil prices, after it rose in January for the first time since March 2015.

The borrowing cost on 30-year mortgages, the most widely held type of U.S. home loan, averaged 4.21 percent in the week ended March 9. That was the highest since 4.32 percent in the week ended Dec. 29 and above 4.10 percent the previous week, the mortgage finance agency said. 
The benchmark 10-year Treasury yield rose more than 17 basis points last week as a group of Fed officials, including Chair Janet Yellen, signaled a high likelihood the U.S. central bank will raise interest rates at its policy meeting next week, on signs of an improving U.S. economy.
The yield on 10-year Treasuries reached about an 11-week high on Thursday at 2.589 percent, Reuters data showed.
The jump in mortgage rates has not stymied application activity for home purchases or to refinance a home loan. 
On Wednesday, the Mortgage Bankers Association said its gauge on U.S. mortgage applications climbed its strongest level since mid-December.
Investors were waiting to see whether the government's jobs report for February, due for release at 8:30 a.m. (1330 GMT) on Friday, will show more hiring and wage growth, providing the latest evidence for the Fed to lift rates since December.
""The strength of Friday's employment report and the outcome of next week's (Federal Open Market Committee) meeting are likely to set the direction of next week's survey rate,"" Freddie Mac chief economist Sean Becketti said in a statement. 
Analysts polled by Reuters forecast U.S. employers likely added 190,000 workers last month, less than January's 227,000 increase. They projected average hourly earnings likely grew by 0.3 percent, rebounding from a 0.3 percent decline in January.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits last week rebounded from a near 44-year low, but the labor market continues to tighten amid a sharp drop in job cuts in February.
Initial claims for state unemployment benefits rose 20,000 to a seasonally adjusted 243,000 for the week ended March 4, the Labor Department said on Thursday. Claims for the prior week were unrevised at 223,000, the lowest level since March 1973.
""There is no evidence of a pickup in involuntary employment separations. We view this as evidence of a tight labor market,"" said John Ryding, chief economist at RDQ Economics in New York.Jobless claims have now been below the 300,000 threshold associated with a healthy labor market for 105 straight weeks.
That is the longest stretch since 1970, when the labor market
was much smaller. The four-week moving average of claims, considered a better measure of labor market trends as it irons out week-to-week volatility, rose 2,250 to 236,500 last week.
A separate report from global outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas showed U.S.-based employers announced 36,957 job cuts in February, down 19 percent from January. Layoffs tumbled 40 percent compared to February last year. 
The labor market is at or close to full employment, with employers increasingly reporting difficulties finding qualified workers for open job positions. 
The sustained strength in the jobs market is likely to be corroborated on Friday with the release of the government's closely watched employment report for February.
STRONG PAYROLLS EXPECTED
According to a Reuters survey of economists, nonfarm payrolls probably gained 190,000 jobs last month after surging 227,000 in January. But payrolls could surprise on the upside after a report on Wednesday showed private sector employers hired 298,000 workers in February, the largest amount in a year.
The unemployment rate is forecast falling one-tenth of a percentage point to 4.7 percent. Labor market tightness together with firming inflation could allow the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates as early as next week.
Fed Chair Janet Yellen signaled last week that the U.S. central bank would likely raise rates at its March 14-15 policy meeting. The Fed raised its benchmark overnight rate in December and has forecast three rate increases for 2017.
The dollar fell against a basket of currencies after European Central Bank President Mario Draghi suggested there was less need for the ECB to prop up growth and inflation in the euro zone. Prices for U.S. Treasuries fell, while rose marginally.
The labor market strength comes despite the economy showing signs of fatigue early in the first quarter. Data on trade, consumer, business and construction spending were soft in January, leaving the Atlanta Fed forecasting GDP increasing at a 1.2 percent rate in the first quarter.
The economy grew at a 1.9 percent annualized rate in the fourth quarter, slowing from the third quarter's brisk 3.5 percent pace.
In another report on Thursday, the Labor Department said import prices rose 0.2 percent last month after advancing 0.6 percent in January. It was the third straight monthly increase. 
In the 12 months through February, import prices accelerated 4.6 percent, the largest gain since February 2012, after rising 3.8 percent in January. 
Import prices excluding fuels rose 0.3 percent, the first increase since July, suggesting the drag on prices from a stronger dollar was fading. That could result in a broader increase in imported inflation. Import prices excluding fuels slipped 0.1 percent in January.

""We expect import prices to firm further in the coming months. The recent pickup in import prices from industrialized trading partners provides further support to our view,"" said Blerina Uruci, an economist at  Barclays  (LON:BARC) in Washington.

FRANKFURT (Reuters) - The European Central Bank pledged on Thursday to keep its aggressive stimulus policy at least until the end of the year, maintaining its support for the economy as anti-euro sentiment rises before elections in France and the Netherlands.
While expected, the decision showed the ECB's leadership was resisting calls from Germany to start winding down its 2.3 trillion euro ($2.43 trillion) bond-buying scheme, or at least signal its intention to do so, as growth and inflation rebound.
Instead, the Frankfurt-based central bank stuck to its plan of continuing the purchases -- which began two years ago -- until December. It pledged to keep interest rates at current, record-low levels until long after that, or even cut them if necessary.
""If the outlook becomes less favorable, or if financial conditions become inconsistent with further progress towards a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation, the Governing Council stands ready to increase the program in terms of size and/or duration,"" the ECB said in a statement.
At a press conference due to start at 1330 GMT, ECB President Mario Draghi was expected to acknowledge that the outlook for the euro zone economy had improved but also point to political risks and a still fragile recovery.
The ECB is scheduled to cut the pace of its bond purchases by a quarter from next month but continue them at least until year-end, or longer if it thinks it has not yet reached its medium-term inflation target of almost 2 percent.
But nearly a decade after the 19-country currency bloc's economic woes began, it is looking in better shape.
Economic sentiment is at a six-year high, trade is rebounding, services and manufacturing output is rising, and unemployment is at its lowest since 2009.
Even inflation, the ECB's key objective, has rebounded, essentially hitting its target last month.
In this context, Germany's central bank governor Jens Weidmann and ECB director Yves Mersch have both made the case for ruling out further rate cuts.
And German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble said on Thursday he was in favor of a ""timely start to the exit"" from the ECB's loose monetary policy, echoing calls from the German banking association and the Ifo economic institute.
That leaves Draghi walking a tightrope, as improvements on the economic front are at risk of being derailed by hazards including the Dutch and French elections and global economic governance under new U.S. President Donald Trump.
Economists in a Reuters poll said the ECB's next move will be either a tweak of its guidance in the second half of this year or a gradual reduction in its asset-buying next year.
History may counsel caution. The ECB's most recent rate hikes, in 2007/8 and in 2011, both had to be rapidly reversed as economic conditions worsened.
""An important reason for not taking any hasty action is the ECB's own track record of jumping the gun,"" ING economist Carsten Brzeski said.
Still, the bank's deliberations may be heated, particularly because new inflation forecasts are likely to show an increase, partly due to a rebound in the price of oil.
At most the ECB may drop its reference to downside economic risks and let an ultra-cheap borrowing facility for banks expire as scheduled.
It may also debate but probably reject calls to give up a reference to lowering rates or buying more bonds if necessary.
FRANCE
Although Draghi may be reluctant to admit it, the French election is likely to be a particular concern. With far-right candidate Marine Le Pen wanting to take France out of the euro zone, markets are already bracing for a shock.
The cost of insuring French government debt against default has doubled since the start of the year <FRGV5YUSAC=MG> while the yield differential between five-year French and safe-haven German bonds rose to its highest since 2013 last month.
Investor nerves are also affecting debt of periphery countries such as Italy and Portugal even though the ECB's main indicator of stress in the financial system is trending downwards.
Next weekend's G20 meeting in the German town of Baden-Baden, the first since Trump took office, may further complicate the policy picture.
An early draft of the communique suggests the world's top finance ministers and central bankers may no longer explicitly reject protectionism or competitive currency devaluations. Under Trump, the United States has accused some trade partners, particularly Germany, of exploiting a weak currency.
Nevertheless, policymakers have so far suggested that the ECB is likely to begin discussing its next policy move only in June, with the first actual move perhaps not coming until after German elections in September.

""Our economists' baseline being that such a move is still six months away, with the possibility of an earlier announcement in June,""  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) strategist Jim Reid said.

Specifically, he ECB left its benchmark interest rate unchanged at a record-low 0.0%, in line with forecasts.
The central bank also held its deposit facility rate steady at -0.4% and its marginal lending rate remained at 0.25%.
Additionally, the ECB also confirmed, as previously announced, that the size of its monthly quantitative easing program would be reduced by €20 billion starting in April and continue at a monthly pace of €60 billion ($63.4 billion) until the end of December 2017, “or beyond, if necessary”.
“The Governing Council continues to expect the key ECB interest rates to remain at present or lower levels for an extended period of time, and well past the horizon of the net asset purchases,” the statement said.
After the decision, traders looked ahead to ECB president Mario Draghi’s press conference at 8:30AM ET (13:30GMT).
While Draghi is expected to downplay recent readings of headline inflation near its target of close to, but below, 2%, as a temporary factor due to higher energy prices, market participants will pay close attention to any hints on future path of monetary policy with particular regard to the removal of accommodation.

80,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 09, 2017 02:14AM ET</span>",China February producer inflation fastest in nearly nine years as commodities surge,"By Sue-Lin Wong
BEIJING (Reuters) - China's producer price inflation accelerated to its fastest pace in nearly nine years in February and by more than expected as prices of steel and other raw materials extended a torrid rally, boosting profits for industrial companies worldwide.
Consumer inflation, however, cooled more than expected to its mildest pace since January 2015 as food prices fell, remaining well below the government's 3 percent target.
China's iron ore and steel prices have been rallying for a year, fueled by a construction boom, though worries are growing over rapidly rising stockpiles at Chinese ports.
The country's insatiable demand for resources has helped spur an inflationary pulse in commodities markets and the manufacturing sector worldwide.
The producer price index (PPI) jumped 7.8 percent in February from a year earlier, slightly more than economists had expected and compared with a 6.9 percent increase in January, the National Statistics Bureau (NSB) said on Thursday.
But many analysts believe China's producer inflation may peak soon, and do not expect much of a flowthrough into China's consumer inflation data, which unlike some other large economies is mainly driven by prices of food and services.
In recent months, the People's Bank of China (PBOC) has cautiously shifted to a tightening bias, inching up short-term money market rates, as authorities turn their focus to containing the risk from a rapid build-up in debt.
Cooling inflationary pressures could reduce the risk that the central bank would have to respond more forcefully. 
""We expect any tightening of policy to be driven by concerns about credit risks rather than efforts to contain inflation,"" Julian Evans-Pritchard from Capital Economics in Singapore wrote in a note.
""Given the lack of any meaningful feed through to consumer prices, policymakers aren't likely to be too concerned about the high producer price inflation,"" he said.
Evans-Pritchard expects producer inflation to peak within a month or two, as year-on-year price comparisons start to moderate. Prices of many building materials such as steel reinforcing bars began to take off in spring last year.
PRICES OF STEEL, MINERALS, ENERGY REMAIN STRONG
Similar to previous months, producer price gains were mainly seen in mining and heavy industry, with a 36.1 percent leap in mining, the biggest jump in that category since early 2010.
Raw materials increased 15.5 percent, while oil refiners and chemical producers also saw solid increases.
That has been good news for some producers after years of losses which severely restricted their ability to service their debts.
Coal and chemical products firm Yunnan Yunwei <600725.SS> said on Tuesday it had returned to profit in 2016. Its shares have gained 25 percent in the last three months.
However, while factory surveys show manufacturers have been able to pass on some of the higher input costs by raising prices of their goods, there has been scant evidence of it filtering down to consumers yet.
China's consumer inflation rate slowed to 0.8 percent in February from a year earlier as food prices fell following the long Lunar New Year celebrations. The CPI for January and February combined rose 1.7 percent.
""Although February's CPI slowdown was relatively large, CPI is still relatively steady when food and energy prices are taken out of the equation,"" statistician Sheng Guoqing said.
The stats bureau attributed the slowdown in consumer inflation to the Lunar New Year and cold weather.
Analysts polled by Reuters had predicted the consumer price index (CPI) would rise 1.7 percent, versus a 2.5 percent acceleration in January.
The government is targeting 3 percent consumer inflation for 2017, unchanged from last year, Premier Li Keqiang said in his annual government work report on Sunday. 
China has cut its economic growth target to a more modest 6.5 percent this year to give policymakers more room to push through painful reforms to contain financial risks.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. private sector job growth recorded its biggest increase in more than a year in February amid a surge in construction and factory hiring, suggesting the economy remains on solid ground despite an apparent further slowdown in the first quarter.
Signs of sustained labor market strength, if confirmed by the U.S. government's closely followed monthly employment report on Friday, could encourage the Federal Reserve to hike interest rates next week. 
""I never say 'done deal' when it comes to the Fed, but a strong report would get us pretty close to one,"" said Joel Naroff, chief economist at Naroff Economic Advisors in Holland, Pennsylvania. ""It would reinforce the warning that I have been making that rates could rise faster and go higher than the markets currently anticipate.""  
The ADP National Employment Report showed on Wednesday that private payrolls grew by 298,000 jobs last month, the largest increase since December 2015. The gain was well above economists' expectations for a 190,000 increase.
Construction payrolls jumped by 66,000 jobs last month, the sector's second largest gain since the ADP series started 15 years ago. The surge likely reflected unseasonably mild weather that kept crews at building sites.
Manufacturing increased by 32,000 jobs last month.
The ADP report, developed with Moody's Analytics, has a poor track record predicting the private payrolls component of the Labor Department's more comprehensive jobs report. Still, some economists raised their February nonfarm payrolls forecasts. 
""Taken literally, the data suggest significant upside risk to the employment report on Friday,"" said Jim O'Sullivan, chief U.S. economist at High Frequency Economics in Valhalla, New York. ""However, ADP is far from infallible for signaling the more volatile payrolls data."" 
Payrolls likely increased by 190,000 jobs in February after rising by 227,000 in January, according to a Reuters survey of economists. The unemployment rate is forecast edging down to 4.7 percent from 4.8 percent in January. 
WEAK PRODUCTIVITY
Fed Chair Janet Yellen signaled last week that the U.S. central bank would likely raise rates at its March 14-15 policy meeting.. The Fed raised its benchmark overnight rate in December and has forecast three rate increases for 2017.
Prices of U.S. Treasuries fell on Wednesday, with the yield on the two-year (US2YT=RR) note rising to its highest level since August 2009. The dollar (DXY) firmed versus a basket of currencies, while stocks on Wall Street were mixed.
The economy grew at a 1.9 percent annualized rate in the fourth quarter, slowing from the third quarter's brisk 3.5 percent pace. Data on trade, consumer, business and construction spending were soft in January. 
As a result, the Atlanta Fed is forecasting GDP increasing at a 1.2 percent rate in the first quarter. 
In a separate report on Wednesday, the Labor Department said nonfarm productivity, which measures hourly output per worker, rose at an annualized 1.3 percent rate in the final three months of 2016, as it had estimated last month.
Weak productivity suggests it will be hard to significantly boost economic growth. President Donald Trump has pledged to boost annual growth to 4 percent. The economy has not achieved 3 percent annual growth since the 2007-2009 recession ended.
Productivity grew at a 3.3 percent pace in the third quarter. It increased 0.2 percent in 2016, the smallest gain since 2011, after rising 0.9 percent in 2015.
Productivity has risen at an average annual rate of 0.6 percent over the last five years, well below its long-term rate of 2.1 percent from 1947 to 2016.

""The underlying trend in productivity remains disappointing and means higher wages are increasingly weighing on businesses' bottom line,"" said Gregory Daco, head of U.S. macroeconomics at Oxford Economics in New York.

BRASILIA (Reuters) - Brazil's annual inflation rate probably fell in February to its lowest level since 2010, easing below 5 percent to approach the government target, a Reuters poll showed on Wednesday.
The survey's median forecast was for consumer prices to have risen 4.88 percent in the 12 months through February, slowing from a 5.35 percent increase in January.
Brazil targets annual inflation at 4.5 percent, less than half of what it was running at until a year ago.
The rapid drop in inflation caused by the country's worst recession on record has allowed the central bank to slash interest rates, with many investors betting policymakers could accelerate the pace of rate cuts at their next meeting in April.
On a monthly basis, prices rose 0.45 percent in February, up from an increase of 0.38 percent in January, according to the median prediction of 25 economists polled.
February's inflation data will be released on Friday at 9 a.m.(1200 GMT) by the national statistics institute IBGE. 
Lower inflation and interest rates are expected to help Brazil's economy emerge from its two-year recession in 2017. That could bolster political support for unpopular President Michel Temer's push to have Congress pass austerity measures.
A growing number of economists expect Brazil to lower its inflation target later this year for the first time in more than a decade, according to Reuters polls. 
The government is carefully considering that possibility, Finance Minister Henrique Meirelles told Reuters last month.

The Washington-based industry group said its seasonally adjusted measure of home loan applications rose 3.3 percent to 405.7 in the week ended March 3. This was the highest since 407.3 in the week ended Dec 16.
Interest rates on 30-year, fixed-rate conforming mortgages, the most widely held type of U.S. home loan, averaged 4.36 percent, up from 4.30 percent the prior week. 
Conforming loans are those with balances of $424,100 or less and qualify for guarantees from federal mortgage agencies  Fannie Mae  (PK:FNMA) and  Freddie Mac  (PK:FMCC).
Last week, mortgage rates rose in step with benchmark U.S. Treasury yields (US10YT=RR) as a group of Federal Reserve officials signaled the central bank would consider raising interest rates at its March 14-15 policy meeting.
Mortgage rates on other types of home loans that the MBA tracks also increased from the previous week.
MBA's seasonally adjusted gauge on applications to refinance an existing home loan gained 5.2 percent to 1,357.6, the highest since the week of Dec. 16, 2016.

The MBA's seasonally adjusted gauge on purchase application activity, a proxy for future home sales, increased 1.7 percent to 235.0, the highest since the week ended Jan. 20.
The share of applications for adjustable-rate mortgages grew to 7.7 percent last week, which was their largest since October 2014.

The loan amount on applications to buy a home averaged $313,000, the highest since the MBA survey began in 1990.

88,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 08, 2017 08:59AM ET</span>",China posts first monthly trade deficit in three years as imports soar,"By Sue-Lin Wong
BEIJING (Reuters) - China unexpectedly posted its first trade gap in three years in February as a construction boom pushed imports much higher than expected and as increasing U.S. protectionist rhetoric casts a spotlight on the export giant's trade position.
The upbeat import reading reinforced the growing view that economic activity in China picked up in the first two months of the year, adding to a global manufacturing revival.
That could give China's policymakers more confidence to press ahead this year with oft-delayed and painful structural reforms such as tackling a rapid build-up in debt.
""We suspect that this largely reflects the boost to import values from the recent jump in commodity price inflation, but it also suggests that domestic demand remains resilient,"" Julian Evans-Pritchard at Capital Economics said in a note.
The surprise monthly deficit also comes as U.S. President Donald Trump focuses increased attention on China's large and persistent run on trade surpluses with the U.S. and as global efforts to ward off trade protectionism face growing difficulties.
China's imports surged 38.1 percent from a year earlier, the biggest increase since February 2012, official data showed on Wednesday, while exports unexpectedly fell 1.3 percent.
That left the country with a trade deficit of $9.15 billion for the month, the General Administration of Customs said.
Most analysts, however, attributed the rare trade gap to distortions caused by the long Lunar New Year celebrations, which began in late January this year but fell in February in 2016. Many businesses shut for a week or more and factory production and port operations can be significantly affected.
""All deficits since 2005 have been in either the Lunar New Year month or in one of the months around the Lunar New Year month,"" ING's Chief Asia Economist Tim Condon wrote in a note.
""Like those earlier ones, we expect February's to be a one-off and the full-year trade surplus will be close to 2016's 3.4 trillion yuan.""
Still, combined January and February data showed China's trade rose 13.3 percent from the same period a year earlier, suggesting real improvement in underlying demand at home and abroad.
That also jives with strong China factory activity surveys which showed growth in both output and orders is accelerating.
""Looking ahead, we expect external demand to remain fairly strong during the coming quarters which should continue to support exports,"" Evans-Pritchard said.
But he added that it was unlikely the current pace of import growth can be sustained as the impact of higher commodity prices will start to drop out of the calculations in coming months.
Analysts polled by Reuters had expected February shipments from the world's largest exporter to have risen 12.3 percent in dollar-terms, an improvement from a 7.9 percent rise in January.
Imports had been expected to rise 20 percent, after rising 16.7 percent in January.
That would have produced a trade surplus of $25.75 billion in February, roughly half that recorded in January.
China's February trade surplus with the United States fell to $10.42 billion, the smallest since February 2014. China exports to the U.S. fell 4.2 percent, while its imports from the U.S. rose 38 percent.
COMMODITY BOOM
China's first-quarter economic growth could accelerate to 7 percent year-on-year, from 6.8 percent in the last quarter, economists at OCBC wrote in a note on Monday, while adding that the pace may start softening in spring.
As the government ramps up infrastructure spending and developers rush to complete new housing projects, steel mills are consuming more iron ore and coking coal to meet demand.
With the economy on much steadier footing than a year ago, the government has trimmed its economic growth target to around 6.5 percent this year, Premier Li Keqiang said in his work report at the opening of parliament on Sunday. The economy grew 6.7 percent last year, the slowest pace in 26 years.
As with last year, China has not set a target for exports in 2017, underlining the uncertain global outlook and fears of rising U.S. trade protectionism, but Li said China will take steps to steady exports this year.
Trump hasn't made good yet on his campaign pledges of greater protectionist measures in the early days of his presidency, but analysts say the specter of deteriorating U.S.-China trade and political ties is likely to weigh on confidence of exporters and investors worldwide.
The U.S. trade deficit jumped to a near five-year high in January, pointing to slower economic growth and posing a challenge for the Trump administration.
The U.S. reported its trade gap with China rose 12.8 percent to $31.3 billion in January, with China-bound exports dropping 13.4 percent.
Elsewhere, Trump administration trade adviser Peter Navarro said on Monday that the $65 billion U.S. trade deficit with Germany was ""one of the most difficult"" trade issues.
Meanwhile, the world's financial leaders are preparing to meet next week for the G20 finance ministers in Germany, the first gathering attended by representatives of the Trump administration. 

A draft communique showed finance ministers and central bank heads from G20 countries may no longer explicitly reject protectionism or competitive currency devaluations, promising only to keep an ""open and fair international trading system"".

The report is jointly developed with Moody's Analytics.

The ADP figures come ahead of the U.S. Labor Department's more comprehensive non-farm payrolls report on Friday, which includes both public and private-sector employment.
Economists polled by Reuters are looking for U.S. private payroll employment to have grown by 193,000 jobs in February, down from 237,000 the month before. Total non-farm employment is expected to have changed by 190,000.
The unemployment rate is forecast to tick down to 4.7 percent from the 4.8 percent recorded a month earlier."

BERLIN (Reuters) - German industrial output rose more than expected in January, driven by strong demand for machinery, cars and other capital goods, suggesting Europe's biggest economy started into 2017 on a solid footing despite the threat of rising protectionism.
The figures, published by the Economy Ministry on Wednesday, gave some reassurance that Germany's economic upswing is likely to continue after data on Tuesday showed that industrial orders posted their biggest monthly slump in eight years.
""Industrial production is back on track,"" Bankhaus Lampe economist Alexander Krueger said, adding that factories would push up overall economic growth in the first quarter of 2017.
In another positive sign for increased business activity, a survey from the Ifo economic institute showed on Wednesday that industry companies plan to hike investment by 5 percent this year after an increase of roughly 3 percent in 2016.
Ifo head Clemens Fuest said Germany's domestic demand remained strong and there were also positive signs for exports. 
""So we expect this economic upswing to continue for the time being,"" Fuest told n-tv televison, adding that U.S. President Donald Trump's protectionist plans could pose a threat for German exporters only in the medium term.
Industrial output jumped 2.8 percent on the month, the data showed. This was the strongest monthly increase since August 2016 and overshot the consensus forecast in a Reuters poll for a 2.5 percent rise. The December reading was revised up to a fall of 2.4 percent from a previously reported 3.0 percent drop.
COLD WINTER
January's increase was driven by a 3.7 percent rise in manufacturing output, with demand for machinery, vehicles and other capital goods jumping 6.1 percent - the strongest monthly increase since August 2013.
Construction production fell 1.3 percent while energy output edged down 0.7 percent, the data showed. 
""The cold winter weather is still taking its toll on the construction sector, which shrank for the second month in a row,"" ING economist Carsten Brzeski said. 
""Given the cold February, the negative trend in the construction sector could continue another month before returning as an important growth driver for the entire economy.""
The Economy Ministry said the rise in January was above the average development in the fourth quarter, adding that sentiment surveys signaled a positive business climate, meaning the industrial upswing is likely to gain further momentum.
Bankhaus Lampe's Krueger gave a more cautious outlook. ""The tailwind from industry for overall economic growth will ease significantly after the first quarter of 2017,"" he said.
Unicredit (MI:CRDI) chief economist Andreas Rees said the latest data gave reassurance that the German economy was performing well. ""The combination of a pick-up in global trade and robust domestic demand bodes well for future growth,"" Rees added.
He added, however, that the next round of business sentiment surveys from Ifo and Markit would be closely watched at the end of March. 
""It will be interesting to see whether the discussed border adjustment tax in the U.S. will put a - psychological - dampener on German managers' minds or not,"" Rees said.
The German economy quadrupled its quarterly growth pace to 0.4 percent in the final three months of 2016 as higher state and household spending and construction more than offset a drag from net trade with imports rising more than exports.
Economists expect German economic growth to accelerate further in the first quarter of 2017. The government forecasts gross domestic product (GDP) to grow 1.4 percent this year.

This would be below the performance of 2016 when the economy expanded by 1.9 percent, the strongest rate in half a decade, driven by soaring private consumption, increased state spending on roads and refugees as well as higher investment in housing.

Bank Indonesia's consumer index was 117.1 in February, much higher than the January reading of 115.3.
A reading above 100 in the survey indicates consumers are optimistic. About 4,600 respondents from 18 major cities participated in the survey.
The survey said consumers expected economic conditions to improve over the next six months, driven mainly by an increase in business activity and job availability.
Consumers involved in the survey predict that price pressures would decrease in May because of subdued prices of basic commodities by the government.
Indonesia's annual inflation rate climbed to 3.83 percent in February from 3.49 percent in January.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's economy grew more than earlier estimated in the fourth quarter as capital expenditure grew at its fastest in almost three years, welcome news for policymakers as they begin to discuss how to wind down years of massive stimulus.
The economy grew an annualized 1.2 percent in October-December, less than the median estimate for 1.6 percent annualized growth but more than the preliminary reading of a 1.0 percent annualized expansion.
The figure translates into quarter-on-quarter growth of 0.3 percent, versus a preliminary reading of 0.2 percent growth and the median estimate for 0.4 percent growth.
A stronger pace of growth will be a boon to the government as policymakers have been counting on an increase in business investment to drive future expansion and increase low productivity.
However, growth is still not robust enough to generate sustained inflation that the Bank of Japan wants, and the risk of rising protectionism could discourage Japanese exporters from raising wages, seen as key to boosting consumption and economic activity at home.
""The economy will remain in recovery mode, because we are seeing the benefits of capital expenditure from manufacturers and the construction sector,"" said Shuji Tonouchi, senior market economist at Mitsubishi UFJ  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) Securities.
""I am a little worried about the strength of consumer spending. I am still not sure how protectionism will materialize, but this is also a potential risk.""
Private consumption registered no growth in October-December, the same as preliminary data. Sluggish household spending has kept the country in prolonged deflation and been a key challenge for the BOJ in meeting its 2 percent price goal via its massive bond buying program.
Households cut spending for the 11th straight month in January even as the job market tightened further, separate data showed earlier this month. Private consumption accounts for around 60 percent of GDP.
STRONGER CAPEX
The capital expenditure component of GDP rose 2.0 percent from the previous quarter, which was more than the forecast for 1.7 percent growth, and faster than the preliminary 0.9 percent.
The revised data showed capital expenditure grew at the fastest since a 2.3 percent quarterly rise in January-March 2014.
Increased investment from the real estate sector, construction companies, food processing companies and electronics makers drove gains in capex, a Cabinet Office official told Reuters.
Some economists expect capital expenditure to increase further as companies will soon have to start investing in more efficient equipment to deal with a shrinking pool of workers as the population ages.
However, U.S. economic policy poses a risk, because companies could suddenly turn cautious on capex if U.S. President Donald Trump adopts protectionist trade policies.
There are also concerns that protectionism could hurt Japan's exports.
After capital expenditure, net exports were the second-biggest driver of growth in the fourth quarter, revised data showed.
However, the plus 0.2 percentage point contribution from net exports was unchanged from preliminary figures, which raises questions about the strength of external demand.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. trade deficit jumped to a near five-year high in January as rising oil prices helped to push up the import bill, pointing to slower economic growth in the first quarter and posing a challenge for the Trump administration.
President Donald Trump took office with a pledge to boost annual economic growth to 4 percent and renegotiate trade deals in favor of the United States. Trump blames U.S. trade policy for the loss of American factory jobs and the import-driven surge in the trade gap could intensify the debate on a cross-border tax. 
""Team Trump really has their work cut out for them if they are going to stick with the campaign pledge to double growth,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG in New York. ""If it is not made in America then we don't want it is what the Trump administration is saying.""
The Commerce Department said on Tuesday the trade gap increased 9.6 percent to $48.5 billion, also buoyed by imports of cell phones and automobiles. That was the highest level since March 2012. When adjusted for inflation, the trade deficit rose to $65.3 billion from $62.0 billion in December. 
Both the inflation-adjusted imports and exports were the highest on record in January, signs of improving domestic demand and stronger economic growth among U.S. trading partners. Nevertheless, the wider trade deficit suggests trade could again weigh on economic growth in the first quarter.
Data such as housing starts, consumer spending and construction outlays have implied the economy struggled to regain momentum early in the first quarter after growth slowed to a 1.9 percent annualized rate in the final three months of 2016.
Trade cut 1.7 percentage points from gross domestic product in the fourth quarter. Following the trade data, the Atlanta Federal Reserve slashed its first-quarter GDP estimate by five-tenths of a percentage point to a 1.3 percent rate.
The economy grew at a 3.5 percent pace in the third quarter. 
The dollar was trading little changed against a basket of currencies, while prices for U.S. government bonds slipped. U.S. stocks fell as healthcare stocks took a beating after Trump tweeted about lowering drug prices.
MUCH WORK TO DO
Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said the January trade data showed there was ""much"" work to be done. 
""In the coming months we will renegotiate bad trade deals and bring renewed energy to trade enforcement in defense of all hard-working Americans,"" Ross said.
The administration has pulled out of the 12-nation Trans-Pacific Partnership trade pact. Trump also wants to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), which was signed in 1994 by the United States, Canada and Mexico. 
Economists, however, warn that the America-first or protectionist policies being pursued by the administration are a threat to the country's economic health as other nations could retaliate. Reports last week suggested the government was preparing to ignore any rulings by the World Trade Organization it sees as an affront to U.S. sovereignty.
""If the U.S. carries through with its threats not to heed WTO rulings, it will encourage other countries to defect from the international free-trade regime and increase the risks of beggar-thy-neighbor policies,"" said Marc Chandler, global currency strategy head at Brown Brothers Harriman in New York. 
In January, imports of goods and services increased 2.3 percent to $240.6 billion, the highest since December 2014, as the country imported 259 million barrels of crude oil. That was the largest amount since July 2013.
The price of imported oil averaged $43.94 per barrel in January, the highest since August 2015. That pushed the value of petroleum imports to a two-year high. Imports of cell phones and other household goods rose $1.0 billion, while those of automobiles hit a record high. 
There were also strong gains in imports of industrial supplies and materials, and capital goods. China accounted for the bulk of imports, sending $41.4 billion worth of merchandise. That was up 5.1 percent from December. 
Exports of goods and services climbed 0.6 percent to $192.1 billion, the highest level since December 2014. They were supported by shipments of industrial supplies and materials, which hit their highest level in two years. Petroleum exports were the highest since May 2015.

Exports to China dropped 13.4 percent, leaving the politically sensitive U.S.-China trade deficit up 12.8 percent at $31.3 billion. The nation's trade deficit with Mexico fell 10.1 percent to its lowest level since July 2015.

BRASILIA (Reuters) - Brazil's worst-ever recession unexpectedly intensified in the final quarter of 2016, data showed on Tuesday, frustrating hopes for signs of a recovery and stepping up pressure on President Michel Temer and the central bank to do more to stimulate growth.
Brazil's gross domestic product contracted by 3.6 percent in 2016, statistics agency IBGE said, following a 3.8 percent drop in 2015. The nation's two-year downturn is the longest and deepest on record for Latin America's biggest country. 
The economic contraction worsened in the fourth quarter, with a steeper-than-expected decline of 0.9 percent following a 0.7 percent drop in the previous three months.
Investment fell 10.2 percent in 2016, in a sharp drop that is partly blamed by economists on Brazil's chronically high interest rates. The central bank started to cut its benchmark rate from a decade-high of 14.25 percent in October and is now expected to take them to single digits this year.
The disappointing data fueled calls for the central bank to accelerate the pace of rate cuts from 75 basis points per meeting. Yields on rate futures showed a 22-percent chance of a steeper cut in the bank's next policy decision in April, according to Reuters data. 
""There's a lot of idle capacity in the economy and that's a reason for the central bank to move faster,"" said Cristiano Oliveira, chief economist at São Paulo-based Banco Fibra, responding to Tuesday's data. 
The majority view among economists is that Brazil will emerge from recession in 2017, but at a very slow rate of 0.5 percent, which would be insufficient to reduce unemployment.
Finance Minister Henrique Meirelles said after the figures were announced that Brazil is still feeling the effects of the recession but is ""clearly"" starting to grow.
Some economists, however, say they are tempering their views for growth in 2017.
""We see zero growth in 2017, or maybe just a little bit above that,"" said Carlos Kawall, chief economist at Banco Safra, in São Paulo. ""We should not see any big recovery this year; we will have to wait until 2018."" 
Household consumption fell 4.2 percent as joblessness hit a record high, while government spending dropped 0.6 percent.
The downturn has left nearly 13 million people unemployed, caused a record number of bankruptcy filings and led agencies to strip Brazil of its hard-won investment grade credit rating.
It also contributed to the impeachment of former President Dilma Rousseff last year and to the low approval ratings of her successor, President Temer, whose agenda of budget and pension reforms has helped fuel a strong rally in Brazilian equities and currency since last year.
Although this recession has been the deepest in Brazil's history, it has not been marked by the financial upheaval seen in other crises in the country's turbulent economic past. 
Previous downturns were often accompanied by sovereign debt crises, capital flight and hyperinflation, none of which happened during the current slump.

LONDON (Reuters) - British consumers are feeling the strain of rising prices caused by last year's Brexit vote, suggesting the economy is heading for a slowdown just as London gears up for divorce talks with the European Union, surveys and data showed on Tuesday.
After helping the economy withstand the immediate Brexit shock last year, consumers are reining in spending on non-essentials as prices for day-to-day shopping rise, the British Retail Consortium (BRC) industry group and Barclaycard said.
Separate data from market research firm Kantar Worldpanel showed the inflation rate for groceries doubling in the space of a month as prices for food staples including butter, tea and fish all rose.
Britain's economy unexpectedly lost no pace last year after the surprise referendum vote in June to leave the EU. But Tuesday's signals add to evidence that growth is now starting to wilt, just as Chancellor Philip Hammond prepares to unveil an annual budget plan on Wednesday.
He has signaled he will not spend heavily now but will keep money in reserve in case the economy needs help to get through a slowdown as Britain withdraws from Europe's single market -- an unsettling prospect for many employers and investors.
""We kept the view that it was pain deferred after the Brexit vote, not pain avoided. Now the data is really starting to come through to support that view,"" said Oliver Jones, UK economist at Fathom Consultancy.
Sterling fell to a seven-week low against the dollar, hit by the weak data and nervousness among investors ahead of a vote in Britain's upper house of parliament on whether to give Prime Minister Theresa May a green light to start formal Brexit talks.
The BRC said there was now an ""undeniable"" trend of cautious spending among consumers on non-essential items.
Over the three months to February, total non-food sales fell by 0.2 percent, the first fall over a three-month period in more than five years, the BRC said.
Credit card company Barclaycard reported a similar trend as it said discretionary purchases slowed for a fifth month, with Britons having to spend more on food, fuel and other essentials.
Official consumer price inflation has risen to near the Bank of England's 2 percent target. Many economists think it will hit 3 percent this year.
Kantar Worldpanel said grocery price inflation jumped to 1.4 percent for the 12 weeks to Feb. 26, from 0.7 percent in the 12 weeks to Jan. 29.
The BoE is watching closely to see if households rein their spending as it weighs up whether the economy needs more monetary stimulus to spur demand or an interest rate hike to curb inflation.
Mortgage lender Halifax also reported signs of a squeeze on consumers as annual house price growth cooled to 5.1 percent in the three months to February, the weakest rise since July 2013.
""A sustained period of house price growth in excess of pay rises has made it increasingly difficult for many to purchase a home,"" Halifax housing economist Martin Ellis said.

""This development, together with signs of reduced momentum in the jobs market and squeezed consumer spending power, is expected to curb house price growth during 2017.""

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia's central bank held rates steady on Tuesday, a widely expected decision given policymakers recently signaled a steady outlook for much of the year ahead.
The central bank kept rates at a record low of 1.5 percent for an eighth straight month, following easings in August and May last year. All 67 economists in a Reuters poll expected a steady outcome this week.
The Australian dollar <AUD=D4> inched higher after the rate decision, supported by the outlook for steady policy. It was last up 0.5 percent at $0.7619 after dropping to a more than one-month low of $0.7598 this week.
""Today's RBA statement reveals a central bank pleased with both the improving global backdrop and the transition of the Australian economy to better growth and stronger employment,"" said Scott Haslem, economist at UBS.
Haslem expects the RBA to stay pat until the middle of 2018 as it balances disinflationary forces such as record low wage growth and heightened retail competition with sky-rocketing house prices.
Governor Philip Lowe has repeatedly emphasized limits to monetary policy and last month said further cuts in interest rates would not be in the national interest as the danger of a debt-fueled boom and bust was just too severe.
With the governor signaling a high bar for a move lower, interbank futures <0#YIB:> imply a mere 6 percent chance of another cut by August.
On Tuesday, Lowe maintained his upbeat tone as Australia's A$1.7 trillion ($1.3 trillion) economy expanded 2.4 percent in 2016 helped by a jump in commodity prices and stronger consumer spending.
""Exports have risen strongly and non-mining business investment has risen over the past year,"" Lowe said.
""Most measures of business and consumer confidence are at, or above, average.""
He also reiterated the central bank's forecasts for a gradual pick-up in underlying inflation, which is pinned at a record low of 1.5 percent.
BUSINESS CONFIDENCE
A survey of business expectations by Dun & Bradstreet (NYSE:DNB) on Tuesday found business confidence was at an 18-month high while plans for capital investments for the second quarter of 2017 were at a two-year peak.
""The critical issue will be whether this optimism translates to a lift in actual activity,"" said Stephen Koukoulas, Dun & Bradstreet economic adviser.
So far, there has been little evidence of that with both businesses and households crimping on overall spending.
Data out recently showed retail sales grew at a tepid pace for a third straight month while the outlook for capital expenditure remained uninspiring.
Lowe also retained his concerns about record low wage growth and a tardy labor market with jobs heavily skewed toward part-time work.
He is also worried about the high levels of household debt, with the ratio of household debt to disposable income at an all-time peak around 180 percent.
""The bank is concerned that a further cut in interest rates could induce some households to borrow beyond their means. The bank is thus prioritizing its concerns about household balance sheets at this point,"" said NAB's chief economist Ivan Colhoun.

Statement by Philip Lowe, Governor:Monetary Policy Decision
Number2017-06Date7 March 2017
At its meeting today, the Board decided to leave the cash rate unchanged at 1.50 per cent.
Conditions in the global economy have continued to improve over recent months. Business and consumer confidence have both picked up. Above-trend growth is expected in a number of advanced economies, although uncertainties remain. In China, growth is being supported by higher spending on infrastructure and property construction. This composition of growth and the rapid increase in borrowing mean that the medium-term risks to Chinese growth remain. The improvement in the global economy has contributed to higher commodity prices, which are providing a significant boost to Australia's national income.
Headline inflation rates have moved higher in most countries, partly reflecting the higher commodity prices.
Long-term bond yields are higher than last year, although in a historical context they remain low. Interest rates are expected to increase further in the United States and there is no longer an expectation of additional monetary easing in other major economies. Financial markets have been functioning effectively and stock markets have mostly risen.
The Australian economy is continuing its transition following the end of the mining investment boom, expanding by around 2½ per cent in 2016. Exports have risen strongly and non-mining business investment has risen over the past year. Most measures of business and consumer confidence are at, or above, average. Consumption growth was stronger towards the end of the year, although growth in household income remains low.
The outlook continues to be supported by the low level of interest rates. Financial institutions remain in a good position to lend. The depreciation of the exchange rate since 2013 has also assisted the economy in its transition following the mining investment boom. An appreciating exchange rate would complicate this adjustment.
Labour market indicators continue to be mixed and there is considerable variation in employment outcomes across the country. The unemployment rate has been steady at around 5¾ per cent over the past year, with employment growth concentrated in part-time jobs. The forward-looking indicators point to continued expansion in employment over the period ahead.
Inflation remains quite low. With growth in labour costs remaining subdued, underlying inflation is likely to stay low for some time. Headline inflation is expected to pick up over the course of 2017 to be above 2 per cent, with the rise in underlying inflation expected to be a bit more gradual.
Conditions in the housing market vary considerably around the country. In some markets, conditions are strong and prices are rising briskly. In other markets, prices are declining. In the eastern capital cities, a considerable additional supply of apartments is scheduled to come on stream over the next couple of years. Growth in rents is the slowest for two decades. Borrowing for housing by investors has picked up over recent months. Supervisory measures have contributed to some strengthening of lending standards.
Taking account of the available information the Board judged that holding the stance of policy unchanged at this meeting would be consistent with sustainable growth in the economy and achieving the inflation target over time.

130,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 06, 2017 10:22AM ET</span>",U.S. factory orders rise for second straight month,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - New orders for U.S.-made goods increased for a second straight month in January, suggesting the recovery of the manufacturing sector was gaining momentum as rising prices for commodities spur demand for machinery. 
Factory goods orders rose 1.2 percent, the Commerce Department said on Monday after an unrevised 1.3 percent jump in December. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast factory orders advancing 1.0 percent in January.
Factory orders were up 5.5 percent from a year ago. Total shipments of manufactured goods increased 0.2 percent after surging 2.5 percent in December.
Manufacturing, which accounts for about 12 percent of the U.S. economy, is regaining its footing after being buffeted by lower oil prices, a strong dollar and an inventory overhang. 
The nascent recovery was underscored by a survey last week showing a gauge of national factory activity jumped to a 2-1/2-year high in February.
Manufacturing could be boosted by the Trump administration's proposed tax reform, which would include corporate tax cuts. Promises of a lower corporate tax bill have buoyed business confidence in the last few months, but are yet to translate into strong business investment on capital goods. 
The Commerce Department also said orders for non-defense capital goods excluding aircraft - seen as a measure of business confidence and spending plans - slipped 0.1 percent in January instead of the 0.4 percent drop reported last month. 
Shipments of these so-called core capital goods, which are used to calculate business equipment spending in the gross domestic product report, fell 0.4 percent in January. They were previously reported to have declined 0.6 percent.
The weakness in shipments points to continued sluggish growth in business spending on equipment, which increased at a 1.9 percent annualized rate in the fourth quarter. That was the first rise in over a year. 
U.S. stocks and the dollar (DXY) were trading lower in mid-morning trading. Prices of U.S. Treasuries also fell.
In January, orders for transportation equipment accelerated 6.2 percent, reflecting a 62.2 percent surge in defense aircraft orders. There was also a 69.8 percent jump in orders for civilian aircraft. Outside transportation, orders for machinery increased 0.9 percent.
Orders for computers and electronic products fell 1.9 percent and bookings for electrical equipment, appliances and components declined 2.6 percent. Orders for fabricated metal product rose 2.3 percent.
Unfilled orders at factories fell 0.4 percent after declining 0.8 percent in December. Unfilled core capital goods orders increased 0.4 percent in January after a similar gain in the prior month.

Inventories of goods at factories rose 0.2 percent in January. They have increased in six of the last seven months. The inventories-to-shipments ratio was 1.31 in January, unchanged from December.

In a report, the U.S. Census Bureau said factory orders increased by a seasonally adjusted 1.2% in January, above forecasts for a gain of 1.0%. Factory orders gained 1.3% in December.
Factory orders excluding transportation gained 0.3% in January, lower than the prior month’s 2.4% increase that was upwardly revised from an initial 2.1% advance.

ATHENS (Reuters) - Greece's economy contracted from October to December after two straight quarters of growth, statistics service (ELSTAT) said on Monday, with its performance in the last quarter of 2016 turning out worse than projected in February.
The seasonally adjusted, revised data showed a 1.2 percent decline in economic output in the fourth quarter, a worse performance than a 0.4 percent slump projected in February's flash estimates.
Facing a bailout review entailing a liberalization of labor laws, Athens is keen to show that taxation and pension cuts that came with last year's 86-billion-euro aid deal will bear fruit and lead to recovery this year.
Earlier, Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras told a cabinet meeting the economy was turning a page, poised to show 'exceptionally high' rates of growth this year.
Recovery will be key to bring down an unemployment rate of nearly 23 percent, the highest in the euro zone, and attain a projected primary budget surplus of 1.75 percent - excluding debt servicing outlays - demanded by Greece's creditors.
The data showed the 175 billion euro economy shrank at an annual 1.1 percent pace in the fourth quarter versus earlier projections of 0.3 percent growth.
The EU and the IMF expect the economy to rebound by 2.7 percent this year, while the Bank of Greece projects it will expand by 2.5 percent, provided the second bailout review, which has dragged on for months, is concluded soon.
""The data revision points to a full-year 2016 real GDP growth of -0.1 percent versus a 0.3 percent expansion suggested by the previous flash estimates,"" Eurobank economist Platon Monokroussos said.
Looking at the components of gross domestic product, the main drivers behind the decline in economic output were weaker public consumption and a negative contribution from net exports.
Consumption fell 1.1 percent compared to the third quarter, with imports rising by 4.5 percent while exports declined 1.4 percent. Gross capital formation rose 1.8 percent from the previous quarter.
""Private consumption remained on a positive trajectory for the third consecutive quarter, despite the tax burden,"" Monokroussos said.

The Frankfurt-based Sentix research group's euro zone index rose to 20.7 points, reaching its highest level since August 2007. It was above the consensus reading of 18.5 in a Reuters poll of analysts. 
""All the expectation components for the global economic regions rose and cast the decline of last month in a new light,"" Sentix said in a statement. ""Therefore the potential threat of a sudden halt to the economic recovery is off the table.""
The index had last month edged down to 17.4 from 18.2 in January on concerns that U.S. President Donald Trump's policy course would weigh on the global economy.
A sub-index measuring investor assessment of the current situation in the euro zone also rose to its highest level since May 2011.
An index tracking Germany, the euro zone's largest economy, rose to 34.1 from 31.3 in February. The indices for the United States and Japan also rose.
""Trump's motto 'Make America great again' is having an effect,"" Sentix wrote.
U.S. stocks have risen to record highs since Trump's election after he vowed to remove some of the regulations introduced after the financial crisis and to boost spending on the military and infrastructure.
""In addition to the main regions, the positive economic momentum for emerging markets is retained,"" Sentix said. It noted that

140,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 06, 2017 02:40AM ET</span>",China Feb data expected to show solid growth as Beijing vows to tackle debt,"BEIJING (Reuters) - A flurry of data in coming weeks is expected to show China posted solid economic growth in February, even as the government trimmed its growth target for the year to focus on containing the risks from a rapid build-up in debt.
Export and import growth is expected to hit multi-year highs, according to Reuters polls, adding to views that the global economy are shifting into higher gear and giving China's policymakers more confidence to press ahead on oft-delayed structural reforms.
China's first-quarter economic growth could accelerate to 7 percent year-on-year, from 6.8 percent in the last quarter, economists at OCBC wrote in a note on Monday, while adding the pace may ease beginning in spring.
Reflecting continued strength in its manufacturing sector, and particularly heavy industry, China's producer price index (PPI) likely rose 7.7 percent from a year earlier, the sharpest gain in nearly 9 years.
China's iron ore and steel prices have been rallying for a year, fueled by a construction boom, though worries are growing over rising inventories. The country's insatiable demand for resources has helped spur an inflationary pulse in commodities worldwide.
While factory surveys show manufacturers have been able to pass on some of the higher production costs by raising prices of their goods, there has been scant evidence of it flowing through to consumer inflation yet.
Consumer prices likely rose 1.7 percent in February, easing from a 2.5 percent increase in January as food prices normalized following Lunar New Year celebrations. Beijing is targeting consumer inflation at 3 percent this year, unchanged from 2016.
China's foreign exchange reserves likely fell for an eighth straight month, though the decline was seen to be marginal as a weaker U.S. dollar and tighter restrictions on taking money out of the country dampened pressure from capital outflows.
FX reserves likely dipped to $2.973 trillion, from $2.998 trillion in January, when reserves fell below the closely watched $3 trillion level for the first time in nearly 6 years.
While that level is not seen as a firm ""line in the sand"" for Beijing, doubts are growing over how much longer authorities can afford to defend both the currency and its reserves if the U.S. dollar resumes its upward trend.
China announces foreign exchange reserves on Tuesday, followed by trade and inflation data on Wednesday and Thursday, respectively, while loan and money data is expected anytime from March 10-15.
China will release activity data on March 14 for industrial output, retail sales and fixed asset investment. The data will combine January and February in a bid to smooth out seasonal factors caused by the timing of the long Lunar New Year holidays, which began in late January this year but fell in February last year.
Industrial output is expected to have risen 6.2 percent for Jan-Feb, picking up from 6.0 percent in December, while fixed asset investment is likely to grow 8.2 percent, edging up from 8.1 percent in December.
Retail sales growth is expected to have cooled to 10.5 percent for Jan-Feb, from 10.9 percent in December.
Car sales have been hit particularly hard as a tax cut was rolled back. General Motors (N:GM) reported on Monday that sales in the first two months fell 14.8 percent on-year.
BOOMING EXPORTS, IMPORTS
Trade data is expected to show a further improvement in demand at home and abroad.
Driven largely by purchases of coal, iron ore and crude oil, imports likely rose 20.0 percent on-year, the highest since January 2013, and accelerating from 16.7 percent growth in January, though the February readings may have been distorted by the long holiday, which impacts production and port handling.
Shipments from the world's largest exporter are seen rising 12.3 percent in February, the highest since September 2014. Exports rose 7.9 percent in January.
China's trade surplus is forecast to have dropped to $25.75 billion in February, versus January's $51.35 billion. The surplus, long an irritant with some of its major trading partners, has come under fresh scrutiny amid fears of rising U.S. trade protectionism under new President Donald Trump.
LENDING SEEN SLOWING
While China's trade data often steals the headlines, loan and money supply figures may come under the closest scrutiny by investors after Premier Li Keqiang said on Sunday that the economic growth target would be cut to 6.5 percent this year to give policymakers more room to focus on reforms and erect a ""firewall"" against financial risks.
Authorities had made similar pledges to tackle debt risks last year, even as banks extended a record amount of credit.
Still, new bank lending likely eased sharply to 920 billion yuan ($133.40 billion) in February from January's 2.03 trillion, which was the second-highest monthly tally on record.
Chinese banks usually ""front load"" loans early in the year after the government renews their credit quotas, competing fiercely to maintain market share and to lock in higher-quality borrowers as soon as possible.
Growth in outstanding loans likely inched up to 12.7 percent on-year in February, while M2 money supply likely rose 11.4 percent, from 11.3 percent in January.
Beijing has the target for broad money supply growth this year to around 12 percent from about 13 percent for 2016.
With the economy on more stable footing, China's central bank has moved cautiously to a tightening policy bias in recent months to contain capital outflows and rein in debt risks.
It raised short-term interest rates modestly in January and February and is expected to do so again in coming months, but is seen keeping its benchmark policy lending rate steady through at least mid-2018, according to a separate Reuters poll.

In a report, the Institute of Supply Management (ISM) said its non-manufacturing purchasing manager's index (PMI) unexpectedly rose to 57.6 in February from the prior month’s reading of 56.5.
Analysts had expected no change from January’s reading.
On the index, a reading above 50.0 indicates the non-manufacturing sector economy is generally expanding, below 50.0 indicates the sector is contracting.
The Non-Manufacturing Business Activity Index increased to 63.6, 3.3 points higher than January’s reading of 60.3. Analysts had forecast it to drop to 60.0.
The New Orders Index registered 61.2 in February, 2.6 points higher than the reading of 58.6 in the previous month.
The Employment Index increased 0.5 points to 55.2 last month from January’s reading of 54.7.
The Prices Index decreased 1.3 points to 57.7 in February from the prior month’s reading of 59.0.
“The non-manufacturing sector reflected strong growth in February after cooling off in January,” the report indicated, adding that all 16 service industries reported growth.
“Respondents’ comments continue to be mixed, with some uncertainty; however, the majority indicate a positive outlook on business conditions and the overall economy,"" the ISM concluded.
Immediately following the report, EUR/USD traded at 1.0558 compared to 1.0560 ahead of the release, GBP/USD was at 1.2237 from 1. 2234 earlier, while USD/JPY was at 114.47 from 114.44 prior to the publication.

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's unexpectedly strong economic growth since last June's Brexit vote may be starting to fade as inflation picks up, according to a major business survey that chimed with notes of caution from several top companies.
Slowing consumer spending started to hurt services companies in February, an unpromising signal for the economy ahead of Britain's divorce with the European Union, Friday's Markit/CIPS UK Services Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) showed.
As finance minister Philip Hammond puts the final touches on his first annual budget on March 8, the survey is likely to reinforce his sense that Britain's strong growth since last year's vote to leave the EU will fade this year.
The services PMI fell to a five-month low of 53.3 from 54.5 in January and suggested the economy is now expanding at a quarterly pace of around 0.4 percent - much slower than the 0.7 percent expansion during the fourth quarter of 2016.
Sterling slid to a seven-week low against the dollar after the PMI was published, prompting investors to discount further the chance of the Bank of England raising record low interest rates any time soon.
Lacklustre reports from major British companies added to the sense of a tougher 2017 for the economy than last year.
Advertising giant WPP (LON:WPP) , the kind of company regarded by analysts as a bellwether for the economy, warned of a tough economic background and its forecast for growth this year came in below analyst forecasts.
Earlier this week, British broadcaster  ITV  (L:ITV) reported the first decline in advertising revenue since 2009.
Britain's economy expanded faster than most of its developed world peers in 2016 but economists think rising inflation is starting to weigh on consumers and business profit margins, something corroborated by the PMI survey.
""Notwithstanding the disappointment, that is what everyone has been expecting to happen - we just hoped we were wrong,"" said Alan Clarke, head of European fixed income strategy at Scotiabank, on the PMI.
Data company Markit said some firms in its survey reported cautious spending by British consumers.
It highlighted strong inflation pressure with input costs and selling prices in services companies increasing at the fastest rates since mid-2008 when consumer price inflation hit more than 5 percent.
""Weaker consumer spending was a key cause of slower service sector growth, suggesting that household budgets are starting to crack under the strain of higher prices and weak wage growth,"" Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit, said.
Despite the inflation pressure, Williamson said the PMI's fall left it around levels more consistent with a further rate cut by the Bank of England than an increase.
Last month BoE Governor Mark Carney said he remained convinced that inflation would go above the bank's 2 percent target only temporarily and due entirely to the fall in the value of the pound since the Brexit vote, rather than more deep-seated price pressures.
The pound may have further to fall, a Reuters poll of foreign exchange strategists and economists showed on Thursday. [GBP/POLL]
Prime Minister Theresa May intends to trigger the formal process for separating from the EU by the end of this month.
Although growth slowed in February, services firms remained confident about their prospects in the next 12 months, with optimism running just below January's eight-month high.

146,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 03, 2017 06:24AM ET</span>",Euro zone private sector business growth near six-year high,"By Rahul Karunakar
(Reuters) - Euro zone private sector business activity rose at its quickest pace in nearly six years in February, accelerating across all major economies with job creation reaching its fastest in almost a decade, surveys showed on Friday.
The data, which came alongside news on Thursday that euro zone inflation had just surpassed the European Central Bank's target, could pose a challenge to policymakers in how to explain leaving monetary policy unchanged even as the economy picks up sharply.
IHS Markit's final composite Purchasing Managers' Index - seen as a good overall growth indicator - rose sharply to 56.0 in February from 54.4 in the previous month. It has not been higher since April 2011 and was unchanged from a flash estimate.
While separate official data showed German retail sales unexpectedly dropped in January, the PMIs showed that February private sector services activity in Europe's four largest economies Germany, France, Italy and Spain all improved.
""The PMIs tell you that the economy is on a reasonably solid footing, obviously the economy is not roaring away to the extent that some of the other Anglo-Saxon economies have done over the course of recent years, but it is a pretty good place to be,"" said Peter Dixon, economist at Commerzbank (DE:CBKG).
The reports suggest that rising concerns about potential upsets in coming euro zone elections, particularly the prospect of far-right leader Marine Le Pen posing a serious challenge for the presidency in France, are being shrugged off by the economy. 
""We don't quite know what will happen in France following the election in April-May and that is probably the single biggest risk that the continent faces,"" Dixon added. 
If sustained, economic growth could hit 0.6 percent in the first quarter, according to Markit. That would be much faster than the 0.4 percent economists predicted in a Reuters poll just last month. That forecast was based on hopes that there would be no major upsets in several national elections this year. [ECILT/EU]
""The final PMI numbers paint a bright picture of a euro zone economy starting to fire on all cylinders. Growth accelerated in all of the four largest member states in February to suggest an increasingly sustainable and robust-looking upturn,"" said Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit.
The reports suggest optimism is on the rise, euro zone companies are raising prices for their services, and crucially, they are beginning to hire again. The composite PMI employment index rose to 53.8 from 53.4, its highest since October 2007. 
Business expectations indexes for the services sector and for all industries improved at the fastest rate in nearly six years.
Manufacturers, too, enjoyed their best month in nearly six years in February, boosted by a weaker euro, which helped drive strong demand for exports, a similar survey showed on Wednesday. The euro is expected to ease a bit further, according to a Reuters poll of currency strategists.[EUR/POLL]
The renewed strength in the PMIs will be welcomed by the European Central Bank, which is expected to remain on the sidelines through upcoming national elections in three major economies in the currency bloc.[ECB/INT]
With the Federal Reserve set to raise interest rates further this year and pressure mounting on the ECB to consider scaling back its aggressively-stimulative monetary policy, the central bank will have a challenge with its messaging in the coming months.
""The acceleration in growth, employment and prices signaled by the surveys suggests that analysts will begin to pull forward their expectations of when the ECB could begin tapering its stimulus,"" added Williamson.

""However, it seems likely that central bank rhetoric will remain dovish in coming months, focusing on the headwinds that the economy faces in 2017, and specifically the need for policy to remain accommodative in the face of political uncertainty.""

147,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 03, 2017 05:11AM ET</span>",Euro zone January retail sales unexpectedly drop for third straight month,"BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Euro zone monthly retail sales fell in January for the third consecutive month, against market expectations of a rise, estimates released by Eurostat on Friday showed, in a sign of lower consumer appetite for spending as prices go up.
Retail sales in the 19 countries sharing the euro fell by 0.1 percent in January from December, the European Union's statistics office Eurostat said. The figure compared with market expectations of a 0.4 percent increase on the month.
Year-on-year, the volume of retail sales grew 1.2 percent in January, lower than the 1.6 percent rise forecast by economists polled by Reuters.
The monthly drop is the third in a row and is compounded by a downwardly revised 0.5 percent fall recorded in December, despite Christmas shopping. In its previous estimate, Eurostat had recorded a 0.3 percent fall in December.
The figures, which are subject to revision, may indicate a reduced appetite for shopping in the euro zone, possibly caused by higher consumer prices, which could dent the bloc's economic recovery.
Eurostat flash estimates released on Thursday said annual consumer inflation reached a four-year high in February, accelerating to 2.0 percent after a 1.8 percent rise the previous month, mostly driven by higher energy prices
The fall in the retail sales monthly reading was mostly due to a 0.2 percent drop in purchases of non-food products, a wide category that includes clothing, electrical goods, pharmaceutical products and e-commerce.
Sales of food, drinks and tobacco were also down 0.1 percent.
Car fuel sales went up by 0.8 percent in the month, the only component of the reading that recorded a rise.

Markit's final services index rose to 54.4 from 53.4 in January, helped by a sharper increase in new business in post
and telecommunications as well as transport and storage. Markit's final composite Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI),
which tracks the activity in manufacturing and services that together account for more than two-thirds of the economy, rose to 56.1 from 54.8 in January to reach a 34-month high.
Markit's final PMI for manufacturing on Wednesday showed growth had accelerated at the strongest rate in nearly six years in February. It said the results suggest manufacturing would contribute to overall growth in the first quarter.
Friday's results suggest that the services sector, which is not traditionally a German strength, would also make a
contribution to growth. Services providers recorded the strongest expansion in new work since February 2016 after three months of slowing growth. ""The latest PMI data add to our expectations that economic growth will strengthen in the first quarter to at least 0.6 percent quarter-on-quarter, marking a strong start to 2017,"" Markit economist Trevor Balchin said.
To address an accumulation of backlogs, German service sector companies stepped up recruitment. Employment rose for a
40th consecutive month and at the fastest rate since June 2011.
Markit also said that companies in the services sector were positive regarding the 12-month outlook and sentiment improved for the third successive month to the sharpest since March 2011.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's economy likely grew faster in the fourth quarter than initially reported, as companies ramped up investment in plant and manufacturing equipment, a Reuters poll showed.
Separate data is also expected to show the country's current account surplus for January likely narrowed from the previous month due to a temporary slowdown in exports before the Lunar New Year holidays, the poll of economists showed.
Any upward revision to gross domestic product is likely a welcome sign to the government, because policymakers have been counting on an increase in business investment to drive future growth and increase low productivity.
""Corporate sentiment among manufacturers has been improving, and we are finally starting to see this reflected in capital expenditure,"" said Hiroshi Miyazaki, senior economist at Mitsubishi UFJ  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) Securities.
""I expect more capital expenditure to come through, and I think the economy is headed in the right direction.""
GDP growth for the October-December quarter is expected to be upwardly revised to an annualized 1.6 percent from a preliminary 1.0 percent, according to the median estimate of 20 economists.
The Cabinet Office will release the data at 8:50 a.m. Tokyo time on March 8, which is 2350 GMT on March 7.
The capital expenditure component of GDP is forecast to be revised up to 1.7 percent growth from the previous quarter, which is almost twice as fast as the 0.9 percent quarterly expansion in the preliminary data.
Some economists expect capital expenditure to increase further as companies will soon have to start investing in more efficient equipment to deal with a shrinking pool of workers as the population ages.
However, U.S. economic policy poses a risk, because companies could suddenly turn cautious on capex if U.S. President Donald Trump adopts protectionist trade policies.
Separate data from the finance ministry is expected to show Japan's current account surplus in January narrowed to 239.0 billion yen ($2.09 billion) from 1.1 trillion yen in the previous month due to a slowdown in exports.
Japan's exports tend to slow in January as factories in China curb output before the Lunar New Year holidays, but this is likely to be temporary as global demand has shown positive signs so far this year.

157,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 02, 2017 07:35PM ET</span>",Japan's core inflation rises for first time in over a year,"By Leika Kihara
TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's core consumer prices rose for the first time in over a year in January due to a pickup in energy costs and private consumption, offering some hope for the central bank's efforts in accelerating inflation to its 2 percent target.
But household spending slumped in January even as the job market tightened further, underscoring the fragile nature of Japan's economic recovery.
The core consumer price index (CPI), which includes oil products but excludes volatile fresh food prices, rose 0.1 percent in January from a year ago, government data showed on Friday, posting the first increase since December 2015.
It compared with a median market forecast for a flat growth and followed a 0.2 percent drop in December.
A separate index that excludes the effect of energy and fresh food prices, but includes processed food costs, was up 0.2 percent in January from a year earlier, the government said.
Low inflation in Japan, a phenomenon seen for much of the past two decades, remains the biggest hurdle to fostering a durable economic recovery - a goal that has eluded policy makers since the late 1990s.
The ministry began releasing from Friday a new index on consumer prices that excludes the effect of volatile fresh food and energy costs, which it says is useful in tracking consumer price trends that strips away one-off factors.
Separate data showed household spending fell 1.2 percent in January from a year earlier, worse than a median market forecast for a 0.4 percent drop and marking the 11th straight month of declines. The jobless rate fell to 3.0 percent in January, matching a median forecast.
Japan's economy expanded in July-September and analysts expect growth to pick up in coming quarters, thanks to a recent rise in exports and factory output driven by improvements in emerging economies.
Policymakers hope that prospects of a sustained recovery will prompt companies to boost wages and household spending, seen as a soft spot in the world's third-largest economy.

Many analysts expect core consumer prices to head toward 1 percent later this year, though that will still keep inflation distant from the BOJ's ambitious 2 percent target.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits fell to near a 44-year low last week, pointing to further tightening of the labor market even as economic growth appears to have remained moderate in the first quarter.
The stronger labor market and rising inflation could push the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates this month. Several Fed officials have in recent days suggested the U.S. central bank could increase borrowing costs soon. 
""The jobs market is strengthening and we are near full employment. The Fed is worried that the jobs market will overheat and that is fanning the discussion of a March rate hike,"" said Ryan Sweet, senior economist at Moody's Analytics in Westchester, Pennsylvania 
Initial claims for state unemployment benefits dropped 19,000 to a seasonally adjusted 223,000 for the week ended Feb. 25, the lowest level since March 1973, the Labor Department said on Thursday. 
It was the 104th straight week that claims remained below 300,000, a threshold associated with a healthy labor market. That is the longest stretch since 1970, when the labor market was much smaller. It is now at or close to full employment, with an unemployment rate of 4.8 percent.
Economists had forecast new claims for unemployment benefits dipping to 243,000 in the latest week. The government reported on Wednesday that the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index jumped 1.9 percent in the 12 months through January, the biggest gain since October 2012. The PCE price index increased 1.6 percent in December. 
The core PCE, the Fed's preferred inflation measure, increased 1.7 percent, still below its 2 percent target.
With more voices joining the chorus of Fed officials signaling further monetary policy tightening soon, financial markets have almost fully priced in a rate hike at the central bank's March 14-15 policy meeting. 
Fed Chair Janet Yellen could offer more clues on Friday when she speaks on the economic outlook in Chicago. The Fed raised its benchmark overnight interest rate last December and has forecast three rate increases for this year. 
The dollar (DXY) rose to a seven-week high against a basket of currencies after the data, while prices for U.S. government debt fell. Stocks on Wall Street slipped as investors took profits after a huge rally on Wednesday that propelled the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) above 21,000 for the first time.
LABOR SHORTAGES
The four-week moving average of claims, considered a better measure of labor market trends as it irons out week-to-week volatility, fell 6,250 to 234,250 last week, the lowest reading since April 1973. 
A survey from the Fed on Wednesday showed the labor market remained tight in early 2017, with some of the central bank's districts reporting ""widening"" labor shortages.
""Workers are not being laid off in large numbers,"" said Rob Martin, an economist at  Barclays  (LON:BARC) in New York.
The labor market strength comes despite signs the economy struggled to gain momentum early in the first quarter after slowing in the final three months of 2016. Data this week showed tepid growth in consumer spending in January, weak equipment and construction spending, and a wider goods trade deficit.
The Atlanta Fed is forecasting first-quarter gross domestic product rising at a 1.8 percent annualized rate. The economy grew at a 1.9 percent pace in the fourth quarter.
Thursday's claims report also showed the number of people still receiving benefits after an initial week of aid increased 3,000 to 2.07 million in the week ended Feb. 18. The four-week average of the so-called continuing claims edged up 750 to 2.07 million.

The continuing claims data covered the survey week for February's unemployment rate. The four-week moving average of claims fell 21,500 between the January and February survey periods, suggesting an improvement in the jobless rate.

159,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 02, 2017 10:30AM ET</span>",Freight and fridge sales: Indian economists seek GDP clues amid data doubts,"By Rajesh Kumar Singh
NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Surprised again by India's strong official growth statistics, economists are relying increasingly on high-frequency indicators like bank credit and rail freight to gauge the real health of Asia's third-largest economy.
For India's cash-reliant economy, Prime Minister Narendra Modi's decision in November to outlaw old 500 and 1,000 rupee banknotes came as a big shock.
The decision sucked 86 percent of cash out of circulation, and everyone from street hawkers to big consumer goods firms suffered a slump in sales.
With data on commercial vehicle output, rail freight, service tax receipts and home appliance sales showing slowing growth or contraction, economic expansion in the quarter to December was forecast by economists at 6.4 percent.
In fact, it came in at 7 percent, slower than the previous quarter but enough for India to retain the title of the world's fastest growing major economy.
""Forecasting India's GDP has become like predicting the English weather,"" said one senior economist with an international ratings agency. ""You never know when it will rain, when it will shine.""
The shock was bigger for economists at Mumbai-based brokerage Ambit Capital, who predicted the economy may even contract in the quarter after the cash crunch hobbled businesses.
Ambit's Ritika Mankar Mukherjee defended her team's view, which she said was based on an extensive survey of small- and medium-sized enterprises. She also cited a slowdown in bank credit growth to a multi-year low of 5 percent.
""India is a heavily bank credit-dependent economy,"" she said. ""How come you have an acceleration in manufacturing activity when credit growth is slowing down?""
Ambit is one of several brokerages to devise their own measures of economic activity, applying methods honed in China, where GDP figures are suspected to have been ""smoothed"" for years by the authorities.
""The message from the GDP numbers doesn't tally with what we see on the ground,"" said Sonal Varma, an economist with Nomura in Singapore. ""It does become important to supplement your analysis with additional information.""
T.C.A. Anant, Chief Statistician of India, defended the official data.
""One should keep in mind that anecdotal evidence is not the same as the estimates derived over indicators which are aggregated over a large number of sources,"" he told CNBC-TV18, when asked about their accuracy.
POLITICS OF DATA
The official figures were music to the ears of Modi's ruling Bharatiya Janata Party, as it fights a tough election in the battleground state of Uttar Pradesh.
Modi had taken flak for his shock monetary therapy from opposition parties as well as Nobel laureates Amartya Sen and Paul Krugman. Buoyed by the growth figures, he hit back at Sen, who teaches economics at Harvard University.
""Hard work is more important than Harvard,"" he told a campaign rally in Uttar Pradesh on Wednesday.
The regional election in a state that is home to one in six Indians is a key mid-term test of Modi's popularity. A strong showing would boost his chances of winning a second term in 2019.
Sandeep Shastri, a political scientist, says the GDP figures will have little bearing on the election. 
""It is not a substantive issue for voters,"" he said.
Official GDP data has been questioned since a change in methodology in 2015 transformed India into the world's fastest-growing major economy. New Delhi defended the overhaul, citing an improved database of hundreds of thousands of firms.
Data reporting has long been a challenge in an economy where the informal sector accounts for 40 percent of output and employs nine in 10 workers.
The federal statistics office carries out periodic surveys of the gray economy, but it mostly extrapolates data from old surveys.
And since India does not have reliable national retail sales data, statisticians use production figures to estimate consumer spending.
Still, some economists are perplexed by figures showing growth in consumer spending hitting a four-year high, even as sales of beverages, home appliances and vehicles fell.
Earnings of consumer goods giants such as  Hindustan Unilever  (NS:HLL) and drug makers like GlaxoSmithKline Consumer Healthcare (NS:GLSM) also took a hit.
Some data also appear to be contradictory. For example, services dependent on government spending grew at a faster pace in the quarter, but overall government spending fell.

""This does not add up,"" said Varma, the Nomura economist.

ZURICH (Reuters) - Measly economic growth and tumbling exports data for Switzerland underlined on Thursday the failure of the Swiss National Bank to check the rise of the franc.
Month-on-month GDP growth was just 0.1 percent in the final quarter of last year, with goods exports - which together with services amount to around two-thirds of the economy - shrinking 3.8 percent from the previous quarter.
Much of the decline was put at the door of the strong Swiss franc, which makes Swiss goods more expensive abroad.
The franc strengthened almost 2 percent against the euro in the fourth quarter and is another 0.7 percent stronger so far this year.
Fears sparked by France's elections and anxiety that Greece's fiscal woes could threaten the future of the euro have driven increased demand for safe-haven francs.
There is also a new concern - new U.S. President Donald Trump's aversion to what he sees around the world as anti-American currency manipulation would turn to Switzerland as the Swiss National Bank attempts to weaken the currency.
But not yet. The currency's advance has come despite the SNB spending an average 2.4 billion francs per week so far in 2017 – nearly two and a half times the average from a year ago.
""We are very concerned about the rise in the franc,"" said Hans Hess, head of the mechanical and electrical engineering lobby Swissmem, which revealed that nearly half of Swiss industrial companies are considering moving operations abroad.
""It's not only the machine industry, but tourism, retail which suffer when the franc rises. A stronger franc makes life much harder for Swiss exporters.""
Global watchmaker brand Swatch (S:UHR), for example, reported a 47 percent slide in annual net profit - partly due to the franc which the company described as ""expensive.""
So industries struggling with shriveled margins and lost sales are anxiously watching the franc's advance toward the high of 1.0623 euros touched after Britons' June vote to quit the EU.
It was at 1.0640 euros on Thursday.
SNB DILEMMA
The SNB - which uses currency intervention and negative interest rates to curb the franc - faces an increasingly difficult situation, economists say.
""The SNB has been juggling with three balls – negative interest rates, the size of its balance sheet and an overly strong Swiss franc, and then someone has thrown them a fourth one – the danger of being called a currency manipulator,"" said Thomas Flury, head of currency at UBS Wealth Management.
""There is increasing doubt how long the SNB can maintain the current constellation,"" said Flury, who thinks the franc could rise to 1.05 or even 1.03 within weeks.
Switzerland already meets two U.S. Treasury criteria for ""unfair currency practices"": having a material current account surplus and having engaged in ""persistent one-sided intervention in the foreign exchange markets"".
Switzerland could have a U.S. trade surplus above $20 billion this year on current trends, Swiss private bank Mirabaud calculates.
The SNB declined to comment, but its dilemma is plain to see.
""To prevent the rise of the currency, the SNB would have to intervene to a far greater extent than the level they are at the moment,"" Kubli said. ""But the SNB probably doesn't want to intervene in an unlimited way because of concerns about the size of their balance sheet.""

Foreign currency interventions have amassed SNB currency reserves of nearly 700 billion francs, larger than Swiss GDP.

BRUSSELS/FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Euro zone inflation surged to a four-year high last month, zooming past the European Central Bank's target and piling pressure on rate setters to open talks about when and how extraordinary stimulus measures will be scaled back.
Inflation in the 19 countries sharing the euro rose to 2.0 percent from 1.8 percent in January, Eurostat data showed on Thursday, the highest since the start of 2013 and just above the ECB's target of a rate just below 2 percent. 
Producer price inflation, which feeds into overall inflation with a lag, meanwhile surged to an annual 3.5 percent rate from 1.6 percent, hinting at building pressure for underlying price growth.
Still, the ECB is likely to resist any call to step off the accelerator when it meets next week, arguing that the oil price fueled inflation surge is temporary, growth is fragile and the outlook is fraught with uncertainty given elections in France, Germany, the Netherlands and possibly Italy. 
Underlying inflation is also weak, holding steady at 0.9 percent last month, suggesting that once the oil price surge passes through the numbers, inflation will fall back down, staying below the ECB's target possibly through 2019.
Having missed its inflation objective for years, the ECB is keen not to move too early, worried that any market turbulence could force it to reverse course as it happened when the euro zone debt crisis spiraled out of control in 2011.
Still, ECB policymakers are likely to acknowledge an improved outlook, a precursor to any discussion about rolling back its 2.3 trillion euro asset buying program and raising deeply negative rates.
Economic sentiment and manufacturing activity are at a six-year high, stock markets are surging and the euro zone economy has grown above an annual 1.5 percent rate for eight straight quarters, its best run since before the financial crisis. 
Keeping inflation-wary Germans patient may be the ECB's biggest challenge as the politically sensitive and emotionally charged issue is bound to feature in the election campaign ahead of elections in September
With German inflation at 2.2 percent, real rates are in negative territory, eating into the savings of thrifty households and adding to already abundant criticism of super easy monetary policies.
Inflation is a red flag for many Germans whose families suffered from depreciation of money and mass unemployment in the 1920s.
German households also prefer relatively simple savings products with lower but safer returns, a problem when real return turn negative.
With overall savings of 5 trillion euros ($5.28 trillion) and interest rates at zero, an inflation of 2 percent means German savers are basically losing 100 billion euros per year, Bavarian Finance Minister Markus Soeder said on Wednesday. 

Policymakers earlier suggested that any discussion about the bank's next step would likely start in June with a decision coming only after the summer.

In a report, Eurostat said consumer price inflation rose by a seasonally adjusted 2.0% in February in line with expectations and following a final reading of a 1.8% advance in the prior month.
According to Eurostat, the main components of euro area inflation, energy had the highest annual rate in February (9.2%, compared with 8.1% in January), followed by food, alcohol & tobacco (2.5%, compared with 1.8% in January), services (1.3%, compared with 1.2% in January) and non-energy industrial goods (0.2%, compared with 0.5% in January).
Headline inflation is running ahead of the ECB's target of ""close to, but below 2%"" for the first time since January 2013.
Core CPI, which excludes food, energy, alcohol, and tobacco costs, remained as expected at a seasonally adjusted 0.9% for a third consecutive month in February.
The ECB will hold its next monetary policy meeting on March 9 and is widely expected leave interest rates and quantitative easing measures untouched.
Policy makers however have pointed to the lower core reading and argued that the energy and food driven spike in the headline number will not lead to higher inflation over the medium term.
ECB president Mario Draghi brushed off calls for the removal of policy accommodation just last month with a similar argument, calling the rise “temporary” and almost entirely due to rising oil prices.
""Support from our monetary policy measures is still needed if inflation rates are to converge towards our objective with sufficient confidence and in a sustained manner,"" Draghi said.
Draghi further argued that the ECB should not react to individual data points and short-lived increases in inflation.
""We therefore continue to look through changes in inflation if we believe they do not durably affect the medium-term outlook for price stability,” he explained.
After the report, which was released simultaneously with January producer prices and unemployment for the region, EUR/USD was unchanged at 1.0530, while EUR/GBP traded at 0.8585 compared to 0.8581 earlier.
Meanwhile, European stock markets were trading slightly lower. The Euro Stoxx 50 dropped 0.21%, Germany's DAX fell 0.14%, France’s CAC 40 slipped 0.05%, while London’s FTSE 100 inched down 0.05%."

DETROIT (Reuters) - February U.S. auto sales, an indicator of consumer spending, fell slightly even as automakers stepped up discounting to sustain sales, major manufacturers reported on Wednesday.
Demand for cars, sport utility vehicles and pickup trucks in February dipped to an annualized pace of 17.6 million vehicles, compared with a robust 17.7 million a year earlier, according to Autodata Corp.
Shares of Detroit automakers General Motors Co (N:GM),  Ford Motor Co  (N:F) and  Fiat  Chrysler Automobiles NV (N:FCAU) (MI:FCHA) all rose as the broader market surged more than 1 percent (N).
However, analysts pointed to caution flags in the latest results, including discounts that hit 10 percent of the average selling price for February, according to three companies that track vehicle pricing.
""With the industry at 10 percent you are in a push market,"" said Mark Wakefield, head of the North American automotive practice for consultancy AlixPartners. ""This is top cycle stuff."" In a push market, manufacturers try to unload vehicles, rather than respond to the pull of consumer demand.
The challenge now for automakers is to avoid over-producing vehicles or launching a price war that could undermine profits, especially as rising interest rates make it more expensive to subsidize loans and leases, Wakefield said.
""It's that fine balance,"" he said. ""How much can I push the boundary without prompting a reaction that pulls all of us down?""
The tension surfaced in another round of sniping on Wednesday between GM and Ford over which one was more dependent on discounts to prop up pickup truck sales. 
On the plus side for automakers, U.S. consumers continued buying more SUVs and pickups, which generate higher profits. 
Light trucks accounted for 62 percent of light vehicle sales in February. In 2016, that split was 59.5 percent in favor of trucks and SUVs, according to Autodata Corp. Over a full year, that shift would mean roughly two assembly plants' worth of cars had been replaced by SUVs or trucks.
February sales were mixed for the major automakers. GM beat most analysts' expectations with a 4.2 percent gain in new vehicle sales.
Ford sales declined by 4 percent, with its F-Series pickup trucks up 9 percent, SUVs rising 6 percent but cars sliding 24 percent from a year ago, the automaker said.
Toyota Motor Corp (T:7203), No. 3 in U.S. sales volume, suffered a 7.2 percent drop as sales of the company's best-selling model, the Camry sedan, dropped 15 percent. 
Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV sales fell 10 percent, as its largest-volume Jeep SUV brand dropped 15 percent.
Nissan Motor Co (T:7201) beat expectations on a 3.5 percent gain, led by a 54 percent surge for its Rogue small SUV.

 Honda  Motor Co (T:7267) (N:HMC) sales rose 2.6 percent, helped by its trucks and SUVs, gaining 12 percent from a year earlier.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. consumer spending cooled in January as demand for automobiles and utilities fell, but inflation recorded its biggest monthly increase in four years, raising the probability of an interest rate hike from the Federal Reserve this month.
The tepid gain in consumer spending added to weak housing starts, equipment spending and construction data in suggesting economic growth remained moderate early in the first quarter after slowing in the final three months of 2016.
Despite the softness on the demand-side of the economy, the manufacturing sector recovery is gaining steam. Factory activity hit a 2-1/2-year high in February, other data showed on Wednesday.
""A weak start to the year for consumers suggests a downside risk to first-quarter growth prospects, though it likely won't quell recent chatter about a March Fed rate hike,"" said Sal Guatieri, a senior economist at BMO Capital Markets in Toronto.
The Commerce Department said consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, increased 0.2 percent after rising 0.5 percent in December.
Consumer spending is likely to remain supported amid promises by the Trump administration of sweeping tax cuts and increased infrastructure spending.
In a speech to Congress on Tuesday night, President Donald Trump said his economic team was working on a ""historic"" tax reform that would slash corporate taxes. Trump promised ""massive"" tax cuts for the middle class, but offered no further details. Consumer confidence has surged following Trump's Nov. 8 election victory, hitting a 15-1/2-year high in February. 
In January the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index increased 0.4 percent - the largest gain since February 2013 - after rising 0.2 percent in December. 
In the 12 months through January, the PCE price index jumped 1.9 percent. That was the biggest year-on-year gain since October 2012 and followed a 1.6 percent increase in December. 
Excluding food and energy, the so-called core PCE price index rose 0.3 percent in January. That was the biggest increase since January 2012 and followed a 0.1 percent gain in December. 
The core PCE price index increased 1.7 percent year-on-year after a similar gain in December. The core PCE is the Fed's preferred inflation measure. 
While still below the U.S. central bank's 2 percent target, inflation is now in the upper end of the range that Fed officials in December estimated would be reached this year.
""COMPELLING"" CASE FOR RATE HIKE 
The strong inflation readings come a day after New York Fed President William Dudley said the case for further monetary policy tightening had become a ""lot more compelling.""
Prices for U.S. Treasuries fell, with the yield on the interest-rate sensitive 2-year note (US2YT=RR) hitting its highest level since August 2009. Fed funds futures were pricing in about a 65 percent chance of a rate hike at the Fed's March 14-15 policy meeting.
The dollar touched a seven-week high against a basket of currencies. Stocks on Wall Street rose, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) breaching the 21,000 mark for the first time ever as investors focused on Trump's comments.
The U.S. central bank has forecast three rate increases this year. The Fed hiked its overnight interest rate last December. 
In a separate report on Wednesday, the Institute for Supply Management said its index of national factory activity increased to a reading of 57.7 last month, the highest since August 2014, from 56.0 in January. 
A reading above 50 indicates an expansion in manufacturing, which accounts for about 12 percent of the U.S. economy. Some of the increase likely reflects a surge in business confidence following Trump's election.
But that has not been matched by a strong increase in business spending on capital goods. Business spending on equipment rose moderately in the fourth quarter and appeared to weaken in January, data showed this week.
""For now, businesses and households appear confident, but have yet to act on that confidence,"" said Michael Feroli, an economist at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) in New York. ""When it comes to calculating GDP it is the hard data that matters, and so far the hard activity data for the first quarter has been disappointing.""
Rising inflation is eroding consumer spending. When adjusted for inflation, consumer spending fell 0.3 percent in January, the first drop since August and the biggest in three years. It increased 0.3 percent in December and January's drop implies consumer spending will probably not provide a big boost to GDP in the first quarter
Consumer spending increased at a 3.0 percent annualized rate in the fourth quarter, helping to blunt some of the impact on the economy from a wider trade deficit. 
The economy grew at a 1.9 percent rate in the fourth quarter and the Atlanta Fed is forecasting GDP rising at a 1.8 percent pace this quarter. Another report from the Commerce Department on Wednesday showed construction spending declined 1.0 percent in January.

Personal income rose 0.4 percent in January after gaining 0.3 percent in December. Income at the disposal of households after accounting for inflation, fell 0.2 percent, the first decline since October 2013.

185,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 01, 2017 11:01AM ET</span>",Inflation-averse Germans see fastest price rises in 4-1/2 years,"By Michael Nienaber
BERLIN (Reuters) - German inflation, a politically- and emotionally-charged issue for consumers heading for the polls later this year, soared to its highest level in four-and-a-half years in February, bounding past the European Central Bank's euro zone target.
Manufacturing was also reported as growing at the strongest rate since 2011, in a further sign that Europe's biggest economy is firing on all cylinders.
The inflation data nonetheless triggered fresh calls from Germany for an end to the ECB's loose monetary policy, particularly with the federal election set for September.
Inflation is a red flag for many Germans whose families suffered from depreciation of money and mass unemployment in the 1920s. Coupled with the ECB's zero interest rates, inflation is also undermining already meager returns from savings accounts.
""It's high time for the ECB to move away from its ultra-loose monetary policy,"" Bavarian Finance Minister Markus Soeder told Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung (FAZ) newspaper.
With overall savings of 5 trillion euros ($5.28 trillion)and interest rates at zero, an inflation of two percent means German savers are basically losing 100 billion euros per year, he added. 
Consumer prices, harmonized to compare with other European countries, rose by 2.2 percent on the year after an increase of 1.9 percent in January, the Federal Statistics Office said.
That was the highest annual inflation rate since August 2012 and came in slightly stronger than a Reuters consensus forecast of 2.1 percent. The ECB targets a rate of below but close to 2 percent for the 19-member euro zone as a whole.
Rising energy prices and higher food costs were the main drivers behind the overall increase in Germany, a breakdown of the non-harmonized data showed.
""That's not just a flash in the pan. Inflation will remain this high in the coming months,"" Postbank chief economist Marco Bargel said, adding that core inflation would also pick up due to Germany's continued upswing and its robust labor market.
German unemployment fell more than expected in February and the jobless rate remained unchanged at its lowest level since reunification in 1990, separate data from the Federal Labour Office showed on Wednesday.
STRENGTH
The strong economy enables companies to pass on higher costs - such as increased import prices - to customers, pushing up overall inflation.
This trend was also reflected in a survey among purchasing managers, also released on Wednesday. It showed output prices charged by manufacturers rose at the fastest pace since 2011.
The goods-producing sector expanded at its strongest rate in nearly six years in February, suggesting factories will push up overall growth at the start of 2017.
""The rising inflation in Germany supports the notion that preparations should start for an exit from the expansive monetary policy in Europe,"" Ifo institute head Clemens Fuest told FAZ newspaper.
""If these figures are confirmed for the euro zone as a whole, the ECB should reduce its bond purchases by 10 billion euros a month from April"", Fuest suggested.
But other leading economists jumped to the defense of the ECB, saying it was too early for the central bank to reverse course.
""Calls from Germany on the ECB to change its monetary policy are mistaken and premature,"" the head of the DIW economic research institute Marcel Fratzscher said.
The inflation rate for the entire euro zone is expected to rise to 2.0 percent in February from 1.8 percent in January, economists polled by Reuters said. Those figures are due on Thursday.
The ECB has slashed interest rates and adopted a bond-buying program worth 2.3 trillion euros to pump money into the region's economy. It has rejected German calls to scale back its stimulus, arguing that core inflation is still too weak.
A sustained rebound in German inflation would give Bundesbank President and ECB rate-setter Jens Weidmann more grounds to argue for a reduction in the ECB's bond-buying program, a scheme that he has often criticized.
The German central bank has warned that homes in large German cities are 15 to 30 percent overpriced, stoking fears about the side-effects of the ECB's stimulus.
The German economy grew by 1.9 percent last year, driven by strong private consumption, increased state spending and higher construction investment, and it is expected to carry its growth momentum through into 2017.
Markit economist Trevor Balchin said he expected Germany's quarterly growth rate to accelerate to at least 0.6 percent in the first three months of 2017 from 0.4 percent in the final three months of 2016.

The Institute for Supply Management (ISM) said its index of manufacturing activity rose to 57.7 last month from January’s reading of 56.0.
Analysts had forecast no change.
A reading above 50.0 indicates expansion in the manufacturing sector, below indicates contraction.
The ISM indicated that the survey suggested that the overall economy had grown for the 93rd consecutive month.

(Reuters) - Euro zone manufacturing growth accelerated to a six-year high in February as a weaker euro helped drive strong demand for its exports, with inflationary pressure showing further signs of recovering, a business survey showed.
While the upturn in euro zone factory activity was not shared by all major economies, particularly France, prices rose faster across most countries in the region.
The IHS Markit euro zone manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index rose to 55.4 in February -- the highest reading since April 2011 -- from 55.2 in January, although it inched down from a flash estimate of 55.5.
That reading is well above the 50 mark denoting growth and suggests a solid pickup in activity. Optimism among euro zone manufacturers about future business is also surging.
An index measuring output, which feeds into a composite PMI due out on Friday, jumped to 57.3, which was also the highest in nearly six years. The flash composite PMI suggested economic growth of 0.6 percent in the first quarter.
Separate data showed German unemployment fell more than expected in February, with the jobless rate holding at 5.9 percent, the lowest since German reunification in 1990.
""Certainly if you look at euro zone manufacturing, it is the highest for quite some time, clearly suggesting the economy is gaining is little more traction compared to where we have been over the course of recent months,"" said Peter Dixon, economist at Commerzbank (DE:CBKG).
""The other thing I would say is the strength of the sentiment indicator in recent months has probably outstripped the actual strength of the economy. So there are lots of positives -- but we have to be a little bit cautious.""
WEAKER EURO HELPS
Renewed optimism about the region's economic outlook in recent weeks has been buoyed by a weak euro, which makes the currency bloc's exports relatively cheap on world markets.
The latest PMI survey's new export orders sub-index rose to its highest since April 2011 at 55.5, up from 55.2 in January. 
""Euro area manufacturers are reporting the strongest production and order book growth for almost six years, in what's looking like an increasingly robust upturn,"" said Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit.
""This year has seen firms more optimistic about the future than at any time since the region's debt crisis. Companies are reporting stronger demand in both home and export markets, with the weakened euro providing an accompanying tailwind to help drive sales.""
The euro  is predicted to weaken a further 3 percent against the dollar over the coming year, according to a recent Reuters poll of foreign exchange analysts. [EUR/POLL] 
Brisker exports and the fastest growth in prices charged in nearly six years will be welcome news for the European Central Bank, which is widely expected to remain on the sidelines through upcoming elections in key countries in the region.
In Britain, manufacturing activity eased more than expected in February but still showed relatively solid expansion.
It remains far from clear whether the latest upswing in euro zone activity will last, however.
Possible upsets in those elections, in the Netherlands, France and Germany, along with a rise in protectionism worldwide, pose the biggest risks to the euro zone economy, according to a recent Reuters poll of economists. [ECILT/EU]
""You've got political risks which is clearly the one thing which should dominate the European economic agenda,"" said Dixon. 
But purchasing managers do not seem worried yet. 

""Given the current buoyant demand environment, manufacturers are eschewing political uncertainty and quietly getting on with growing their businesses,"" added IHS's Williamson.

On the index, a reading above 50.0 indicates industry expansion, below indicates contraction.
Companies indicated that growth of new business from the domestic market slowed, but noted that this was partly offset by a sharp acceleration in the rate of increase in new export business.
Supply-chain disruption alongside the cost impact of the weak sterling exchange rate led to a further sharp rise in purchase prices. Input cost inflation eased from January’s record high, but remained among the fastest seen during the survey history.

HONG KONG (Reuters) - Asian factories extended a global manufacturing revival as activity picked up steam in February, though the outlook for many of the region's export-reliant economies remained uncertain in the wake of U.S. President Donald Trump's protectionist stance.
Manufacturing surveys for Asia, including for its two biggest economies China and Japan, showed a broadly positive impulse for exports in a welcome sign for many of the companies tapped into the global supply chain. 
""Encouragingly, the data indicated that the current upturn in demand remains broad-based across both domestic and international markets, while a further steep increase in purchasing activity raises the prospect of continued production growth in coming months,"" said Annabel Fiddes, economist at IHS Markit, referring to Taiwan's strong PMI reading.
Trump, however, remained the great unknown risk factor for Asia and the rest of the world. 
In a key speech to Congress, the U.S. president outlined his plan for his first year in office that included healthcare and tax reforms, but he did not announce anything new on trade.
Trump's protectionist stance has rattled global markets, with policymakers and investors remaining on edge until they see more clarity, and specific details, on U.S. economic policies.
Authorities in China, whom Trump last week labeled the ""champions of currency manipulation"", can take comfort from a private survey showing factory activity expanded for an eighth consecutive month thanks to a pick up in export orders.
Zhou Hao, an economist at Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) expects ""bubble deflating"" will remain a key theme at the upcoming National Congress, underscoring challenges for policymakers in China as an explosive rise in debt in recent years has stoked speculative asset bubbles. 
That explains why Beijing plans to slightly lower its target for broad money supply growth to 12 percent, as authorities adopts a modest tightening bias in a bid to cool strong credit growth. It raised interest rates on a key funding tool in January. 
FED FACTOR
India also benefited from a rebound in global demand with activity expanding for a second month, not entirely surprising given data a day earlier showed annual growth expanded 7 percent, though the strong number raised scepticism among economists on the quality of the figures.
Of greater concern was the rate of increase in output prices, as a sub-index measuring costs paid by customers grew at its fastest pace in nearly three and a half years in a sign of rising inflationary pressures. 
The encouraging factory activity in Asia should also be squared off against rising interest rates in the United States, where any tempering in activity could prove detrimental to some of the region's globe-trotting manufacturers.
A handful of Federal Reserve policymakers on Tuesday jolted markets into higher expectations for a March U.S. interest rate increase, with comments that suggested rate-setters were worried about waiting too long in the face of pending economic stimulus from Washington.
Similar surveys later in the day are expected to show solid growth in manufacturing in Europe and the United States.
China's exports, which have lagged its regional counterparts in recent months, showed signs of a pickup with the Caixin PMI sub-index for new export orders rising to 53.8, the highest rate of growth since September 2014. 
That bounce in new orders was echoed in South Korea where exports grew at their fastest pace in five years supported by a pickup in global demand and from China.
The trade ministry said exports to China, South Korea's biggest customer, rose for a fourth straight month while semiconductor exports posted their best monthly performance on record, riding on a months-long rally in electronics.
""February data shows that there is a clear export resurgence, as exports in terms of both price and volume seem to be increasing,"" said Lee Sang-jae, an economist for Eugene Investment & Securities in Seoul.
In Japan, the picture was mixed, even as a pick up in manufacturing activity at its fastest pace in three years was accompanied by strong export orders. Question marks remain about domestic demand, and shipments to the U.S., which have failed to show strong growth in the past year.
Indeed, January exports growth slowed and data on Tuesday showed factory output unexpectedly fell for the first time in six months in Japan while headline PMI figures out of China showed signs of slowing.
In Australia, investors had a lot to cheer as data showed the economy rebounded sharply last quarter thanks to a boom in commodity exports, extending the resource rich nation's 25-year streak of uninterrupted expansion.
An uptick in momentum in China, Australia's major export market, is another reason for the Reserve Bank of Australia to hold off on more rate cuts this year. 
""Looking ahead, with domestic monetary policy set to remain loose and global growth likely to pick up a bit this year, we expect a gradual recovery in Asian manufacturing ahead,"" said Krystal Tan, Asia economist at Capital Economics.

BEIJING (Reuters) - China's factory activity expanded faster than expected in February as domestic and export demand picked up, adding to signs that the global economy is regaining momentum even as fears grow of a surge in trade protectionism.
Growth in both output and orders accelerated last month, according to official and private factory surveys on Wednesday, giving the government more room to focus on tackling financial risks to the economy as debt continues to rise.

Zhou said it was ""very likely"" that China's central bank would raise short-term interest rates by a another 10 basis points in March -- which would mark the third such move in as many months -- as authorities grow more confident that the economy is on steadier footing.
Facing growing risks from explosive growth in debt, China's central bank has cautiously shifted its stance in recent months to a tightening bias after years of super-loose policy to stave off the risk of a hard landing for the world's second-largest economy.
Policy sources have told Reuters that China's leaders will accept a lower economic growth target of around 6.5 percent in 2017, and target a less aggressive expansion of money supply, as the focus slowly shifts from growth to pushing reforms to contain debt and housing risks.
China's industrial sector has benefited from a construction boom since the middle of last year that has spurred demand and prices for building materials from cement to steel, boosting sales and profits.
The official Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) released on Wednesday rose to a three-month high of 51.6 in February, compared with the previous month's 51.3, and above the 50-point mark that separates growth from contraction on a monthly basis.
Analysts had expected a reading of 51.1.
Output rose at a faster pace of 53.7, compared to 53.1 in January, while overall new order growth also picked up.
A private survey which focuses more on small and mid-sized firms offered similarly encouraging findings.
The Caixin/Markit Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' index (PMI) rose to 51.7, up from 51.0 in January and beating analysts' forecasts of 50.8.
New export orders grew at the fastest pace since September 2014.
While the industrial sector continued to shed jobs in February, the pace eased to its slowest since March 2013.
Inflationary pressures also continued to rise sharply thanks largely to higher prices for building materials such as steel reinforcing bars and copper pipes, but producers were able to pass some of the increased input costs on to consumers.
For now, China's consumer inflation remains well within the central bank's comfort zone, but expectations of upward pressure could keep the central bank on a gradual tightening path.
POLICY DILEMMA?
Stronger readings on export orders would build on China's better-than-expected trade numbers in January, but worries of a rise in U.S. trade protectionism are clouding the longer-term outlook for Asia's exporters.
Still, China's domestic demand appears solid for now, and is becoming more broad-based.
A separate reading on the services sector showed growth remained robust in February, though the pace of expansion has been slowing modestly for four consecutive months.
The official non-manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) stood at 54.2 in February, down from 54.6 in January, and well above the 50-point mark.
Capital Economics said persistently softer service sector activity may suggest domestic demand growth has peaked, increasing the risk of a reversal in the central bank's new tightening bias and a return to stimulus if authorities fear economic growth is faltering.
""We think that domestic demand growth in China, which appears to have plateaued recently, will slow in the coming quarters as a tighter monetary and fiscal stance continues to weigh on credit growth and infrastructure investment,"" Julian Evans-Pritchard, Singapore-based China economist for the consultancy, said in a research note.
New construction orders - a major economic growth driver last year - expanded at a slower pace in February, possibly in response to government measures to cool red-hot property prices. But construction activity still remained robust overall.
""Construction businesses remain optimistic about the outlook for their industry, indicating that the government’s tightening measures have had limited impact on developers’ sentiment so far,"" economists at ANZ said in a note.
""For the first time in the past few years, we see an upside risk to (China's) growth. A strong infrastructure pipeline and better-than-expected exports bode well for the near term economic outlook,"" ANZ said, saying they would not be surprised if Beijing now decides to maintain its annual growth target of 6.5-7.0 percent.
The growth target and other policy priorities are expected to be agreed at the annual session of China's parliament starting this weekend.
Improving business conditions in China are giving a welcome boost to its Asian neighbors, which have seen their economic growth flag in recent years as China slowed.
South Korea said on Wednesday that its exports grew at the fastest pace in five years in February, with shipments to China surging 28.7 percent on-year, the best growth since late 2010.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. economy expanded at a slower pace in the fourth quarter, as previously reported, and appeared to remain on a moderate growth path as President Donald Trump took office with a promise to reinvigorate manufacturing and protect jobs.
Trump has pledged to boost annual economic growth to 4 percent through a mix of infrastructure spending, sweeping tax cuts and deregulation. He is expected to outline part of his program in a speech to Congress on Tuesday night.
Gross domestic product rose at a 1.9 percent annual rate in the fourth quarter, the Commerce Department said in its second estimate, as downward revisions to business and government investment offset robust consumer spending. 
The estimate matched what was published last month. Output increased at a 3.5 percent rate in the third quarter.
The economy grew 1.6 percent for all of 2016, its worstperformance since 2011, after expanding 2.6 percent in 2015.
""The overall size and composition of the Trump economic stimulus is yet unknown. However, it is likely to contribute to further economic strength for the balance of this year and beyond,"" said Sung Won Sohn, an economics professor at California State University Channel Islands in Camarillo.
Trump, who made his 4 percent GDP growth pledge during last year's election campaign, has promised a ""phenomenal"" tax plan that the White House said would include tax cuts for businesses and individuals. 
Details on the proposal remain vague, though Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said on Sunday that Trump would use his speech to Congress to preview some aspects of his tax reform plans.
Economists polled by Reuters had expected fourth-quarter GDP would be revised up to a 2.1 percent rate on Tuesday.
In another report, the Commerce Department said the goods trade deficit jumped 7.6 percent to $69.2 billion in January. Inventories at wholesalers fell 0.1 percent last month, while stocks at retailers increased 0.8 percent.
However, retail inventories excluding automobiles, which go into the GDP calculation, were unchanged after increasing 0.3 percent in December. Economists said the wider goods deficit and weak inventories posed a downside risk to first-quarter GDP growth estimates, which are currently around a 2 percent rate.
""It now looks like trade will subtract over a half point from growth in the first quarter and inventories will be close to a neutral factor,"" said Daniel Silver, an economist at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) in New York.
The trade deficit sliced off 1.70 percentage points from GDP growth in the fourth quarter, while inventories contributed 0.94 percentage point.
Expectations of moderate growth in the first quarter suggest the Federal Reserve is likely to maintain its gradual pace of interest rate increases.
U.S. government bond prices were trading higher on Tuesday, while the dollar (DXY) fell against a basket of currencies. U.S. stocks were trading lower. 
STRONG DOMESTIC DEMAND
Consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirdsof U.S. economic activity, was revised sharply higher to a 3.0 percent rate of growth in the fourth quarter. It was previously reported to have risen at a 2.5 percent rate. That left private domestic demand increasing at a brisk 3.0 percent rate.
Some of the rise in demand was met with imports, which subtracted from GDP growth. There is scope for consumer spending to rise further against the backdrop of a tightening labor market and surging confidence among households.
In a third report on Tuesday, the Conference Board said its consumer confidence index jumped 3.2 percent to 114.8, the highest reading since July 2001. Consumers remained upbeat about the labor market amid expectations of income gains. 
Business investment was not as strong as initially thought in the fourth quarter. Spending on equipment increased at a 1.9 percent rate instead of the previously estimated 3.1 percent pace. Business investment contributed 0.17 percentage point to GDP growth, less than the 0.30 percentage reported last month.
Business spending has been partly hobbled by lower oil prices, which have crimped demand for machinery, but an acceleration is likely. 
A fourth report on Tuesday from the Institute for Supply Management-Chicago showed its business index surged 7.1 points to a reading of 57.4 in February, the strongest level since January 2015. Companies in the Chicago area reported robust new order growth and production. 
The ISM-Chicago report mirrored other regional surveys that have offered an upbeat assessment of the manufacturing sector, which had been stuck in a rut for more than a year. 
The improvement has mostly been driven by rising oil prices, which have translated into a strong rebound in investment on mining exploration, wells and shafts. Spending on mining exploration, wells and shafts rose at a 23.6 percent rate in the fourth quarter after declining at a 30.0 percent pace in the prior period.
The increase in residential construction spending was lowered to a 9.6 percent rate from the 10.2 percent pace reported last month. A fifth report on Tuesday showed house prices surged 5.6 percent in December from a year ago after advancing 5.2 percent in November. 
House prices are being driven by a shortage of properties for sale. 

Government spending increased at a 0.4 percent rate in the fourth quarter, rather than the previously reported 1.2 percent pace of growth. There was no contribution to growth from government investment in the last quarter.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India's economy defied expectations on Tuesday to retain the title of the world's fastest-growing major economy, despite the pain caused by Prime Minister Narendra Modi's shock cash crackdown.
Gross domestic product (GDP)  growth slowed to an annual 7.0 percent in October-December from 7.4 percent the previous quarter. Analysts polled by Reuters had expected a 6.4 percent growth rate.
India's growth was higher than China's 6.8 percent for the last three months of 2016.
The federal statistics office retained its growth forecast for the fiscal year ending in March 2017 at 7.1 percent.
The figures surprised economists, who had expected the economy to take a bigger hit from Modi's decision last November to outlaw old 500 rupee and 1,000 rupee banknotes, taking out 86 percent of the currency in circulation virtually overnight.
""Perhaps this data is not capturing the impact of demonetization,"" said Aneesh Srivastava, chief investment officer, IDBI Federal Life Insurance Co.
""I am totally surprised and stunned to see this number ... I believe that, with a lag, we will see an impact on GDP numbers.""

The data also backs the central bank's assessment, which all along maintained the economic disruption caused by Modi's shock monetary therapy as a transitory phenomenon.

228,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 27, 2017 11:00PM ET</span>",Australia's economy to extend growth run as exports boom,"By Wayne Cole
SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia's economy is expected to have returned to growth last quarter as exports boomed and consumers and the government spent more, extending the resource rich nation's remarkable 25-year run of uninterrupted expansion.
Figures on gross domestic product (GDP) due on Wednesday are forecast to show growth of 0.7 percent in the fourth quarter, bouncing from a shock 0.5 percent contraction in the third.
That would mark 102 quarters without recession, a single quarter short of the world record held by the Netherlands.
""Australia looks to have steered clear of a technical recession and, more importantly, it is clear that activity levels have continued to improve in the past couple of months,"" said Savanth Sebastian, a senior economist at CommSec.
Annual growth might only be a tepid 1.9 percent, with the economy barely expanding over the second half of the year. Yet the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) is counting on a pick up to around 3 percent this year and next, thanks in part to surging resource exports and notably liquefied natural gas.
Higher prices for key exports including iron ore and coal had already delivered Australia's smallest current account deficit in 15 years at just A$3.9 billion ($2.99 billion).
Figures from the Australian Bureau of Statistics out on Tuesday showed the balance of goods and services improved by more than A$8 billion to reach a surplus of A$4.7 billion.
Miners also managed to ship more product in the quarter adding 0.2 percentage point to real economic growth. Government spending on infrastructure added another 0.3 percent.
DODGING A DOWNGRADE
Scott Haslem, an economist at UBS reckons that, with prices for iron ore holding strong, Australia could actually record its first current account surplus since 1975 in this quarter.
That should lessen the risk of the country losing its triple A credit rating given S&P Global Ratings cited a reliance on foreign funding as one reason it might downgrade.
""The extent and duration of the spike of commodity prices, and subsequent material improvement of Australia's trade and external position, was largely unexpected,"" said Haslem.
He noted that when S&P warned about the rating, it had forecast a current account deficit of around 4 percent of GDP this year. Now it was more likely to be 1 percent.
The flood of cash from exports was also a big boost to measures of national income and nominal growth.
The impact on incomes was highlighted in data out Monday showing company profits in Australia surged 20 percent in the fourth quarter, led by a near-50 percent jump for miners.
Andrew Hanlan, a senior economist at Westpac, estimates GDP in current dollars soared 2.7 percent in the quarter and lifted the annual pace to a five-year high of 5.5 percent.
That would be a boon for the conservative government of Malcolm Turnbull since it is nominal growth that drives tax revenues and it needs all the money it can get to plug a persistent budget deficit.

229,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 27, 2017 10:15PM ET</span>",Japan factory output unexpectedly falls as exports of cars to U.S. slow,"By Tetsushi Kajimoto
TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's industrial output unexpectedly fell in January for the first time in six months, pressured by a slowdown in shipments of cars to the United States in a sign of an economy grappling for a more sure-footed recovery.
While Asian exports, including Japanese sales, have started to recover from late last year, the jury is still out on whether the uptick is sustainable in the wake of rising protectionism in the United States.
Data by the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry on Tuesday showed industrial output fell 0.8 percent in January, versus a median market forecast for a 0.3 percent increase and a revised 0.7 percent gain the previous month.
It was the sharpest month-on-month decline since May 2016, and the outlook allowed for little cheer as manufacturers surveyed by the ministry tipped output to rise 3.5 percent in February and then decrease by a bigger 5.0 percent rate in March.
""Factory output will probably slow down this quarter as a reaction to solid production in October-December,"" said Hidenobu Tokuda, senior economist at Mizuho Research Institute.
""Still, output is likely to remain in a moderate pickup backed by IT-related demand for smart phones in China and economic recovery in the United States and Europe as well as resource-exporting countries and emerging markets, although uncertainty remains over the outlook on U.S. economic policies.""
Separate data by the ministry showed Japanese retail sales rose 1.0 percent in January on-year, versus expectations for a 0.9 percent gain.
That was the third straight month of annual gains, indicating a gradual pickup in consumer spending.
TRUMP UNCERTAINTY
Japan's economy grew an annualized 1.0 percent in October-December, slowing from 1.4 percent in the third quarter.
Faced with a slow recovery and tepid consumer prices, the Bank of Japan revamped its policy framework in September last year to one better suited for a long-term battle with deflation, after three years of aggressive asset purchases failed to accelerate inflation to 2 percent.
The ministry maintained its assessment on industrial output, saying production was picking up. 
But that view had to be squared off by evidence showing momentum in the world's third-largest economy remained soft, underscoring a fragile recovery and an uncertain outlook. 
The worry for Japan - and policy makers globally - is the uncertainty over the economic policies of U.S. President Donald Trump, whose repeated pledges to pull back from free trade have raised concerns that protectionism will spread.
The ministry said factories curbed production due in part to a slowdown in shipments of cars to the United States, where Trump has ratcheted up his criticism of major nations, including Japan, for stealing U.S. jobs.
Last month, Trump took aim at Toyota Motor Corp (T:7203), warning the world's largest automaker that it would face a ""big border tax"" if it exported Mexico-built cars to the U.S. market. 

Data this month showed Japan's exports to the U.S. fell 6.6 percent in January from a year ago, extending a largely weak trend for shipments to the world's largest economy seen through much 2016.

230,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 27, 2017 12:32PM ET</span>",U.S. core capital goods orders fall; manufacturing recovery intact,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - New orders for key U.S.-made capital goods unexpectedly fell in January after three straight months of strong gains, but did little to change views that manufacturing was recovering from a prolonged downturn amid rising commodity prices.
Last month's drop is likely to be temporary as business confidence has surged in recent months on promises by the Trump administration to cut corporate taxes and ease regulations. In addition domestic demand is firming.
""We remain cautiously optimistic as there are limitations to what the president can do, but even minimal improvement from an otherwise declining trend established over the past near-decade is a large step in the right direction,"" said Lindsey Piegza, chief economist at Stifel Fixed Income in Chicago.
The Commerce Department said on Monday that non-defense capital goods orders excluding aircraft, a closely watched proxy for business spending plans, dropped 0.4 percent after an upwardly revised 1.1 percent increase in December.
These so-called core capital goods were previously reported to have gained 0.7 percent in December. There were declines in orders for primary metals and electrical equipment, appliances and components, as well as computers and electronic products. Orders for machinery and fabricated metal products rose.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast core capital goods rising 0.5 percent last month. A separate report on Monday showed contracts to purchase previously owned homes fell to a one-year low in January amid a dearth of properties for sale. 
This suggests that home resales could decline in February after hitting a 10-year high in January. Prices for U.S. government bonds were trading lower, while stocks on Wall Street rose to record highs. The dollar slipped against a basket of currencies.
The recent surge in business confidence spilled over into investment on capital goods. January's drop in core capital goods orders likely reflects caution among businesses as they await details of the proposed stimulus.
TAX DETAILS AWAITED
President Donald Trump has promised a ""phenomenal"" tax plan that the White House said would include tax cuts for businesses and individuals. Details on the plan remain vague, though Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said last week that he wanted the tax relief enacted by August. Trump told state governors on Monday that he would talk about his plans for infrastructure spending in a speech to Congress on Tuesday.
""It seems like expectations for fiscal stimulus are beginning to ease a little bit,"" said Ryan Sweet, senior economist at Moody's Analytics in West Chester, Pennsylvania. 
""It's not about the size of the fiscal stimulus but the timing of when we get the corporate tax reforms, personal income tax cuts and infrastructure spending. It's very unclear when these polices are going to get enacted.""
Business investment picked up in the fourth quarter, with spending on equipment increasing at a 3.1 percent rate after four straight quarterly declines.
Manufacturing, which accounts for about 12 percent of the U.S. economy, was in a slump for more than a year as a collapse in oil prices undercut demand for machinery. A strong dollar, however, remains a challenge for manufacturers as it makes their goods less competitive on overseas markets.
Shipments of core capital goods fell 0.6 percent last month after jumping 1.6 percent in December. Core capital goods shipments are used to calculate equipment spending in the government's gross domestic product measurement. 
A 6.0 percent surge in demand for transportation equipment buoyed overall orders for durable goods, items ranging from toasters to aircraft that are meant to last three years or more, which leapt 1.8 percent last month. Durable goods orders decreased 0.8 percent in December.
Last month's surged reflected a 69.9 percent jump in civilian aircraft orders. The surge came even as Boeing (NYSE:BA) reported on its website that it had received orders for only 26 aircraft last month. Economists believe not all of the 290 aircraft ordered in December were reflected in the durable goods orders report for that month. 
Orders for defense aircraft soared 59.9 percent. Pointing to continued manufacturing recovery, unfilled orders of core capital goods - a proxy for production in the pipeline - increased 0.5 percent, a seventh consecutive monthly advance.

""There is some kind of core strength in manufacturing output, that's what the continuing gains in unfilled orders show,"" said Anthony Karydakis, chief economic strategist at Miller Tabak in New York.

The NAR said its pending home sales index, based on contracts signed last month, fell 2.8 percent to 106.4. The pending home sales index for December was revised up to 109.5.
Analysts polled by Reuters had forecast a 0.9 percent increase in January. The index last month, however, was still 0.4 percent higher than in January 2016.
Buyers are easily outnumbering sellers in several metro areas, NAR chief economist Lawrence Yun said in a statement.
""Most notably in the West, it's not uncommon to see a home come off the market within a month,"" Yun said.
Across the nation's four regions, contracts in January increased 2.3 percent in the North and edged up 0.4 percent in the South. That contrasted with declines of 9.8 percent in the West and 5.0 percent in the Midwest.

In a report, the National Association of Realtors (NAR) said its pending home sales index decreased by a seasonally adjusted 2.8% last month, disappointing expectations for an increase of 0.8%.
The pending home sales index decreased to 106.4 in January from the prior 109.5 (initially 109.0).
December’s reading was revised to a 0.8% gain, compared to the initial reading of a 1.6% increase.
Year-on-year, pending home sales increased at an annualized rate of 0.4% in January.
“Insufficient supply levels led to a lull in contract activity in the Midwest and West, which dragged down pending home sales in January to their lowest level in a year,” NAR explained in the report.
“The significant shortage of listings last month along with deteriorating affordability as the result of higher home prices and mortgage rates kept many would-be buyers at bay,” NAR chief economist Larry Yun said.
According to Yun, interest in buying a home is the highest it has been since the Great Recession.
“Households are feeling more confident about their financial situation, job growth is strong in most of the country and the stock market has seen record gains in recent months,” he said.
“Sales got off to a fantastic start in January, but last month's retreat in contract signings indicates that activity will likely be choppy in coming months as buyers compete for the meager number of listings in their price range,” Yun concluded.

237,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 27, 2017 08:18AM ET</span>",Euro zone banks cut cross-border lending as stability fears grow,"By Francesco Canepa
FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Euro zone banks have cut lending to their peers in other members of the currency bloc over the past year, European Central Bank (ECB) data showed on Monday, as questions mounted about the health of some lenders and the very future of the euro. 
Loans between banks and to the rest of the economy have been growing in a slow but steady fashion for the past 1-1/2 years but this picture belies increasing fragmentation along national borders.
The retrenching makes euro zone countries more vulnerable to domestic downturns and contradicts the ECB's objective to create a banking union in which credit flows wherever it is needed. 
Triggered by the 2008 financial crisis, banks' retreat to their home turf had paused in 2014-15 as markets calmed, largely thanks to ECB intervention.
But it resumed last year amid increasing tensions in countries such as Italy, where a handful of banks including the third-largest, Monte dei Paschi (MI:BMPS), failed to raise capital and may need state help.
""We haven’t had consolidation in the banking sector and a cleaning up of issues that banks have to deal with,"" Martin Goetz, a professor at the University of Frankfurt, said.
""Banks are more problematic as credit risk and as a result other banks are lowering their credit exposure to them.""
Cross-border loans between euro zone banks were down 6 percent year on year to 1.26 trillion euros in January 2017, having hit the lowest level since 2004 one month earlier, the ECB data showed. They had surpassed 2 trillion euros in 2008. 
Loans between banks in the same country rose 11 percent in the year to January to 4.6 trillion euros, according to Reuters calculations on ECB data. 
Banks in Germany, France and Luxembourg, where cash is at its most abundant, have all cut their cross-border lending over the past year, the data showed.
The ECB does not provide break-up figures of where the cross border loans are directed.
Fears about countries falling out of the currency union were also likely to play a role in banks' decision.

Ralph Hamers, chief executive of ING (AS:INGA), told the Financial Times earlier this year that the Dutch bank was seeking to match more closely its loans and deposits in each European country.

238,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 27, 2017 05:10AM ET</span>",Euro zone sentiment edges higher in Feb as expected,"BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Euro zone economic sentiment inched up in February as expected thanks to more optimism in industry and the services sector, despite weaker readings among consumers and in the retail and construction business, European Commission data showed.
The Commission's monthly sentiment survey showed the overall index rising to 108.0 points in February from 107.9 in January, well above the long-term average of 100.0.
A separate business confidence indicator, which points to the phase of the business cycle, rose to 0.82 points in February from 0.76 in January, the highest since June 2011 and well above market expectations of a 0.79 reading.
The improvement in economic sentiment was driven mainly by more optimism in industry, with the index rising there to 1.3 point from 0.8 in January, and in the services sector where it rose to 13.8 from 12.8.

Sentiment in the retail sector, in construction and among consumers deteriorated.

240,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 26, 2017 10:12PM ET</span>",China's factories seen posting seventh month of modest growth in Feb,"BEIJING (Reuters) - Activity in China's manufacturing sector likely grew modestly for the seventh month in a row in February as resources prices extended a rapid rally and on signs of improving global demand for Chinese exports, a Reuters poll showed.
Signs of sustained solid growth could give authorities more confidence to act as they cautiously move to contain risks from a mountain of debt which has built up after years of debt-fueled stimulus.
The official manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI)probably edged down to 51.1 in February from January's 51.3, but remained well within positive territory, according to a median forecast of 33 economists in the Reuters poll.
A reading below 50 indicates a contraction in activity, while a reading above indicates an expansion on a monthly basis.
The central bank raised key short-term interest rates in late January and early February, in a further sign of policy tightening as the economy shows signs of steadying.
While the rate increases were modest, they reinforced views that Chinese authorities are intent on both containing capital outflows and reining in risks to the financial system. 
But signs that momentum may be slowing means policymakers will likely tread carefully with any tightening as they balance increased oversight of risky activity with maintaining strong growth.
China's top leaders said last week that the country must maintain economic stability to ensure a successful party congress, a key meeting later this year where President Xi Jinping will look to cement his grip on power.
But analysts warned the official factory and services sector readings on Wednesday could be distorted by the timing of the long Lunar New Year holidays, which started on Jan. 27. Many factories and offices close for a week or more.
Readings on price trends will be closely watched for clues on whether inflation pressures are growing, after consumer prices and producer prices both rose more than expected in January.
A sustained pick-up in inflation could bolster expectations of further tightening by the People's Bank of China (PBOC), though consumer prices so far remain well within the central bank's comfort zone.
China's iron ore and steel prices hit multi-year highs last week, underpinned by expectations that strong infrastructure spending would continue to spur demand for building materials.
Investors will also be looking for signs of further growth in export orders. Shipments rose more than expected in January following a dismal performance in 2016, but worries of a rise in U.S. trade protectionism are clouding the outlook longer-term.
The official PMI number will be released on March 1, along with the official services PMI.
The private Caixin/Markit PMI survey will also be published on March 1.
Analysts expect the Caixin PMI, which focuses more on small and mid-sized firms, to come in at 50.8, down slightly from December's reading of 51.0.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - New U.S. single-family home sales rose less than expected in January, likely held back by heavy rains and flooding in California, but continued to point to a strengthening housing market despite higher prices and mortgage rates.
Other data on Friday showed a dip in consumer sentiment this month, though it remained at a level consistent with a healthy pace of consumer spending. The economy has gained momentum, supported by a labor market that is near full employment.
""It is clear that the economy is moving forward solidly. Consumers are confident and are buying homes, but builders are not getting their share of that demand,"" said Joel Naroff, chief economist at Naroff Economic Advisors in Holland, Pennsylvania. 
The Commerce Department said new home sales increased 3.7 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 555,000 units last month. Economists had forecast single-family home sales, which account for about 9 percent of overall home sales, surging 6.3 percent to a 570,000-unit rate. 
New home sales, which are derived from building permits, are volatile on a month-to-month basis and subject to large revisions. Sales were up 5.5 percent compared to January 2016.
Last month, homes sales soared 15.8 percent in the Northeast to their highest level since January 2008. They rose 14.8 percent in the Midwest and advanced 4.3 percent in the South. Sales in the West, which has been hit by extremely rainy weather, fell 4.4 percent.
""The unusually wet winter may have held back sales in January, but sales are still trending higher on a three-month moving average basis,"" said Mark Vitner, a senior economist at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) Securities in Charlotte, North Carolina.
Data this week showed sales of previously owned homes jumped 3.3 percent to a 10-year high in January. House prices increased 6.2 percent in December from a year ago.
'SUPPLY-SIDE CHALLENGES' 
In a separate report on Friday, the University of Michigan said its consumer sentiment index fell to a reading of 96.3 this month from 98.5 in January. The index had surged in the prior three months after Donald Trump's presidential election victory.
""With the focus shifting from campaign promises and philosophical goals, consumers may be acknowledging the difficult task ahead for the Trump administration to actually advance his agenda,"" said Jim Baird, chief investment officer at Plante Moran Financial Advisors in Kalamazoo, Michigan.
The University of Michigan said February's consumer sentiment reading suggested a 2.7 percent annualized growth pace in consumer spending this year. 
U.S. stocks were trading lower on Friday, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) on track to snap a 10-day record-setting winning streak. The PHLX housing index (HGX) fell marginally. U.S. government bond prices rose, while the dollar (DXY) dipped against a basket of currencies.
The housing market has firmed even as the 30-year fixed mortgage rate rose above 4.0 percent, outpacing annual wage growth that has been stuck below 3 percent. The tightening job market is driving the gains in housing.
While the healthy labor market has not unleashed a stronger pace of wage growth, it has improved employment opportunities for young Americans, encouraging them to form their own households. But a shortage of properties available for sale remains an obstacle to a robust housing market.
""Mortgage rates aren't to blame. A big part of the problem is the supply-side challenges builders are facing, like regulatory burdens, labor shortages and a lack of capital and financing options,"" said Jonathan Smoke, an economist at realtor.com in Atlanta.
The inventory of new homes on the market increased 3.5 percent to 265,000 units last month, the highest level since July 2009. New housing stock remains less than half of what it was at its peak during the housing boom in 2006. 

At January's sales pace it would take 5.7 months to clear the supply of houses on the market, which was unchanged from December. A six-month supply is viewed as a healthy balance between supply and demand. The median price for a new home increased 7.5 percent to $312,900 in January from a year ago.

Gross domestic product probably shrank 0.4 percent in the fourth quarter from the third after seasonal adjustments, according to the median forecast of 16 economists. Brazil's GDP contracted 0.8 percent in the third quarter.
Brazil's economy is expected to have contracted 3.5 percent in 2016, after a decline of 3.8 percent in 2015. Brazil has never experienced such a long and deep period of recession, at least since records began more than a century ago.
The recession has left nearly 13 million people unemployed and caused a record number of bankruptcy filings. It also contributed to the ousting of former President Dilma Rousseff last year and to the low approval ratings of her successor, President Michel Temer.
The fourth-quarter GDP numbers will be released on March 7.
Leading indicators have suggested the economy is finally emerging out of recession in the first quarter of 2017, Finance Minister Henrique Meirelles told Reuters earlier this week. The central bank has been cutting interest rates at a rapid pace as inflation falls, which is expected to help boost growth.
The recovery, however, is expected to be very slow. The median expectation of economists in a weekly central bank survey projected a GDP expansion of 0.5 percent in 2017.
Although this recession has been the deepest in Brazil's history, it has not been as dramatic as other crises in the country's turbulent economic past. Previous downturns were often marked by debt crises, capital flights, hyperinflation and mass migration, none of which happened during the current recession. 

Brazil's economy probably shrank 2.2 percent in the fourth quarter from a year before, according to the poll.

Edmunds estimated that February U.S. sales would be 1.33 million vehicles, for a seasonally adjusted annualized rate of 17.6 million. That sales rate is close to the 2016 full-year sales of 17.55 million vehicles, as reported by Autodata Corp.
Sales are expected to be 17 percent higher on a volume basis from January, which had sales of 1.14 million vehicles.
General Motors Co's (N:GM) sales are seen rising 5.7 percent, while Ford Motor Co's (N:F) are expected to decline by 3.4 percent, Edmunds said.
Automakers in the U.S. market report February sales on March 1.
GM was the only automaker among the top eight companies by sales in the U.S. market expected to report improved sales from last February, Edmunds said.
GM's stronger sales are because of more generous incentives, said Jessica Caldwell, executive director for industry analysis at Edmunds. Discounts are especially strong for Chevrolet Silverado pickup trucks, Caldwell said. The Silverado is GM's highest-volume model.

Edmunds said  Fiat  Chrysler Automobiles (N:FCAU) (MI:FCHA) sales will fall 9.5 percent, and that Toyota Motor Corp (T:7203) new vehicle sales in February will drop 4.4 percent.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits rose slightly last week but the four-week average of such claims, considered a better gauge, fell to a 43-1/2-year low in a sign of a strengthening labor market.
Other data on Thursday showed house prices increasing solidly in December amid strong demand for housing even as mortgage rates rose. The reports highlighted strength in the economy that could allow the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates in the near-term.
""All indications are that job creation remains solid, underscoring the resiliency of the nearly eight-year economic recovery,"" said Jim Baird, chief investment officer at Plante Moran Financial Advisors in Kalamazoo, Michigan. ""A March (rate) hike cannot be ruled out.""
Initial claims for state unemployment benefits increased 6,000 to a seasonally adjusted 244,000 for the week ended Feb. 18, the Labor Department said. It was the 103rd straight week that claims remained below 300,000, a threshold associated with a healthy labor market. 
That is the longest stretch since 1970, when the labor market was much smaller. The labor market is at or close to full employment, with the unemployment rate at 4.8 percent.
Economists had forecast new claims for unemployment benefits rising to 241,000 in the latest week. The four-week moving average of claims, considered a better measure of labor market trends as it irons out week-to-week volatility, fell 4,000 to 241,000 last week, the lowest reading since July 1973.
The economy could get a boost from a tax reform being mulled by the Trump administration. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said on Thursday he wanted to see ""very significant"" tax reform passed before Congress' August recess. Mnuchin, however, said the government was still studying the merits of a proposed border tax system. 
Hopes of tax cuts have boosted business and consumer confidence in recent months. The dollar was trading lower against a basket of currencies, hitting a two-week low versus the yen. Stocks on Wall Street slipped, while prices for U.S. government debt rose.
Minutes of the Federal Reserve's Jan 31-Feb 1 monetary policy meeting published on Wednesday showed that many policymakers believed another interest rate hike might be appropriate ""fairly soon"" if labor market and inflation data meet or beat expectations.
The U.S. central bank raised its benchmark overnight interest rate last December. It has forecast three rate increases this year.
TIGHT LABOR MARKET
Last week's claims report covered the survey period for the Labor Department's nonfarm payrolls data for February. The four-week average of claims fell 6,500 between the January and February payrolls survey weeks. This suggests another month of strong job gains after payrolls increased 227,000 in January.
""The message of this report remains that layoffs rates are extremely subdued,"" said John Ryding, chief economist at RDQ Economics in New York. ""We view subdued layoffs as a sign of labor market tightness with employers retaining the labor they have amid elevated job openings and a lack of available workers.""
The tightening labor market is helping to underpin demand for housing. In a report on Thursday, the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) said its house price index rose a seasonally adjusted 6.2 percent in December from a year ago.
That followed a 6.1 percent gain in November. The FHFA's index is calculated by using purchase prices of houses financed with mortgages sold to or guaranteed by mortgage finance companies Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. 
The higher home prices largely reflect tight housing inventories against the backdrop of strong demand.
This is despite the 30-year fixed mortgage rate rising more than 50 basis points since November to above 4.0 percent. But with the home price increases outpacing wage growth, economists expect demand for housing to slow this year.

""While appreciation has remained strong lately, we look for some moderation in price increases over time along with some broader cooling in the housing data,"" said Daniel Silver, an economist at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) in New York.

Analysts had expected continuing claims to decrease to only 2.068 million.
The four-week moving average was 241,000, a drop of 4,000 from the previous week's revised reading of 245,000 (initially 245,250). That was the lowest level for this average since July 21, 1973 when it was 239,500.

BERLIN (Reuters) - Germany posted a record budget surplus last year helped by rising tax revenues and employment and low debt costs, creating conditions for solid economic growth in 2017 underpinned by higher state and household spending.
The German state has been running a surplus for three years, with the gap rising to 23.7 billion euros ($25 billion) in 2016, the highest since the country reunified in 1990, Federal Statistics Office data showed on Thursday.
That has created a huge fiscal buffer at a time when authorities are working to house and integrate hundreds of thousands of immigrants, and separate Statistics Office data showed higher state spending was a factor in boosting economic growth to 1.9 percent last year.
Under Germany's budget law, the federal government's surplus of 7.7 billion euros will go into a fund for refugee-related expenditure.
The economic growth rate for 2016 was the strongest in half a decade, and the Finance Ministry said it expected spending by households and public authorities to drive gross domestic product growth again this year - consolidating a shift away from the export activity that traditionally powered Europe's biggest economy.
As well as supporting economic growth, the arrival of more than a million migrants - most fleeing war and poverty in Africa and the Middle East - in Germany last year has polarized the country's political landscape ahead of federal elections due in September.
Thursday's Statistics Office data, which confirmed preliminary GDP readings, also pegged fourth quarter growth at 0.4 percent, showing foreign trade as a net negative.
The government expects growth to slow to a still robust 1.4 percent in 2017.
""The German economy is on a solid growth path,"" the finance ministry said in its monthly report, also released on Thursday, adding that indicators signaled a continuation of the economic upswing in 2017.
""Consumption will probably remain an important driver of economic growth,"" the ministry said, pointing to job creation, pay hikes, low interest rates and moderate, albeit rising energy prices.
The ministry's report supported readings in Wednesday's Ifo index, which showed German business morale rose in February, boosting hopes for a robust start to 2017 despite worries about U.S. trade policies and the outcome of elections in France due in April and May.
TAX AND SPEND
Germany's economic upturn is also pushing up tax income.
In January, revenues of the federal government and the 16 regional states rose 4.0 percent on the year, the finance ministry said. That is proportionally above the projected rise of 2.9 percent for the whole year.
The buoyant tax revenue has enabled Chancellor Angela Merkel's government to raise state spending on roads, faster internet and refugees without taking on new debt.
It also means Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble can stick to his cherished but internationally criticized goal of running a balanced budget as the government gears up for what promises to be a tightly contested election.
But a continuation of Germany's consumption-led upswing is by no means guaranteed.
Suggesting it might weaken, a survey showed on Thursday that the mood among German consumers worsened more than expected heading into March to reach its lowest level in four months.
The survey by the Nuremberg-based GfK institute cited rising inflation and economic risks linked to the policies of U.S. President Donald Trump as the main factors for the dip.
Its consumer sentiment indicator, based on a survey of around 2,000 Germans, fell to 10.0 going into March. A Reuters poll had expected a fall to 10.1 from 10.2 a month earlier.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australian business investment has fallen for the fourth straight quarter as miners continue to cut back, but other sectors narrowly upgraded their spending plans for the year in tentative signs of recovery.
Thursday's figures from the Australian Bureau of Statistics showed investment slipped 2.1 percent in the fourth quarter to A$27.6 billion ($21.18 billion), when analysts had looked for a fall of only 1 percent.
The decline was entirely driven by the mining sector where spending fell over 9 percent, even as new investment in manufacturing climbed 3.1 percent.
Importantly, spending on equipment, plant and machinery did edge up in the fourth quarter which adds to expectations economic growth bounced after a shock contraction in the previous quarter.
Figures due next week are generally expected to show the economy grew around 0.6 percent to 0.7 percent last quarter.
While economists are convinced that Australia has dodged its first recession in 25 years, the data are yet to show a meaningful recovery in the non-mining economy.
Indeed, spending plans for 2017/18 came in at A$80.6 billion, the lowest in a decade and under the A$84 billion many analysts had looked for.
Again all the weakness was in mining with investment in other parts of the economy unable to offset the plunge.
""That shows the momentum is still down. That's not what you want. What you want to see is a rise in those estimates,"" said Shane Oliver, chief economist at AMP Capital.
""I think it keeps alive the prospect for another rate cut although the RBA has set a very high hurdle for taking rates lower.""
After cutting rates to a record low of 1.5 percent last year, the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) has been on hold in the expectation that growth in the A$1.6 trillion economy will accelerate to around 3 percent.
Just this week, RBA Governor Philip Lowe argued the drag from mining was almost over and cutting rates again would only serve to inflate a debt-driven bubble in the housing market.
Businesses, however, do not seem keen to co-operate.
""Even though the mining capex drag is fading away, the recovery in non-mining is really tepid at this point,"" said Ben Jarman, an economist at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM).
""We are seeing global business sentiment surveys rally quite a bit but it doesn't appear like Australian firms are following suit with their capex plans at the moment.""

SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea's central bank kept interest rates unchanged for an eighth straight month on Thursday, opting for stability as it monitors uncertainties ranging from an unpredictable North Korea to global policy challenges and a political scandal at home.
The Bank of Korea's monetary policy committee held its base rate <KROCRT=ECI> steady at 1.25 percent, a media official said without elaborating. Governor Lee Ju-yeol is due to hold a news conference from 11:20 a.m. (0220 GMT).
All 20 analysts surveyed in a Reuters poll before the decision forecast the Bank of Korea would leave the base rate unchanged on Thursday.
""The BOK is likely training its focus outside the country, as policy in the United States is still fluid while there are upcoming elections in Europe,"" said Kim Ji-na, a fixed-income analyst at IBK Securities.
""At this point it looks like the BOK will keep rates unchanged all year.""
The central bank was widely expected to stand pat in the wake of North Korea's ballistic missile launch earlier this month.
Concerns over possibly heightening trade protectionism under President Donald Trump are also a factor for the BOK to observe closely as South Korean exports have begun to recover.
More long-term, the Bank of Korea has been eyeing steadily snowballing household debt. Data earlier this week showed the debt soared last quarter at its fastest annual pace in more than a decade.
The BOK is also waiting for the Constitutional Court to decide in coming weeks whether it will uphold parliament's vote to impeach President Park Geun-hye over an influence-peddling scandal.
Park is accused of acting with her long-time friend, Choi Soon-sil, to pressure big businesses including Samsung (KS:005930) Group to donate to two foundations set up to back the president's policy initiatives. Park is also accused of allowing Choi to exert inappropriate influence over state affairs.
Both women have denied wrongdoing.

If Park is impeached, a presidential election will be automatically triggered within 60 days by constitutional law. This could mean many policy changes, including economic measures, and the central bank is unlikely to change policy amid such uncertainty.

The business advisory group said its survey also found that almost six in ten British consumers are concerned about their lack of disposable income.
Last week, official data showed British shoppers unexpectedly cut back on spending in January after last year's Brexit vote pushed up inflation - the strongest sign to date the UK economy is heading for a slowdown.
Consumers were barely fazed last year by June's decision to leave the European Union. But they are turning more cautious with prices rising quickly in response to the post-referendum slump in the value of the pound and higher oil prices.
PwC's survey of more than 1,000 UK shoppers found that price was still the most important factor for determining customer loyalty, with 59 percent of respondents saying they returned to a retailer because prices were good.
Other important reasons were trust in the brand (43 percent)and items being in stock (37 percent).

The report also highlighted an increasing reliance on Amazon (O:AMZN), with 91 percent of UK shoppers using the internet retailer.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. home resales surged to a 10-year high in January as buyers shrugged off higher prices and mortgage rates, signaling rising confidence in the economy and bolstering expectations of a pickup in growth in the first quarter.
The National Association of Realtors' report on Wednesday came as the labor market nears full employment and investors wait for the Trump administration to act on its promises to cut taxes, increase infrastructure spending and reduce regulations.
""Existing home sales continue to shine and this bodes well for consumer spending which helps the economy go. Team Trump is trying to boost economic growth and today's existing home sales will make the job a little easier,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG Union Bank in New York.
Existing home sales jumped 3.3 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.69 million units last month, the highest level since February 2007, the NAR said. 
Economists had forecast sales rising only 1.1 percent to a pace of 5.54 million units in January. Home resales were up 3.8 percent from January 2016. 
Though the nation's housing inventory increased from December, it remained near a record low. As a result, the median house price vaulted 7.1 percent from a year ago to $228,900 in January. That was the biggest increase since January 2016. 
Demand for housing is being underpinned by a strengthening labor market, which is improving employment opportunities for young adults and, in turn, boosting household formation.
That helped homebuilder Toll Brothers Inc to report on Wednesday higher-than-expected profit and revenue for the first quarter and to raise its deliveries forecast for the year. 
But a persistent shortage of properties available for sale, which is lifting house prices, remains an obstacle to a robust housing market. That is likely to put pressure on homebuilders to ramp up construction.
While the 30-year fixed mortgage rate appears to be stabilizing after rising rapidly in recent months, it still remains above 4 percent. In contrast, annual wage growth is running below 3 percent. 
A separate report from the Mortgage Bankers Association on Wednesday showed a 2.8 percent drop in applications for loans to purchase homes last week.
The PHLX housing index was trading higher as shares in the nation's largest homebuilder, D.R. Horton, gained 0.12 percent. Shares in  Lennar  Corp (NYSE:LEN) rose 0.14 percent and Pultegroup climbed 0.41 percent.
The overall U.S. stock market was largely unchanged, while the dollar was slightly stronger against a basket of currencies. Prices for U.S. government bonds edged lower.
INVENTORY TIGHT
Last month, the number of homes on the market rose 2.4 percent to 1.69 million units, still remaining close to an all-time low of 1.65 million units in December. Housing inventory was down 7.1 percent from a year ago. It has declined for 20 straight months on a year-on-year basis. 
Economists say homebuilders are struggling to plug the inventory gap because of difficulties securing funding as well as shortages of land and labor. The NAR estimates housing starts and completions should be in a range of 1.5 million to 1.6 million units to alleviate the chronic shortage. 
Housing starts are running above a rate of 1.2 million units and completions around a pace of 1 million units. 
""Inventories of unsold homes remained near a record low ... which is liable to be a bigger problem for sales during the ramp-up into the key spring selling season than it is in the middle of the winter, when sales are at their seasonal low point,"" said Ted Wieseman, an economist at  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) in New York.
At January's sales pace, it would take 3.6 months to clear the stock of houses on the market, unchanged from December. A six-month supply is viewed as a healthy balance between supply and demand. 
With fewer homes available for sale, house prices maintained their ascent last month, recording their 59th consecutive month of year-on-year gains. The higher prices are increasing equity for homeowners and might encourage some to put their homes on the market, but could sideline first-time buyers from the market. First-time buyers accounted for 33 percent of transactions last month, well below the 40 percent share that economists and realtors say is needed for a robust housing market. That was up from 32 percent in December and a year ago.

""We have concerns that continued supply constraints in the housing market will allow outsized house price gains again in 2017, especially hurting potential first-time homebuyers,"" said David Berson, chief economist at Nationwide in Columbus, Ohio.

The share of requests from homeowners to refinance a mortgage fell to 46.2 percent in the week ended Feb. 17. This compared with 46.9 percent in the previous week and was their smallest share since November 2008, the Washington-based industry group said. 
The MBA's seasonally adjusted index on refinancing activity dipped 1 percent to 1,227.6, its weakest level in six weeks. A year ago, it stood at 2,267.4.
Refinancing applications declined with a pickup in mortgage rates as U.S. Treasury yields rose last week following Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen's testimony before Congress, where she hinted chances of a rate hike at an upcoming policy meeting.
Interest rates on 30-year, fixed-rate conforming mortgages, the most widely held type of U.S. home loan, averaged 4.36 percent, up from 4.32 percent the prior week. It was up about half a percentage point from a year earlier.
Conforming loans are those with balances of $424,100 or less and qualify for guarantees from federal mortgage agencies Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.
Mortgage rates on other types of home loans that the MBA tracks were broadly higher from the prior week.
Higher borrowing costs also reduced applications on home purchases.
The MBA's seasonally adjusted gauge on purchase application activity, a proxy for future home sales, fell 2.8 percent to 216.9 in the latest week, which was the lowest since November. A year ago, it was 217.9.

The group's barometer on overall mortgage activity on a seasonally adjusted basis decreased 2.0 percent to 371.5 in the latest week and was down from 521.5 a year earlier.

January's price increase was the fastest since last January (8.1%) and marks the 59th consecutive month of year-over-year gains, the report added.
""Existing-home sales stepped out to a fast start in 2017, surpassing a recent cyclical high and increasing in January to the fastest pace in almost a decade,"" the report said.

287,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 22, 2017 08:44AM ET</span>",UK economy picks up in late 2016 but signs of Brexit hit appear,"By Andy Bruce and William Schomberg
LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's economy sped up at the end of 2016, data showed, but over the whole year it was weaker than previously thought and there were signs that the Brexit vote will increasingly act as a brake on growth in 2017.
The pound fell after Wednesday's Office for National Statistics (ONS) figures, which no longer showed Britain was the fastest-growing major advanced economy last year.
Gross domestic product rose by 0.7 percent in the fourth quarter, faster than the preliminary reading of 0.6 percent thanks to manufacturing and the strongest growth since the fourth quarter of 2015.
The figures are likely to reinforce finance minister Philip Hammond's view that there is no case right now to borrow more to help the economy when he announces his annual budget on March 8.
But he will keep a close eye on warning signs in Wednesday's data.
Business investment fell and slowing household spending growth raised questions about the outlook for 2017. 
The ONS also trimmed its estimate for 2016 growth to 1.8 percent from 2.0 percent, due to businesses stockpiling fewer goods and materials in early 2016.
That pushed Britain's economic growth rate slightly below Germany's 1.9 percent.
Separate ONS data showed Britain's dominant services sector expanded in December at the slowest pace in seven months.
Angus Armstrong, director of macroeconomics at the National Institute of Economic and Social Research, said the familiar pattern of consumers driving the economy was likely to fade. 
""The UK economy needs another driver if it is not to have a significant slowdown in 2017,"" he said. ""The pattern of strong consumer spending and weaker business investment can only be a limited one.""
Business investment fell 1.0 percent in the fourth quarter compared with the July-September period. Investment by companies was 0.9 percent lower compared with the fourth quarter of 2015.
Firms are expected to rein in their investment plans as Britain negotiates its departure from the EU, a process that Prime Minister Theresa May is due to kick off in coming weeks.
The outlook for wages is key for spending by households who have driven Britain's economy since the Brexit vote. Wednesday's data showed compensation of employees edged up by 0.1 percent in the fourth quarter, the weakest rise in more than three years.
BREXIT SQUEEZE
The ONS said household spending increased 0.7 percent on the quarter, slowing from 0.9 percent in the third quarter and marking the weakest growth in a year.
Bank of England deputy governor Minouche Shafik said after the data that the central bank still expected overall economic growth this year of 2.0 percent, much stronger than most economists polled by Reuters expect.
But the bank also predicts a growing squeeze on consumers as inflation rises due to the pound's fall since June's vote to leave the European Union.
There are signs this has started. Data last week showed retail sales fell in each of the three months to January.
The BoE this month signaled that it is in no hurry to raise interest rates with so much Brexit-related uncertainty ahead.

The central bank expects the economy to grow at a slower pace in subsequent years than if Britain had voted to stay in the EU.

BERLIN (Reuters) - German business morale brightened unexpectedly in February as managers' assessment of their business situation reached its highest level in more than five years, supporting expectations that Europe's biggest economy got a robust start in 2017.
The figures, published by the Ifo institute on Wednesday, were another sign that growth in the euro zone is picking up despite increased political risks, such as France's coming election and uncertainty about the trade policies of U.S. President Donald Trump.
""It seems the protectionist plans of Trump can't unsettle companies in the long term,"" Bankhaus Lampe economist Alexander Krueger said, adding that the Ifo index pointed to strong economic growth in the first quarter.
The Munich-based Ifo institute said its business climate index, based on a monthly survey of some 7,000 companies, rose to 111.0 from an upwardly revised reading of 109.9 in January. That beat the Reuters consensus forecast for a dip to 109.6.
That assessment of the current business situation reached its highest level since August 2011. Companies also expressed greater optimism about the months ahead.
Neither Trump's policies nor Britain's planned departure from the European Union was hurting the German economy or the mood in corporate boardrooms, Ifo economist Klaus Wohlrabe said.
""The German economy is in surprisingly strong shape in politically uncertain times,"" he said.
The survey showed morale improved in manufacturing and wholesaling. Construction and retailing managers were less upbeat.
Ifo's figures came after a survey among German purchasing managers showed on Tuesday that private-sector growth picked up in February to its highest level in nearly three years, driven by humming factories.
In addition, reports earlier this month showed German industrial orders posted their biggest monthly increase in around 2 1/2 years, driven mainly by higher demand at home and abroad for goods needed in production.
The German economy grew by 1.9 percent in 2016, the strongest rate in half a decade, driven by soaring private consumption, increased state spending on roads and refugees and rising investment in housing.
For this year, the German government forecasts a weaker growth rate of 1.4 percent because there will be fewer workdays and exports are likely to rise less strongly than imports.

The Bundesbank said in its latest monthly report that the German economy will stay on a strong footing in the coming months thanks to high industrial and construction activity.

On a monthly basis, consumer prices in the 19-country currency bloc went down by 0.8 percent, confirming market expectations.
Stripped of the volatile components of energy and unprocessed food, an indicator closely watched by the European Central Bank, the annual inflation rate in January was 0.9 percent, confirming Eurostat's earlier estimate and the market consensus.

The rise of annual inflation was mostly driven by energy prices which increased by 8.1 percent in January year-on-year, jumping from a 2.6 percent annualized increase in December.

In a report, the Office for National Statistics said  gross domestic product (GDP) expanded by a seasonally adjusted 0.7% in the fourth quarter, surprising economists who had expected it to be unrevised at 0.6%. The U.K.’s economy grew by 0.6% in the preceding quarter.
Year-over-year however, U.K. economic growth grew 2.0% in the three months ended December 31, missing expectations for it to remain unrevised at 2.2%. Britain’s economy had expanded at an annualized rate of 2.2% in the third quarter of 2016.
Meanwhile, business investment unexpectedly fell by a seasonally adjusted 1.0% in the fourth quarter, compared to the consensus forecast for no change. That followed a gain of 0.4% in the preceding quarter.
Year-on-year, business investment fell 0.9% in the October to December period, compared to expectations of a 0.2% increase and the 2.2% decline registered in the third quarter of 2016.
Additionally, the index of services in the U.K. rose 0.8%, in line with expectations and compared to a prior gain of 1.0%.
Industrial output was also stronger than expected, growing by 0.3%, instead of the initially flat reading.
Construction output was also revised up to 0.2%, from 0.1%.
Exports increased 4.1%, compared to expectations for a 2.0% rise and compared to the 2.6% decline registered in the third quarter.
Imports fell 0.4%, compared to forecasts for a 0.3% gain and after a 1.4% increase in the third quarter.
The 0.7% advance in private consumption was in line in with forecasts and also higher than the previous 0.4% gain.
Immediately following the report, the pound weakened. GBP/USD was trading at 1.0505 from around 1.0514 ahead of the release of the data, EUR/GBP was at 0.8440 from 0.8434 earlier and GBP/JPY changed hands at 140.82 compared to the prior 141.06.
Furthermore, European stock markets traded broadly higher. London’s FTSE 100 rose 0.19%, the benchmark Euro Stoxx 50 edged forward 0.09%, France's CAC 40 gained 0.33%, while Germany's DAX traded up 0.25%.

Over the past year, authorities have slapped curbs on China's property sector - a major contributor to the broader economy - as the concentration of price surges in the country's wealthiest cities stoked fears of a nasty crash.
The January data released by the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) suggests regulators are making steady progress in keeping the riskier speculative investors off the property market, with average new home prices in China's 70 major cities up 0.2 percent month-on-month, slowing a touch from December's 0.3 percent rise.
That marked the fourth month of slowing monthly growth, with analysts expecting further falls in the year ahead.
""I think home prices have basically peaked. Considering the yearly growth is still strong, prices are likely to keep falling this year,"" said Zhou Hao, a Singapore-based economist at Commerzbank (DE:CBKG).
Compared with a year ago, home prices still rose 12.2 percent, just off December's 12.4 percent gain.
In China's biggest cities, Shenzhen, Shanghai and Beijing prices rose 18.2 percent, 23.8 percent and 24.7 percent, respectively, from a year earlier, but Shanghai and Shenzhen's monthly pace slowed as local governments' tightening measures knocked demand.
All the same, a more subdued housing market may mean China will be even more reliant on infrastructure spending to boost economic growth.
That may pose challenges as a closer look at China's only shrinking provincial economy reveals increasingly diminishing returns from such a state-driven policy highly reliant on borrowing.
DEBT RISKS
Indeed, China appetite for cheap credit has fed an explosive growth in debt over recent year, prompting a warning from analysts and the likes of the International Monetary Fund of a banking crisis that could ripple across the global economy.
China's debt to GDP ratio rose to 277 percent at the end of 2016, from 254 percent the previous year, UBS analysts said in a recent note.
Moreover, some analysts caution that downward home prices are likely to have a negative impact on producer prices, which is at near six-year highs thanks to record prices in raw materials, affecting firms' ability to service their mounting debt.
Such a scenario could spur a vicious cycle of low property investing feeding into a slowdown in demand across the economy, which grew 6.7 percent in 2016 - the slowest rate in just over a quarter of a century.
The government has been fretting over fast-rising leverage and the risk of asset bubbles in an economy that has recently shifted to a lower gear, prompting a raft of restrictions on purchases and lending in more than 20 cities since October.
Banks in some big cities such as Beijing have started lowering discounts on lending rates for fist-time home buyers since this year, joining recent steps to curb financial risks stemming from loose credit conditions.
That mirrors moves by the People's Bank of China (PBOC) since late January to a tightening policy bias over the coming year as it tries to curb risks from the balooning debt.
Last week, the PBOC singled out corporate debt and property bubble risks in its latest monetary policy implementation report.
Nonetheless, Chinese banks extended 2.03 trillion yuan ($295.74 billion) in net new yuan loans in January, the second-highest monthly tally on record, while the overall financing numbers appeared to indicate a surge in less-regulated shadow banking activity, possibly in response to the central bank's tougher stance.

""China is getting increasingly less bang for its buck as credit flows toward unprofitable projects and unproductive assets such as real estate, which generate little or no return,"" London-based consulting firm Fathom Consulting said in a recent research note.

In a report, market research group Markit said that its flash services purchasing managers’ index (PMI) eased to 53.9 in February, from the prior month’s reading of 55.6 which had been its fastest expansion since November 2015.
Analysts had expected the reading to increase to 55.8.
Services make up approximately 80% of the U.S. economy which makes the data key for interpreting growth.
Markit also said that its flash manufacturing purchasing managers’ index (PMI) fell to 54.3 in February from the prior month’s final reading of 55.0.
Analysts had expected a slight increase to 55.3.
On the indices, a reading above 50.0 indicates expansion, below indicates contraction.
The report indicated that the slowdown was largely due to the services sector while manufacturing activity remained on track to record its fastest quarterly rate of growth in two years.
However, Markit noted that the latest survey showed that business optimism had moderated.
“Measured overall, survey respondents were the least upbeat about the growth outlook since September 2016,” the report said.
“The drop in the flash PMI numbers for February suggest that the post-election upturn has lost some momentum,” Markit chief economist Chris Williamson said.
“Growth of business output, new orders and hiring all waned, as did inflationary pressures,” he noted.
However, Willamson pointed out that, even with the weak numbers, the surveys were consistent with the economy growing at a 2.5% annualized rate in the first quarter.
Following the report, EUR/USD traded at 1.0547 from 1.0533 prior to the release, GBP/USD was at 1.2443 from 1.2416 earlier, while USD/JPY was at 113.45 compared to 113.70 previously.

Feb 21 (Reuters) - Eurozone private sector and manufacturing growth unexpectedly accelerated to near a six-year high in February and job creation reached its fastest since August 2007, propelled by strong demand and optimism about the future, a survey found.
IHS Markit's eurozone flash composite Purchasing Managers' Index, seen as a good overall growth indicator, rose sharply to 56.0, the highest since April 2011, from 54.4 in January, confounding expectations for a slight dip to 54.3.
The broad-based acceleration, which showed France's momentum getting close to Germany's, suggests that if sustained, economic growth could hit 0.6 percent in the first quarter, according to Markit.
That is faster than the 0.4 percent economists predicted in a Reuters poll earlier this month and suggests an economy in rude health before key national elections this year in France, Germany and the Netherlands. [ECILT/EU]
""The increased momentum is due to demand growing at a stronger rate, but also that upturn becoming more broad-based,"" said Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit.
""Importantly, what we now have is France joining the party. It's been a laggard in the region, and a drag on the euro zone upturn for a few years ... and there are finally signs the drag is easing.""
The composite sub-index measuring employment, at 54.3, was the highest in more than nine years.
The renewed strength in the PMIs would also come as a welcome relief to the European Central Bank, widely expected to remain on the sidelines through upcoming national elections in three major economies in the currency bloc.
The euro zone flash manufacturing PMI rose to 55.5 from January's 55.2, the highest since April 2011. New export orders also rose to a near six-year high of 55.5 from January's 55.2, suggesting a weaker currency is helping boost demand.
The services PMI was also buoyant, with the business activity index rising to 55.6 from 53.7, easily beating the Reuters poll expectation of no change at 53.7 and the most optimistic forecast in the survey.

The services sub-index measuring incoming new business, at 55.8, was also the highest in nearly six years.

Market research group Markit said that its Flash Euro Zone Composite Output Index, which measures the combined output of both the manufacturing and service sectors rose from 54.4 in January to 56.0 in February, above forecasts for 54.3. The latest reading was the highest since April 2011.
Growth accelerated in both manufacturing and services to rates not seen since early-2011, with the goods-producing sector again enjoying the faster rate of expansion.
The preliminary euro zone manufacturing purchasing managers’ index inched up to 55.5 this month from a final reading of 55.2 in January. Analysts had expected the index to drop to 55.0 in February.
The flash services purchasing managers’ index climbed to 55.6 this month from 53.7 in January, easily surpassing expectations for a reading of 53.7.
On the index, a reading above 50.0 indicates industry expansion, below indicates contraction.
Job creation was the best seen for nine and a half years, order book growth picked up and business optimism moved higher, all boding well for the recovery to maintain strong momentum in coming months. Inflationary pressures meanwhile continued to intensify.
February also saw the largest overall increase in new business since April 2011.
Commenting on the report, Chris Williamson, Chief Economist at Markit said, “The euro zone economy moved up a gear in February. The rise in the flash PMI to its highest since April 2011 means that GDP growth of 0.6% could be seen in the first quarter if this pace of expansion is sustained into March.""
He added that the ""ECB will be cheered by the signs of stronger growth and further upturn in price pressures, though will no doubt remain concerned that elections and Brexit could disrupt the business environment this year. No change in policy therefore looks likely until at least after the German elections in September.”
EUR/USD was at 1.0563 from around 1.0565 ahead of the release of the data, while EUR/GBP was at 0.8496 from 0.8500 earlier.

The survey by data and information group Nielsen found that 28 percent of Britons named the economy as one of their top two concerns at the end of 2016, up 12 percentage points from a year ago.
That compared with 20 percent of people who named terrorism or immigration in their top two concerns, representing falls of 12 points and 2 points respectively since the end of 2015.
Britain's government is preparing to leave the EU with an approach that prioritizes greater immigration controls over preserving the country's unfettered access to the bloc's single market.
""As the political and economic planning for Brexit gets underway, concerns about jobs leaving the UK have unsettled consumers,"" said Steve Smith, managing director, Nielsen U.K. and Ireland.
Consumers supported the UK economy after the Brexit vote in June last year although data last week showed shoppers unexpectedly cut back on spending in January.
In January, a survey by polling firm ORB showed that greater control of immigration was more important for Britons than free trade with the EU during negotiations.

The online Nielsen study surveyed 504 people.

Consumer prices as measured by the IPCA-15 inflation index probably rose 4.99 percent in the 12 months through mid-February, down nearly 1 percentage point from mid-January, according to the median of 25 estimates.
Prices probably rose 0.50 percent from mid-January, up from an increase of 0.31 percent in the previous month, according to the median of 29 forecasts in the poll. 
The numbers will be released on Wednesday at 9 a.m. (1200 GMT), the same day the central bank is expected to slash interest rates by another 75 basis points to a two-year low of 12.25 percent, according to a separate poll.
Falling inflation and interest rates are expected to help the economy pull through its two-year-long recession. That would bring relief for President Michel Temer, who is working to garner support for austerity measures in Congress.

The central bank's inflation target is 4.5 percent. With consumer prices slowing more rapidly than expected, most economists expect the government to reduce the goal for 2019, according to a Reuters poll last week.

324,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 20, 2017 10:02AM ET</span>","UK factories pick up pace in Feb, but so do price pressures","LONDON (Reuters) - British manufacturers had their best month in two years in February but the post-Brexit vote fall in the value of the pound is making them push up their prices sharply, posing a challenge for 2017, an industry survey showed.
The Confederation for British Industry's monthly reading of the factory sector underscored how the decision to leave the European Union has so far failed to hurt the country's economy, confounding the forecasts of a quick, sharp hit to output. 
The CBI said its total order book balance improved to +8 from +5 in January, well above its long-run average of -15 and better than a median forecast in a Reuters poll of economists for a fall to +3. [ECONGB]
The survey published on Monday added to other signs of a pickup in manufacturing on the back of Britain's strong economic growth in 2016 when British car production hit a 17-year high.
But the CBI's measure of how manufacturers expect to change their prices over the next three months rose further to hit its highest level since April 2011.
""Stronger demand and production is good news for UK manufacturers, though the weaker pound continues to push up input costs,"" CBI chief economist Rain Newton-Smith said. ""This is now feeding through to output price inflation expectations.""
Britain's manufacturing sector accounts for about 10 percent of the country's economy, dwarfed by its services sector. Supporters of Brexit have said the fall in the value of sterling could help rebalance the economy. 
But factories were largely reliant on demand in Britain as more manufacturers reported export sales were below their normal level than above it, despite the weaker pound.
""It remains difficult to see how domestic demand will maintain its momentum when producers push through even bigger price rises,"" Samuel Tombs, an economist with Pantheon Macroeconomics, said. 
""We continue to expect the manufacturing revival to lose considerable pace later this year.""
The launch of Britain's formal divorce talks with the EU in the next few weeks may also hurt investment in the sector, given the uncertain outlook for the country's future ties with the bloc that buys almost half its exports.
Despite the recent pickup for factories, Britain's consumers, were mostly responsible for the economy's resilient response to the Brexit vote. 

However, data published on Friday showed shoppers reined in their spending in January much more sharply than expected, as prices rose following the fall in the value of the pound, suggesting the expected slowdown in the economy this year could happen sooner than many forecasters think.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's exports rose in January at a slower pace than the previous month due to a decline in shipments to the U.S. and the Lunar New Year holidays and as concerns about growing trade protectionism cast doubts over the outlook.
Exports in January rose 1.3 percent from the same period a year ago, less than the median estimate for a 4.7 percent annual increase and slower than a 5.4 percent year-on-year increase in December. It's the second month in a row exports have grown, following 14 straight months of contraction.
Meanwhile, imports into the world's third largest economy posted their first increase since December 2014 as oil prices rose following the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries' agreement last year to cut production.
Stronger economic growth in the United States suggests the decline in Japan's U.S.-bound exports could be temporary, but U.S. President Donald Trump's repeated pledges to pull back from free trade have raised concerns that protectionism will spread.
""The trend for exports remains strong, because global demand is gaining strength,"" said Hiroshi Miyazaki, senior economist at Mitsubishi UFJ  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) Securities.
""If Japanese auto makers continue to take market share in the United States, there will be complaints from the U.S. side. This is a risk, because Japan needs exports for growth.""
The increases in headline export and import numbers were driven in part by stronger trade prices, masking a more mixed picture on volumes, which were weaker among some product classes.
Exports rose in January due to higher shipments of fuel, car parts and steel, but a decline in auto exports contributed to the slower pace of growth, finance ministry data showed on Monday.
Japan's exports to the U.S. fell 6.6 percent in January from a year ago, due to fewer shipments of auto and electronic parts.
Japan's trade surplus with the United States fell an annual 26.6 percent to 399.3 billion yen ($3.54 billion), following a 5.1 annual decline in the previous month.
If the trade surplus with the United States starts rising again, it could become a flashpoint after Trump singled out Japan, China and Germany for their high exports into the U.S. market.
Exports to China, Japan's largest trading partner, rose 3.1 percent year-on-year in January, slower than a 12.4 percent annual increase in the previous month as factories slowed production before the Lunar New Year holidays.
Imports rose 8.5 percent in the year to January, faster than the median estimate for a 4.7 percent annual increase. That marked the first increase in more than two years due to a surge in imports of crude oil from Saudi Arabia and coal from Australia, the data showed.

The trade balance came to a deficit of 1.09 trillion yen, versus the median estimate for a 636.8 billion yen deficit.

337,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 17, 2017 10:00AM ET</span>",Goldman expects U.S. mortgage rates to jump 150 bps by 2019,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) analysts said on Friday they expected U.S. 30-year conventional mortgage rates to rise 150 basis points to about 5.5 percent by 2019, in step with an increase in benchmark Treasury yields and investors demanding higher compensation to own mortgage-backed securities.
Conventional mortgages are home loans guaranteed by federal agencies  Fannie Mae  (PK:FNMA) and  Freddie Mac  (PK:FMCC), which were taken over by the federal government in 2008 during the global credit crisis.
There has been speculation the administration of President Donald Trump may push for mortgage finance reform which includes changing roles for Fannie and Freddie and possibly a phase-out of the two government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs).
In 2013-2014, a number of bills were introduced for reforming the GSEs, including one from Senators Tim Johnson and Mike Crapo. They provide potential templates for future reform, Goldman analysts Marty Young and Alec Phillips wrote in a research note.
""These proposals varied significantly according to the extent to which the government would still play a role in backstopping mortgage debt,"" they said.
Under the Johnson-Crapo proposal named Housing Finance Reform and Taxpayer Protection Act of 2014, Fannie and Freddie would be wound down and replaced by another government agency that insures mortgages and issue MBS with private sector entities taking first 10 percent principal losses for each portfolio of loans.
If mortgage finance reform undergoes the changes similar to the Johnson-Crapo plan, mortgage rates may climb 50 basis points due to higher costs to compensate private sector guarantors for the loans.
""Costs would also need to rise in order to pay the proposed explicit government reinsurance fee, a backstop which today is unpriced,"" Young and Phillips said.
They added any law on housing finance reform will unlikely be enacted before 2018.

Exports likely rose 4.7 percent in January from a year ago, according to the poll of 18 analysts, following 5.4 percent growth in December when shipments rose for the first time in 15 months.
The poll showed imports were also expected to have grown an annual 4.7 percent, which would be the first rise since December 2014. This would result in a trade deficit of 636.8 billion yen ($5.62 billion), the first shortfall in five months.
""The global economy continued its recovery trend thanks to a pickup in emerging economies,"" said Takeshi Minami, chief economist at Norinchukin Research Institute.
""The pace of gains in exports may have slowed due to the timing of Chinese new year holidays but Japan's exports likely maintained its rising trend if we average them out in a few months.""
Shipments of auto parts and electronic parts are expected to have contributed to export growth, while a weak yen and commodity price recovery likely boosted import costs, according to analysts.
In January, the dollar rose to as high as 118.60 yen . It traded around 113.30 yen on Friday. 
The finance ministry will announce the trade data at 8:50 a.m. JST on Monday.
U.S. President Donald Trump had previously lumped Japan with China and Mexico as big contributors to the U.S. trade deficit and spoke against its auto trade as ""unfair"", accusing Tokyo of using monetary policy to devalue its currency to boost exports.
However, more recently, Trump held off criticizing Japan's currency and trade surplus with the U.S. when Prime Minister Shinzo Abe visited the U.S.

The two leaders agreed to establish a bilateral economic dialogue focusing on issues such as economic policies, infrastructure, energy and trade.

Car loans delinquent by 30 days or more grew to $23.27 billion, the most since $23.46 billion in the third quarter of 2008. They were up from $22.98 billion in the prior quarter.
Seriously delinquent auto loans whose payments were 90 days or more past due jumped to $8.24 billion in the fourth quarter, the highest since the third quarter of 2016, according to the survey.
Delinquency is a predictor on possible losses for carmakers, which often make low interest loans to attract buyers. 
Last month, Ford Motor Co's (N:F) finance arm said it expected a pickup in loan losses from historically low levels following a rise in delinquencies and car possessions.
""Credit losses have been at historically low levels for quite some time, and we continue to see credit losses increase 
toward more normal levels,"" Ford Credit said in a presentation of its fourth-quarter results and 2017 outlook.
The increase in late loan payments coincided with drivers loading up on debt to buy the latest car, trunk and SUV models, fueling expectations for record auto sales in 2017.
In the fourth quarter, $142 billion in car loans were generated, giving 2016 the most auto loan originations in the 18-year history of the data, the New York Fed said.
Auto debt hit $1.16 trillion, with a $93 billion rise over the year.
The increase in car loans was part of a broader growth in household debt in the fourth quarter which almost hit an all-time high in the fourth quarter, reaching $12.58 trillion, according to the survey.
Total debt was up $460 billion from a year ago and was just 0.8 percent below an all-time peak of $12.68 trillion in the third quarter of 2008, before the worst of the financial crisis and deep recession, the data showed. 
Some 4.8 percent of all debt was in some stage of delinquency.

Mortgage debt totaled $8.48 trillion at the end of the last quarter, up $231 billion from a year earlier. Student loan debt stood at $1.31 trillion, up $78 billion from a year ago.

Data for the prior week was unrevised. 
Claims have been below 300,000, a threshold associated with a strong labor market, for 102 consecutive weeks.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. homebuilding fell in January as the construction of multi-family housing projects dropped, but upward revisions to the prior month's data and a jump in permits to a one-year high suggested the housing recovery remained on track.
Other reports on Thursday also offered a fairly upbeat assessment of the economy early in the first quarter. Factory activity in the mid-Atlantic region vaulted to a 33-year high in February and the number of new applications for unemployment benefits was less than expected last week.
""There is not much to complain about the economy as housing and manufacturing are improving and the labor market remains tight. The economy is getting stronger,"" said Joel Naroff, chief economist at Naroff Economic Advisors in Holland, Pennsylvania.
Housing starts fell 2.6 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.25 million units last month, the Commerce Department said. The drop in homebuilding also may have resulted from unusually wet weather in California after years of drought.
December's starts were revised up to a rate of 1.28 million units from the previously reported pace of 1.23 million units. Homebuilding was up 10.5 percent compared to January 2016.
Permits for future construction jumped 4.6 percent in January to a rate of 1.29 million units, the highest level since November 2015. Building permits in the South, where most homebuilding occurs, hit their highest level since July 2007.
With overall permits now outpacing starts, homebuilding is likely to rebound in the coming months. Economists had forecast groundbreaking activity slipping to a rate of 1.22 million units last month and building permits rising to a 1.23 million pace.
The PHLX housing index (HGX) fell 0.6 percent. U.S. stocks were trading lower after earlier touching record highs.
Shares in the nation's largest homebuilder, D.R. Horton (N:DHI), were little changed.  Lennar  Corp (N:LEN) fell 0.27 percent and PulteGroup (N:PHM) was down 0.18 percent. Prices of U.S. Treasuries rose while the dollar (DXY) fell against a basket of currencies.
MANUFACTURING RECOVERY
In a separate report, the Philadelphia Federal Reserve Bank said its general activity index jumped to 43.3 this month, the highest reading since January 1984, from 23.6 in February.
Manufacturers in the mid-Atlantic region reported a surge in new orders and shipments. Factories also extended working hours for employees this month. The Philadelphia Fed's data mirrored other regional surveys in suggesting a broad recovery in manufacturing, which was squeezed by the collapse in oil prices and a strong dollar over the past two years. 
""We do expect to see an acceleration in manufacturing output and employment growth this year,"" said Paul Ashworth, chief U.S. economist at Capital Economics in Toronto. ""But ... we don't expect this revival to spill over into much faster GDP growth.""
While manufacturers continued to report paying higher prices for raw materials this month, fewer said they were raising prices for their goods compared to January. That suggests the growing inflation pressures at the factory gate will probably not translate into significant price increases for consumers. 
A government report on Wednesday showed the consumer price index increased 2.5 percent year-on-year in January, the biggest gain since March 2012. Rising inflation, if sustained, could erode households' purchasing power and hurt spending, including home purchases.
The housing recovery is being driven by a strong labor market, which is boosting employment opportunities for young people and supporting household formation. 
In another report on Thursday, the Labor Department said initial claims for state unemployment benefits rose 5,000 to a seasonally adjusted 239,000 for the week ended Feb. 11.
Claims have been below 300,000, a threshold associated with a strong job market, for 102 consecutive weeks. That is the longest stretch since 1970, when the labor market was much smaller. The labor market is at or close to full employment, with the unemployment rate at 4.8 percent. 
Economists had forecast first-time applications for jobless benefits rising to 245,000 in the latest week. While the labor market is expected to continue to underpin the housing market, higher mortgage rates could slow demand for housing. 
January's starts were above the fourth-quarter average, suggesting housing will again contribute to gross domestic product in the first three months of this year.
Homebuilding last month surged 55.4 percent in the Northeast region of the country and jumped 20.0 percent in the South to the highest level since August 2007. Starts fell 41.3 percent in the West to the lowest level since March 2015, likely due to the soggy weather.
Last month, single-family homebuilding, which accounts for the largest share of the residential housing market, climbed 1.9 percent to a pace of 823,000 units. Starts for the volatile multi-family housing segment tumbled 10.2 percent to a rate of 423,000 units. 
Single-family permits slipped 2.7 percent after increasing for five consecutive months. But single-family starts in the South rose to their highest level since August 2007.

Building permits for multi-family units soared 19.8 percent.

The U.S. Department of Labor said the number of individuals filing for initial jobless benefits in the week ending February 11 increased by 5,000 to a seasonally adjusted 239,000 from the previous week’s total of 234,000.
Analysts expected jobless claims to rise by 11,000 to 245,000 last week.
The four-week moving average was 245,250, up 500 from the previous week. The monthly average is seen as a more accurate gauge of labor trends because it reduces volatility in the week-to-week data.
Continuing jobless claims in the week ended February 4 fell to 2.076 million from 2.079 million in the preceding week. Analysts had expected continuing claims to inch down to 2.051 million.

BEIJING (Reuters) - China's non-financial outbound direct investment (ODI) slumped in January and its offshore property purchases plunged after authorities tightened restrictions on capital outflows to support the ailing yuan currency and ease pressure on the country's foreign exchange reserves.
China's non-financial ODI slid 35.7 percent in January to 53.27 billion yuan ($7.77 billion) -- the weakest in 16 months -- compared with the same period a year earlier, the Ministry of Commerce said on Thursday.
Chinese investment in offshore property - which has helped fuel sharp and often contentious home price rises from Vancouver to London - fell by an even sharper 84.3 percent.
Data earlier this month showed China's foreign exchange reserves unexpectedly fell below the closely watched $3 trillion level in January for the first time in nearly six years. But the drop was less than expected, suggesting tighter regulatory controls are making some progress in slowing capital flight.
Following China's moves to close loopholes on money leaving the country and step up checks on the types of overseas investment, ODI in December fell to $8.41 billion, down 39.4 percent on-year and the lowest monthly tally for 2016.
""Risk warnings from regulators and short-term controls have achieved results. Based on their own situation, domestic firms have been more orderly and rational in undertaking overseas direct investment,"" China's State Administration of Foreign Exchange (SAFE) said in a statement to Reuters last week.
Regulators have warned they will pay close attention to ""irrational"" overseas investment in property, entertainment, sports and other sectors.
""Although ODI dropped in January, the overall structure is improving,"" said ministry of commerce spokesman Sun Jiwen.
In addition to the decline in property, investment in culture, sports, and entertainment industries fell 93.3 percent in January.
Showing authorities were indeed being more selective, investment in overseas manufacturing and information technology sectors bucked the trend, rising 79.4 percent and 33.1 percent, respectively. No absolute value figures were released by sector.
The government says it supports legitimate overseas investment, and that policies to support outbound investment will not change, though some officials have expressed concern about the rapid increase in overseas investment last year.
""(Regulators are also paying close attention to) hidden risks in overseas investments. . . Related firms should be prudent,"" the SAFE statement said.
At least three regulators in the last month have strengthened oversight of outbound investment or warned against reckless foreign investment.
Large companies such as Fosun, China's largest private conglomerate, say that new restrictions will not impact their investment plans because they already have sufficient funds overseas.
But several overseas deals by Chinese firms have been canceled or delayed in recent months after being unable to get approval from Chinese regulators.
A Chinese investment group's deal to purchase Italian soccer club AC Milan has been postponed to March 3 after struggling to get approval and funding, and copper-processing firm Anhui Xinke New Materials in December withdrew its bid to buy a controlling stake in a Hollywood studio.
Outbound investment rose to $170.1 billion in 2016, up 44.1 percent from 2015, and a commerce industry spokesman said in December that it was likely to increase again in 2017.
Economists expect more forceful policing of existing regulatory controls after the latest slide in FX reserves, though China's financial system is notoriously porous, with speculators quickly able to find new channels to get funds out of the country.
""I think the impact (of capital controls) is probably limited. It will probably stem outflows for a few months but over the long-term with the Chinese economic fundamentals still poor there is still a great desire for people to try to bring their money out,"" said Chua Han Teng, senior analyst at Fitch's BMI Research in Singapore.
""Therefore in the long term it seems like outflows are likely to persist.""
FOREIGN INVESTMENT IN CHINA ALSO FALLS
Foreign direct investment (FDI) into China also fell in January, dropping 9.2 percent on-year to 80.1 billion yuan ($11.68 billion), the ministry said.
Commerce ministry spokesman Sun Jiwen said the decline in FDI was mainly due to a high base last year and the long Lunar New Year holiday falling earlier this year.
Last year, FDI into China increased 4.1 percent to 813.22 billion yuan, while December FDI rose 5.7 percent to 81.42 billion yuan.

At the same time, fewer homeowners saw their loans go into foreclosure last quarter, sending the level of new foreclosures to its lowest since the fourth quarter of 1988, the Washington-based industry group said.
The latest figures on delinquency and foreclosure rates, which are predictors on defaults, suggested homeowners remain in solid shape to meet their debt obligations, according to MBA.
""It is not unexpected that delinquencies could eventually increase off such a low base. We continue to see strong fundamentals in the overall economy, such as rising home values and increased employment, which bodes well for the future performance of"" various types of mortgages, Marina Walsh, MBA's vice president of industry analysis, said in a statement.
Overall household indebtedness ""have remained within historical norms"" in the third quarter of 2016 despite a recent pickup in delinquencies in subprime auto loans, a Federal Reserve report released on Tuesday showed.
Within the mortgage sector, delinquencies on loans for one-to-four-unit homes on a seasonally adjusted basis increased for the first time since 2013 to 4.80 percent of all home loans outstanding at the end of the fourth quarter.
They were up 28 basis points from the previous quarter when they hit their lowest level since 2006 and were three basis points higher than a year earlier.
Seasonally-adjusted delinquency rates on mortgages insured by the Federal Housing Administration rose to 9.02 percent in the fourth quarter, up from the third-quarter's 8.30 percent which was the lowest since 1997. The fourth-quarter delinquency rate showed no increase on a year-over-year basis. 
Delinquencies on home loans backed by the Department of Veterans Affairs rose to 4.00 percent from the prior quarter's 3.89 percent which was the lowest since 1979. The delinquency rate in the fourth quarter was 12 basis points lower than a year ago.
The share of loans on homes that began foreclosure in the fourth quarter of 2016 was 0.28 percent, down 2 basis points from the previous quarter, and 8 basis points lower than a year ago. This is the lowest rate of new foreclosures started since the fourth quarter of 1988.

New Jersey and New York remained the two U.S. states with the highest percentage of loans in foreclosure at 5.42 percent and 4.28 percent, respectively. But they continued to show improvement from the previous quarter, MBA said.

The Washington-based industry group said its seasonally adjusted measure of loan applications for mortgage refinancing fell 2.9 percent to 1,239.6 in the week ended Feb. 10. This was the lowest level since 1,182.3 in the week ended Jan. 6. 
The refinance share of mortgage activity dropped to 46.9 percent of total applications, its lowest level since June 2009, from 47.9 percent the previous week, MBA said.
On the other hand, loan application activity to buy a home edged up 1.1 percent to 223.9 in the latest week, according to the MBA.
The group's seasonally adjusted gauge on overall mortgage application activity fell 3.7 percent to 379.00, its lowest level since late December.
Mortgage applications have stalled with the spike in interest rates following a bond market selloff across the globe following Donald Trump's surprise U.S. presidential victory in November.
Investors have anticipated that Trump's policies on tax cuts, deregulation and infrastructure spending will spur spending and investments as well as inflation and federal borrowing.
Mortgage rates have retreated from more than two-year peaks in step with lower bond yields.
Interest rates on 30-year, fixed-rate conforming mortgages, the most widely held type of U.S. home loan, averaged 4.32 percent, 3 basis points lower than the previous week.
Conforming loans are those with balances of $424,100 or less and qualify for guarantees from federal mortgage agencies  Fannie Mae  (PK:FNMA) and  Freddie Mac  (PK:FMCC).
Average 15-year mortgage rates were unchanged on the week at 3.55 percent, while five-year adjustable-rate loans fell to 3.34 percent from 3.39 percent. 
Average interest rates on 30-year jumbo mortgages with loan balances greater than $424,100 inched up 1 basis point to 4.28 percent.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. retail sales rose more than expected in January as households bought electronics and a range of other goods, pointing to sustained domestic demand that should bolster economic growth in the first quarter.
The economy's improving prospects were also underscored by other data on Wednesday showing consumer prices last month recording their biggest increase in nearly four years and manufacturing output rising steadily. The reports came a day after Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen appeared to put an interest rate hike next month on the table.
""The U.S. economy has quite a bit of momentum as the year began,"" said Jennifer Lee, a senior economist at BMO Capital Markets in Toronto. ""This morning's reports add a little more impetus for the Fed to move this quarter. Still not our call but it is becoming very interesting.""
The Commerce Department said retail sales increased 0.4 percent last month. December's retail sales were revised up to show a 1.0 percent rise instead of the previously reported 0.6 percent advance. Sales rose despite motor vehicle purchases posting their biggest drop in 10 months. 
Compared to January last year retail sales were up 5.6 percent. Excluding automobiles, gasoline, building materials and food services, retail sales increased 0.4 percent after a similar gain in December. These so-called core retail sales correspond most closely with the consumer spending component of gross domestic product. Economists had forecast retail sales ticking up 0.1 percent and core sales gaining 0.3 percent last month. 
The dollar rose to a one-month high versus a basket of currencies on the data, while prices for U.S. government bonds fell. U.S. stocks were little changed.
January's fairly strong retail sales supported views that economic growth will accelerate in the first quarter. The economy grew at a 1.9 percent annualized rate in the fourth quarter. The Atlanta Fed is currently forecasting the economy growing at a 2.7 percent annualized rate in this quarter.
In a separate report, the Labor Department said its Consumer Price Index jumped 0.6 percent last month, the largest increase since February 2013, after gaining 0.3 percent in December. The surge in the CPI reflected increases in gasoline, apparel and motor vehicle prices among others.
In the 12 months through January, the CPI increased 2.5 percent, the biggest year-on-year gain since March 2012. The CPI rose 2.1 percent in the year to December. Inflation is trending higher as prices for energy goods and other commodities rebound as global demand picks up.
INFLATION CLIMBING 
The so-called core CPI, which strips out food and energy costs, rose 0.3 percent last month after increasing 0.2 percent in December. That lifted the year-on-year core CPI increase to 2.3 percent in January from December's 2.2 percent increase. 
The Fed has a 2 percent inflation target and tracks an inflation measure which is currently at 1.7 percent. Strengthening domestic demand together with firming inflation and a tightening labor market could allow the Fed to raise interest rates at least twice this year.
Yellen told lawmakers on Tuesday that ""waiting too long to remove accommodation would be unwise."" The U.S. central bank has forecast three rate increases this year. The Fed hiked its overnight interest rate last December by 25 basis points to a range of 0.50 percent to 0.75 percent.
A third report from the Fed showed manufacturing production increased 0.2 percent in January after a similar increase in December. Output at mines shot up 2.8 percent, with oil and gas well drilling increasing further.
Retail sales last month were buoyed by a 1.6 percent jump in sales at electronics and appliances stores. That was the biggest rise since June 2015 and followed a 1.1 percent drop in December. Receipts at building material stores increased 0.3 percent.
Sales at clothing stores jumped 1.0 percent, the largest rise in nearly a year. Department store sales climbed 1.2 percent, the biggest increase since December 2015. 
Department store sales have been undercut by online retailers, led by Amazon.com (O:AMZN). That has led to some retailers, including Macy's (N:M), Sears (O:SHLD) and Abercrombie & Fitch (N:ANF) announcing shop closures. 
Sales at online retailers were unchanged last month after soaring 1.9 percent in December. Receipts at restaurants and bars rose 1.4 percent, while sales at sporting goods and hobby stores shot up 1.8 percent. 

Receipts at auto dealerships, however, fell 1.4 percent after vaulting 3.2 percent in December. Last month's drop was the biggest since March 2016. Motor vehicle prices shot up 0.9 percent, the largest rise since November 2009.

The Commerce Department said on Wednesday business inventories increased 0.4 percent. That followed an upwardly revised 0.8 percent jump in November.
Inventories were previously reported to have advanced 0.7 percent in November.
Inventories are a key component of gross domestic product.
Retail inventories edged up 0.1 percent in December instead of being flat as reported in an advance report published last month.
Retail inventories surged 0.9 percent in November.
Retail inventories excluding autos, which go into the calculation of GDP, rose 0.4 percent instead of the previously reported 0.2 percent increase. That followed a 0.5 percent rise in November.
Inventory investment contributed one percentage point to the economy's 1.9 percent annualized growth rate in the fourth quarter. That was the second straight quarterly contribution to GDP growth.
Inventories had been a drag on GDP growth since the second quarter of 2015.
Business sales advanced 2.0 percent in December. That was the biggest increase since March 2011 and followed a 0.3 percent increase in November.
At December's sales pace, it would take 1.35 months for businesses to clear shelves, down from 1.38 months in November.

The U.S. central bank said its overall industrial production index fell 0.3 percent last month after a downwardly revised 0.6 percent gain in December.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast industrial production being flat in January. December's output was originally reported as a 0.8 percent rise. The Fed's measure of the industrial sector comprises manufacturing, mining, and electric and gas utilities.
The bulk of the January decline was due to a 5.7 percent drop in utilities output because of reduced heating demand.
Manufacturing production was up 0.2 percent, matching analysts' forecasts, while mining output rose 2.8 percent.
With overall output declining in January, the percentage of industrial capacity in use fell 0.3 percentage point during the month to 75.3 percent. Manufacturing capacity use rose 0.1 percentage point to 75.1 percent.

The data come as talks for an ambitious EU-U.S. trade deal have been frozen and calls for protectionist measures are growing louder, especially from the U.S. President Donald Trump.
Eurostat said EU exports of goods to the U.S. dropped by 2 percent in 2016 compared to the previous year. Imports from the U.S. also fell by 1 percent.
Although the United States remain by far the main trading partner of the EU, accounting for more than 20 percent of all EU exports and nearly 15 percent of EU imports, last year's drop reversed the trend of expanding trade between the two blocs.
Over the last decade, EU imports from the U.S. fell year-on-year only twice, in 2009 and in 2013, mostly as results of the 2007-09 global financial crisis and the 2010-2012 euro zone debt crisis.
Similarly, EU exports to the U.S. fell in 2013 and between 2007 and 2009.
The drop in 2016 is not linked to an economic crisis, as both blocs are growing steadily, but is part of a wider reduction of global trade.
Last year, overall EU exports to the rest of the world went down 2 percent to 1,745 billion euros while EU imports fell by 1 percent to 1,706 billion euros.
EU exports to China, the bloc's second main trading partner, remained stable, but fell to all other top partners except Japan, where they grew, Eurostat data showed.
Last year, the EU imported more goods from Switzerland, Japan, Turkey and Canada, among its top partners, while its imports from the U.S, China, Russia, Norway, South Korea and India decreased.

385,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 15, 2017 06:05AM ET</span>","UK wage growth slows in late 2016, employment picks up","By William Schomberg and Alistair Smout
LONDON (Reuters) - British workers saw their pay grow more slowly than expected at the end of last year, official data showed on Wednesday, ahead of a likely squeeze on their living standards from higher inflation in 2017. 
At the same time, the employment rate hit a fresh all-time high as the number of people in work rose in the three months to December having fallen in the two previous monthly reports.
Britain's labor market remained strong in 2016 despite the referendum decision in June to leave the European Union.
The unemployment rate in the October-to-December period held at an 11-year low of 4.8 percent, the Office for National Statistics said.
But pay growth remains weak and Wednesday's data showed that, when adjusted for inflation, the rise in earnings was the slowest since the three months to February 2015.
""With prices rising faster, real pay growth is now slowing down,"" Frances O'Grady, the head of Britain's Trades Union Congress umbrella group, said. ""This will be worrying for families whose have still not seen their living standards recover following the financial crisis.""
Sterling dropped to a one-week low after the release. 
The data chimes with the Bank of England's view that despite Britain's strong economic growth, interest rates should remain at their record low level.
British inflation hit its highest level since mid-2014 in January at 1.8 percent and many economists think it will pass 3 percent this year. The BoE believes much of the increase is due to the temporary effect of sterling's fall after the Brexit vote rather than a price-pay spiral. 
FIRST SLOWDOWN IN PAY GROWTH SINCE JULY
The ONS said workers' total earnings including bonuses rose by an annual 2.6 percent, slowing from 2.8 percent in the three months to November. Economists taking part in a Reuters poll had expected wage growth of 2.8 percent.
It was the first time that total pay growth had slowed since the three months to July.
A separate survey showed expectations among households about rising living costs over the next year were the strongest in three years. 
In December alone, the ONS said total wage growth slowed sharply to 1.9 percent, its weakest pace since February, reflecting fewer bonuses paid than in December 2015.
Excluding bonuses, growth in earnings in the fourth quarter also slowed.
The number of unemployment benefit claimants fell by 42,400 to 787,400 in January compared with a revised fall of 20,500 in December. Economists had expected the number of claimants to rise by 800.
ONS officials said the claimant count series was volatile due to the continued roll-out of a new universal credit benefit system.
EU MIGRANT WORKERS FALL
In a possible sign of how the Brexit vote and the subsequent fall in the value of the pound are affecting the attractiveness of Britain as a place to work for migrants, the ONS data showed the first fall in the number of people from other EU countries employed in Britain since the three months to September 2014.
In the last three months of 2016, the number of non-UK EU nationals in employment fell by 19,000, compared with a rise of 12,000 in the same period of the previous year.
The ONS said the figures were not adjusted for seasonal swings but it was the biggest fourth-quarter fall since records began in 1997.
The ONS said the data should be treated with caution and the first overall migration figures to cover the post-referendum period would be published on Feb 23.

Many employers say they are struggling to find suitable candidates to fill their vacancies and are worried that a reduction in foreign workers could aggravate the problem.

Meanwhile, the average earnings index, including bonuses, rose by a seasonally adjusted 2.6% in the three months to December, compared to forecasts for it to increase 2.8% as it did in the prior month.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. producer prices recorded their largest gain in more than four years in January amid increases in the cost of energy products, but a strong dollar continued to keep underlying inflation at the factory gate tame.
Rising raw material costs are boosting producer prices across the globe, notably in China, which is the biggest source of U.S. imports. But economists still expect overall U.S. inflation to keep climbing gradually given the buoyant dollar.
""China saw the biggest price gain since 2011 in January. Given that most of the upward price pressure is the result of raw materials prices returning from the depths of last year, the longer-term view continues to be wary but not alarmed,"" said Jay Morelock, an economist at FTN Financial in New York.
The U.S. Labor Department said on Tuesday its producer price index for final demand jumped 0.6 percent last month, which was the biggest rise since September 2012 and followed a 0.2 percent gain in December. Higher prices for some services also contributed to the increase in January.
Economists had expected the PPI to rise 0.3 percent in January. Despite the surge, the PPI only increased 1.6 percent in the 12 months through January after a similar gain in December. A measure of underlying producer price pressures that excludes food, energy and trade services advanced 0.2 percent after edging up 0.1 percent in December. 
The so-called core PPI rose 1.6 percent in the 12 months through January, slowing from December's 1.7 percent gain. The Federal Reserve has a 2 percent inflation target.
Gradually rising inflation together with a tightening labor market and firming economic growth should position the Fed to continue raising interest rates this year. The U.S. central bank raised rates in December and projected three more hikes in 2017.
Fed Chair Janet Yellen told U.S. lawmakers on Tuesday that waiting too long to raise borrowing costs would be ""unwise.""
The dollar (DXY) was trading higher on Yellen's comments, touching a three-week high against a basket of currencies. U.S. government bond prices fell while stocks on Wall Street were mixed.
DOLLAR STRENGTH
More U.S. manufacturers are reporting paying higher prices for raw materials. The Institute for Supply Management's (ISM) prices index surged in January to its highest level since May 2011. 
Closely correlated to the PPI, the ISM index has advanced for 11 straight months. Those gains largely reflected increases in the prices of commodities such as crude oil, which are rising due to a steadily growing global economy. Oil prices have climbed above $50 per barrel. 
But with the dollar strengthening further against the currencies of the United States' main trading partners and wage growth still moderate, the spillover to consumer inflation from rising commodity prices is likely to be limited.
A government report on Friday showed import prices excluding fuels fell in January for a third straight month. Data on Wednesday is expected to show the consumer price index increased 0.3 percent last month after a similar gain in December, according to a Reuters survey of economists.
""While the trend in inflation remains upward, it is not quickening as fast as today's headline suggests. Inflation is not an immediate issue for the Fed,"" said Sarah House, an economist at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) Securities in New York.
Last month, prices for final demand goods increased 1.0 percent, the largest rise since May 2015. The gain accounted for more than 60 percent of the increase in the PPI. Prices for final demand goods advanced 0.6 percent in December. 
Wholesale food prices were unchanged last month after climbing 0.5 percent in December. Healthcare costs edged up 0.2 percent. Those costs feed into the Fed's preferred inflation measure, the core personal consumption expenditures (PCE) index.
The volatile trade services component, which measures changes in margins received by wholesalers and retailers, shot up 0.9 percent in January after being unchanged in the prior month.

In a report, the Commerce Department said that producer prices increased by a seasonally adjusted 0.6% last month, higher than the forecast for a 0.3% advance that matched December’s gain.
Year-over-year, the producer price index (PPI) rose 1.6% in January, compared to expectations for a gain of 1.5% and following a 1.6% increase in the preceding month.
The core producer price index, that excludes food and energy, advanced by 0.4% in January, higher than forecasts for a gain of 0.2% which was the reading a month earlier.
Core producer prices increased at an annualized rate of 1.2% last month, compared to expectations for an advance of 1.1% and after rising 1.6% in the preceding month.
Core prices are viewed by the Federal Reserve as a better gauge of longer-term inflationary pressure because they exclude the volatile food and energy categories. Furthermore, when producers pay more for goods, they are more likely to pass price increases on to the consumer, so PPI could be considered a leading indicator of inflation.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Optimism about the strength of the euro zone economy took a hit on Tuesday as data showed lower-than-expected growth, possibly caused by weaker global trade as protectionist calls grow louder.
The gross domestic product (GDP) of the 19 countries sharing the euro grew 0.4 percent on the quarter in the last three months of 2016, revised down from an earlier estimate of 0.5 percent.
The new estimates mirrored data released in Germany, the bloc's largest economy, which also grew 0.4 percent on the quarter, below market expectations of a 0.5 percent increase.
Although lower than expected, the German data showed a rebound from a near-stall (0.1 percent) in the previous quarter.
Euro zone growth maintained the same quarterly pace as in the previous quarter. On a year-on-year basis, it slowed to 1.7 percent from the 1.8 percent recorded in the third quarter.
Economists were disappointed by the figures, pointing to the reduced contribution of exports to the euro zone economy.
Available data ""suggest that a positive contribution from domestic demand may have been offset by weak net trade,"" said Jessica Hinds of Capital Economics.
Howard Archer of IHS Markit said: ""It is apparent that growth was very much domestic-demand led – this was certainly true of Germany, France and Italy.""
In economic forecasts released on Monday, the European Commission said risks to growth this year included potential trade disruption under U.S. President Donald Trump, who has argued for more protectionist policies.
The new figures may strengthen the hand of those European Central Bank board members who are reluctant to reverse in the medium term its very accommodating monetary policy, despite a pick-up in prices. Inflation was 1.8 percent in January, nearing the ECB's target of ""below, but close to 2 percent"".
INDUSTRY BRAKES
The euro zone GDP growth revision was partly due to a large drop in industry output in December. It was 1.6 percent lower than in November, the steepest fall in more than four years.
This was mostly due to a 3.3 percent decline in the production of capital goods like machinery, a sign of decreasing appetite for long-term investment.
Output fell also in the energy sector, non-durable consumer goods and intermediate goods.

Production of durable consumer goods, such as cars and refrigerators, was the only component of the indicator that went up. It recorded a 2.9 percent rise, in a sign of managers' confidence that consumers will spend more on durable goods.

401,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 14, 2017 06:17AM ET</span>",Inflation picks up to multi-year highs in China as central bank eyes tighter policy,"By Elias Glenn
BEIJING (Reuters) - China's producer price inflation picked up more than expected in January to near six-year highs as prices of steel and other raw materials extended a torrid rally, adding to views that global manufacturing activity is building momentum.
China consumer inflation also rose more than expected, nearing a three-year high as fuel and food prices jumped, data showed on Tuesday.
Much of the pick up in consumer prices was likely due to higher food and travel costs heading into the long Lunar New Year holiday, the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) said.
But mounting price pressures in China and many other countries have sparked talk of tighter monetary policy this year, after years of super-loose settings aimed at reviving economic growth.
China's central bank raised short-term interest rates in recent weeks as it looks to contain risks from an explosive growth in debt, while India's central bank last week unexpectedly signaled an end to its longest easing cycle since the global financial crisis, citing inflation risks.
Some analysts, however, believe the ramp up in price pressures in China may be short-lived, noting that a jump in January food prices was likely seasonal and that producer price gains slowed by half on a month-on-month basis.
""We don't expect such high rates of inflation to last,"" Capital Economics China economist Julian Evans-Pritchard said in a note.
""Tighter monetary policy, slowing income growth and cooling property prices should keep broader price pressure contained over the medium-term,"" he added, noting that weak prices early last year may have exaggerated the strength of a reflationary trend seen in recent months.
Consumer inflation quickened to 2.5 percent in January from a year earlier, the highest since May 2014.
But it is still well within the government's comfort zone of 3 percent, and is showing few signs yet that the jump in producer prices is filtering through to the broader economy, analysts say.
Analysts polled by Reuters had predicted the consumer price index (CPI) would rise 2.4 percent, after a 2.1 percent gain in December. 
Food prices, the biggest component of CPI, rose 2.7 percent in January, led by a 7.1 percent increase in the price of pork. 
Fuel costs surged 16.5 percent on-year, the biggest increase among CPI components, likely due to a low comparison in the year-ago period when fuel prices fell. 
Capital Economics expects consumer prices to rise only 2.0 percent this year. 
Producer price inflation accelerated to 6.9 percent -- the fastest since August 2011 -- from December's rise of 5.5 percent.
Gains in the producer price index (PPI) were driven by a 31.0 percent increase in mining costs as coal prices rise, the biggest jump in that category since early 2010.
The market had expected producer prices to rise 6.3 percent on an annual basis.
But on a monthly basis, they only rose 0.8 percent, down from December's 1.6 percent gain.
China's massive imports of coal, crude oil, iron ore and industrial materials have helped fuel a sharp rebound in global resources prices in recent months, boosting profits for producers and processors.
Iron ore futures in China rose for a sixth session in a row on Tuesday, hitting their highest in more than three years, while London copper futures have climbed to around 20-month highs.
Price gains in China have been further amplified by government efforts to reduce industrial overcapacity.
Investors are cashing in on the global reflationary trade. Shares of Jiangxi Copper Co Ltd, China's biggest integrated copper producer, have surged over 60 percent in the past year in Shanghai and 85 percent in Hong Kong. 
But heady increases in China's commodity futures market, especially for iron ore, metal reinforcing bars and coking coal used in steel production, have added to policymakers' worries about speculative price bubbles.
Worries about speculation and debt risks led the central bank to move to a tightening bias in recent months, not inflation, analysts say. 
""Inflation is not the main driver of monetary policy at the moment...I do think they are going to tighten more this year, but the main driver is credit risk and concerns of leverage and what's going on in the property market,"" said Capital Economics' Evans-Pritchard. 

Banks in some big Chinese cities have started to reduce discounts on mortgage rates for first-time home buyers, newspapers have reported, joining recent steps to curb financial risks stemming from years of loose credit conditions.

Mannheim-based ZEW said its monthly survey showed its economic sentiment index fell to 10.4 from 16.6 points in the previous month. This undershot the Reuters consensus forecast for a less pronounced drop to 15.0.
A separate gauge measuring investors' assessment of the economy's current conditions edged down to 76.4 points from 77.3 in January. This was also weaker than the Reuters consensus forecast which predicted a nearly stable reading of 77.2.
ZEW President Achim Wambach said the drop in expectations was probably the result of recent weaker-than-expected figures from industrial production, retail sales and exports.
""Political uncertainty regarding Brexit, the future U.S. economic policy as well as the considerable number of upcoming elections in Europe further depresses expectations,"" he said.
""Nevertheless, the economic environment in Germany has not significantly worsened,"" Wambach added.
The German economy grew by 0.4 percent in the fourth quarter and by 1.9 percent in the whole of 2016, data showed on Tuesday, as increased state spending, rising private consumption and construction more than offset a drag from net foreign trade.

406,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 14, 2017 04:40AM ET</span>",UK inflation rises to highest since June 2014 as fuel costs surge,"LONDON, Feb 14 (Reuters) - British consumer prices rose last month at the fastest pace since June 2014, caused by higher global oil prices and the Brexit vote-fueled fall in the value of sterling, official data showed on Tuesday.
Consumer prices rose 1.8 percent compared with a year earlier, the Office for National Statistics said, slightly
below expectations for a 1.9 percent annual rise in a Reuters poll of economists.
The Bank of England forecast earlier this month that inflation will rise above 2.7 percent in around a year's time as Britain's vote to leave the European Union pushes up the cost of imports.
Separate ONS data showed prices paid by factories for fuel and materials rose at an annual rate of 20.5 percent in January, the sharpest rise since September 2008.
The cost of crude oil alone was more than 88 percent higher than a year earlier - the biggest increase since June 2000 - overwhelmingly driven by a global rebound in oil prices.
""The latest rise in CPI was mainly due to rising petrol and diesel prices, along with a significant slowdown in the fall in food prices,"" ONS statistician Mike Prestwood said.
The pound's fall - it is down about 17 percent against the U.S. dollar and 11 percent against the euro since the June 2016 referendum - is starting to hit the spending power of consumers, who have helped the British economy to grow since the vote.
Last week BoE rate-setter Kristin Forbes said she was beginning to become uncomfortable with the central bank's commitment to a neutral policy stance, arguing instead that interest rates could need to rise soon if price pressures continue to build.
Retail price inflation - tracked by British inflation-linked government bonds and many commercial contracts - also rose to its highest since June 2014 at 2.6 percent.
Excluding oil prices and other volatile components such as food, core consumer price inflation held steady at 1.6 percent, confounding economists' expectations for a rise to 1.8 percent.
Data on factory gate prices underscored the inflationary pressures in the pipeline. Output prices rose 3.5 percent on the year, the biggest increase since January 2012, compared with forecasts of a 3.2 percent increase.
The ONS also released figures for December house prices, which showed an 7.2 percent annual rise across the United Kingdom as a whole compared with a 6.1 percent increase in November.

Prices in London alone rose 7.5 percent on the year.

Consumer prices fell 0.5% in January from a month earlier, in line with economists’ expectations.
Earlier this month, the Bank of England said it sees inflation running at 2% this year, slightly higher than its previous forecast of 1.8% made in its November inflation report.
The BoE expects inflation of 2.7% next year, which is well above its target rate of 2%.
Much of the increase inflation is the result of the weaker pound, which is making imported goods more expensive.
Retail price inflation rose by 2.6% in January compared with the same month in 2015.
Excluding oil prices - which have risen sharply in recent months - and other volatile components such as food, core consumer price inflation was 1.6%, compared with economists' expectations for 1.8%.
Data on factory gate prices underscored the inflationary pressures in the pipeline.
Output prices rose 3.5% against forecasts of a 3.2% increase, while prices paid by factories for materials and energy jumped by 20.5%.

BERLIN (Reuters) - The German economy grew by 0.4 percent in the final quarter of 2016, data showed on Tuesday, as increased state spending, higher private consumption and construction in Europe's biggest economy more than offset a drag from foreign trade.
The growth figure for the final three months of 2016 came in slightly weaker than the consensus forecast in a Reuters poll of 0.5 percent. Still, it marked a sharp rebound after the German economy barely expanded over the summer months.
The overall growth rate for 2016 was confirmed at 1.9 percent, which was the strongest rate in half a decade.
""The fourth quarter was not as strong as most economists had expected, but sentiment surveys rose sharply in the past months and orders are also pointing upward,"" Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) analyst Joerg Kraemer said.
""Therefore growth could slightly pick up in the first quarter of 2017,"" Kraemer said, adding that private consumption would continue to support overall growth due to record-high employment, strong pay hikes and ultra-low interest rates.
The quarterly GDP growth rate for the third quarter was revised down to 0.1 percent from 0.2 percent and the rate for the second quarter was revised up to 0.5 percent from 0.4 percent, the data showed.
The so-called statistical overhang from the fourth quarter was confirmed at 0.5 percent. This means that the German economy started 2017 on an economically strong footing.
On the year, the German economy grew by 1.2 percent unadjusted in the fourth quarter and by 1.7 percent adjusted for workdays, the data showed.
Germany's consumption-driven upswing is expected to continue in 2017, although a strong rebound in inflation means consumers will have less money to spend than in the previous years.
For 2017, the German government expects weaker growth of 1.4 percent due to fewer work days and weaker exports.
RISING PRICES
Consumer prices, harmonized to compare with other European countries, rose by 1.9 percent on the year in January, separate data released on Tuesday showed.
This was the highest annual inflation rate since July 2013.
On a non-harmonized basis, consumer price inflation for January was also confirmed with the national index rising by 1.9 percent from the previous year.
Capital Economics analyst Jack Allen said the pick-up was largely due to food and energy prices, adding that core inflation was unlikely to surge in the coming months and wage growth was still subdued in Germany. 

""The upshot is that the comparatively high rate of headline inflation in Germany is unlikely to dissuade the European Central Bank from maintaining its asset purchases throughout this year,"" he said.

The data is among the latest in a string of surveys that show the A$1.6 trillion economy is humming along, cementing views the central bank will stand pat on interest rates after easing twice last year.
National Australia Bank's (AX:NAB) monthly survey of more than 400 firms showed its index of business conditions jumped 6 points to +16 in January. That took it back to the highs seen in mid-2007 and well above the long run average of +5.
The survey's measure of business confidence also climbed 4 points to +10 in January.
Its index of sales doubled to +22 for the month, while the measure of profits was steady at +12. A healthy 5 point rise in employment to its highest since 2011 seemed to bode well for the generally tardy labor market.
Cost price measures in the survey also lifted notably, suggesting a build up in wage pressures, although retail price inflation remained very subdued.
New South Wales enjoyed the bulk of the improvement in conditions, while other states were relatively stable.
NAB Chief Economist Alan Oster was circumspect about reading too much into the survey, reflecting in part the bank's view that a slowdown in the economy will force two more cuts in interest rates later in 2017.
""Recent strength in the NAB Business Survey is consistent with an anticipated rebound in economic activity. With that said, a confluence of seasonal factors suggests it is unwise to get too carried away with the result just yet, especially as some key industries remain fairly weak.""
""The trend for retail is still very soft, which suggests the outlook for consumption remains cloudy,"" Oster added.
The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) held rates steady this month and painted an optimistic picture for the next couple of years, predicting solid economic growth, further expansion in resource exports and a welcome pick-up in inflation.

The survey of consumer expectations, an increasingly influential gauge of prices for the U.S. central bank, found that year-ahead inflation expectations increased to 3.0 percent, from 2.8 percent in December and 2.5 percent in November.
The expectation three years out was 2.9 percent, from 2.8 percent the month before. ""Both increases were fairly broad-based, but largest among younger and higher-income respondents,"" the New York Fed said.
Both measures were last this high in June, 2015. The survey, which started three and a half years ago, hit its lowest price levels last year.
The Fed has raised rates twice in the past two years, but policymakers predict more rapid hikes in 2017 as low unemployment and expected fiscal stimulus continue to boost prices.
Inflation has remained below the central bank's preferred 2 percent target for a few years, but expectations have shot up since Donald Trump won the Nov. 8 presidential election.

The internet-based survey is done by a third party and taps a rotating panel of 1,200 household heads.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's economy grew for a fourth straight quarter in the final three months of last year as a weaker yen supported exports, but tepid private consumption and the risks of rising U.S. protectionism cast doubts over a sustainable recovery.
Data on Monday showed the world's third-largest economy grew an annualized 1.0 percent in October-December, roughly in line with the 1.1 percent increase markets had expected, following a revised 1.4 percent expansion in July-September.
Japan's export-driven growth over the quarter has helped fill the economic shortfall left by anemic domestic demand, but accompanying this tailwind are concerns Japan's persistent trade surplus with the U.S may make it a target of U.S. President Donald Trump's criticism.
During a weekend meeting with Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, Trump held off from his previous rhetoric against Japan for using its monetary stimulus to weaken the yen and gain an unfair trade advantage. But analysts doubt a honeymoon would last long.
Economy Minister Nobuteru Ishihara said Japan remained in a moderate recovery trend and expected the positive momentum to be maintained, but he sounded a cautious note on the outlook.
""Attention should be paid to uncertainty over global economy and fluctuations in financial markets,"" he told reporters after the GDP data release.
Analysts were equally cautious about the outlook even as a weak yen has provided exports a lift.
""The fact that the economy grew a fourth straight quarter on the back of exports should be considered a passing mark for policymakers,"" said Hidenobu Tokuda, senior economist at Mizuho Research Institute.
""Still, the corporate sector strength has not spread to households who are facing higher costs of living and future uncertainty. The key is how price-adjusted real wages grow to support private consumption from now on.""
The preliminary reading for fourth-quarter gross domestic product (GDP) figure translated into 0.2 percent growth on a quarter-on-quarter basis, versus a 0.3 percent gain expected by analysts.
External demand - or exports minus imports - contributed 0.2 percentage point to GDP, with exports rising 2.6 percent, the fastest growth in two years, on shipments of cars to China and the United States, and those of electronics parts to Asia.
Private consumption, which accounts for roughly 60 percent of GDP, showed no growth, largely in line with a flat reading forecast by economists. Rising prices of fresh food and vegetables are likely to have dented households' purchasing power.
PROTECTIONIST RISKS
Underlining a struggle to accelerate inflation to the Bank of Japan's 2 percent target, the GDP deflator, a broad gauge of prices, fell 0.1 percent in October-December from the same period a year earlier, down for a second straight quarter of declines.
Housing investment, a bright spot in the economy thanks to the central bank's aggressive monetary easing, rose 0.2 percent, the slowest expansion in four quarters.
On the upside, capital expenditure - a key component of GDP - rose 0.9 percent, reversing from a 0.3 percent decline in the third quarter.
Just the same, some economists saw risks stemming from weak domestic demand as well as trade protectionism.
During the October-December period, the dollar rebounded to as high as above 118 yen following Trump's election, after hitting lows around 101 yen in October. A weaker yen helped Japan's exports mark the first annual growth in 15 months in December. It was fetching 113.91 yen on Monday.
Trump's protectionist policies, which have rattled global markets and regional economies reliant on the vast U.S. market, have kept investors guessing about the outlook for world trade, investment and growth.
Despite the positive diplomatic overture, the Trump-Abe meeting on the weekend has done little to allay deeper concerns about growing U.S. protectionism.
""I don't think this summit was any indication of change in Trump's stance of negotiating with its trading partners based on recognition that a U.S. trade deficit is bad,"" Yoshimasa Maruyama, chief market economist at SMBC Nikko Securities, wrote in a note to clients.

417,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 12, 2017 07:10PM ET</span>",UK employers worry that EU workers will leave this year: survey,"LONDON (Reuters) - More than a quarter of employers in Britain say staff members from other European Union countries have considered leaving their firms or the country in 2017 after last year's Brexit vote, an industry group said on Monday.
The proportion rose to 43 percent of employers in education and 49 percent in healthcare sector employers, according to a survey of more than 1,000 companies conducted by the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development.
The CIPD said Britain's labor market remained strong, but the decision by voters to leave the European Union was likely to force companies to rethink their training strategies as they adjusted to having fewer EU workers in future.
Prime Minister Theresa May has promised tighter control over immigration when Britain leaves the bloc, which is likely to be in 2019, even if it means the country losing its unfettered access to the EU's single market.
The CIPD said recent official data showed employers who rely heavily on EU migrant workers were struggling to fill some vacancies: firms in retail and wholesale, manufacturing, health and accommodation and food services accounted for 45 percent of vacancies in late 2016. 
Gerwyn Davies, the CIPD's labor market adviser, said the official data also showed the number of non-UK EU nationals working in Britain grew more slowly in the three months to September than before the referendum. 
""This is creating significant recruitment challenges in sectors that have historically relied on non-UK labor to fill roles and who are particularly vulnerable to the prospect of future changes to EU immigration policy,"" he said.

Signs of shortages of migrant workers appeared last year in Britain's farm sector shortly after June's referendum as the fall in the value of the pound made the country a less attractive destination.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. consumer sentiment eased off a 13-year high in early February likely as some of the jubilation over Donald Trump's election victory ebbed, but it remained strong enough to suggest that consumers will continue to drive the economy.
Confidence surged in the wake of Trump's victory last November. The jump in sentiment tracked a stock market rally as both consumers and investors focused on the business mogul-turned politician's promises to cut taxes and reduce regulations.
These proposals, whose details remain vague, were viewed as pro-business and favorable for economic growth. At a meeting with airline executives on Thursday President Trump said he would announce a ""phenomenal"" tax plan in the next few weeks, but offered no specifics.
The University of Michigan on Friday said its consumer sentiment index fell to 95.7 early this month from a reading of 98.5 in January, which was the highest since January 2004. The survey's current conditions sub-index of consumer expectations dropped to 85.7 from January's reading of 90.3.
""This might be due to a lack of follow-through from Washington on the details of the plans for tax cuts, reforming healthcare, and infrastructure spending,"" said John Ryding, chief economist at RDQ Economics in New York.
The University of Michigan said consumers who participated in this month's survey were split in their views on the Trump administration's economic policies. Thirty percent of respondents had a favorable view, while 29 percent had a negative perception.
As such, nearly six-in-10 consumers made a positive or negative mention of government policies, which the university said was an unusually high reading for the survey.
Consumers' views were split along party lines, with self-identified Democrats anticipating an economic recession, while self-identified Republicans expected continued growth.
""America is clearly in a politically charged environment, and that was evident in the survey results,"" said Jim Baird, chief investment officer at Plante Moran Financial Advisors in Kalamazoo, Michigan.
""The bottom line is that consumers remain understandably upbeat, supported by continued strength in the labor markets ... and appear to be of the positive mindset for spending growth to continue in the coming months.""
Consumer spending accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity. The dollar was trading higher against a basket of currencies, while prices for U.S. government debt fell. Stocks on Wall Street hit record highs on the back of Trump's promised tax announcement.
LOW INFLATION EXPECTATIONS
The University of Michigan survey also showed consumers' inflation expectations remaining generally low early this month. The low inflation theme was also evident in a separate report from the Labor Department on Friday.
Import prices increased 0.4 percent last month amid further gains in the cost of energy products after advancing 0.5 percent in December. In the 12 months through January, import prices jumped 3.7 percent, the largest gain since February 2012, after advancing 2.0 percent in December.
But import prices excluding fuels fell 0.2 percent following a 0.1 percent dip the prior month. They were unchanged in the 12 months through January.
Import prices are rising as firming global demand lifts prices for oil and other commodities, but the spillover to a broader increase in inflation is being limited by dollar strength.
The dollar gained 4.4 percent against the currencies of the United States' main trading partners in 2016, with most of the appreciation occurring in the last months of the year.
This suggests that the greenback will continue to depress imported inflation in the near-term even though the dollar has weakened 2.9 percent on a trade-weighted basis this year.
""We expect to see the dollar generally strengthen in the coming months, which will keep non-fuel import price inflation tame,"" said Sarah House, an economist at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) Securities in Charlotte, North Carolina.
Prices for imported fuels increased 5.8 percent last month
after rising 6.6 percent in December. The cost of imported food dropped 1.3 percent after declining 1.5 percent in December.

Prices for imported capital goods edged down 0.1 percent, while those for automobiles dropped 0.5 percent -- the biggest decline since January 2015.

Its estimate follows the publication of industrial output and trade data for December, which underlined the economy's strong end to 2016.
NIESR cited consumer spending and a pick-up in industrial production as the main drivers behind the economy.

LONDON (Reuters) - British manufacturing grew more strongly than expected in December, showing the economy remained resilient to the end of the year despite June's Brexit vote shock, although 2017 looks likely to be more difficult.
Official data released on Friday also showed the country's smaller construction sector grew more quickly in December than many economists had forecast, while the trade deficit narrowed.
Britain's economy was the strongest among the Group of Seven richest nations last year, confounding predictions of a sharp slowdown following the decision by voters to leave the European Union. But it is widely expected to slow this year as rising inflation eats into the spending power of consumers.
The Bank of England has signaled it is in no hurry to raise interest rates from their record low.
Sterling rose after Friday's data and British government bond futures  modestly extended losses. 
""While industrial production and manufacturing output has proved resilient into the end of 2016, its sustainability over 2017 is in question,""  Barclays  (LON:BARC) economists Andrzej Szczepaniak and Fabrice Montagne said in a note to clients.
They pointed to soaring inflation pressures and the likelihood that potentially difficult negotiations with the EU will deter companies from making long-term investments.
British Prime Minister Theresa May is due to launch the process of leaving the EU by the end of March.
The main driver of Britain's growth since in recent years has been the dominant services sector.
But Friday's figures showed manufacturing grew strongly in the October-to-December period, up 1.2 percent from the previous three months, the strongest performance since June 23's Brexit referendum.
In December, manufacturing output jumped by 2.1 percent, much more than the 0.5 percent rise forecast by a Reuters poll of economists.
However, the Office for National Statistics said the increase was due in large part to the often volatile pharmaceuticals sector.
Compared with December 2015, manufacturing was up 4.0 percent, the strongest increase since April 2014.
Industrial output overall rose 1.1 percent in December, stronger than expectations for a 0.2 percent increase in the Reuters poll, taking the year-on-year growth figure to 4.3 percent, the strongest since January 2011.
Britain's construction sector also grew by more than expected, up 1.8 percent in December from November, helped by the building of houses and commercial property. The Reuters poll had predicted an increase of 1.0 percent.
The ONS said it was not revising its preliminary estimate that Britain's economy grew by 0.6 percent in the fourth quarter of 2016.
Separate figures from the ONS showed Britain's goods trade deficit fell to 10.89 billion pounds in December, narrower than a forecast of 11.50 billion pounds in the Reuters poll.
The ONS said the improvement was largely to due to exports of erratic items such as gold and aircraft parts and there was little evidence that the fall in the value of the pound since the Brexit vote was helping bring down the trade gap.
Excluding the volatile erratic items, Britain's goods trade deficit widened in December.

Exports of British goods in terms of volume rather than value increased 7.1 percent in quarterly terms during December, however - the fastest growth since mid-2006.

BEIJING, Feb 10 (Reuters) - China posted much stronger-than-expected trade data for January as demand picked up at home and abroad, an encouraging start to 2017 for the world's largest trading nation even as Asia braces for a rise in U.S. protectionism under President Donald Trump.
Trump criticized China, Japan and Germany last week, saying the three key U.S. trading partners were engaged in devaluing their currencies to the harm of U.S. companies and consumers.
But he has not followed through yet on threats to label China a currency manipulator and slap heavy tariffs on Chinese goods, and took a major step on Thursday to improve ties by holding a phone call with President Xi Jinping.
""China's trade data are going to be pretty good in the first part of this year because of the very good run that we had in the last part of 2016,"" said Louis Kuijs, head Of Asia economics at Oxford Economics in Hong Kong.
""The worry we have is really about U.S. trade policy, which is undeniably turning more protectionist...It is pretty obvious to me that the climate for exports to the U.S. is going to be much harsher in the coming years.""
China's imports in January rose at the fastest pace in four years, fueled by a continued construction boom which is boosting demand and global prices for resources from copper to steel, preliminary customs data showed on Friday.
The 16.7 percent bounce easily eclipsed an expected rise of 10.0 percent in a Reuters poll.
China's imports from the United States rose 23.4 percent in January, the fastest pace in at least a year, while its monthly trade surplus with the U.S. dipped to $21.37 billion. 
Both Chinese and U.S. data show China's surplus with the U.S. narrowed last year, but it remained well above the sustained level of more than $20 billion that is one of three criteria used by the U.S. Treasury to designate another country as a currency manipulator. 
The surplus decreased $20.1 billion to $347.0 billion in 2016, the U.S. Commerce Department said Tuesday, while Chinese data put it somewhat lower.
Led by electronics, China's January exports climbed the most in almost a year, adding to evidence that Asia's long trade recession may be bottoming out.
January shipments rose 7.9 percent, more than twice as much as expected, after 2016 exports slumped nearly 8 percent.
China had been lagging a recent export recovery seen in Japan, South Korea and Taiwan, dragging on the regional supply chain. Its integrated circuit shipments rose 14.5 percent last month, while exports of mobile phones rose 7.9 percent. 
That left the country with a initial trade surplus of $51.35 billion for the month, the highest in a year. Customs is due to release updated data for trade on Feb. 23.
""The export outlook for China is good, except for the potential risk of a Sino-U.S. trade war. The most important risk for China is what the Trump administration will do,"" Jianguang Shen, chief economist at Mizuho Securities in Hong Kong.
China watchers warned the long Lunar New Year holidays may have distorted the data to some degree, with companies pumping up production or rushing to build inventories before the break, which can last for weeks.
But most economists agreed the trend backed the view that manufacturing demand is improving in China and globally.
MAN OF STEEL
The world's second-largest economy continued to hoover up commodities ranging from coal and iron ore to soybeans.
Iron ore imports were the second highest on record, while crude oil imports were the third highest ever. Coal purchases also soared, for use in both power generation and steelmaking.
""Steel mills are making really good money. So that means they can afford to pay for more iron ore,"" said Lachlan Shaw, an analyst at UBS in Melbourne, adding that government efforts to reduce excess capacity were aiding the trend. 
Chinese futures prices for steel reinforcing bars used in construction have surged some 80 percent since last February, adding to views that price pressures are slowly building in the economy.
But analysts are not sure how much longer the commodities buying frenzy will last, noting that inventories are building up at Chinese ports and pointing to signs that a year-long housing boom is cooling off.

The Banco de Mexico hiked interest rates <MXCBIR=ECI> by 50 basis points to 6.25 percent, the highest level since March 2009 and in line with expectations in a Reuters poll.
The central bank said it raised rates to avoid consumer price contagion following a jump in gasoline prices and to anchor inflation expectations.
Mexican policymakers said they would closely watch for any sign that higher gasoline prices or the weak peso were fueling widespread pressures on inflation.
""They are leaving the door open for additional moves during this year. The key is to not let inflation expectations for 2018 also be contaminated,"" said Rafael Camarena, an economist at Santander (MC:SAN).
Mexico's annual inflation accelerated faster than expected to 4.72 in January, data showed earlier on Thursday, its highest rate in more than four years, after the government raised regular gasoline prices by 14 percent.
In its statement, the central bank said the outlook for both growth and inflation had worsened, but that the impact from the gasoline price hike was expected to be temporary.
Policymakers said that inflation would continue to run above its 4 percent upper limit before beginning to ease late in the year and move back toward 3 percent in 2018.
The peso <MXN=> extended gains after the decision
The central bank raised rates five times last year, lifting borrowing costs by a cumulative 250 basis points as the peso slid to successive record lows.
The peso tumbled past 22 per dollar to an all-time low just ahead of U.S. President Donald Trump's inauguration on concerns he would rip up a free trade agreement with Mexico.
The currency has rallied back about 7 percent since Trump took power after he did not immediately move to impose tariffs on Mexican goods.

444,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 09, 2017 10:41AM ET</span>",U.S. jobless claims near 43-year low; wholesale inventories surge,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits unexpectedly fell last week to near a 43-year low, amid a further tightening of the labor market that could eventually spur faster wage growth.
Other data on Thursday showed inventories at wholesalers surged in December for a second straight month and sales recorded their biggest increase since 2011, signs of confidence in the economy as domestic demand strengthens.
Initial claims for state unemployment benefits dropped by 12,000 to a seasonally adjusted 234,000 for the week ended Feb. 4, the Labor Department said. That left claims just shy of the 43-year low of 233,000 touched in early November.
Claims have now remained below 300,000, a threshold associated with a strong labor market, for 101 straight weeks. That is the longest stretch since 1970, when the labor market was much smaller.
""There is no sign of a pickup in layoff activity. We continue to view the signal of extremely subdued layoffs from the jobless claims data as evidence of companies attempting to retain their workers in a tight labor market,"" said John Ryding, chief economist at RDQ Economics in New York.
Prices of U.S. Treasuries fell, with yields rising to session highs, while the dollar rose against a basket of currencies.
The labor market is at or close to full employment, with the unemployment rate at 4.8 percent after hitting a more than nine-year low of 4.6 percent in November. The economy created 227,000 jobs in January.
Further tightening in labor market conditions could boost wage growth, which has remained stubbornly sluggish despite anecdotal evidence of more companies struggling to find qualified workers.
PRETTY UPBEAT SIGNAL 
Lackluster wage growth, if sustained, could hurt consumer spending and crimp economic growth. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast first-time applications for jobless benefits rising to 250,000 in the latest week. 
""Today's report sent a pretty upbeat signal about conditions in the job market,"" said Daniel Silver, an economist at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) in New York. ""It looks like conditions in the job market have remained solid in the few weeks since the reference period for the January payroll report.""
The four-week moving average of claims, considered a better measure of labor market trends as it irons out week-to-week volatility, fell 3,750 to 244,250 last week, the lowest level since November 1973.
The claims report also showed the number of people still receiving benefits after an initial week of aid increased 15,000 to 2.08 million in the week ended Jan. 28. The four-week average of the so-called continuing claims fell 3,750 to 2.08 million.
In a separate report on Thursday, the Commerce Department said wholesale inventories increased 1.0 percent after a similar jump in November. The back-to-back strong increases of stock accumulation, however, suggest a moderation in the pace of inventory investment in the months ahead.
Wholesale stocks excluding autos, the component of wholesale inventories that goes into the calculation of gross domestic product, increased 0.9 percent in December. 
Inventory investment contributed one percentage point to the economy's 1.9 percent annualized growth rate in the fourth quarter. That was the second straight quarterly contribution to GDP growth. Inventories had been a drag on GDP growth since the second quarter of 2015.
Sales at wholesalers jumped 2.6 percent in December, the largest increase since March 2011, after increasing 0.5 percent in November. 

At December's sales pace it would take wholesalers 1.29 months to clear shelves, the smallest since December 2014 and down from 1.31 months in November. The ratio has declined from the 1.37 months touched in January of last year, which was the highest since March 2009.

In a report, the U.S. Department of Labor said the number of individuals filing for initial jobless benefits in the week ending February 4 decreased by 12,000 to a seasonally adjusted 234,000 from the previous week’s total of 246,000.
Analysts had expected jobless claims to rise by 4,000 from the original reading to 250,000 last week.
First-time jobless claims below the 300,000-level are usually associated with a firming labor market.
Meanwhile, continuing jobless claims in the week ended January 28 unexpectedly increased to 2.078 million from 2.063 million in the preceding week, which was revised from 2.064 million.
Analysts had expected continuing claims to decrease to 2.060 million.
The four-week moving average was 244,250, a 3,750 drop from the previous week's 248,000. That was the lowest level for this average since November 3, 1973 when it was 244,000.
The monthly average is seen as a more accurate gauge of labor trends because it reduces volatility in the week-to-week data.

BERLIN (Reuters) - Germany's trade surplus climbed to a record high in 2016, official data showed on Thursday, days after U.S. President Donald Trump's top trade adviser accused Berlin of exploiting a ""grossly undervalued"" euro to its advantage.
The surplus is likely to worsen tension between Washington and Berlin, which is trying to safeguard global free trade this year during its presidency of the Group of 20 leading economies, adopting the motto ""Shaping an Interconnected World"".
Germany's trade surplus for 2016 rose to 252.9 billion euros ($270.05 billion), surpassing the previous high of 244.3 billion euros in 2015, the Federal Statistics Office said.
""The record surplus will continue to fuel the conflict with the USA and within the EU,"" said Marcel Fratzscher, head of the DIW economic institute, an advocate of stronger investment in Germany.
""European neighbors would benefit from stronger investment in Germany,"" he said. ""Germany, however, would profit first and foremost, as the investment gap and the resulting excessive trade surpluses are detrimental to the domestic economy.""
Germany's 2016 current account surplus, which measures the flow of goods, services and investments into and out of a country, surpassed China's surplus of $210.4 billion euros and hit $284.41 billion, making it the world's largest.
The United States runs persistent balance of trade and current account deficits and uses foreign capital to finance the difference between domestic investment and domestic savings.
The European Commission and the United States have urged Germany to increase its domestic demand and imports to help reduce global economic imbalances and fuel global growth, including within the euro zone.
Germany rejects such criticism, saying it has already increased domestic demand by introducing a national minimum wage in 2015 and agreeing to raise pension entitlements in 2016.
In addition, the government has increased state spending on roads, digital infrastructure and asylum seekers while sticking to its goal of keeping a balanced budget.
""GROSSLY UNDERVALUED""
Last week, U.S. President Donald Trump's top trade adviser said Germany was using a ""grossly undervalued"" euro to gain advantage over the United States and its European partners.
Chancellor Angela Merkel rejected the charge, saying her government had always called on the European Central Bank to pursue an independent monetary policy.
Some German lawmakers have pressed the ECB to tighten its policy. Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble said at the weekend the euro was too weak for Germany, but he noted that the ECB ""must make policy that works for Europe as a whole"".
On Wednesday, Merkel said the European Union would have to press ahead on trade deals with other countries if it does not reach an agreement with Trump's administration.
The German trade surplus grew in 2016 even though exports fell 3.3 percent in December while imports were unchanged. That means for December alone, the trade surplus narrowed to 18.4 billion euros from 21.8 billion in November.
German industrial production also fell in December, but orders rose the same month by the most in more than two years, suggesting the first quarter of 2017 may be getting off to a strong start.
On Wednesday, Germany's DIHK Chambers of Commerce raised its forecast for German economic growth in 2017 to 1.6 percent, but it warned that companies were worried about U.S. trade policy.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's core machinery orders rebounded more than expected in December from the prior month's fall and are seen rising again this quarter - an encouraging sign of a pick-up in capital expenditure.
The Cabinet Office data showed on Thursday core orders, a highly volatile data series regarded as an indicator of capital spending in the coming six to nine months, grew 6.7 percent in December, the fastest month-on-month gain in six months.
It followed a 5.1 percent drop in November and was twice the 3.1 percent pace forecast in a Reuters poll.
Japanese policymakers hope capital spending will help drive growth in the world's third-largest economy and pull it out of deflation and stagnation.
""Capital expenditure is picking up due to a recovery in exports, and it will gather momentum in the coming months as external and domestic economic conditions firm up,"" said Takeshi Minami, chief economist at Norinchukin Research Institute.
""Policies of U.S. President Donald Trump could pose a risk. If protectionism causes global trade to contract, that could hit Japan's domestic capital spending as well.""
By sector, core orders from manufacturers rose 1.0 percent in December, following a 9.8 percent gain the previous month. Orders from the services sector rose 3.5 percent after a 9.4 percent decline in November.
Manufacturers surveyed by the Cabinet Office forecast that core orders will rise 3.3 percent in January-March from the previous quarter, after a 0.2 percent decrease in the final three months of last year.
Compared with a year earlier, core orders, which exclude ships and orders from electric power utilities, grew 6.7 percent in December, the data showed.
The Cabinet Office, however, maintained its assessment of machinery orders, saying the pick-up was stalling.
Data out next Monday is likely to show Japan's economy grew for a fourth straight quarter in October-December led by exports and capital spending, and the Bank of Japan sees the economy in gradual recovery through fiscal 2018.
However, the outlook is far from assured as protectionist talk from U.S. President Donald Trump impairs the outlook for global trade, possibly undermining the economic health of export-reliant Japan and investment by Japanese companies.

Trump and Prime Minister Shinzo Abe are scheduled to meet for talks later this week, where trade imbalances and currency valuations are in focus as Trump pursues an ""America First"" campaign.

The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) also changed its stance to ""neutral"" from ""accommodative"", saying it would monitor inflation, despite calls for the central bank to support an economy dealt a major blow when Prime Minister Narendra Modi in November abolished high-value notes in a bid to target unaccounted cash, or ""black money.""
The RBI monetary policy committee on Wednesday voted 6-0 to keep the repo rate <INREPO=ECI> at 6.25 percent, marking its third straight unanimous decision since being established in September.
A Reuters poll last week showed 28 of 46 participants saw the RBI cutting the rate by 25 basis points to its lowest since November 2010 on Wednesday, but analysts warned it could be a close call.
""The committee decided to change the stance from accommodative to neutral while keeping the policy rate on hold to assess how the transitory effects of demonetization on inflation and the output gap play out,"" said the RBI in a statement.
The RBI decision disappointed investors, sending India's benchmark 10-year bond yields <IN069726G=CC> up 13 bps from levels before the decision.
ROOM TO ACT?
Many analysts believed the RBI had room to act, given inflation <INCPIY=ECI> fell to a two-year low of 3.41 percent in December, below the central bank's medium-term target of 4 percent.
The government also delivered last week a budget that kept its fiscal deficit target for the year starting in April at 3.2 percent of gross domestic product, below the 3.3 to 3.5 percent expected by analysts.
The RBI also saw reduced need for additional rate cuts as banks have substantially slashed their lending rates this year after receiving a surge in deposits of old banknotes, and sought more time to gauge the impact of global headwinds on the rupee <INR=D2>.
Between January 2015 and October 2016, the RBI cut rates 175 basis points.
In holding again on Wednesday, the RBI is seeing a reduced need for additional rate cuts as banks have substantially slashed their lending rates this year after receiving a surge in deposits of old banknotes, and sought more time to gauge the impact of global headwinds on the rupee <INR=D2>.

But the decision to hold is a risk, as private forecasts are more pessimistic than the RBI. The International Monetary Fund, for example, sees the economy growing at 6.6 percent for the year ending March, below the RBI's forecasts.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan attained its second-biggest current account surplus on record in 2016, Ministry of Finance data showed on Wednesday, just days before the U.S. and Japanese leaders meet for talks with trade surpluses and currency valuations expected to be high on the agenda.
The 20.6 trillion yen ($183.63 billion) surplus reflected the trade balance swinging into surplus on cheaper oil, rising foreign tourists arrivals creating a record travel surplus, and hefty foreign income from overseas investments.
Trade surpluses and currency valuations are in focus as U.S. President Donald Trump pursues an ""America First"" campaign in which he has accused big exporters such China, Germany and Japan of deliberately weakening their currencies to gain a competitive advantage.
For the whole of 2016, Japan posted a trade surplus of 6.8 trillion yen ($59.95 billion) with the United States, down 4.6 percent from 2015, with U.S.-bound car shipments rising for a second straight year, the Ministry of Finance said.
Trump and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe are scheduled to meet for talks later this week. Trump said he and Abe would play a round of golf, with Abe as his partner in the game, rather than a competitor.
Wednesday's data showed the vast bulk of Japan's current account surplus was generated by Japanese direct and portfolio investment abroad, accounting for 18.1 trillion yen of the 20.6 trillion current account surplus for 2016.
The trade surplus was 5.6 trillion yen in 2016, from the 630 billion yen deficit seen in 2015, earned in part as declining oil prices curbed import costs.
The travel balance logged a record 1.3 trillion yen surplus last year as a record number of foreign tourist visits took Japan's services deficit to the smallest on record.
Japan's current account surplus was 1.11 trillion yen in December, a seventh straight month of annual increases, the ministry data showed.
That compared with economists' median forecast for a surplus of 1.29 trillion yen seen in a Reuters poll.

LONDON (Reuters) - The first post-Brexit vote cracks may be emerging in consumer spending, the cornerstone of Britain's economy, with a series of downbeat retail surveys suggesting inflation pressures are starting to weigh on households.
Britain's economy outperformed expectations after the June 23 vote to leave the European Union, finishing 2016 with the fastest growth among any of its large, advanced-economy peers.
But economists polled by Reuters think the economy will slow markedly this year, mainly because consumer spending looks set to weaken under the strain of higher prices following the pound's near 20 percent slump against the dollar.
Gauges of retail sales - which can be volatile month to month and sometimes contradict each other - are now pointing in the same direction, potentially an early sign that this slowdown may be starting to take effect.
The latest report from the British Retail Consortium on Tuesday showed retail sales in cash terms grew at the weakest pace for any November to January period since 2008/2009, when Britain's economy was its low point after the financial crisis.
The Confederation of British Industry's retail sales balance for January suffered the sharpest one-month drop since records began in 1983, while a European Commission survey of the retail sector and official data for December also weakened.
Bank of England officials will view the figures as justification for their view that household spending looks set to weaken from last year, despite rowing back on some of its more pessimistic forecasts that followed the Brexit vote.
Last week BoE Governor Mark Carney admitted the central bank had been wrong-footed by the strength of consumer spending, thanks to a strong labor market and cheap credit.
""Now that dynamic will start to be tested as this year progresses,"" he said at a press conference following the BoE's policy decision on Thursday, during which he stressed that the outlook for wages would be key.
For most economists, the only question is how much consumer spending will ebb in the coming months, given it has been driven by rising wages, which will soon be eaten away by surging inflation.
The possibility that consumers may have front-loaded spending to beat the onset of higher prices, or taken advantage of record low interest rates to borrow now rather than later, add to the list of question marks.
""I think it's worth saying that all of these should make me relatively pessimistic about what happens this year,"" said London School of Economics professor Charles Bean, a former BoE deputy governor, at Fathom Consulting's Monetary Policy Forum hosted by Thomson Reuters last week.
There is little doubt rising prices are on the minds of consumers - a source of concern in itself as their spending accounted for a full 63 percent of economic output in 2015.
Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Trends data show that ""inflation"" as a search engine term hit an almost five-year high early this year, while consumer sentiment surveys from data company Markit and from the European Commission have also recorded rising concern about inflation.
The BRC survey and Kantar Worldpanel supermarket data published on Tuesday also suggested consumers are now having to pay more for essential goods, which suggests discretionary spending could falter soon.
""The strength of retail sales in the autumn - which prevented GDP growth from slowing after the referendum - appears to have reflected consumers bringing forward expenditure from 2017, due to anticipated price rises,"" said economist Samuel Tombs at Pantheon Macroeconomics.

469,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 07, 2017 01:23PM ET</span>",U.S. trade deficit falls as exports hit more than 1-1/2 year high,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. trade deficit fell in December as exports hit their highest level in more than 1-1/2 years amid record shipments of technology products, but strengthening domestic demand points to further rises in imports, which could constrain economic growth. 
The Commerce Department said on Tuesday the trade gap dropped 3.2 percent to $44.3 billion, ending two straight months of increases. The trade deficit rose 0.4 percent to a four-year high of $502.3 billion in 2016. That represented 2.7 percent of gross domestic product, down from 2.8 percent in 2015.
When adjusted for inflation, the deficit decreased to $62.3 billion from $63.9 billion in November. 
President Donald Trump has blamed U.S. trade policy for the loss of American factory jobs and has vowed to make sweeping changes, starting with pulling out of the 12-nation Trans-Pacific Partnership trade pact. 
Trump also wants to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement, which was signed in 1994 by the United States, Canada and Mexico. But economists do not believe these protectionist measures will eliminate the deficit. 
""When an economy is at full employment, an acceleration in demand tends to be accompanied by a pickup in import growth and a wider trade deficit,"" said John Ryding, chief economist at RDQ Economics in New York. ""The U.S. simply does not have enough spare labor and capacity at any exchange rate to close the deficit, which will likely widen in 2017 and 2018.""
U.S. financial markets were little moved by the report as the government published an estimate of the goods deficit last month. Trade slashed 1.7 percentage points from gross domestic product in the fourth quarter, leaving output rising at a 1.9 percent annualized rate. 
The economy grew at a 3.5 percent pace in the third quarter. The improvement in the deficit at the end of the year could set up trade to be a modest drag on growth in the first quarter.
In December, exports of goods and services increased 2.7 percent to $190.7 billion, the highest since April 2015, as shipments of advanced technology goods such as aerospace, biotechnology and electronics, hit a record high. 
There were increases in exports of industrial supplies and materials, capital goods, consumer goods and motor vehicles.
SWEEPING FLOORS
""Exports are jumping, which should increase those factory hours and bring back a few workers to sweep the shop floors while the robots toil away,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG Union Bank in New York.
""All the protectionism and slapping import duties on goods coming in the U.S. is probably not going to gain us the additional jobs that are being hoped for."" 
Despite December's rebound, exports remain constrained by relentless dollar strength. The dollar gained 4.4 percent against the currencies of the United States' main trading partners in 2016. Some of that impact will still be felt early this year. 
Last week in remarks to a meeting with pharmaceutical executives, Trump reiterated his view that the trade deficit is at least partly the result of other countries, especially China and Japan, devaluing their currencies to gain a trade advantage. 
""A trade deficit is erroneously associated with ... stealing our jobs and is seen as the product of currency manipulation,"" said RDQ Economics' Ryding.
""The trade deficit of $502 billion in 2016 could not be eliminated by a weaker dollar or a tariff wall on foreign imports. The most effective way to close a trade gap is to engineer a recession to deflate the demand for imports.""
Exports to the European Union jumped 10.1 percent, with goods shipped to Germany surging 12.4 percent. Germany has also come under criticism from some Trump advisers. Exports to China, another sore point for Trump, fell 4.1 percent.
Imports of goods and services rose 1.5 percent to $235.0 billion in December, the highest level since March 2015. Part of the increase in the import bill reflects higher oil prices, as well as strengthening domestic demand. 
The price of imported crude oil averaged $41.45 in December, the highest since September 2015. Food imports hit a record high, as did those of motor vehicles.
Imports of goods from China fell 7.6 percent in December, while those from Germany rose 1.4 percent.
With both exports and imports falling, the politically sensitive U.S.-China trade deficit dropped 9.0 percent to $27.8 billion in December. The trade deficit with China decreased $20.1 billion to $347.0 billion in 2016. 

The trade gap with Germany declined 6.2 percent to $5.3 billion in December. The trade deficit with Germany narrowed $10.0 billion to $64.9 billion last year. The United States also saw big declines in its trade deficits with Canada and Mexico in December.

In the release of the monthly Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS), the U.S. Labor Department said that the number of job openings, excluding the farming industry, decreased to 5.501 million in December from 5.505 million a month earlier, which was revised from the original reading of 5.522 million.
Analysts had expected the number of job openings to rise to 5.568 million.
The report has garnered more attention despite the lag on the data, as Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen cited the survey when assessing the state of the labor market.

471,By Investing.com,"<span>Feb 07, 2017 08:33AM ET</span>",U.S. trade deficit narrows more than expected in December,"Investing.com - The U.S. trade balance fell more than expected in December, putting an end to two consecutive months of increases, official data showed on Tuesday.
In a report, Bureau of Economic Analysis said that U.S. trade deficit fell to a seasonally adjusted $44.3 billion in December, from $45.7 billion in the preceding month whose figure was revised up from $45.2 billion.
Analysts had expected the U.S. trade deficit to shrink to just $45.0 billion in the final month of 2017.
December exports were $190.7 billion, $5.0 billion more than November exports. December imports were $235.0 billion, $3.6 billion more than November imports.
According to the Bureau, the December decrease in the goods and services deficit reflected a decrease in the goods deficit of $1.2 billion to $65.7 billion and an increase in the services surplus of $0.3 billion to $21.4 billion.
For 2016, the goods and services deficit increased $1.9 billion, or 0.4 percent, from 2015. Exports decreased $51.7 billion or 2.3 percent. Imports decreased $49.9 billion or 1.8 percent.
Several market experts have recently commented that the trade balance will be under watch given President Donald Trump’s promises to revamp trade deals to help the U.S. economy and reduce the country’s trade deficit.
Trump has repeatedly pointed to high trade deficits with Mexico, China or other countries as proof that trade deals have been unfair.
Following the report, EUR/USD was trading at 1.064 compared to 1.0673 ahead of the release, GBP/USD was at 1.2360 from 1.2361 earlier, while USD/JPY traded at 112.40 compared to 112.38 before the publication.

472,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 07, 2017 05:08AM ET</span>",China Jan FX reserves fall below $3 trillion for first time in nearly 6 years,"BEIJING (Reuters) - China's foreign exchange reserves unexpectedly fell below the closely watched $3 trillion level in January for the first time in nearly six years, though tighter regulatory curbs appeared to making some progress in slowing capital outflows.
China has taken a raft of steps in recent months to make it harder to move money out of the country and reassert a firmer grip on its faltering currency, even as U.S. President Donald Trump steps up accusations that Beijing is keeping the yuan too cheap.
Reserves fell $12.3 billion in January to $2.998 trillion, more than the $10.5 billion that economists polled by Reuters had expected.
While the $3 trillion mark is not seen as a firm ""line in the sand"" for Beijing, concerns are swirling over the speed at which the country is depleting its reserves and how much longer it can afford to defend the currency.
Some analysts fear a heavy and sustained drain on reserves could prompt Beijing to devalue the yuan as it did in 2015, which would sow turmoil in global financial markets and likely stoke political tensions with the new U.S. administration.
To be sure, the January decline was much smaller than the $41 billion reported in December, and was the smallest in seven months, indicating China's renewed crackdown on outflows appears to be working, at least for now.
Economists expect more forceful tightening of regulatory controls after Tuesday's data, though China's financial system is notoriously porous, with speculators quickly able to find new channels to get funds out of the country.
""With FX reserves below $3 trillion, we can expect capital controls as well as tightening yuan liquidity to continue, as the authorities try to avoid a further drawdown,"" said Chester Liaw, an economist at Forecast Pte Ltd in Singapore, referring the central bank's surprise hike in short-term interest rates on Friday.
While the world's second-largest economy still has the largest stash of forex reserves by far, it has burned through over half a trillion dollars since August 2015, when it stunned global investors by devaluing the yuan.
The yuan <CNY=CFXS> fell 6.6 percent against a surging dollar in 2016, its biggest annual drop since 1994.
COULD HAVE BEEN WORSE?
The drop in January's reserves could have been worse if not for a sudden reversal in the surging U.S. dollar in January, some analysts said. The softer dollar boosted the value of non-dollar currencies that Beijing holds.
The yuan has gained nearly 1 percent against the dollar so far this year.
But analysts expect downward pressure on the yuan to resume, especially if the U.S. continues to raise interest rates, which would likely trigger fresh capital outflows from emerging economies such as China and test its enhanced capital controls.
The drop in reserves in January was mainly due to interventions by the central bank as it sold foreign exchange and bought yuan, China's foreign exchange regulator, the State Administration of Foreign Exchange(SAFE), said in a statement.
But SAFE said that changes in China's reserves are normal and the market should not pay too much attention to the $3 trillion level.
Still, the government may be getting close to a key decision point.
Some analysts estimate China needs to retain a minimum of $2.6 trillion to $2.8 trillion under the International Monetary Fund's (IMF's) adequacy measures, and fears of a devaluation would likely intensify capital flight.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia's central bank held rates steady at its first policy meeting of the year on Tuesday, playing down a recent soft patch in economic growth as a temporary hiccup that would not prevent a pick up to a healthy 3-percent pace over time.
The Reserve Bank of Australia's (RBA) optimistic tone lifted the local currency 20 ticks to $0.7662 AUD=D4 as markets widened the odds on another policy easing.
The central bank kept rates at a record low of 1.5 percent for a seventh straight month, following easings in August and May last year. All 72 economists in a Reuters poll expected a steady outcome this week.
Notably, Governor Philip Lowe said the economy looked to have bounced back to ""reasonable growth"" after a surprise contraction in the third quarter of last year.
""The Bank's central scenario remains for economic growth to be around 3 percent over the next couple of years,"" Lowe said, waving aside fears Australia may have slipped into its first recession in 25 years.
He also reiterated the bank's forecasts for a gradual pick up in underlying inflation, which is currently pinned at a record low of 1.5 percent.
The RBA will release its latest forecasts for the economy in a quarterly policy statement due on Friday.
With Lowe accentuating the positive, investors trimmed bets on another rate cut for the near term with interbank futures 0#YIB: implying around a 16 percent of a move by June.
HOT HOUSING
Lowe again noted that prices for Australia's key commodity exports had risen sharply in past months, which blessed the country with its largest trade surplus on record in December.
Analysts expect that windfall to percolate through profits, wages and tax receipts in a boon for nominal growth and an argument against further rate cuts.
Adding to the case against stimulus has been an acceleration in house prices in Australia's two largest cities, Sydney and Melbourne, driven by an unwelcome revival in borrowing for investment properties.
Home prices rose at an annual pace of 10.7 percent in January, with Sydney running red-hot at 16 percent, data from property consultant CoreLogic showed last week.
Minutes of the December RBA meeting showed the board was mindful of balancing the benefits of easy policy against the risks of encouraging a renewed borrowing binge by households, many of which are already heavily in debt.
Lowe has repeatedly argued that cutting rates further could carry risks for debt that outweighed any economic benefit.

"
476,By Investing.com,"<span>Feb 06, 2017 11:05PM ET</span>","RBA holds steady at 1.5% as expected, signals easing end","Investing.com - The Reserve Bank of Australia held steady ata record low 1.5% on Tuesday and signaled it sees the end of an easing cycle in monetary policy globally.
Statement by Philip Lowe, Governor:Monetary Policy Decision
Number2017-02Date7 February 2017
At its meeting today, the Board decided to leave the cash rate unchanged at 1.50 per cent.
Conditions in the global economy have improved over recent months. Business and consumer confidence have both picked up. Above-trend growth is expected in a number of advanced economies, although uncertainties remain. In China, growth was stronger over the second half of 2016, supported by higher spending on infrastructure and property construction. This composition of growth and the rapid increase in borrowing mean that the medium-term risks to Chinese growth remain. The improvement in the global economy has contributed to higher commodity prices, which are providing a boost to Australia's national income.
Headline inflation rates have moved higher in most countries, partly reflecting the higher commodity prices. Long-term bond yields have also moved higher, although in a historical context they remain low. Interest rates have increased in the United States and there is no longer an expectation of further monetary easing in other major economies. Financial markets have been functioning effectively and stock markets have mostly risen.
In Australia, the economy is continuing its transition following the end of the mining investment boom. GDP was weaker than expected in the September quarter, largely reflecting temporary factors. A return to reasonable growth is expected in the December quarter.
The Bank's central scenario remains for economic growth to be around 3 per cent over the next couple of years. Growth will be boosted by further increases in resource exports and by the period of declining mining investment coming to an end. Consumption growth is expected to pick up from recent outcomes, but to remain moderate. Some further pick-up in non-mining business investment is also expected.
The outlook continues to be supported by the low level of interest rates. Financial institutions remain in a position to lend. The depreciation of the exchange rate since 2013 has also assisted the economy in its transition following the mining investment boom. An appreciating exchange rate would complicate this adjustment.
Labour market indicators continue to be mixed and there is considerable variation in employment outcomes across the country. The unemployment rate has moved a little higher recently, but growth in full-time employment turned positive late in 2016. The forward-looking indicators point to continued expansion in employment over the period ahead.
Inflation remains quite low. The December quarter outcome was as expected, with both headline and underlying inflation of around 1½ per cent. The Bank's inflation forecasts are largely unchanged. The continuing subdued growth in labour costs means that inflation is expected to remain low for some time. Headline inflation is expected to pick up over the course of 2017 to be above 2 per cent, with the rise in underlying inflation expected to be a bit more gradual.
Conditions in the housing market vary considerably around the country. In some markets, conditions have strengthened further and prices are rising briskly. In other markets, prices are declining. In the eastern capital cities, a considerable additional supply of apartments is scheduled to come on stream over the next couple of years. Growth in rents is the slowest for a couple of decades. Borrowing for housing has picked up a little, with stronger demand by investors. With leverage increasing, supervisory measures have strengthened lending standards and some lenders are taking a more cautious attitude to lending in certain segments.
Taking account of the available information, and having eased monetary policy in 2016, the Board judged that holding the stance of policy unchanged at this meeting would be consistent with sustainable growth in the economy and achieving the inflation target over time.

Other data in coming weeks is expected to show the world's second-largest economy got off to a good start in 2017, with steady growth giving the central bank room to slowly tighten monetary policy to contain the risks from high levels of debt.
China's FX reserves likely fell about $10.5 billion in January, roughly a quarter of the drop seen in December but leaving them hovering around the closely watched $3 trillion level, according to median estimates of economists polled by Reuters.
While the $3 trillion mark is not seen as a firm ""line in the sand"" for Beijing, concerns are swirling in global financial markets over the speed at which the country is depleting its ammunition to defend the currency and staunch capital outflows.
Some economists forecast that China's reserves actually rose last month due to tighter controls on moving money out of the country as well as valuation effects, with a weaker U.S. dollar boosting the value of the non-dollar currencies China holds.
The yuan currency <CNY=CFXS> strengthened against the dollar last month for the first time since September.
But analysts expect downward pressure on the yuan to return, especially if the U.S. continues to raise interest rates, which would likely trigger fresh capital outflows from emerging economies such as China and test its enhanced capital controls.
The government has stepped up oversight of individual forex purchases and outbound investments by companies, saying it wants to close loopholes for speculative outflows.
China announces foreign exchange reserves on Tuesday, followed by trade and inflation data on Feb. 10 and Feb. 14, respectively, while loan and money data is expected anytime from Feb. 10-15.
China will release combined January and February activity data for industrial output, retail sales and fixed asset investment in March, in a bid to smooth out seasonal factors.
Trends in Chinese data can be difficult to pin down early in the year due to distortions created by the long Lunar New Year holiday, when hundreds of millions of people travel and many factories and business shut, often for weeks.
Factory and service sector surveys for January published last week showed growth remained strong, despite some signs of slowing from December. Business expectations remained high.
INFLATION REBOUND
Inflation data is expected to point to a further pick-up in producer prices, fueled largely by stronger demand and higher prices for building materials and coal.
China's producer price index (PPI) likely rose 6.3 percent in January from a year earlier, a rapid turnaround from when wholesale prices were in decline just four months prior.
Consumer prices likely rose 2.4 percent in January, still relatively benign but the fastest pace since May 2014.
While a strong recovery of commodities prices have pushed up industrial profits, there has been little indication of higher prices being pushed on to the consumer yet.
Still, further evidence of nascent price pressures is likely to suggest the central bank will keep a policy tightening bias.
Trade data for January is also expected to show improvement, with exports in dollar terms from the world's largest exporter seen rising 3.3 percent in January, compared with a 6.1 percent decline the previous month.
China has lagged an export rebound enjoyed by some of its North Asian neighbors in recent months.
Imports likely rose 10.0 percent, accelerating from 3.1 percent growth in December.
China's trade surplus is forecast to have risen to $47.90 billion in January, versus December's $40.82 billion, with growing attention on its large trade surplus with the United States as new U.S. President-election Donald Trump ramps up his protectionist rhetoric.
Banks probably extended 2.3 trillion yuan ($335.2 billion) in new loans in January, the Reuters poll showed, the second highest monthly tally ever and building off last year's record lending.
While Chinese leaders have stressed the need to corral asset bubbles and rely on more sustainable growth, the economy continues to rely heavily on credit to hit official growth targets, with debt levels rising again last year.
The growth rate of outstanding loans likely fell slightly to 13.4 percent year-on-year in January, while M2 money supply growth was likely stable at 11.3 percent.
China's central bank surprised financial markets on Friday by raising short-term interest rates on the first day back from a long holiday.
While the rate increases were modest, they reinforced views that authorities are intent on both containing capital outflows and reining in risks to the financial system created by years of debt-fueled stimulus.

The Sentix euro zone index fell to 17.4 points from January's 18.2. The February reading from the Frankfurt-based research group was exactly in line with the consensus forecast in a Reuters poll of analysts.
""Investors are reacting to Donald Trump's first official acts and see in these a burden for the global economy,"" Sentix said in a statement.
Investors viewed the euro zone's current conditions more favorably, with a sub-index rising in February to 20.5 - the highest since May 2011 - from 16.5 in January.
Expectations for economic developments in the euro zone deteriorated, slipping to 14.3 from 20.0. Sentix noted, however, that the February expectations reading was still above December's reading of 11.8.
An index tracking Germany, the euro zone's largest economy, fell to 31.3 in February from 33.1 in January.
Trump has said the European Union has become a ""vehicle"" for German interests and predicts that more member states would leave the bloc as Britain did last June.
Trump has also warned German car companies that he would impose a border tax of 35 percent on vehicles imported to the U.S. market. His top trade adviser has accused Germany of using a ""grossly undervalued"" euro to gain advantage over the United States and its own EU partners.

482,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 06, 2017 04:20AM ET</span>","Japan real wages drop in December, boding ill for consumer spending","TOKYO (Reuters) - Japanese wages, on an annual inflation-adjusted basis, dropped in December for the first time in a year, government data showed on Monday, a setback for hopes that consumer spending can increase and help lift economic growth.
The decline was caused by a rise in the cost of living, which outpaced nominal pay hikes, officials said. Higher prices for items such as fresh vegetables have increased living costs.
The labor ministry data showed inflation-adjusted real wages dropped 0.4 percent in December from a year earlier, following a revised flat reading in November.
In nominal terms, wage earners' cash earnings rose 0.1 percent year-on-year in December, following a 0.5 percent gain in November. Special payments - most of which consist of winter bonus - fell 0.1 percent.
The data came as labor unionists and business leaders kick off the annual spring wage negotiations. These are expected to produce smaller wage gains than last year due to increased uncertainty on the global outlook.
Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has called on business leaders to support a sustainable economic recovery by raising employee wages, but it remains a struggle to accelerate pay hikes despite the tight job market and high corporate profits.
Nearly two-thirds of Japanese firms are considering no wage hikes this year, a Reuters poll showed last month.
For the whole of 2016, inflation-adjusted real wages rose 0.7 percent, up for the first time in five years, thanks in part to declines in consumer prices, the labor ministry data showed.
Regular pay, which accounts for the bulk of total pay and determines base salaries, increased an annual 0.5 percent in December from a year earlier, rising for a sixth straight month.
Overtime pay, a barometer of strength in corporate activity, fell 1.9 percent in the year to December, down for a seventh consecutive month.
The ministry defines ""workers"" as 1) those who are employed for more than one month at a firm that employs more than five people, or 2) those who are employed on a daily basis or have less than a one-month contract but had worked more than 18 days during the two months before the survey was conducted at a firm that employs more than five people.

BEIJING (Reuters) - Growth in China's services sector remained robust in January as companies reported a solid increase in orders, though the pace of expansion eased from the previous month, a private business survey showed.
The services PMI fell marginally to 53.1 in January on a seasonally adjusted basis, from 53.4 in December, the Markit/Caixin services purchasing managers' index (PMI) showed.
But it remained well above the 50-mark that separates expansion in activity from contraction on a monthly basis.
Improving business conditions prompted service companies to hire staff at the fastest pace in 20 months.
The strong reading mirrored improvements in manufacturing surveys last week, giving China's policymakers more room to focus on containing the financial risks from a sharp rise in debt.
Though activity in services slowed slightly from December, strong growth looks set to continue, in line with policymakers efforts to rebalance the economy toward services and consumption, which are the biggest drivers of growth in the world's second-largest economy.
Expansion in new business for services firms slowed slightly from December but remained robust.
And service firms remained strongly positive about the business outlook for the next 12 months, citing planned company expansions, new product developments and forecasts of strengthening client demand. A sub-index for business expectations matched an 18-month high with a reading of 60.8.
However, input prices rose the fastest in nearly four years. And while companies also raised their output prices the most since August 2015, companies said tough competition held back their ability to raise prices, suggesting a squeeze in profit margins.
Caixin's composite PMI covering both the manufacturing and services sectors showed a similar pattern of solid but slightly easing growth, falling to 52.2 in January from the previous month's near 4-year high of 53.5.
A number of economists have predicted a loss of growth momentum this year as a property boom cools and the boost from previous stimulus starts to wear off.
Chinese firms are also facing the prospect of higher borrowing costs.
The central bank has begun to raise key short-term rates in a sign that policymakers will focus on controlling high debt levels and cooling down overheated property and commodities markets.
But the rate increases so far have been modest, suggesting authorities remain wary about tapping the brakes too hard and stunting economic growth.
""The economy continued to recover, but the expansion rate has slowed. Meanwhile, inflationary pressures continued to build up as prices increased further,"" said Zhengsheng Zhong, director of macroeconomic analysis at CEBM Group, in a note with the PMI data.
""The economy is unlikely to maintain the pace of expansion seen in the fourth quarter of last year given that the manufacturing sector's willingness to restock has declined. China's economic growth may decelerate after the first quarter of this year.""

A monthly survey by Australia and New Zealand Banking Group (AX:ANZ) showed total job advertisements jumped 4 percent in January from December when they fell 2.2 percent.
That saw the annual pace of job ads growth rise to 7.1 percent, from 3.7 percent in December. ANZ no longer provides a breakdown between internet job ads and newspaper spots which take a tiny share of total vacancy ads.
""The bounce in ANZ job ads, along with modest increases in other leading indicators, lends support to our view that although momentum in the labor market has slowed, it remains strong enough to underpin a gradual decline in the unemployment rate this year,"" said ANZ senior economist Felicity Emmett.
A measure of Australian business conditions recovered strongly in December, a survey found last month, as firms reported a marked pick up in sales and profits.
Figures out last week showed Australia posted a record trade surplus in almost three years in December as surging commodity prices boosted export earnings, and likely economic growth as well.

Still, there is considerable slack in Australia's labor market, with the jobless rate at 5.8 percent and employment increasingly skewed toward part-time work.

A cheaper currency normally helps exporters in the medium term, but the BCC said that currency weakness was proving a double-edged sword for its members, mostly small and medium-sized businesses. 
Some 25 percent of businesses said sterling's weakness had boosted their export margins, but 22 percent said it had reduced the profitability of their overseas sales.
Nearly half of the companies surveyed did not manage currency risk, and had no plans to do so.
Many smaller businesses billed overseas customers in sterling but paid for some of their raw materials in foreign currency, the BCC said, leaving them exposed to the costs of sterling's fall unless they put up prices. 
Sterling has fallen more than 15 percent against the dollar since June 23, and other business surveys have reported a big increase export orders - but any gains have not yet shown up in Britain's official trade data.
""For firms that import, it's now more expensive, and companies may find themselves locked into contracts with suppliers and unable to be responsive to currency fluctuations,"" BCC Director General Adam Marshall said. 
Firms which had managed foreign exchange risk better were now likely to find that currency hedges taken out before the referendum were expiring, said Lee McDarby, an executive at currency brokers Moneycorp, which sponsored the survey.
The effects for businesses' domestic profit margins was clear, with 44 percent reporting a fall. More than two thirds of firms expect sterling weakness to increase their costs in 2017, and more than half expect to pass at least some of this on to their customers.
The Bank of England expects consumer price inflation to rise sharply this year due to firms passing on higher import costs, and to reach 2.7 percent by the end of this year, up from 1.6 percent at the end of 2016.

The BCC survey was based on responses from 1,474 business people between Dec. 1 and Dec. 19.

489,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 03, 2017 02:32PM ET</span>","U.S. job growth accelerates in January, but wages lag","By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. job growth surged more than expected in January as construction firms and retailers ramped up hiring, but wages barely rose, handing the Trump administration both a head start and a challenge as it seeks to boost the economy.
Nonfarm payrolls increased by 227,000 jobs, the largest gain in four months, the Labor Department said on Friday. The unemployment rate, however, rose one-tenth of a percentage point to 4.8 percent and wages increased by only three cents, suggesting that there was still some slack in the labor market.
Still, the labor market is tightening and could hopefully soon spur faster wage growth. Federal Reserve officials view the jobs market as being at or near full employment.
U.S. government bond prices initially rose as traders focused on the disappointing wage growth, which investors saw as keeping the Fed on a gradual path of interest rate increases this year. In the afternoon, U.S. Treasuries were trading lower while the dollar edged up against a basket of currencies.
Stocks on Wall Street rose, with the S&P 500 index (SPX) approaching its record peak.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast payrolls rising 175,000 last month and the unemployment rate unchanged at 4.7 percent. The economy created 39,000 fewer jobs in November and December than previously reported.
""While there's a great deal of anticipation surrounding steps that President Trump and the GOP-led Congress are expected to take to boost the economy, that's going to take more time,"" said Mark Hamrick, a senior economic analyst at Bankrate.com in Washington.
President Donald Trump vowed during last year's election campaign to deliver 4 percent annual gross domestic product growth, largely on the back of a plan to cut taxes, reduce regulations, increase infrastructure spending and renegotiate trade deals in the United States' favor.
Although details on the policy proposals remain sketchy, consumer and business confidence have surged in the wake of Trump's election victory last November. But with the economy near full employment, some economists are skeptical of the 4 percent growth pledge. Annual GDP growth has not exceeded 2.6 percent since the 2007-08 recession.
Trump, who during the election campaign regularly dismissed the job numbers and the unemployment rate as ""phony"" and ""one of the biggest hoaxes,"" welcomed January's acceleration in hiring.
""So we're very happy about that. I think that it's going to continue big league,"" said Trump.
DISAPPOINTING WAGE GROWTH
Average hourly earnings edged up 0.1 percent last month, below expectations for a 0.3 percent rise. December's wage gain was revised down to 0.2 percent from the previously reported 0.4 percent increase.
There was a big decline in earnings in the financial sector last month, which probably offset minimum wage increases that took effect in 19 states in January. The small gain lowered the year-on-year increase in earnings to 2.5 percent from 2.8 percent in December.
Economists say a growth rate of between 3 and 3.5 percent in wages is needed to lift inflation to the Fed's 2 percent target. Sluggish wage growth, if it persists, would suggest little urgency from the Fed to tighten monetary policy.
The pace of rate hikes will, however, probably depend on how much inflation is generated from Trump's proposed measures to bolster economic growth. The U.S. central bank, which raised rates in December, has forecast three rate increases this year.
""The tepid wage data and the relative stability of the unemployment rate should allow the Fed to proceed with rate normalization at an unhurried pace,"" said Michael Feroli, an economist at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) in New York. ""We continue to look for the next hike at the June meeting.""
On Wednesday, the Fed kept its benchmark overnight interest rate unchanged in a range of 0.50 percent to 0.75 percent. It said it expected labor market conditions would strengthen ""somewhat further.""
With its January employment report, the government published its annual ""benchmark"" revisions and updated the formulas it uses to smooth the data for regular seasonal fluctuations. It also incorporated new population estimates.
The government said the level of employment in March of last year was 60,000 lower than it had reported. As the labor market nears full employment, the pool of workers is shrinking, which is slowing job growth.
The labor force participation rate, or the share of working-age Americans who are employed or at least looking for a job, was at 62.9 percent in January, the highest level since September. The employment-to-population ratio was at 59.9 percent last month, the highest level since March 2016.
A broad measure of unemployment that includes people who want to work but have given up searching and those working part-time because they cannot find full-time employment rose two-tenths of a percentage point to 9.4 percent last month.
Nearly all sectors of the economy added jobs in January. Manufacturing payrolls rose by 5,000 jobs, rising for a second straight month. The gains were mostly at factories making machinery, nonmetallic mineral products, transportation equipment, food and furniture.
""Plenty to build on here for Donald Trump who has tended to put a premium on manufacturing jobs,"" said Alan Ruskin, global head of G10 FX strategy at  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) in New York.
Construction employment jumped 36,000, the largest increase since March, likely boosted by warm weather. The housing sector led the construction job gains.
Retail payrolls, surprisingly surged 45,900, the biggest rise since February. Retailers, including Macy's (N:M), Sears (O:SHLD), American Apparel and Abercrombie & Fitch (N:ANF) announced job cuts in January amid store closures.
Department store sales are being undercut by online retailers, led by Amazon.com (O:AMZN).
Employment in the financial sector increased by 32,000 jobs last month, an acceleration from December's 23,000 gain. But average hourly earnings fell 1.0 percent.

Government employment fell for a fourth straight month in January. Further declines are likely after the Trump administration enforced a hiring freeze on civilian federal government workers on Jan. 22.

When adjusted for seasonal factors, Mexican consumer confidence <MXCONF=ECI> slid 15.1 percentage points to 69.3 in January, the same month Trump took office threatening to scrap the North American Free Trade Agreement, build a Mexican-funded southern U.S. border wall and deport million of undocumented immigrants.
The January figure is the lowest the national statistics agency has recorded in the data series which began in 2001.
Trump's victory has sent shock waves through Mexico, threatening to upend years of cooperation between the neighboring countries.
U.S. threats to rip up a free trade deal with Mexico cast a chill over company investment plans, while worries of slower growth and inflation could hit private spending.
Following Trump's Nov. 8 win, the peso fell to a series of record lows, fanning inflation and helping drive President Enrique Pena Nieto's popularity to fresh lows.
Mexico's annual inflation shot up in early January to 4.78 pct, its fastest pace in over four years, stoked by a government-led increase in gasoline prices.
Consumer prices are seen rising to over 5.2 percent this year, according to a central bank poll published this week, a move well above policymakers' upper limit of 4 percent that will likely fuel further interest rate hikes.
""The fall in consumer confidence is directly related with Donald Trump taking office, and his threats toward Mexico, but it's also affected by inflationary pressures,"" Gabriela Siller, of Banco BASE, said in an investor note.
In unadjusted terms, the consumer confidence index <MXCONC=ECI> fell to 68.5 during the month from a prior reading of 85.7.

Factory goods orders increased 1.3 percent, the Commerce Department said on Friday after a revised 2.3 percent decline in November. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast factory orders rising 1.0 percent in December after a previously reported 2.4 percent decline in November.
Total shipments of manufactured goods increased 2.2 percent, the largest increase since December 2010, after rising 0.3 percent in November.
The department also said orders for non-defense capital goods excluding aircraft - seen as a measure of business confidence and spending plans - rose 0.7 percent in December instead of the 0.8 percent increase reported last month.
Shipments of these so-called core capital goods, which are used to calculate business equipment spending in the gross domestic product report, increased 1.0 percent in December as previously reported.
A report on Wednesday showed factory activity accelerated to a more than two-year high in January, with manufacturers reporting increases in new orders and employment. Manufacturing accounts for about 12 percent of the economy.
A collapse in oil prices in 2015 and a surge in the dollar weighed on manufacturing for much of last year, with most of the pain coming through sharp cutbacks in business spending on equipment. Oil prices have since risen above $50 per barrel, lifting some of the fog off manufacturing.
The government reported last Friday that business spending on equipment increased at a 3.1 percent annualized rate in the fourth quarter, the first increase in over a year.
In December, orders for transportation equipment fell 2.5 percent, reflecting a 64 percent plunge in defense aircraft orders. Outside transportation, orders for machinery rose 0.7 percent.
Orders for computers and electronic products surged 2.6 percent, while bookings for electrical equipment, appliances and components fell 0.6 percent.

LONDON (Reuters) - Business started 2017 on a solid footing, surveys showed on Friday, thriving ahead of a myriad of political risks in the coming year.
Fears of a growing protectionist agenda in the United States, whether national elections across Europe upset the status quo and just how fractious Britain's divorce proceedings from the European Union become, are all expected to weigh in the months ahead.
Yet so far those risks seem to have been mostly ignored with firms from Asia to Europe increasing or at least largely maintaining activity. Similar upbeat results are expected later from the United States..
Euro zone businesses started 2017 by increasing activity at the same multi-year record pace they set in December. 
China's factory activity grew for a seventh month and while India's services business contracted for a third month as firms struggled to recover from a government crackdown on currency in circulation, the pace slowed.
""The outlook for this year is reasonably bright despite all the risks. The numbers for January have generally been quite positive,"" said Andrew Kenningham, chief global economist at Capital Economics.
Growth in Britain's services sector slowed for the first time in four months in January, dipping just below its long-run average, as businesses battled the sharpest rise in costs in more than five years. 
But on Thursday the Bank of England sharply revised up its growth forecast for 2017 to 2.0 percent, a view held by only the most optimistic forecaster in a Reuters poll of 50 economists taken last month. 
Britain's economy unexpectedly outpaced all its major peers last year, wrongfooting those who expected an immediate hit from June's Brexit vote.
The Markit/CIPS British services Purchasing Managers' Index dropped to a three-month low of 54.5 last month from December's 15-month high, at the bottom end of a range of forecasts in a Reuters poll of economists, but Markit said the PMIs still point to first quarter growth of 0.5 percent. 
IHS Markit's final composite PMI for the euro zone, seen as a good guide to growth, held at 54.4. It has not been higher since May 2011 and has remained above the 50 mark dividing growth from contraction since mid-2013.
That points to first quarter expansion of 0.4 percent, Markit said, matching the median prediction in a Reuters poll. 
""Despite the slightly disappointing outcome this remains a very strong report,"" said James Knightley, senior economist at ING.
China's factory activity expanded for the seventh straight month in January, giving Beijing more room to tackle chronic imbalances in the economy. The Caixin/Markit Manufacturing PMI fell to 51.0.
The world's second largest economy has seen a broad-based pickup in recent months, with fourth-quarter GDP beating expectations due largely to a strong housing market and higher government spending on infrastructure projects.
A recovery in the country's ""smokestack"" industries has also been supported by government mandates to close down outdated production capacity in the coal and steel sectors, as well as a rebound in investment in the property sector that came amid a record flood of credit.
India's Nikkei/IHS Markit Services PMI remained below 50 registering 48.7 in January as firms still reel from Prime Minister Narendra Modi's decision in November to abolish high-value bank notes.

Modi's policy removed 86 percent of the currency in circulation, hitting consumption and capital investments, and shattered traditional cash-reliant supply chains.

LONDON (Reuters) - Growth in Britain's services sector slowed for the first time in four months in January as businesses battled the sharpest rise in their costs in more than five years, a closely watched survey showed on Friday.
Britain's economy outpaced its main peers last year, wrong-footing those who expected a rapid hit from June's Brexit vote. But Friday's data offered signs that a limited slowdown might be taking place.
The Markit/CIPS services purchasing managers' index (PMI) dropped to 54.5 from December's 15-month high of 56.2, just below its long-run average and at the bottom end of a range of forecasts in a Reuters poll of economists.
Combined with drops in manufacturing and construction PMIs this week, the survey was consistent with quarterly growth slowing to 0.5 percent in early 2017 from 0.6 percent at the end of last year, Markit said, in line with the Bank of England's relatively upbeat growth forecasts released on Thursday.
Nonetheless, sterling dropped almost half a cent against the U.S. dollar after the PMI was published, extending its hefty falls on Thursday when BoE Governor Mark Carney gave no hint that interest rates were likely to rise soon.
Samuel Tombs, an economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said he believed the survey overstated growth for the economy as a whole, as it did not include retailers likely to be hit hardest by rising prices.
""Momentum is fading as prices shoot up,"" he said.
Services firms said their costs were rising at the fastest since March 2011 due to sterling's fall since the referendum.
""Anecdotal evidence widely attributed cost pressure to fuel, salaries, freight charges and imports,"" Markit said.
In turn, businesses further raised the prices they charged which were the most widespread since April 2011.
""The degree to which costs are rising threatens to test the tolerance of some policymakers in terms of their willingness to 'look through' what's likely to be a marked upturn in inflation in 2017,"" IHS Markit economist Chris Williamson said.
Markit said optimism among businesses in its survey rose to its highest since May last year, helped by new orders, products and markets, as well as continued low interest rates and a bit more clarity about Britain's exit from the European Union.

Britain's parliament gave Prime Minister Theresa May an initial green light to start Brexit talks earlier this week.

In a report, market research group Markit said the seasonally adjusted Markit/CIPS services purchasing managers’ index (PMI) dropped to 54.5 last month from a reading of 56.2 in December.
Analysts had expected the index to fall only to 55.8.
On the index, a level above 50.0 indicates expansion in the industry, below 50.0 indicates contraction.
Markit indicated that this was the slowest rise in output since October, though the survey did show the strongest business expectations since May 2016.
The report also highlighted that input price inflation hit its highest level since March 2011.
“Service sector growth eased after a strong end to 2016, but the January surveys still point to a buoyant start to 2017 for the U.K. economy,” Markit chief economist Chris Williamson said in the report.
Combined with the other PMI surveys from manufacturing and construction, Williamson said the data pointed to economic growth of 0.5% in the first quarter of 2017.
He noted that the strong optimism suggested that the slowdown in January may be temporary.
Regarding price increases, Williamson warned that higher costs could inevitably feed through to consumer prices.
“While the robust start to the year adds some justification to the Bank of England’s improved outlook for 2017, the degree to which costs are rising threatens to test the tolerance of some policymakers in terms of their willingness to ‘look through’ what’s likely to be a marked upturn in inflation in 2017,” he concluded.
Immediately following the report, sterling weakened on the disappointing data. GBP/USD was trading at 1.2481 from around 1.2524 ahead of the release of the data, EUR/GBP was at 0.8606 from 0.8580 earlier, while GBP/JPY traded at 141.24 compared to 141.57 previously.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's economy was seen growing for a fourth straight quarter in October-December thanks to stronger exports and a pickup in capital spending, a Reuters poll found on Friday. 
Poll respondents saw the economy as likely continuing to recover even though uncertainty over the policies of U.S. President Donald Trump remains deep. 
The economy was expected to expand at an annualized rate of 1.1 percent in the fourth quarter, according to the poll of 20 analysts, after posting growth of 1.3 percent in the third quarter.
Under those circumstances quarter-on-quarter growth would a 0.3 percent gain, unchanged from July-September.
""Data will likely confirm the economy is on a moderate recovery led by a pickup in overseas economies,"" said Hidenobu Tokuda, senior economist at Mizuho Research Institute.
""Japan's economic recovery is expected to continue, helped by global economic growth and yen weakness. But downside risks are also high because of uncertainty over protectionism in the U.S. and the political situation in Europe.""
The poll found net exports added 0.3 percentage point to growth in October-December, the same as it contributed in the third quarter. 
Capital spending was seen growing 0.9 percent in the last quarter, the poll found, rising for the first time in two quarters.
Private consumption, which accounts for roughly 60 percent of gross domestic product, was seen flat in the last quarter, after posting modest gains in the previous three quarters.
The Cabinet Office will announce the GDP data on Feb. 13 at 8:50 a.m.(2350 GMT, Feb. 12).
Japan's core machinery orders, a leading indicator of capital spending, were seen rising 3.1 percent in December from the previous month, up for the first time in two months.
The highly volatile data series, regarded as an indicator of capital spending in the next six to nine months, fell 5.1 percent in November.
From a year ago, core orders, which exclude orders for ships and electrical equipment, were expected to rise 4.6 percent in December after a 10.4 percent gain in November.
""Corporate investment sentiment is picking up as a brighter mood is spreading in the global economy - although we cannot dispel risks from U.S. policy,"" said Takumi Tsunoda, senior economist at Shinkin Central Bank.
The Cabinet Office will publish the machinery orders data at 8:50 a.m. on Feb. 9.
The poll found Japan was likely to post a current account surplus of 1.29 trillion yen ($11.42 billion) in December, which would be 30 straight surplus month. 

The corporate goods price index (CGPI), which measures the price companies charge each other for goods and services likely stopped falling in December helped by price gains in oil- and coal-related products after 21 straight months of posting year-on-year declines.

512,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 02, 2017 07:40PM ET</span>",Leading indicator of London new home builds slumps by a third,"By Costas Pitas
LONDON (Reuters) - The number of new homes built in London fell 6 percent last year and a closely watched indicator of future supply dropped by a third, industry data showed on Friday, as the Brexit vote hit a market already coming off record highs. 
Registrations with the National House-Building Council (NHBC), when a builder pays to take out a warranty on a home about to be constructed, dropped 33 percent to 17,322 units in 2016 compared to a near record in 2015.
NHBC statistics account for around 80 percent of the market and are a leading indicator as it can take years for registrations to feed into the number of completed homes. 
Business Development Director Mark Jones said several factors were at play in the London market such as ""the timings of the registrations and the build coming through including the impact of Brexit in those early months."" 
Registrations in the capital rose marginally in the first four months of 2016 but then slumped by over 60 percent in the run-up to the June 23 Brexit vote and its immediate aftermath between May and July.
Britain's biggest builder Barratt (L:BDEV) built nearly 60 percent fewer homes in the second half of 2016 in London, saying the rising cost of land over recent years had priced it out of the market. 
It has also cut the price of top-end homes in central London by up to 10 percent, as a hike in stamp duty property tax on second homes and buy-to-let properties has pushed down prices and made the city center less attractive to buyers and builders. 
The number of new homes built in London last year fell by 6 percent to 21,464 units and rose nationwide by just over 0.5 percent to 141,175 units, far fewer than the government would have wanted in its bid to boost supply to deal with a chronic shortage. 
Several housebuilders are also concerned that future growth could be hit by any Brexit-imposed curbs on the number of Europeans coming to Britain, who make up the majority of workers on some London building sites.
Prime Minister Theresa May has said she will control immigration in response to the Brexit vote but has yet to set out specific details, prompting several sectors reliant on foreign labor to make their case to government. 
""Our lobbying is all about ensuring that we are at the top of the agenda when it comes to immigrant labor,"" said Peter Andrew, deputy chairman of the Home Builders Federation. 

""If we're to get the increases in output that the government is looking for, we are going to need the labor we've got now plus the labor required to build the increases,"" he said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits fell more than expected last week, pointing to tightening labor market conditions that should support the economy this year.
Other data on Thursday showed worker productivity slowing in the fourth quarter, which economists said suggested companies would need to keep hiring to increase output.
Increased demand for workers against the backdrop of weak productivity and a shrinking labor pool is starting to put upward pressure on wages, paving the way for interest rate increases from the Federal Reserve this year.
""It looks like firms will have to keep hiring if they want to expand output, as productivity is barely growing,"" said Joel Naroff, chief economist at Naroff Economic Advisors in Holland, Pennsylvania. ""They are going to have to make do with their workforces as the labor market continues to tighten."" 
Initial claims for state unemployment benefits fell 14,000 to a seasonally adjusted 246,000 for the week ended Jan. 28, the Labor Department said. Claims have now been below 300,000, a threshold associated with a healthy labor market, for 100 straight weeks. That is the longest stretch since 1970, when the labor market was much smaller.
The labor market is at or close to full employment, and the Fed said on Wednesday it expected labor market conditions would strengthen ""somewhat further."" A tight labor market is expected to boost wage growth and support the economy through strong consumer spending and the continued recovery of the housing market. 
The Fed, which has forecast three rate increases this year, kept its benchmark overnight lending rate unchanged in a range of 0.50 percent to 0.75 percent at the end of its latest two-day policy meeting on Wednesday. The U.S. central bank increased borrowing costs in December.
The dollar was trading marginally lower against a basket of currencies, while prices for U.S. government bonds rose. U.S. stocks were trading slightly higher. 
Economists had forecast first-time applications for jobless benefits falling to 250,000 in the latest week. The four-week moving average of claims, considered a better measure of labor market trends as it irons out week-to-week volatility, rose 2,250 to 248,000 last week.
Last week's claims data have no bearing on January's employment report, which is due to be released on Friday, as they fall outside the survey period.
RETAIL LAYOFFS SURGE
Although claims were low in January, a report on Thursday from global outplacement consultancy Challenger, Gray & Christmas showed U.S. employers announced 45,934 job cuts last month, a 37 percent jump from December and the largest number of cuts since April 2016. 
Retailers announced 22,491 layoffs, accounting for 49 percent of all job cuts recorded last month. Department store giant Macy's, which is closing 68 stores, announced 10,000 job cuts last month. Other retailers announcing layoffs included The Limited, American Apparel, Sears and Abercrombie & Fitch.
Department stores have faced stiff competition from online rivals including Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN).
According to a Reuters survey of economists, nonfarm payrolls probably increased by 175,000 jobs last month, picking up from the 156,000 jobs added in December. The unemployment rate is expected to be unchanged at 4.7 percent in January, near a nine-year low. 
There is, however, a possibility that employment gains could beat expectations after reports on Wednesday showed jumps in private sector hiring and manufacturing jobs in January. But retail payrolls pose a downside risk. 
In another report, the Labor Department said worker productivity rose at a 1.3 percent annual rate in the fourth quarter, slowing from the prior period's brisk 3.5 percent pace of increase. 
While productivity rebounded in the second half of the year after contracting in the first six months, it only increased 0.2 percent in 2016, the smallest gain since 2011. That followed a 0.9 percent gain in 2015. 
Productivity has increased at less than 1.0 percent in each of the last six years. Productivity growth averaged 1.1 percent from 2007 to 2016, well below the long-term rate of 2.1 percent from 1947 to 2016.
""The data illustrate the challenges facing businesses in terms of maintaining profitability as a tight labor market is pushing up wage costs faster than productivity,"" said John Ryding, chief economist at RDQ Economics in New York.
Unit labor costs, the price of labor per single unit of output, increased at a 1.7 percent pace in the fourth quarter, accelerating from the prior quarter's 0.2 percent rate. Unit labor costs rose 2.6 percent in 2016 after increasing 2.0 percent in 2015. 

Hourly compensation per hour rose at a 3.0 percent rate in the fourth quarter. While that was slower than the third quarter's 3.7 percent rate of increase, it continued to suggest that wage growth is picking up. Hourly compensation rose 2.8 percent in 2016 after advancing 2.9 percent in 2015.

514,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 02, 2017 11:05AM ET</span>","Bank of England, ramping up growth forecast, in no mood for rate hike","By William Schomberg and David Milliken
LONDON (Reuters) - The Bank of England made its latest sharp increase to forecasts for British economic growth in 2017 on Thursday, but appeared in no rush to raise interest rates, warning of ""twists and turns"" on the road out of the European Union.
There were signs of a partial split as some of the BoE's nine rate-setters ""moved a little closer"" to their limits for tolerating an expected overshoot of inflation above their 2 percent goal.
But the general message from the BoE was that it remained comfortable with its record low rates even as the pound's slide since June's Brexit vote pushes prices up quickly.
In response, the pound fell and British government 10-year bond yields headed for their biggest one-day decline in two months, suggesting investors were pushing back their bets on when the BoE might raise rates.
The Monetary Policy Committee voted unanimously to keep rates on hold at a record low of 0.25 percent and to leave its other stimulus programs unchanged.
Governor Mark Carney said that just because the central bank had raised its growth forecasts, it did not mean that the vote to leave the European Union would be painless.
""The Brexit journey is really just beginning. While the direction of travel is clear, there will be twists and turns along the way,"" he told a news conference.
Significantly, the BoE also said it now believed the unemployment rate could fall to 4.5 percent - down from a previous estimate of 5 percent and below the current rate of 4.8 percent - before it starts to push up inflation.
That could help the central bank to keep rates low for longer despite it announcing the second big increase in three months to its forecast for economic growth in 2017.
After Thursday's announcement, financial markets were pricing in a roughly 36 percent chance of a rate hike by the BoE this year, down from 50 percent last week, according to HSBC, while economists said it would probably not happen until mid-2019.
""The MPC may decide to start its tightening cycle only after the UK is safely out of the EU, despite a short- to medium-term peak in inflation above the MPC target of 2 percent,"" Yael Selfin, an economist with KPMG said.
Economists with RBC Capital Markets said they still expected the next move by the BoE to be a rate cut next year as the Brexit pressure on inflation hurt spending and growth.
Carney and his fellow policymakers were wrong-footed by the resilience of Britain's economy last year following the referendum decision in June to take the country out of the EU.
Britain's growth in 2016 was faster than in any other Group of Seven big rich economy, confounding the BoE's pre-referendum warnings of a swift Brexit hit to the economy.
""The thing that we missed is the strength of consumer spending and consumer confidence associated with that,"" Carney told reporters when asked about last year's forecasting failure.
STRONG GROWTH VIEW
The BoE said it now expected economic growth of 2.0 percent this year, higher than the forecasts of all but one of 50 economists polled by Reuters last month and up a lot from its previous forecast of 1.4 percent.
The new 2017 outlook towered above the forecast of 0.8 percent growth made by the bank in the weeks after the Brexit vote, when the economy seemed to be heading for a recession and the BoE cut interest rates to a record low of 0.25 percent.
Since then, Britain's consumers have carried on spending and finance minister Philip Hammond has relaxed the country's austerity drive.
Growth forecasts for 2018 and 2019 were raised by a moderate 0.1 percentage points in each year, and the BoE said it still expected rising inflation to cause household living standards to start stagnating at the end of this year.
On inflation, Carney said he expected price growth to hit the bank's 2 percent target this month but the BoE also said it now expected inflation in two years' time, a key yard-stick, to be slightly lower than it said in November.
The BoE said it eased the inflation outlook in part because of a mini-recovery in the value of sterling and the recent increase in market bets on higher interest rates.
The outlook for Britain's economy remains highly uncertain for political reasons too, related to Brexit and the policies of new U.S. President Donald Trump. Carney said the scope for central banks to dominate the global economy was diminishing, with interest rates already so low.
""In many respects, we're coming to the last seconds of central bankers' 15 minutes of fame, to use the Warhol line, which is a good thing,"" he said.

U.S. artist Andy Warhol once said that in the future everyone would be world-famous for 15 minutes.

The Labor Department said on Thursday that nonfarm productivity, which measures hourly output per worker, rose at a 1.3 percent annual rate. Productivity in the third quarter was revised up to show a 3.5 percent pace of increase instead of the previously reported 3.1 percent rise.
Economists had forecast productivity increasing at a 1.0 percent rate in the fourth quarter. Productivity rose 0.2 percent in 2016, the smallest gain since 2011, after increasing 0.9 percent in 2015.
The slowdown in productivity was flagged in last week's gross domestic product report, which showed output increasing at a 1.9 percent pace in the fourth quarter, decelerating from the third quarter's brisk 3.5 percent pace.
Weak productivity has boosted employment growth as companies hire more workers to maintain output, which could help explain the divergence between payroll gains and economic growth. The economy grew 1.6 percent in 2016, while job growth averaged 180,000 per month.
Productivity has increased at an annual rate of less than 1.0 percent in each of the last six years. Productivity growth averaged 1.1 percent from 2007 to 2016, well below the long-term rate of 2.1 percent from 1947 to 2016.
Soft productivity, which has significantly lowered the economy's long-run potential, could undermine U.S. living standards. Some economists believe productivity is not being measured correctly, especially on the information technology side.
In the fourth quarter, output per worker increased at a 2.2 percent rate. Unit labor costs, the price of labor per single unit of output, increased at a 1.7 percent pace. They rose at a 0.2 percent rate in the prior period.
Unit labor costs rose 2.6 percent in 2016 after increasing 2.0 percent in 2015. Hourly compensation per hour rose at a 3.0 percent rate in the fourth quarter. While that was slower than the third quarter's 3.7 percent rate of increase, it continued to suggest that wage growth is picking up.

In a report, the U.S. Department of Labor said the number of individuals filing for initial jobless benefits in the week ending January 28 decreased by 14,000 to a seasonally adjusted 246,000 from the previous week’s total of 260,000 which was revised from an initial reading of 259,000.
Analysts had expected jobless claims to drop by 9,000 from the original reading to 250,000 last week.
First-time jobless claims below the 300,000-level are usually associated with a firming labor market.
Meanwhile, continuing jobless claims in the week ended January 21 also declined to 2.064 million from 2.103 million in the preceding week, which was revised from 2.100 million.
Analysts had expected continuing claims to decrease to 2.065 million.
The four-week moving average was 248,000, a 2,250 increase from the previous week's 245,750 (initially 245,500).
The monthly average is seen as a more accurate gauge of labor trends because it reduces volatility in the week-to-week data.

ROME (Reuters) - World food prices rose to a near two-year high in January and look set to be higher and more volatile in 2017, the United Nations food agency said on Thursday.
Food prices on the Food and Agriculture Organization's (FAO) index have fallen for five straight years due to ample supply, a slowing global economy and a strong U.S. dollar.
But in January, the index, which measures monthly price changes for a basket of cereals, oilseeds, dairy products, meat and sugar, averaged 173.8 points, a high not seen since February 2015.
The 2.1 percent monthly rise was driven by surges in sugar quotations and export prices for cereals and vegetable oils. 
FAO Senior Economist Abdolreza Abbassian said outside factors including concerns about U.S. President Donald Trump's trade policy in North America would probably contribute to more volatility in food prices.
""Uncertainties are going to create problems for international markets, in terms of where Mexico will source its corn, would the current trend continue with its closest (trade) partner, the United States,"" Abbassian said. 
Relations between major grain exporters Russia and Ukraine could also have an impact, he said, adding food prices overall were likely to be broadly firmer but more volatile this year than in 2016.
A 9.9 percent rise in the price of sugar in January was driven by expectations of protracted tightness in supplies from Brazil, India and Thailand, a trend Abbassian said was likely to continue.

FAO raised its forecast for global cereals output in 2016-17 to 2.592 billion tonnes, based primarily on larger-than-expected wheat harvests in Australia and Russia.

The Markit/CIPS construction purchasing managers' index (PMI) hit a five-month low of 52.2 in January after December's nine-month high of 54.2, a steeper decline than all forecasts in a Reuters poll, though still indicating modest growth.
The index also showed the sharpest rise in costs since August 2008, as sterling's slide since the referendum decision in June to leave the European Union pushed up the price of imported raw materials.
The surge in price pressures echoed a record rise in raw materials costs reported by manufacturers in a similar survey on Wednesday.
""There were more positive trends in terms of staff hiring and business optimism regarding the year-ahead outlook,"" Markit economist Tim Moore said.
The Bank of England is expected to revise up its growth forecasts, and possibly those for inflation too, when it gives a quarterly economic update later on Thursday.
Construction firms reported a boost to their workloads thanks to Britain's resilient economic growth since the referendum and a strong pipeline of new projects, Moore said.
The Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors had a similar message in a separate survey also released on Thursday.
A growing majority of firms expect output to increase over the coming year, led by hopes of more road and railway building, RICS said.
Finance minister Philip Hammond promised more spending on transport infrastructure in a budget statement in November. He set aside 23 billion pounds ($29 billion) to spend on boosting economic productivity over the next five years.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Federal Reserve held interest rates steady on Wednesday in its first meeting since President Donald Trump took office, but painted a relatively upbeat picture of the U.S. economy that suggested it was on track to tighten monetary policy this year.
The U.S. central bank said job gains remained solid, inflation had increased and economic confidence was rising, although it gave no firm signal on the timing of its next rate move.
Fed policymakers are still awaiting clarity on the possible impact of Trump's economic policies.
""Measures of consumer and business sentiment have improved of late,"" the Fed said in a unanimous statement following a two-day policy meeting in which it left its benchmark interest rate in a range of 0.50 percent to 0.75 percent.
The Fed also highlighted that the unemployment rate, currently at 4.7 percent, was still hovering near its recent low.
Financial markets were little changed after the rate decision, while investors were still expecting the next rate increase to occur in June, according to Fed funds futures data compiled by the CME Group (NASDAQ:CME).
The Fed raised rates in December for only the second time in a decade and forecast three rate increases in 2017.
Fed Chair Janet Yellen recently underscored that, with the economy near full employment, the central bank risked a ""nasty surprise"" on inflation if it is too slow with rate hikes.
The Fed said in its statement that it still expects inflation to rise to its 2 percent target in the medium term, although it noted that inflation compensation was still low and long-term inflation expectations were little changed.
It did, however, indicate that the effects of weak oil prices had ended, something that will give it a ""clean"" read on inflation in the future. On Monday, the Commerce Department reported an uptick in inflation to 1.7 percent.
""The economy continues to chug along and sentiment has improved. The Fed does sound more confident about eventually getting to its 2 percent inflation target,"" said Brian Jacobsen, chief portfolio strategist at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) Funds Management.
FISCAL POLICY UNCERTAINTY
Investors had all but ruled out a rate increase this week, given the uncertainty surrounding Trump's fiscal and trade policies and how they would affect the Fed's outlook.
Trump's promises on infrastructure spending, tax cuts, regulation rollbacks and a renegotiation of trade deals could quickly spur higher inflation, which may necessitate a faster pace of rate hikes.
The businessman-turned-politician has offered few specifics on his economic plans or a timeline for their rollout, while the announcement of policies viewed by many as protectionist and an immigration crackdown have caused market jitters in recent days.
""There is still uncertainty about fiscal policy, so the Fed is likely waiting for a bit more data and more certainty,"" said Tony Bedikian, head of global markets at Citizens Bank.
Earlier on Wednesday, data showed U.S. factory activity accelerated to more than a two-year high in January while a report by a payrolls processor showed U.S. private employers added 246,000 jobs in January, far above analysts' expectations.
The Labor Department is scheduled to release its closely-watched monthly jobs report for January on Friday. Yellen may also give a clearer signal on the Fed's thinking when she provides semi-annual testimony to Congress in mid-February.

There are seven more Fed policy meetings in 2017, with the next one scheduled for March 14-15.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. factory activity accelerated to more than a two-year high in January amid sustained gains in new orders and raw material costs, pointing to a recovery in manufacturing as domestic demand strengthens and the drag from low oil prices ebbs.
Other data on Wednesday showed private employers boosted hiring last month. While construction spending slipped in December, the underlying trend remained strong. The signs of momentum in the economy at the start of the year came as the Federal Reserve's policy-setting committee met for a second day.
The U.S. central bank, which has forecast three rate hikes this year, is not expected to raise rates when the meeting ends later on Wednesday. The Fed hiked its benchmark overnight interest rate in December to a range of 0.50 percent to 0.75 percent.
""The economy is off to the races with the wind at its back. The Fed will lift rates three times in 2017 for sure, and maybe they might need to add a rate hike or start the year earlier with a policy firming in March,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG Union Bank in New York.
The Institute for Supply Management (ISM) said its index of national factory activity increased 1.5 percentage points to a reading of 56.0 last month, the highest since November 2014 when oil prices started collapsing.
A reading above 50 indicates an expansion in manufacturing, which accounts for about 12 percent of the U.S. economy. Some of the increase likely reflects a surge in business confidence following last November's election of Donald Trump as president.
Trump has pledged to cut taxes and reduce regulations. The business mogul-turned politician, who was sworn in as president on Jan. 20, has yet to offer more details about any fiscal stimulus package.
Manufacturers' comments on business conditions last month ranged from ""good"" to ""stronger."" Some described demand as ""very"" steady and others reported that sales bookings were ""exceeding expectations.""
The ISM's production sub-index increased 2.0 percentage points and a gauge of new orders edged up 0.1 percentage point, reaching its highest level in just over two years.
A measure of factory employment jumped 3.3 percentage points to its highest level since August 2014, suggesting factory payrolls likely rose in January for a second straight month.
Manufacturers reported paying more for raw materials. That was the 11th consecutive monthly increase, indicating inflation pressures at the factory gate could be building up. The ISM's prices index increased 3.5 percentage points in January to its highest level since May 2011.
""If higher prices in the goods-producing sector were sustained, this would likely help reassure Fed officials that inflation will reach and maintain its two percent target,"" said John Silvia, chief economist at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) Securities in Charlotte, North Carolina.
""However, the strong dollar will likely help keep a lid on inflation.""
MANUFACTURING RECOVERING
A collapse in oil prices in 2015 and a surge in the dollar weighed on manufacturing for much of last year, with most of the pain coming through sharp cutbacks in business spending on equipment. Oil prices have since risen above $50 per barrel, lifting some of the fog off manufacturing.
The manufacturing rebound was also underscored by a separate survey on Wednesday from data firm Markit.
The government reported last Friday that business spending on equipment increased at a 3.1 percent annualized rate in the fourth quarter, the first rise in over a year.
January's data so far suggests that the economy is poised for an acceleration after gross domestic product increased at a 1.9 percent annualized rate in the fourth quarter. The deceleration from the third quarter's brisk 3.5 percent pace reflected a wider trade deficit.
The dollar was trading higher against a basket of currencies, while prices for U.S. government bonds fell. U.S. stocks were marginally lower, having surrendered earlier gains.
Separately on Wednesday, the ADP National Employment Report showed private employers added 246,000 jobs in January, up from 151,000 in December. The report, jointly developed with Moody's Analytics, came ahead of the Labor Department's more comprehensive employment report on Friday, which includes both public and private sector payrolls.
The ADP report has a spotty record predicting the private payrolls component of the employment report because of methodology differences. Still, economists said the ADP report and the jump in the factory jobs measure of the ISM survey raised the possibility that January nonfarm payrolls could beat expectations.
""While we wouldn't dismiss the strength of the ADP number entirely, we would treat it with some caution, particularly in January,"" said Paul Ashworth, chief U.S. economist at Capital Economics in Toronto.
According to a Reuters survey of economists, nonfarm employment probably rose by 175,000 jobs last month, picking up from the 156,000 jobs added in December.

A third report from the Commerce Department showed construction spending slipped 0.2 percent in December after shooting up 0.9 percent in November. Construction spending increased 4.2 percent from December 2015.

527,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 01, 2017 12:10PM ET</span>","Global FDI fell 13 percent in 2016, facing bumpy 2017: U.N.","By Tom Miles
GENEVA (Reuters) - Global foreign direct investment (FDI) fell 13 percent in 2016 and a possible 10 percent rise in 2017 is beset by uncertainty, the United Nations trade and development agency UNCTAD said on Wednesday.
FDI, which largely comprises cross-border mergers and acquisitions (M&A) and investment in start-up projects abroad, is a bellwether of globalization and a potential sign of growth of corporate supply chains and future trade ties. 
""FDI recovery continues along a bumpy road,"" said UNCTAD Secretary-General Mukhisa Kituyi. ""Significant uncertainties about the shape of future economic policy developments could hamper FDI in the short-term.""
Global FDI was an estimated $1.52 trillion in 2016. The United States was the top destination with $385 billion, an 11 percent rise from 2015. Britain was second with $179 billion, up almost six-fold because of three big M&A deals, and China third with $139 billion. 
Inflows to India and Africa both slipped about 5 percent, and Latin America by 19 percent. Europe saw a 29 percent fall, partly because of a significant drop in investment channeled via low tax regimes in Switzerland, Ireland and the Netherlands.
The 2017 growth forecast is based on expected economic growth and rising commodity prices, but the outlook is clouded by uncertainty over the policies of U.S. President Donald Trump and the evolution of Britain's plan to leave the European Union.
Until the fog lifts, companies might keep plans on hold, said UNCTAD's investment chief James Zhan.
If Trump cuts taxes on repatriated profits, U.S. firms will have an incentive to bring foreign earnings back to the United States, but that might not translate into an investment boom there, Zhan said. 
""The challenge is that those who are holding large earnings overseas may not be those companies that are in the business of infrastructure or those areas (requiring investment), and besides, the interest rate in the U.S. has been low, so liquidity or capital shortage hasn’t been a problem.”
While domestic tax enticements may mean the United States draws down its stock of investment globally, China is going in the other direction, having become a net source of FDI for the first time in 2016.

Last year China was the third largest outward investor globally, with big spending in Brazil, Germany and Spain. But after several years of ""spectacular"" growth, China's boom in outward FDI may slow down this year due to policies to reduce capital flight, Zhan said.

The Commerce Department said on Wednesday that construction spending slipped 0.2 percent to $1.18 trillion. Construction spending in November increased by an unrevised 0.9 percent.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast construction spending gaining 0.2 percent in December.
Construction spending increased 4.5 percent in 2016 after surging 10.6 percent in 2015.
December's drop in construction spending could have implications on the fourth-quarter gross domestic product estimate. The government reported last week that GDP increased at a 1.9 percent annualized rate in the fourth quarter after accelerating at a 3.5 percent pace in the July-September period.
Investment in private nonresidential structures -- which include factories, hospitals and roads -- declined at a 5.0 percent rate in the fourth quarter after rising at a 12.0 percent pace in the prior period.
In December, spending on private construction projects gained 0.2 percent, reaching its highest level since July 2006.
It was boosted by 0.5 percent increase in spending on residential projects.
Investment in private nonresidential structures was unchanged after shooting up 0.8 percent the prior month.
Public construction spending dropped 1.7 percent in December. The drop, which was the largest since July, followed four straight monthly increase.
Outlays on state and local government construction projects declined 2.4 percent, also snapping fourth straight months of increases. Federal government construction spending jumped 6.1 percent to the highest level since October 2015.

It was the third straight month of gains in federal government spending on construction projects.

The Institute for Supply Management (ISM) said its index of manufacturing activity rose to 56.0 last month from December’s reading of 54.5. That was its highest level since November 2014.
Analysts had forecast a smaller increase to 55.0.
A reading above 50.0 indicates expansion in the manufacturing sector, below indicates contraction.
The ISM indicated that the survey suggested that the overall economy had grown for the 92nd consecutive month.
The new orders index rose to 60.4 in January from 60.3 a month earlier.
The employment index advanced to 56.1 last month from the prior 52.8 and compared to forecasts for an increase to 53.1.
The prices paid index rose to 69.0 in January, from the previous month’s reading of 65.5 and compared to expectations for an increase to 66.0. That was the 11th consecutive increase in the price of raw materials.
""The PMI, New Orders, and Production Indexes all registered their highest levels since November of 2014, and comments from the panel are generally positive regarding demand levels and business conditions,” ISM chair Bradley Holcomb commented in the release.
After the report, which was published simultaneously with construction spending for December, the dollar strengthened. EUR/USD was trading at 1.0741 from around 1.0801 ahead of the release of the data, GBP/USD was at 1.2640 from 1.2648 earlier, while USD/JPY was at 113.84 from 113.24 earlier.

(Reuters) - Small U.S. firms borrowed slightly more in December than in the prior month, data released on Wednesday showed, but more were repaying existing loans late, suggesting that default rates may rise this year.
The Thomson Reuters/PayNet Small Business Lending Index rose to 129.7 in December from a downwardly revised 129.1 in November. Measured from a year earlier, when the index registered 135.6, it was the sixth decline in seven months. Movements in the index typically correspond with movements in gross domestic product growth a quarter or two ahead.
""It's an improved mood, but the questions are still out there on the policies and how they are going to play out,"" said Bill Phelan, PayNet's chief executive and founder, referring to policies under U.S. President Donald Trump, who was elected in November.
Since taking the top political U.S. post on Jan. 20, Trump has continued to meet with CEOs of big U.S. companies to urge them to boost jobs at home, and has signed a number of executive orders directing changes in immigration, health insurance, governments rule-writing and other policies that leave small businesses unclear on where they stand.
The U.S. economy grew at a 1.9 percent annual pace in the fourth quarter, the latest government figures showed, slower than in the third quarter but close to what many economists see as its long-term potential.
Small business borrowing is a key barometer of growth because small companies tend to do much of the hiring that drives economic gains.
""Small businesses are show-me kind of companies, and then they will get more active if they like the direction it's going,"" Phelan said.
Companies also having a harder time paying back existing debts, PayNet data showed. The share of loans more than 30 days past due rose in December to 1.69 percent, the highest in four years.

LONDON (Reuters) - Sterling's fall since Britain voted to leave the European Union stoked the sharpest rise in factory costs on record last month but offered little boost to exports, tainting otherwise robust manufacturing growth at the start of 2017.
Markit/CIPS UK Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) edged down to 55.9 from December's 2-1/2 year peak of 56.1, matching the consensus forecast in a Reuters poll.
The survey out on Wednesday suggested Britain's economy continues to expand at a solid rate after outpacing its rivals last year, with the PMI's gauge of manufacturing output pointing to the fastest growth since May 2014.
But it also drove home the view shared by Bank of England policymakers, who meet this week, that rising prices will soon put a brake on household spending, a key driver of the economy.
Factories' raw material costs rose at the fastest pace since PMI records began 25 years ago - fueled by the pound's near 20 percent drop against the dollar since June's Brexit vote, as well as higher prices for steel and oil.
In response, manufacturers raised the prices they charged for their goods at the fastest pace since April 2011.
In previous months spiraling cost pressures had been matched with an improvement in export orders, but this faded in January's PMI. Orders from abroad rose at the weakest rate since last May, before the Brexit vote.
""With cost pressures increasingly feeding though to higher selling prices at factories, it looks inevitable that consumer price inflation will rise further in coming months,"" said Rob Dobson, senior economist at IHS Markit, which compiles the survey.
""The question is whether increased cost ... pressure will act as a drag on manufacturing growth going forward."" Dobson said manufacturers sounded relaxed about this, with optimism at an eight-month high. A recent survey from industry association EEF also showed manufacturers were confident about the year ahead, despite doubts about the economic outlook.
""Taken alongside robust output growth, rising new order inflows and further job creation, all signs are pointing to a solid contribution to UK GDP from manufacturing during the opening quarter of 2017,"" Dobson said.

Manufacturing accounts for around a tenth of British economic output, and recent strong manufacturing PMIs have not fully transferred into subsequent official growth statistics.

In a report, market research group Markit said that its U.K. manufacturing PMI slipped to a seasonally adjusted 55.9 last month from a reading of 56.1 in December.
The reading was in line with the consensus forecast.
On the index, a reading above 50.0 indicates industry expansion, below indicates contraction.
Markit indicated that output rose at the fastest rate since May 2014 as new order intakes expanded at a robust pace.
However, the research group also noted that purchase price inflation hit a new survey record, advancing at the fastest pace in the quarter-century history of the report.
“The question is whether increased cost inflationary pressure will act as a drag on manufacturing growth going forward,” Rob Dobson, senior economist at survey compiler Markit, said.
Dobson added that “all signs are pointing to a solid contribution to U.K. growth from manufacturing during the opening quarter of 2017.""

Markit's Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) for manufacturing, which accounts for about a fifth of the economy, rose to 56.4 from 55.6 in December.
This was the highest level since January 2014 and above the 50 line that separates growth from contraction for the 26th consecutive month. The final figure was just one notch below the flash reading issued in late January.
""Germany's manufacturing sector started 2017 in much the same way that it finished 2016, with growth accelerating,"" IHS Markit economist Philip Leake said.
""The sector's impressive performance bodes well for GDP growth in the first quarter, building on the strongest expansion in five years across 2016 as a whole.""
Manufacturers enjoyed increased demand from both domestic and foreign clients in January, the survey showed, with new orders rising at the fastest rate in three years.
The sector's overall solid performance was also underpinned by unusually strong job creation as factories hired new staff at a rate not seen since August 2011.
The rate of cost inflation accelerated sharply, with input prices climbing at the fastest since May 2011 and firms citing higher costs for commodities, steel, oil and energy.

""Some companies raised their tariffs to protect margins but, with the pace of cost inflation still far exceeding that for charges, there seems scope for further price hikes in the early part of the year,"" Leake said.

Nationwide said house prices were up 4.3 percent year-on-year in January, their smallest increase since November 2015 and slowing from 4.5 percent in December. 
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast a marginally smaller slowdown to 4.4 percent.
On the month, prices edged up 0.2 percent after a 0.8 percent jump in December.
""The outlook for the housing market remains clouded, reflecting the uncertainty surrounding economic prospects more broadly,"" Nationwide economist Robert Gardner said.
Britain's economy was creating fewer jobs than earlier in 2017, and rising consumer price inflation was eating into households' disposable income, he added.
Nationwide expects the year-on-year rise in house prices to slow to around 2 percent in 2017 - though this still contrasts with widespread predictions of an outright fall after June's vote to leave the European Union.
Bank of England data on Tuesday showed lenders approved the most mortgages since March in December, but the increase was less than economists had forecast.
Samuel Tombs, economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said a fall in mortgage rates in late 2016 had not boosted activity as much as expected, and saw further headwinds for home-buyers now lenders' funding costs were starting to rise again.

BEIJING (Reuters) - China's manufacturing sector expanded for the sixth month in a row in January as the world's second-largest economy continued to benefit from record bank lending and a construction boom.
The improvement in the industrial sector could give the government more room to tackle high debt levels in many parts of the economy this year, though analysts are not sure if current growth levels can be sustained amid growing risks at home and abroad.
U.S. President Donald Trump and a top economics adviser on Tuesday unleashed a barrage of criticism against China, Germany and Japan, saying the three key U.S. trading partners were engaged in devaluing their currencies to the harm of American companies and consumers.
On the election campaign trail, Trump had threatened to slap heavy tariffs on U.S. imports of Chinese goods.
A slowing property market could also dent China's industrial activity this year, dampening demand for building materials from glass to steel.
The official Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) released on Wednesday stood at 51.3 in January, dipping marginally from 51.4 in December but slightly better than economists had expected.
The reading remained well above the 50 level which separates expansion from contraction on a monthly basis, indicating that China's factories had carried solid momentum through from a rebound in the second half of 2016, which helped fuel a global manufacturing revival.
""Today's PMI readings suggest that China's economy continued to perform well last month,"" Julian Evans-Pritchard, Singapore-based China economist for Capital Economics, said in a research note.
""China's recent recovery appears to remain largely intact for now.""
Still, ""the more important question is whether or not the current strength will be sustained. We doubt that it will be given how reliant the recent recovery has been on support from monetary and fiscal policy that is now being withdrawn,"" Evans-Pritchard said.
A breakdown of key PMI indexes showed production and new order growth remained solid last month, though the pace of expansion eased for both from December.
Production remained fairly robust, with the output index at 53.1 compared with 53.3 in December.
However, export orders grew at only a marginally better pace, with the index edging up to 50.3.
Even as Trump ramps up his criticism of China, it has lagged an export recovery which is being seen by some of its North Asian neighbors. South Korea on Wednesday reported its shipments rose in January for a third consecutive month and at the fastest pace in nearly five years.
Persistent export weakness has forced Beijing to rely on higher infrastructure spending to boost growth, which along with a housing frenzy has boosted demand for building materials.
Rising commodity prices and stronger demand have in turn boosted profits for industrial firms, and helped revive inflation expectations worldwide.
However, some analysts question whether the growth rate can be maintained once the impact of earlier stimulus measures begins to wear off and as the property market starts to cool, which is widely expected.
Indeed, economists at ANZ noted that growth in construction services seems be faltering, though at 61.1 the index remained above last year's average of around 60.
The factory PMI figures were seasonally adjusted, but economists and investors are generally cautious about China data early in the year due to the timing of the long Lunar New Year holidays, when many factories and offices shut.
If the economy remains on solid footing, China's leaders are expected to turn their attention to containing financial risks this year, accepting slightly lower growth of around 6.5 percent compared with 6.7 percent in 2016.
The central bank is also moving very gradually to a tightening policy bias, raising the prospect of higher borrowing cots later in the year.
A separate reading on the services sector showed the pace of growth picked up in January from the previous month.
The official non-manufacturing PMI stood at 54.6 in January, up from 54.5 in December, and well above the 50-point mark.
The services sector accounted for over half of China's economy last year and for the majority of growth, as rising wages give Chinese consumers the opportunity travel and eat out more.

Policymakers are counting on growth in services to offset the stubborn weakness in exports that is dragging on the economy.

However, some economists may temper their optimism due to concerns that growing U.S. trade protectionism could threaten Japan's export-focused economy.
The final Markit/Nikkei Japan Final Manufacturing Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) was a seasonally adjusted 52.7, slightly below a flash reading of 52.8 but still above the final reading of 52.4 in December.
The index remained above the 50 threshold that separates expansion from contraction for the fifth consecutive month, and showed that activity expanded at the fastest since March 2014.
The index for new export orders was 53.1, just below a preliminary 53.2 but still indicating the fastest gain in 12 months.
The index for total new orders, which measures both domestic and external demand, was 54.0, versus a flash reading of 54.1 and a final 53.2 in December. The data confirmed that new orders grew at the fastest in 13 months.
Recent data have suggested that Japan's sluggish economy may be slowly regaining traction.
In a quarterly review of its forecasts, the Bank of Japan on Tuesday raised its growth estimates for the fiscal year beginning in April and the following year, nodding to brightening prospects for exports.
But the central bank left unchanged its already optimistic inflation forecasts for the coming years, despite external factors that push up prices, such as a rebound in oil prices and rising import bills from a weak yen. [L4N1FL0A]
""Risks to both economic activity and prices are skewed to the downside,"" it said.
The PMI survey showed input prices accelerated to a 22-month high due to higher costs of raw materials stemming from weakness in the yen and higher fuel costs. But Japanese firms were only able to pass on only modest increases in the prices of their goods.
Some economists have expressed concern about Japan's economic outlook because its exports could suffer if U.S. President Donald Trump adopts protectionist trade policies.

Japan is hammering out plans to show U.S. President Donald Trump its firms are ready to create U.S. jobs, according to a document whose contents were revealed to Reuters, as Prime Minister Shinzo Abe prepares for a summit where automotive trade will be high on the agenda.

The British Retail Consortium (BRC) said shop prices fell 1.7 percent last month compared with a year ago after a 1.4 percent decline in December.
""Fluctuations in the monthly figures belie an underlying trend of building cost pressures that are gradually feeding through from the fall in sterling combined with higher commodity prices,"" said Helen Dickinson, chief executive of the BRC.

The Bank of England expects inflation to rise above its 2 percent target in the coming months, pushed up largely by the fall in the value of the pound since June's Brexit vote.
However, economists predict the BoE will not raise interest rates until 2019 at the earliest because of an expected slowdown in the economy caused by the reduced spending power for consumers and lower business investment.

Recent business surveys have pointed to surging price pressures for firms in the services, manufacturing and construction sectors.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. consumer confidence retreated from a 15-year high in January likely as some of the election euphoria fizzled, but households remained upbeat about the labor market, suggesting that the economy would continue to grow this year.
Other data on Tuesday showed an acceleration in house prices in November, which should further boost household wealth and support consumer spending even as wage growth remains moderate. Consumer sentiment surged in the aftermath of Donald Trump's election as president last November. 
The jump was in tandem with a stock market rally as both consumers and investors focused on Trump's pledge to cut taxes and reduce regulations, policy proposals that have been viewed as pro-business and favorable for economic growth. 
""The moderation in consumer optimism is likely attributable to a return to normalcy following the typical bounce in confidence that follows a presidential election,"" said Jim Baird, chief investment officer at Plante Moran Financial Advisors in Kalamazoo, Michigan. 
""The bottom line is that the consumer sector is still... poised for further spending growth in the coming months, providing a key support to the economy as a whole.""
The Conference Board said its consumer confidence index fell to 111.8 this month from an downwardly revised reading of 113.3 in December, which was still the highest since August 2001. The index was previously reported at 113.7 in December. 
While consumers' assessment of current business conditions improved sharply this month, they were less confident about the outlook. Some economists said consumers were likely opting for caution until the Trump administration offers more details on the fiscal stimulus, especially tax cuts. 
""The Trump rally effect on consumer's hearts and minds is starting to fade as it is apparent this administration will face a rocky road if it does not tone down its harsh rhetoric,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG Union Bank in New York.
""The longer it takes the Trump administration to come out with specific proposals and programs to make America great again, consumers will continue to stay cautious.""
The survey's so-called labor market differential, derived from data on respondents' views on whether jobs are plentiful or hard to get, rose to 5.9 percentage points from 3.3 points in December. 
This measure, which closely correlates to the unemployment rate in the Labor Department's employment report, suggests that the jobless rate and labor market slack could decline further this year.
The reports were released ahead of the start of the Federal Reserve's two-day policy meeting on Tuesday. The U.S. central bank, which has forecast three rate hikes this year, is not expected to raise rates at this week's meeting. 
The Fed hiked its benchmark overnight interest rate in December to a range of 0.50 percent to 0.75 percent.
TRUMP ROILS MARKETS
U.S. financial markets were little moved by the data, with investor attention focused on comments by Trump, which appeared to express concerns about the value of the dollar. 
In comments directed to the pharmaceutical industry, Trump said currency devaluation by other countries had increased drugmakers' outsourcing of their production and called on the companies to make more of their goods in the United States.
The dollar fell against a basket of currencies, while prices for U.S. government bonds rose. Stocks on Wall Street were trading lower, with investors continuing to fret over Trump's isolationist policies, including travel restrictions to the United States which sparked protests across U.S. cities and criticism from several corporate leaders. 
Other data on Tuesday showed the S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller composite index of home prices in 20 metropolitan areas increased 5.3 percent in the 12 months to November after rising 5.1 percent in October. While the acceleration in house prices offers a boost to households, it could restrain home sales. 
Mortgage rates have risen above 4 percent, while wage growth remains moderate. In a third report, the Labor Department said wages increased 0.5 percent in the fourth quarter after a similar gain in the previous period.
That slowed the year-on-year rate of increase to 2.3 percent from 2.4 percent in the year to September. While the quarterly data continues to show moderate wage growth even as the labor market tightens, anecdotal evidence points to an acceleration amid efforts by companies to retain and attract skilled workers.
Minimum wage increases being implemented by some states are also boosting wage growth. The Fed's latest Beige Book showed wages in some districts were being pushed up ""a bit"" by increases in the minimum wage and that most districts reported that wage pressures had increased. 
The Fed said information from many districts indicated that labor markets were expected to ""continue to tighten in 2017, with wage pressures likely to rise.""
According to data from job site Glassdoor, wages rose 2.9 percent year-on-year in December, matching the increase in average hourly earnings reported by the government in last month's employment report. 
The Atlanta Fed's ""Wage Growth Tracker"" shows wages increased 3.5 percent year-on-year in December.
""With a near-record job openings and a 4.7 percent unemployment rate, it's unlikely much slack remains,"" said Andrew Chamberlain, Glassdoor's chief economist. 

""While it's true many working-age Americans have left the labor market in recent years, and those sidelined workers may be depressing wages somewhat, we expect wage growth to accelerate during the first half of 2017.""

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Inflation in the euro zone has risen to just below the European Central Bank's target, economic growth is accelerating at greater speed than in the United States, and unemployment has hit a more than seven-year low.
Myriad data releases showed on Tuesday that the 19-member currency bloc's economy is on the mend - a confirmation of recovery that will intensify political pressure on the European Central Bank to haul back its generous stimulus program.
But while the noise from hawks in countries like Germany will undoubtedly get louder, the ECB is likely to stand firm with its policies in the near term, believing some of the key data is not sustainable. 
Inflation accelerated to 1.8 percent year-on-year in January, Eurostat estimated, up from 1.1 percent in December, leaving it just shy of the ECB's medium-term target of below but close to 2 percent.
It was the highest rate since February 2013 and came after data in the past two days that showed prices rising in Germany, France and Spain, three of the bloc's four biggest economies.
But core inflation, which excludes volatile prices of energy and unprocessed food and which is the ECB's focus, came in only stable, at 0.9 percent year-on-year.
ECB President Mario Draghi has said he will look past energy price fluctuations until underlying inflation picks up in a ""convincing"" way.
One of Draghi's rate-setting colleagues, Ewald Nowotny, has also pretty much shut down any move soon, particularly on tapering, or easing off its asset-buying program - something economists have noted. 
""With core inflation still weak, it seems unlikely that this will cause the ECB to change course"" on its bond-buying program, said Bert Colijn, economist at bank ING.
Nonetheless, the barrage of positive economic news is likely to mean some policy change ahead. 
""We're seeing a sharp jump in inflation in many countries ... this situation could lead to a tightening of monetary policy from central banks and a rise in interest rates over the long term,"" Spanish Economy Minister Luis de Guindos said, referring to the global rather than specifically euro zone picture.
Spain's year-on-year inflation rate in January came in at 3.0 percent - but de Guindos said he expected it to ease back in the second quarter.
Energy prices jumped 8.1 percent year-on-year in January after a 2.6 percent increase in December and unprocessed food was 3.3 percent more expensive than a year earlier.
UPWARDS
But the euro zone is clearly enjoying something of an economic renaissance, the beneficiary of just over 1.5 trillion euros in stimulus from the ECB and negligible borrowing costs. 
Eurostat said euro zone gross domestic product rose 0.5 percent quarter-on-quarter in the last three months of 2016 for a 1.8 percent year-on-year rise.
The quarter-on-quarter growth would mean an annualized rate of 2 percent, higher than the 1.9 percent annualized rate reported for the U.S. economy, the world's biggest.
Whether this can last will depend on a number of factors, not least of which is that if inflation keeps rising, consumer spending may be hit.
Bringing political risk into the mix, there are also elections ahead in France, the Netherlands and possibly Italy.
""We suspect the euro zone may find it difficult to sustain this momentum amid appreciable political uncertainties during 2017 and likely reduced consumer purchasing power due to higher inflation,"" said Howard Archer, economist at IHS Global Insight.
But stronger economic growth also helped bring down the bloc's unemployment rate to 9.6 percent in December, the lowest since May 2009, before Greece's debt crisis broke out.
Joblessness has been one of the euro zone's biggest problems, triggering demands for economic reforms to free up labor markets.
""This starts to get closer to figures that would justify more wage pressures, but it seems unlikely that this will happen in a meaningful way in the first half of 2017,"" ING's Colijn said.

""Nevertheless, the ECB will look at this batch of data with a mix of joy and concern, as it does show that the economy is moving in the right direction, but it will probably bring out the hawks early.""

577,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 31, 2017 07:40AM ET</span>","French economy shows no sign of election angst, ends year on robust footing","By Michel Rose
PARIS (Reuters) - The French economy ended last year on a strong footing, picking up speed in the final quarter after a lackluster performance in the previous two quarters thanks to more buoyant consumer and investment spending which showed no sign of abating ahead of this spring's presidential election.
Economic output in the euro zone second-largest economy grew by 0.4 percent in the fourth quarter of 2016, in line with expectations and faster than the 0.2 percent increase in the previous three months, the INSEE national statistics agency said on Tuesday.
However, the end-of-year pick-up was not enough to push French growth for 2016 as a whole above the 1.2 percent registered in 2015, with 2016 GDP growth standing at 1.1 percent, INSEE said. With foreign trade acting as the main drag, it also failed to meet the government's own 1.4 percent target on which it based its budget for this year.
French Finance Minister Michel Sapin nonetheless took heart in the data.
""Household and business confidence stand at a very high level and are auguring a very dynamic start to 2017, in terms of activity as well as job creation,"" he said in a statement to Reuters. 
Consumer spending, the traditional engine of the 2 trillion euro economy, rebounded 0.6 percent in the fourth quarter after barely registering any growth in the previous six months, which had been marred by strikes against labor reforms and lower tourist spending following a deadly Islamist attack in Nice.
In a positive sign for the coming year, investment spending sharply picked up, with companies ramping up investment by 1.3 percent in the fourth quarter, while households' reached 0.9 percent as the property market improved.
Leading indicators such as Markit's purchasing managers index showed activity in the French private sector has started the year on a solid footing, reaching levels not seen in more than 5-1/2 years in January.
The pick-up in French growth also comes amid signs of a more robust recovery in the wider eurozone.
""The big question mark over the horizon is whether economic activity will be affected prior to the oncoming presidential elections,"" Diego Iscaro, economist at IHS Markit said in a note.
""It is fair to say that there are not any indications so far suggesting that consumer or firms are in a 'wait and see' mode, although this situation may change as the election gets closer,"" he added.
France's presidential elections pose the ""greatest existential risk for Europe,""  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) strategists said on Tuesday, although they added that supportive European Central Bank (ECB) policies could limit the elections' impact on the market.
Investors have pushed benchmark French government bonds yields higher on fears that far-right leader Marine Le Pen could create an upset similar to the Brexit vote or Donald Trump's election in the United States, despite the fact that no opinion poll shows her close to winning the election's runoff in May. 
Conservative Francois Fillon and reformist centrist Emmanuel Macron are the other two frontrunners and opinion polls show either of them would defeat Le Pen should they be pitted against her.

Prices fell 0.2 percent on a month-on-month basis, but this gave a year-on-year inflation rate of 1.6 percent, preliminary EU-harmonized data from the INSEE statistics agency showed on Tuesday.
The 12-month rate, the highest since October 2012 and up from an increase of 0.8 percent in December, exceeded economists' average estimate for a reading of 1.3 percent as polled by Reuters, with expectations ranging from 0.9 percent to 1.5 percent.
A 10-percent yearly rise in energy prices was the main driver, INSEE said, while fresh food products rose 8.7 percent.
Benchmark crude oil prices hovered around $55 a barrel for most of January, while they had dropped as low as $27, a 12-year trough, in the corresponding month the year before. 
On Jan. 1, France's carbon tax increased to 30.5 euros per tonne of CO2 from 22 euros before, pushing up prices at the pump.
INSEE also said a later start this year to the regulated post-Christmas sale period, during which shops are allowed to discount their products below cost, boosted yearly inflation.

Separately, INSEE said producer prices rose 0.9 percent in December, giving a 12-month rate of 1.7 percent.

The jobless rate in the 28-member European Union was unchanged 8.2% in December. This remains the lowest rate recorded in the EU since February 2009."

In a report, Eurostat said consumer price inflation rose by a seasonally adjusted 1.8% in January compared to forecasts for an increase of 1.6% and following a final reading of a 1.1% advance in the prior month.
That was its highest level since February 2013.
According to Eurostat, energy prices drove inflation higher, followed by food, alcohol & tobacco, services, and non-energy industrial goods.
Core CPI, which excludes food, energy, alcohol, and tobacco costs, unexpectedly increased by a seasonally adjusted 0.9% in January. That was in line with expectations and the prior month’s increase.

586,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 31, 2017 04:50AM ET</span>",UK consumers slow their borrowing in December ahead of expected Brexit pinch,"LONDON (Reuters) - British consumers slowed the pace of their borrowing in December for the first time in five months, an early sign that households might be reining in their spending as last year's Brexit vote pushes up inflation.
Consumer credit in December rose by just over 1.0 billion pounds - much less than an increase of 1.7 billion pounds forecast in a Reuters poll of economists and down from an increase of nearly 2 billion pounds in November.
Spending by households helped Britain rack up the fastest economic growth in 2016 among the world's big, rich economies, despite the shock of the vote in June to leave the European Union.
The annual growth rate in borrowing slowed to 10.6 percent from 10.8 percent in November which had been the strongest growth in 11 years. It was the first fall in the annual rate since July and the biggest slowdown since December 2013.
Credit card borrowing slowed even more sharply to show an increase of 228 million pounds, the smallest increase since October 2015.
The BoE expects growth to slow in 2017 as rising inflation, triggered by the post-Brexit vote fall in the value of the pound, eats into the spending power of consumers.
Furthermore, Britons are saving less than at any time in the last eight years, raising questions about how long they are likely to continue borrowing so freely.
BoE Governor Mark Carney said on Jan. 16 that British growth had relied heavily on consumers, rather than business investment or exports, which made it vulnerable as household spending could not outpace wage growth indefinitely.
A survey published overnight showed households might be starting to scale back on spending as last year's Brexit vote pushes up inflation.
Tuesday's figures from the BoE showed that the number of mortgages for house purchase approved by lenders increased to 67,898, a bit below the median forecast of 69,000 in the Reuters poll but still the biggest number since March 2016.
Last week, the British Bankers' Association, using less comprehensive figures, said mortgage approvals hit a nine-month high in December.
The BoE forecast in November that mortgage approvals would slow to a monthly average of 65,000 over the next six months, and major lenders expect weaker house price growth.
Net mortgage lending, which lags approvals, rose by 3.8 billion pounds in December, the BoE said, stronger than a forecast of 3.3 billion pounds in the Reuters poll. 
The BoE also said on Tuesday that foreign investors were net sellers of British government bonds for the first time since July after some of the strongest purchases on record in the previous three months.

Net sales totaled 2.97 billion pounds in December compared with purchases of 15.58 billion pounds in November.

The central bank raised its gross domestic product (GDP) forecast to 1.4% for the fiscal year ending March 31, from its previous forecast made in October of 1.0% growth.
The BoJ said it expects inflation to rise to around its target of 2% around fiscal 2018. It cited signs that medium-to-long term inflation expectations have stopped declining and were showing some indications of rising with wages picking up.
For the current fiscal year, it expected the consumer price index (CPI) excluding fresh food, its preferred indicator, would fall 0.2%, compared with its October forecast for a 0.1% fall, but in fiscal 2017, the BoJ expected inflation of 1.5%.

At the two-day policy meeting that ended on Tuesday, it also kept its yield target for 10-year Japanese government bonds around zero percent.
In an attempt to channel money out to broader sectors of the economy, the central bank extended by a year the deadline for its loan programs aimed at boosting lending to industries with growth potential.
In a quarterly review of its forecasts, the BOJ maintained its projection for core consumer inflation at 1.5 percent for the next fiscal year, which starts in April. It also left unchanged its projection of 1.7 percent inflation for fiscal 2018.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's factory output rose for a second straight month in December and household spending fell less than expected, in a welcome - if modest - sign of economic recovery.
Industrial output rose 0.5 percent in December from the previous month, preliminary government data showed on Tuesday. The result compared with a median market forecast of a 0.3 percent increase.
Manufacturers surveyed by the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry expect output to rise 3.0 percent in January and increase 0.8 percent in February.
Separate data on Tuesday showed household spending fell 0.3 percent in December year on year, marking the 10th straight month of declines but beating the 0.6 percent decrease projected by analysts. Household spending dropped 1.5 percent in November.
The figures reinforce the dominant market view that the Bank of Japan will hold off on expanding monetary stimulus at its meeting on Tuesday.

600,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 30, 2017 07:10PM ET</span>","UK consumers less gloomy, but more reluctant to spend big: GfK","LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's consumers turned a little less gloomy in January but there were signs that they might be starting to scale back on spending as last year's Brexit vote pushes up inflation, a survey published on Tuesday showed.
Market research company GfK's monthly consumer sentiment index edged up to -5 in January from -7 in December, higher than a median forecast of -8 in a Reuters poll of economists.
But a fall in the GfK's measure of the appetite for major purchases among consumers - which slipped to 10 from 12 in December - could be a foretaste of slower consumer spending this year, Joe Staton, head of market dynamics at GfK, said.
In December, GfK measured a big jump in households' willingness to make major purchases. The Bank of England has said consumers might have brought forward big purchases in anticipation of price rises in 2017.
""Rising inflation and weak income growth is forecast to squeeze households' disposable income, and these two factors could conspire to depress confidence for the year ahead,"" Staton said on Tuesday.
""It's certainly difficult to see where the oomph will come from over the short term.""
Britain's economy grew more strongly than its rich country peers last year, confounding forecasts from the Bank of England and almost all private economists that the referendum decision to leave the European Union would quickly hit growth.
BoE officials have said they now expect Britain is heading into a ""slow-motion"" slowdown with inflation on course to rise above its 2 percent target in the coming months, eating into the spending power of consumers.
GfK said its survey showed households remained their most pessimistic about the economy over the 12 months ahead since just after the Brexit vote in June.
Separately on Tuesday, Adzuna, a jobs search engine, said the number of advertised vacancies fell by nearly 5 percent in December from November after rising for the previous three months.
Adzuna also said the average advertised salary rose by a monthly 0.3 percent to 32,323 pounds but was down 3 percent compared with December 2015.

So far, Britain's labor market has shown no major sign of weakening since the referendum, according to official data.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. consumer spending accelerated in December as households bought motor vehicles and cold weather boosted demand for utilities amid a rise in wages, pointing to sustained domestic demand that could spur economic growth in early 2017.
There are also signs that inflation firmed last month. The growth outlook was further bolstered by other data on Monday showing a jump in contracts to buy previously owned homes. A strengthening economy, rising price pressures and tightening labor market could allow the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates at least three times this year.
""Consumers keep on spending to help the economy grow and inflation is stirring,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG Union Bank in New York. ""The economy is at full employment. Time for the Fed to hoist sail on interest rates.""
The Commerce Department said consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, increased 0.5 percent after gaining 0.2 percent in November. The rise was the biggest in three months and in line with economists' expectations.
Consumer spending increased 3.8 percent in 2016 after a 3.5 percent rise in 2015. With domestic demand firming, inflation showed some signs of picking up last month. The personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index rose 0.2 percent after edging up 0.1 percent in November. 
In the 12 months through December the PCE price index advanced 1.6 percent, the biggest increase since September 2014. That followed a 1.4 percent increase in November.
Excluding food and energy, the so-called core PCE price index ticked up 0.1 percent after being unchanged in November. The core PCE price index increased 1.7 percent on a year-on-year basis after a similar gain in November.
The core PCE is the Fed's preferred inflation measure and is running below its 2 percent target. However, other inflation measures are above the PCE price indexes. The consumer price index (CPI) is currently at 2.1 percent on a year-on-year basis and the core CPI is up 2.2 percent. 
""Inflation will gradually accelerate over the next couple of years due to higher energy prices and stronger wage growth that leads firms to raise prices,"" said Gus Faucher, deputy chief economist at PNC Financial (NYSE:PNC) in Pittsburgh.
HOME PURCHASE CONTRACTS RISE
The consumer spending and inflation data was included in the fourth-quarter gross domestic product report published last Friday. It was released ahead of the Fed's two-day policy meeting that begins on Tuesday. 
The U.S. central bank, which has forecast three rate hikes this year, is not expected to raise rates at this week's meeting. The Fed lifted its benchmark overnight interest rate in December to a range of 0.50 percent to 0.75 percent. 
U.S. stocks were trading lower amid nervousness over President Donald Trump's order to curb travel and immigration from seven Muslim-majority nations, which led to demonstrations in U.S. cities and at airports.
Prices for most U.S. government bonds edged up, while the dollar (DXY) was little changed against a basket of currencies. 
In a separate report, the National Association of Realtors said its pending homes sales index surged 1.6 percent in December. These contracts become sales after a month or two. Last month's jump suggested a rebound in existing home sales after they tumbled 2.8 percent in December.
While the housing market continues to recover and support the economy, it remains constrained by a dire shortage of properties available for sale. Economists see a modest impact on home sales from higher mortgage rates as the tightening labor market starts to boost wage growth.
The economy grew at a 1.9 percent annual rate in the fourth quarter, restrained by a wider trade deficit. Private domestic demand, however, increased at a solid 2.8 percent rate. The economy expanded at a 3.5 percent rate in the third quarter. 
Consumer spending could get a boost from the Trump administration's promise to cut taxes. While Trump's has offered few details on his economic policy, consumer confidence has surged and the stock market has rallied to record highs.
Consumer spending last month was buoyed by a 1.4 percent jump in purchases of long-lasting manufactured goods such as automobiles. Spending on services, most likely utilities, increased 0.4 percent. 
Personal income advanced 0.3 percent last month after nudging up 0.1 percent in November. Wages and salaries rebounded 0.4 percent after slipping 0.1 percent in November. Income increased 3.5 percent in 2016 after rising 4.4 percent in 2015.
Savings fell to $768.4 billion last month, the lowest level since May 2015, from $791.2 billion in November. 

""The gradual downward trend in the household savings confirms that households were on a solid footing by the end of the fourth quarter and precautionary savings are not a concern,"" said Blerina Uruci, an economist at  Barclays  (LON:BARC) in Washington.

BERLIN (Reuters) - German inflation is likely to have picked up further in January, surpassing the European Central Bank's official price stability target of just under 2 percent for the first time in more than four years, regional data suggested on Monday.
The strong inflation data, published by several German states, is expected to fuel the political debate in Europe's biggest economy about an end to the ECB's loose monetary policy.
Preliminary data from several states showed that consumer price inflation accelerated in most German regions. In the most populous state of North Rhine-Westphalia, for example, annual inflation rose to 2.1 percent after 1.9 percent in December.
Consumer prices increased by 2.3 percent in Saxony and by 2.4 percent in Hesse whereas the annual inflation rate remained unchanged at 1.7 percent in both Brandenburg and Bavaria.
The state readings, which are not harmonized to compare with other euro zone countries, will feed into nationwide inflation data for Europe's largest economy due out at 1300 GMT.
A Reuters poll suggests overall consumer price inflation rose to 2.0 percent in January after 1.7 percent in December, the highest rate since December 2012.
Helaba economist Stefan Muetze said, however, he now expects the EU-harmonised inflation rate (HICP) to come in a tick stronger at around 2.1 percent.
For the euro zone as a whole, economists polled by Reuters expect the inflation rate, due on Tuesday, to rise to 1.5 percent in January after 1.1 percent in December.
Given that transportation costs soared in most German states, Jennifer McKeown of Capital economics said that there were first signs of rising price pressures also in the core components of the inflation rate.
But she added that underlying price pressures, especially in the services sector, were still relatively subdued.
""Accordingly, concerns about rising inflationary pressures in Germany are unlikely to prevent the ECB from implementing this year's asset purchases as planned,"" McKeown said.
Helaba's Muetze agreed, saying: ""(ECB President Mario) Draghi will keep a steady hand. The latest German data will not make him change course all of a sudden.""
The central bank of the 19-member single currency bloc has unleashed unprecedented stimulus in recent years, cutting interest rates aggressively and pumping more than a trillion euros into the economy through asset purchases.

A sustained rebound in German inflation would give Bundesbank president and ECB rate setter Jens Weidmann more scope to argue for a reduction in the ECB's bond-buying program, a scheme that he has often criticized.

Deloitte said its quarterly consumer confidence index dipped to -6 from a series high of -5 three months earlier, but was still above levels seen a year earlier, when few people thought Britain was likely to vote to leave the European Union.
""So far, Brexit has not dented consumers' confidence about the outlook for jobs,"" Deloitte economist Ian Stewart said. ""However the New Year sees the arrival of headwinds that may challenge the current consumer-friendly economic conditions.""
Consumer price inflation jumped to a two-year high of 1.6 percent in December, and the Bank of England forecasts it will exceed 2.7 percent by the end of the year, as sterling's post-referendum plunge pushes up the cost of imports.
Among the 3,000 Britons surveyed for Deloitte between Dec. 31 and Jan. 2, confidence about disposable income fell compared with a year earlier, breaking a pattern seen since 2012.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japanese retail sales rose less than expected in December, government data showed on Monday, unwelcome news as the Bank of Japan meets to set monetary policy.
Retail sales rose 0.6 percent in December from a year earlier, below the median market forecast for a 1.3 percent increase.
The Bank of Japan is expected to announce a steady monetary policy after its two-day meeting Tuesday and seek to allay speculation of an early tapering of its massive stimulus.
Weak consumer spending has dogged Japan's economy, which has struggled to achieve steady recovery after decades of deflation and stagnation.
""I didn't expect December retail sales to be strong because end-year private consumption wasn't strong,"" said Shuji Tonouchi, senior market economist at Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanely Securities.
""Prices have been rising but it's mostly due to the rise in energy prices, and domestic demand hasn't changed...We are looking carefully at whether this would lead to sustained inflation,"" Tonouchi added.
Japan's economy expanded for a third straight quarter in July-September as exports recovered, but domestic activity remained weak. Recent data has shown Japan's core consumer prices fell at the slowest annual pace in nearly a year, a tentative sign that inflation and domestic demand may pick up in the coming months.

DETROIT (Reuters) - U.S. auto sales are expected to remain robust and scale a record high of 17.6 million vehicles in 2017, lifted by expected fiscal stimulus and deregulatory policies of President Donald Trump, consultancies J.D. Power and LMC Automotive said on Friday.
The consultancies see January keeping sales robust at an annualized rate of 17.3 million vehicles, although falling 1.8 percent from last January.
January sales will be about 1.13 million vehicles, JD Power and LMC said.
It would be the third consecutive year of a record high for total light vehicle sales.
U.S. auto sales led the economy out of the 2008-2009 economic crisis. Wall Street automotive company analysts have been predicting a downturn in sales since at least 2015 and so far, the market has surpassed those expectations.
“After an overheated close to 2016 and the increased likelihood of deregulation and fiscal stimulus from the Trump administration driving the economy higher, we now expect 2017 to be another record year in U.S. auto sales,"" said Jeff Schuster, head of forecasting at LMC Automotive.
""While there are many variables to consider this year, one area of caution is the large number of lease maturities repopulating the used-car market,"" he said. ""It creates demand for a vehicle, but also more used-vehicle options to compete with the new-vehicle market.”
Edmunds, an automotive consultant and online sales site, said 2017 will show a record 31 percent of new vehicles purchased through leasing.
JD Power and LMC said January will show record average selling prices of about $31,500 per vehicle, high inventory levels and rising consumer discounts. Also, pickup trucks and SUVs will continue to account for more than 60 percent of the market, they said.
Edmunds said on Wednesday January U.S. auto sales will have an annualized selling rate of 17.7 million vehicles. Total light vehicle sales were expected to be 1.53 million vehicles, up 0.7 percent from a year earlier.
January U.S. auto sales will be reported by automakers on Wednesday.

628,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 27, 2017 09:28AM ET</span>",Weak exports curb U.S. fourth-quarter economic growth,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. economic growth slowed sharply in the fourth quarter as a plunge in shipments of soybeans weighed on exports, but steady consumer spending and rising business investment suggested the economy would continue to expand.
Gross domestic product increased at a 1.9 percent annual rate, the Commerce Department said on Friday in its first estimate of fourth-quarter GDP. That was a deceleration from the 3.5 percent growth pace logged in the third quarter.
As a result, the economy grew only 1.6 percent in 2016, the weakest pace since 2011. Growth last year was constrained by cheap oil and a strong dollar, which hurt company profits and undercut business investment.
An inventory correction also eroded growth. Those impediments to growth are mostly out of the way. The economy expanded 2.6 percent in 2015.
In the fourth quarter, exports fell at a 4.3 percent rate, reversing the 10 percent increase notched in the third quarter. The fourth-quarter drop in exports was the biggest since the first quarter of 2015.
Trade sliced off 1.70 percentage points from GDP growth in the fourth quarter after adding 0.85 percentage point in the prior period. That was the biggest drag since the second quarter of 2010. Most of the hit came from soybean exports, which fired up GDP growth in the third quarter after a poor soy harvest in Argentina and Brazil.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast GDP rising at a 2.2 percent rate in the fourth quarter.
Prices for U.S. government debt rose and U.S. interest rates futures turned flat after the data. U.S. stock index futures pared gains while the dollar fell against the euro and yen.
OUTLOOK FAIRLY BRIGHT
With a labor market at or near full employment starting to lift wages and supporting consumer spending, the outlook for the economy is fairly bright. Growth this year could also get a boost from President Donald Trump's pledge to increase infrastructure spending, cut taxes and reduce regulations.
Although Trump has offered little detail on his economic policy, his promises have been embraced by consumers, businesses and investors. Consumer and business confidence have soared, while the U.S. stock market has rallied to record highs.
But uncertainty over the Trump administration's trade policy poses a risk to the economy.
A stronger economy would also mean further interest rate increases from the Federal Reserve. The U.S. central bank has forecast three rate hikes this year. It raised its benchmark overnight interest rate in December by 25 basis points to a range of 0.50 percent to 0.75 percent.
Consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, increased at a 2.5 percent rate in the fourth quarter. It rose at a 3.0 percent pace in the third quarter.
Income at the disposal of households increased 3.7 percent in the fourth quarter after a robust 4.1 percent rise in the prior period. Savings dipped to $791.2 billion from $818.1 billion in the third quarter.
With domestic demand increasing steadily, businesses continued to restock. They accumulated inventories at a rate of $48.7 billion in the last quarter, up from $7.1 billion in the third quarter. Inventories added 1.0 percentage point to GDP growth, double the contribution in the third quarter.
Business investment shifted into higher gear, with spending on equipment increasing at a 3.1 percent rate after four straight quarterly declines. The gain reflects a surge in gas and oil well drilling, in tandem with rising crude oil prices.
Spending on mining exploration, wells and shafts increased at a 24.3 percent rate after declining at a 30.0 percent pace in the third quarter. Energy services firm Baker Hughes said last Friday that U.S. energy companies added 29 oil rigs in the week to Jan. 20, bringing the total count to 551 - the most since November 2015.
Investment in nonresidential structures, however, fell at a 5.0 percent pace in the fourth quarter after rising at a 12.0 percent rate in the prior period.
Investment in home building rebounded after two straight quarterly declines, contributing to growth. Government spending picked up as a rise in state and local government investment offset a decline in federal government expenditures.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's factory output is expected to rise for a second straight month in December, supported by signs of a global manufacturing recovery, a Reuters poll showed.
Economists polled by Reuters also expect retail sales rose for a second straight month in December, but see household spending falling for the 10th straight month, showing consumer spending remains sluggish. 
While mixed, the data is expected to reinforce the market view that the Bank of Japan will hold off on expanding monetary stimulus in coming months amid signs that the economy may be slowly regaining its footing.
Industrial production likely rose 0.3 percent in December from the previous month, the Reuters poll of 21 analysts found, slowing from a 1.5 percent gain in November. 
""Exports are picking up on the back of the overseas economic recovery, which gives positive spillover effects to production activity. As a results, an inventory adjustment has progressed in the past several months,"" said Takeshi Minami, chief economist at Norinchukin Research Institute.
""There is a risk of protectionism trade policy but I think the recovering trend in the factory output is likely to continue for a while as the global economy is recovering.""
A preliminary private survey earlier this week showed Japanese manufacturing activity expanded in January at the fastest pace in almost three years as export orders surged. 
The trade ministry will announce factory output at 8:50 a.m. on Tuesday, Jan. 31 (2350 GMT, Jan 30).
Retail sales, which will be released on Monday by the trade ministry, likely rose 1.3 percent in December from a year ago, up for a second straight month.
But household spending was expected to have slipped an annual 0.6 percent, less than a drop of 1.5 percent in November but its 10th straight month of declines, the poll found.
""Stock price gains probably contributed positively to private spending but consumers' budget-minded manner persists, thus consumer spending lacked momentum,"" said Takumi Tsunoda, senior economist at Shinkin Central Bank. 
The jobless rate is expected to have stayed steady at 3.1 percent in December and the jobs-to-applicants ratio likely improved to 1.42 last month, which would be the highest reading since July 1991 when the ratio stood at 1.44.
The internal affairs ministry will release household spending and jobs-related data at 8:30 a.m. on Tuesday.

The BOJ is expected to announce the outcome of its first policy review of the year later in the day.

After falling in December, the YouGov/Cebr Consumer Confidence Index rose 2 points to 110.3 in January, its biggest increase since August and its highest level since September.
The improvement reflected a better outlook for house prices, businesses and household finances, YouGov and Cebr said.
Only the survey's gauge of job security fell this month.
The figures come a day after official data showed Britain's economy kept up its robust pace of growth in the fourth quarter of 2016, meaning there has been no slowdown at all since the June 23 vote to leave the European Union.
Still, Cebr, a business consultancy, said it was cautious about how long the buoyant mood among consumers would last.
""Inflation is picking up and the rising cost of living could start to erode consumer confidence, particularly if pay growth stays subdued,"" said Cebr director Scott Corfe.
Bank of England Governor Mark Carney has said he will keep a close eye on how Britons spend their money this year, given the economy's reliance on consumers. Their spending power is expected to be hurt by rising prices caused by the fall in the value of the pound after the Brexit vote.

The YouGov/Cebr survey is based on the responses of around 6,000 consumers each month.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's core consumer prices fell at the slowest annual pace in nearly a year in December, data showed on Friday, a sign inflation should pick up in coming months on a rebound in oil costs and rising import costs from a weak yen.
The data will be among factors the Bank of Japan will scrutinize at its policy meeting early next week, where it is widely expected to keep monetary policy steady and maintain its upbeat inflation projections.
The nationwide core consumer price index, which includes oil products but excludes volatile fresh food prices, slipped 0.2 percent in December from a year earlier, government data showed, compared with a median market forecast for a 0.3 percent fall.
It was the 10th straight month of declines but the smallest fall since February, when there was a flat reading.
Core consumer prices in Tokyo, available a month before the nationwide data, fell 0.3 percent in January from a year earlier, against the median market forecast for a 0.4 percent drop. It followed a 0.6 percent decline in December, the biggest annual drop in nearly four years.
Japan posted a third straight quarter of annual expansion in July-September and analysts expect growth to pick up in coming quarters, thanks to a recent pick-up in exports and factory output driven by improvements in emerging economies.
Policymakers hope that prospects of a sustained recovery will prompt companies to boost wages and household spending, seen as a soft spot in the world's third-largest economy.
While prospects of accelerating inflation offer some relief for the BOJ, many central bankers remain wary on whether price rises driven by external factors could help speed up inflation to their ambitious 2 percent target.

Data showed overall consumer prices rose 0.3 percent in December from a year earlier.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - New U.S. single-family home sales fell to a 10-month low in December after three straight months of solid gains, but the housing market recovery remains intact as a tightening labor market boosts wage growth.
While other data on Thursday showed a bigger-than-expected increase in the number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits last week, the four-week moving average of claims dropped to levels last seen in 1973. 
There was also good news on the economy with the goods trade deficit falling in December as exports rose. With trade expected to have weighed on economic growth in the fourth quarter, last month's rise in exports bodes well for output in early 2017.
The Commerce Department said new home sales dropped 10.4 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 536,000 units last month. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast single-family home sales, which account for 8.9 percent of overall home sales, slipping 1.0 percent.
Many economists did not believe that the decline in sales was in response to a recent run-up in mortgage rates as applications for loans to purchase houses rose in December. A homebuilders survey also showed strong sales gains last month. Cold weather could have impacted on sales.
""December's decline is probably mostly a result of volatility rather than a drop in the underlying fundamentals for housing demand, despite the rise in mortgage rates,"" said David Berson, chief economist at Nationwide in Columbus, Ohio.
New home sales, which are derived from building permits, are
volatile on a month-to-month basis and subject to large revisions. Sales increased 12.2 percent to 563,000 units in 2016, the highest since 2007.
With the labor market considered as being at or near full employment, and pushing up wages, demand for housing is likely to remain supported. But a chronic shortage of properties for sale remains an obstacle to a robust housing market. 
A report from the National Association of Realtors on Tuesday showed the supply of previously owned homes for sale dropped to a 17-year low in December. 
The PHLX housing index (HGX) rose 0.67 percent on Thursday amid expectations that homebuilders would need to ramp up construction to meet demand for housing. Shares in the nation's largest homebuilder, D.R. Horton (N:DHI), gained 0.54 percent. and  Lennar  Corp (N:LEN) climbed 0.53 percent.
Shares in PulteGroup (N:PHM) surged 5.11 percent as the No. 3 homebuilder reported higher-than-expected quarterly profits, which were boosted by an increase in home sales and prices. 
The dollar was trading higher against a basket of currencies. Prices for U.S. government debt fell, with the yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note rising to a four-week high.
RISING MORTGAGE RATES 
The fixed 30-year mortgage rate increased 43 basis points in December from November to an average of 4.20 percent, the highest since April 2014, according to data from mortgage finance firm Freddie Mac. 
Further increases are likely as the Federal Reserve has forecast three rate hikes this year. The U.S. central bank raised its benchmark overnight interest rate in December by 25 basis points to a range of 0.50 percent to 0.75 percent. 
Last month, new single-family homes sales rose 48.4 percent in the Northeast to their highest level since January 2008. They fell in the Midwest, the South and the West. 
The inventory of new homes on the market increased 4.0 percent to 259,000 units, the highest since August 2009. New housing stock, however, remains less than half of its peak during the housing boom.
According to Jonathan Smoke, chief economist at realtor.com, the acute shortage of previously owned homes has not been a boost to the new housing market because of supply constraints facing builders, including labor, land and finance. 
""New home sales will likely outpace single-family growth as builders sell more homes that haven't been started, but supply-side constraints will likely keep that growth to single digits in 2017,"" said Smoke.
In a separate report on Thursday, the Labor Department said initial claims for state unemployment benefits increased 22,000 to a seasonally adjusted 259,000 for the week ended Jan. 21. Claims have now been below 300,000, a threshold associated with a healthy labor market, for 99 consecutive weeks. 
That is the longest stretch since 1970, when the labor market was much smaller. Last week's data included the Martin Luther King Jr. holiday, which could have impacted on the data. Claims tend to be volatile around this time of the year because of different timings of the various holidays. 
""Through the volatility they continue to show no sign of an uptrend,"" said Jim O'Sullivan, chief U.S. economist at High Frequency Economics in Valhalla, New York. ""We believe the trend in employment growth remains quite strong, more than strong enough to keep the unemployment rate trending down.""
The four-week moving average of claims, considered a better measure of labor market trends as it irons out week-to-week volatility, fell 2,000 to 245,500 last week, the lowest since November 1973.
In another report, the Commerce Department said the goods trade deficit fell 0.5 percent to $65.0 billion in December. Goods exports increased $3.7 billion to $125.5 billion. The rise outpaced a $3.4 billion gain in imports.
Economists expect trade to have subtracted at least 1.5 percentage points from GDP in the fourth quarter reversing a 0.85 percentage point contribution the prior quarter. 
The export drag will likely come from a decline in soybean shipments, after they provided a huge boost to growth in the third quarter. The government will publish its advance fourth-quarter GDP estimate on Friday.

According to a Reuters survey of economists, GDP likely increased at a 2.2 percent annualized rate in the fourth quarter after a surging at a 3.5 percent pace in the July-September quarter.

Trump, since taking office last Friday, has embarked on a series of moves aimed at bolstering jobs and capital investments, stoking jitters about inflation.
Benchmark 10-year Treasury yields (US10YT=RR) rose to four-week highs early Thursday at 2.551 percent.
The borrowing cost on 30-year mortgages, the most widely held type of U.S. home loan, averaged 4.19 percent in the week ended Jan. 26, up from 4.09 percent last week which was the lowest since early December, it said. 
Four weeks earlier, it averaged 4.32 percent, which was the highest since 4.33 percent in the week of April 24, 2014.
The spike in mortgage rates, together with tight housing supply, have crimped home sales. 
On Thursday, the government said new single-family home sales fell to a 10-month low in December, though they marked their strongest year since 2007 last year.
While housing turnover fell at the end of last year, home prices marched higher, lifting the median values on new homes by 7.9 percent in 2016.
Limited housing inventory ""should support higher house prices regardless of the oscillations of the mortgage rate,"" Freddie Mac's chief economist Sean Becketti said in a statement.
Below is a summary of Freddie Mac's average mortgage rates in the week ended Jan. 26:
Loan type Latest week (pct) Week ago (pct) Year ago (pct)

New home sales, which are derived from building permits, are volatile on a month-to-month basis and subject to large revisions. Sales were down 0.4 percent from December 2015.
They increased 12.2 percent to 563,000 units in 2016, the highest since 2007. A labor market which is viewed as being at or near full employment is underpinning demand for housing.
Home sales, however, are being constrained by a chronic shortage of properties for sale.
A report from the National Association of Realtors on Tuesday showed the supply of previously owned homes for sale dropped to a 17-year low in December. Supply could remain a challenge for housing with homebuilders continuing to complain about a shortage of skilled workers and land.
Economists so far see a limited impact on demand for housing from the recent run-up in mortgage rates, given labor market strength.
The fixed 30-year mortgage rate increased 43 basis points in December from November to an average of 4.20 percent, according to data from mortgage finance firm Freddie Mac. That was the highest since April 2014.
Further increases are likely as the Federal Reserve has forecast three rate hikes this year. The U.S. central bank raised its benchmark overnight interest rate in December by 25 basis points to a range of 0.50 percent to 0.75 percent.

With sales weak, the inventory of new homes on the market increased 4.0 percent to 259,000 units, the highest since August 2009. New housing stock remains less than half of its peak during the housing boom.
At December's sales pace it would take 5.8 months to clear the supply of houses on the market. That was the highest since September 2015 and was up from 5.0 months in November.

A six-month supply is viewed as a healthy balance between supply and demand. The median price for a new home increased 7.9 percent to $322,500 in December from a year ago.

652,By Investing.com,"<span>Jan 26, 2017 09:46AM ET</span>", U.S. services PMI expands at fastest pace in more than a year - Markit,"Investing.com – Activity in the U.S. services sector increased its expansion in January, rising to more than a one-year high and bolstering optimism over the state of the U.S. economy, according to preliminary data released on Thursday.
In a report, market research group Markit said that its flash services purchasing managers’ index (PMI) rose to 55.1 in January, from the prior month’s reading of 53.9. That was its fastest expansion since November 2015.
Analysts had expected the reading to increase to 54.4.
On the index, a reading above 50.0 indicates expansion, below indicates contraction.
Services make up approximately 80% of the U.S. economy which makes the data key for interpreting growth.
Markit indicated that the survey showed faster rises in business activity and new work with firms in the sector reporting the strongest business outlook for just under two years.The report also revealed that input cost inflation had slowed since December.
Markit chief economist Chris Williamson commented that, combined with the manufacturing data earlier in the week, the two surveys suggested growth of 2.5% in January, in what would be a faster expansion in 2016.
“The strong start to 2017 and bullish mood for the year ahead adds to our expectation that we will see the Fed hike rates a further three times in 2017,” Williamson said.

657,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 26, 2017 08:00AM ET</span>","Consumers drive UK economy, defying expected Brexit vote hit","By David Milliken and William Schomberg
LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's free-spending consumers again confounded warnings that June's Brexit vote would cause an immediate slowdown in the country's economy, driving robust growth in the final three months of 2016, data showed on Thursday.
Gross domestic product rose at a quarterly pace of 0.6 percent between October and December, keeping up the same above-average pace seen in the initial three months after the referendum decision to leave the European Union.
A Reuters poll of economists had forecast a slight slowdown to growth of 0.5 percent.
Sterling, which lost as much as 20 percent against the dollar last year after the shock vote, hit a six-week high against the dollar  and British 10-year government bond yields (GB10YT=RR) rose to their highest since mid-December as some investors believed the Bank of England might soon start to move toward an interest rate hike.
""What the figures today show is that the UK economy continues to be resilient and continues to confound the skeptics,"" finance minister Philip Hammond said. 
Though most economists expect higher inflation this year to squeeze consumers - and see longer-term damage to trade from Brexit - Hammond said the economy's resilience meant Britain could be optimistic about the Brexit talks that lie ahead.
""Clearly, life goes on, despite the Brexit vote,"" Scotiabank economist Alan Clarke said. 
The Office for National Statistics said services, which are most sensitive to consumer spending, were the biggest gainers, growing by 0.8 percent. Industrial output was flat and construction only edged up slightly.
LEADING THE PACK, FOR NOW
Growth in 2016 as a whole slowed only slightly to 2.0 percent from 2.2 percent in 2015, but this was mostly due to weak growth in the first three months of the year, before the referendum.
Many economists had expected Britain to flirt with recession after the Brexit vote. But it was probably one of 2016's fastest-growing major rich economies. Its year-on-year growth exceeded Germany's 1.9 percent last year.
The BoE raised its forecast for growth in 2017 to 1.4 percent in November and it may well raise it again in a quarterly update next Thursday after the run of strong economic data.
But the outlook for 2017 remains murky, largely because of Britain's reliance on its consumers, which BoE Governor Mark Carney flagged as a risk this month. 
Sterling's fall is already pushing up costs for businesses and households are likely to share the pain soon.
Allan Monks, a J.P. Morgan economist, said the BoE would probably stick to its neutral stance on interest rates next week. But if the expected slowdown in the economy did not materialize, it could start to signal a hike later this year.
The Confederation of British Industry on Wednesday reported strong orders for manufacturers in January, suggesting a strong start to 2017 for the country's factories.
Figures on Thursday showed the number of mortgages approved by banks hit a nine-month high in December and consumer credit continued to expand robustly.
There was a possible warning sign in separate data which showed British retail sales fell unexpectedly in January, hit by weak food sales. Retailers said they thought the fall was a blip, though they did see tougher time ahead. 

Also on Thursday, a report showed British carmakers cut investment by a third last year due to Brexit worries.

In a report, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said gross domestic product expanded by a seasonally adjusted 0.6% in the three months ended December 31, above forecasts for growth of 0.5%. The U.K.’s economy grew by the same amount in the preceding quarter.
Year-over-year, U.K. economic growth expanded 2.2% in the fourth quarter, also above the forecast for an expansion of 2.1%. The U.K. economy grew at an annualized rate of 2.2% in the third quarter.
This preliminary fourth quarter data measures the economy in a period dominated by preparations for triggering Article 50 which will kick start negotiations between Britain and the European Union ahead of the Brexit as well as the surprise election of Donald Trump as the U.S. President.
Additionally, the index of services in the U.K. rose 1.0%, beating expectations for a 0.9% and after a prior gain of 1.1% that was revised up from an earlier reading of a 1.0% advance.
The ONS noted that the fourth quarter expansion was dominated by services, with a strong contribution from consumer-focused industries such as retail sales and travel agency services.
Following declines in the July to September period, construction and production provided negligible positive contributions to GDP growth.
Overall, U.K. GDP was estimated to have increased by 2.0% during 2016, slowing slightly from 2.2% in 2015 and from 3.1% in 2014.
GDP per capita was estimated to have increased by 0.4% during Quarter 4 2016 and by 1.3% during 2016.

LONDON (Reuters) - British car production reached a 17-year high last year, but the country's vote to leave the European Union contributed to a roughly 33 percent drop in investment in the sector, a car industry body said on Thursday.
Carmakers had lobbied hard against Brexit, saying that it could result in the imposition of export tariffs that would make UK plants uncompetitive. 
Britain built 1.72 million vehicles in 2016, the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) said, adding that the annual increase of 8.5 percent lifted output to its highest since 1999 and the third-highest since the 1970s. 
However, the SMMT said that investment in the sector, which tends to make decisions about future production two to three years before a model rolls off the production line, fell by a third to 1.66 billion pounds ($2.1 billion).
""We do see companies at least delaying decisions until there is greater certainty,"" SMMT Chief Executive Mike Hawes told reporters.
Among the British car industry's concerns is the requirement of many free-trade deals between countries and blocs for more than 50 percent of components in a car to be made locally. Britain currently averages 41 percent. 
If Britain fails to secure a preferential deal with the European Union during the two-year divorce talks due to begin by the end of March, cars made in Britain could become subject to a 10 percent World Trade Organization tariff on exports.
""It would be very hard to overcome that level of additional cost, given that plants operate on wafer-thin margins,"" Hawes said, adding that carmakers generally make only a 2-4 percent return on investment. 
""We want trade deals, but they must be the right deals, not rushed deals. Failure to do so could damage UK automotive manufacturing beyond repair.""
Prime Minister Theresa May said last week Britain would leave the EU single market, which guarantees unfettered trade on the continent, but suggested that the car industry may be able to retain elements of free trade under a bespoke Brexit deal. 
Japanese carmaker Nissan (T:7201) said in October that it would build two new models at its Sunderland plant in North East England. 

A source told Reuters that the decision had been made after a government pledge for extra support to counter any loss of competitiveness caused by Britain leaving the EU, though a spokesman for the Prime Minister said that no explicit promises had been made on compensation for tariffs.

Retail sales are the largest contributor to Russian gross domestic product and have suffered steep falls since the economy entered a deep slump in 2014, when oil prices collapsed and the West imposed sanctions over the Ukraine crisis.
They contracted 5.9 percent in December, data from the Federal Statistics Service showed, more than the 3.3 percent drop predicted by a Reuters poll of analysts and the 4.1 percent fall in November.
The contraction was partly driven by a 6 percent decline in Russian real disposable incomes, reflecting the lingering effect on household spending from inflation.
""The weakness in the construction and retail sectors right at the end of last year serve as a reminder that the recovery will be sluggish,"" Capital Economics said in a note.
Poor retail sales data contrast with figures earlier this month showing industrial output rose by 3.2 percent in December after increasing by 2.7 percent a month earlier.
In other data released on Wednesday, unemployment declined to 5.3 percent from 5.4 percent in November.
Economy Minister Maxim Oreshkin said earlier this month that Russian GDP could expand by 2 percent in 2017 in the absence of external shocks.

In 2016, GDP shrank by around 0.5 percent.

The Washington-based industry group said its seasonally adjusted measure of home mortgage applications rose to 243.2 in the week ended on Jan. 20, up 6.0 percent from the previous week.
Interest rates on 30-year, fixed-rate conforming mortgages, the most widely held type of U.S. home loan, averaged 4.35 percent, up from 4.27 percent in the prior week.
Conforming loans are those with balances of $424,000 or less and qualify for guarantees from federal mortgage agencies  Fannie Mae  (PK:FNMA) and  Freddie Mac  (PK:FMCC). 
Four weeks ago, 30-year conforming mortgage rates averaged 4.45 percent, their highest since April 2014.
U.S. home borrowing costs rose in step with bond yields (US10YT=RR) in a renewed selloff in the U.S. Treasuries market as investors assessed whether early actions from U.S. President Donald Trump would push up domestic growth and inflation. 
The MBA's seasonally adjusted index on application activity to refinance an existing mortgage edged up 0.2 percent to 1,265.6. 
The refinance share of overall mortgage application activity fell to 50.0 percent, its smallest since July 2015, from 53.0 percent in the prior week, the MBA said.
The group's seasonally adjusted of total mortgage applications increased 4 percent to 397.4, its highest in five weeks.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's exports rose for the first time in 15 months in December on strong sales of electronics and car parts, a positive sign for the export-reliant economy even as U.S. protectionism threatens to hurt trade across the region and dent external demand.
Ministry of Finance data showed on Wednesday that exports rose 5.4 percent year-on-year in December, compared with a 1.2 percent annual increase expected by economists in a Reuters poll. It followed an annual 0.4 percent decline in November.
The volume of shipments also rose 8.4 percent from a year earlier, up for a second straight month, underlining a pickup in external demand.
The trade data should be welcome news for the Bank of Japan, which is seen maintaining an upbeat view on the world's third largest economy at a policy review next week on prospects of improving global growth.
However, worries about protectionism under U.S. President Donald Trump have raised uncertainty over the outlook as he formally withdrew the United States from the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal on Monday, distancing America from its Asian allies.
""Global demand is firming up as emerging markets in Asia are catching up with a recovery in advanced economies,"" said Takeshi Minami, chief economist at Norinchukin Research Institute.
""If debate on protectionism leads to an unwelcome rise in the yen, that would dampen the momentum towards a pickup in Japan's exports though.""
BOJ Governor Haruhiko Kuroda last week offered an optimistic view on global recovery prospects, indicating the central bank will maintain its upbeat economic and price forecasts when its board conducts a quarterly review of projections on Jan. 30-31.
The BOJ chief also dismissed concerns that protectionism could spread and undermine global trade.
REPEAT OF TRADE WAR
All the same, investors are wary about prospects for global trade as Trump has criticized Japan - along with his primary target China - for running trade surpluses with the United States.
Earlier this month, Trump took aim at Toyota Motor Corp (T:7203), warning the world's largest automaker that it would face a ""big border tax"" if it exported Mexico-built cars to the U.S. market.
All of this has raised concerns about a repeat of the trade friction that escalated in the 1980s between Tokyo and Washington.
For the whole of 2016, Japan posted a trade surplus of 6.8 trillion yen ($59.95 billion) with the United States, down 4.6 percent from 2015, with U.S.-bound car shipments rising for a second straight year.
In December, the value of exports to the United States, Japan's second largest trading partner, rose 1.3 percent year-on-year, the first increase in 10 months led by shipments of automobiles and car parts, the MOF data showed.
Exports to China, Japan's largest trading partner, rose 12.5 percent in December to 1.3 trillion yen, a record amount, helped by shipments of car parts and electronics equipment.
Analysts note the fall in the yen at the end of last year had helped boost exports. Imports fell 2.6 percent on-year in December, versus the median estimate for a 0.8 percent annual decrease, resulting in a trade surplus of 641.4 billion yen - the fourth straight month of surpluses.
On the whole the main risk to the outlook for the region stems from external headwinds, analysts say.

""Several headwinds to trade remain including trade protectionism and the likely slowing of Chin’s property sector,"" said Vaninder Singh, Asia economist at RBS (LON:RBS), in a note to clients.

BERLIN (Reuters) - German business morale unexpectedly dropped in January, a survey showed on Wednesday, suggesting a more downbeat assessment of the outlook for Europe's largest economy, although analysts were split over the impact of a more protectionist US trade stance.
The Munich-based Ifo economic institute's business climate index, based on a monthly survey of some 7,000 firms, fell to 109.8 from 111.0 in December, confounding the consensus Reuters forecast for a slight improvement to 111.3.
U.S. President Donald Trump has unsettled German politicians and business leaders with his comments that Britain would not be the last country to leave the European Union and with threats to impose high tariffs on imports from China and Mexico.
The United States is Germany's most important single export destination.
""It did not even take a week for U.S. President Trump to put a dampener on the mood of German companies,"" Dekabank economist Andreas Scheuerle said.
He added that Trump's latest remarks made business leaders realize that growing protectionism was not just a theoretical threat.
ING economist Carsten Brzeski said in a note titled ""Germany: First signs of being trumped"" that the drop in the Ifo index suggested German concerns had grown about the economic implications of the new U.S. administration.
But Ifo economist Klaus Wohlrabe said that there were no clear signs of a Trump effect in the January survey, pointing to increased export expectations.
""The German economy made a less confident start to the year,"" Ifo chief Clemens Fuest said in a statement. The Ifo headline figure was the lowest since September.
Companies expressed a higher level of satisfaction with their current business situation, but they were less optimistic about their six-month business outlook.
The Ifo survey showed that business morale deteriorated in all four major business areas - manufacturing, construction, wholesaling and retailing - after hitting record highs in recent months.
The German economy grew by 1.9 percent last year, the strongest rate in five years, helped by robust private consumption, increased state spending on refugees and higher investment in construction.
The Economy Ministry on Wednesday confirmed its forecast for the economy to grow by 1.4 percent this year. It added the slowdown was mainly due to there being fewer workdays in 2017.
Ifo economist Wohlrabe confirmed the institute's forecast for economic growth of 1.5 percent in 2017.
With trade prospects subdued not only by Trump's protectionist policy plans, but also by Britain's decision to leave the EU, the German economy looks set to remain dependent on domestic demand this year.
""Particularly the construction sector should remain an important growth driver in 2017,"" Brzeski said.

""Maybe one of the few upsides of many uncertainties in traditional export destinations could be a rethinking or reorientation of the economy, finally leading to a kick-start of investments at home.""

He said German firms were waiting for actions from Trump, not just words and nothing has yet been decided on protectionist measures.
""There is no Trump effect seen in this numbers as export expectations have risen, even in the car industry,"" said Wohlrabe.
Trump has warned German car companies such as BMW (DE:BMWG) that he plans to impose a border tax of 35 percent on vehicles imported to the U.S. market.

In a report, the German research institute Ifo said its Business Climate Index fell to a seasonally adjusted 109.8 this month from a reading of 111.0 in December, missing forecasts for a rise to 111.3.
The Current Assessment Index increased to 116.9 in January from 116.6 a month earlier. The reading was in line with expectations.
The Business Expectations Index, which measures attitudes toward business prospects over the next six months, unexpectedly fell to 103.2 this month from the reading of 105.5 (revised from 105.6) in December and compared to estimates for a reading of an increase to 105.8.
The monthly index is based on a survey of around 7,000 German firms in the manufacturing, construction, wholesale and retail sectors.
Immediately following the report, EUR/USD was trading at 1.0731 from around 1.0725 ahead of the release of the data, while EUR/GBP was at 0.8564 from 0.8561 earlier.
Meanwhile, European stock markets were broadly higher. The benchmark Euro Stoxx 50 gained 1.24%, Germany's DAX rose 1.25%, France’s CAC 40 added on 1.11%, while London’s FTSE 100 advanced 0.69%."

690,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 24, 2017 09:40PM ET</span>","South Korea economy falters in fourth quarter as consumption, construction slump amid political crisis","SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea's economic growth retreated further in the last quarter of 2016, the Bank of Korea said on Wednesday, as a sharp slowdown in construction investment and private consumption took hold in the face of a deepening political crisis.
The quarter was marked by an influence-peddling corruption scandal involving President Park Geun-hye, who was impeached by South Korea's parliament, with a final determination by a court to follow.
The outgoing chief judge at the Constitutional Court said on Wednesday the court should make its impeachment ruling before March 13 because two of the nine judges, including himself, are retiring soon.
A presidential election will be automatically triggered within 60 days of the court's decision if she is removed.
South Korea's special prosecutors plan to investigate more companies after their probe of Samsung (KS:005930) Group (SAGR.UL) named the group's leader, Lee Jae-young, as a suspect in the corruption scandal that led to Park's impeachment.
The political upheaval has raised fears of policy paralysis and may have weighed on consumer sentiment, which fell for a third month through January.
Growth was just 0.4 percent in seasonally adjusted terms on-quarter, slowing from a 0.6 percent in the September quarter and a 0.8 percent gain in the June quarter, the Bank of Korea said on Wednesday.
The 0.4 percent growth in seasonally adjusted terms topped the median forecast of 0.3 percent from a Reuters survey of 17 economists.
Construction investment fell by a seasonally adjusted 1.7 percent during the October-December period after a 3.5 percent jump three months earlier, while private consumption expanded just 0.2 percent, slumping from a 0.5 percent rise in the September quarter.
Facilities investment increased 6.3 percent on-quarter, jumping from a 0.2 percent rise three months earlier.
""A decline in private consumption was the biggest factor in lowering the growth rate even as facilities investment improved,"" Chung Kyu-il, a director at the BOK, said at a news conference, noting private consumption made up 49.5 percent of GDP.
Chung added that exports of semiconductors, displays, and other electronic components will continue to improve and drive facilities investment this year, although the shipping and shipbuilding sectors may drag on growth as they undergo corporate restructuring.
In annual terms, GDP rose 2.3 percent in the fourth quarter, down from a 2.6 percent rise in the third quarter.
The economy expanded 2.7 percent in 2016 from a year earlier, matching the bank's growth target and edging up after a 2.6 percent rise in 2015.
""While 2.7 percent expansion is a notable pick-up, the construction investment failing to grow shows domestic demand is sluggish,"" Kim Doo-un, a Seoul-based economist with Hana Financial Investment said.
""An expansion of 0.4 percent (on-quarter) is quite low given that it's the weakest in a year and a half,"" he added.
Exports failed to lift growth in the December quarter, slipping by 0.1 percent after rising 0.6 percent in the previous three months.
By sector, manufacturing led the overall growth with a 1.8 percent gain on-quarter, while agriculture and fisheries declined 2.8 percent. Services remained unchanged from three months earlier.
The central bank said earlier that private spending would be weaker in 2017 as uncertainties arising from the influence-peddling corruption scandal affect consumer sentiment.
Credit costs rising in line with U.S. interest rates will increase the burden of household debt repayment, putting private consumption growth at risk.

The BOK sees gross domestic product growth at 2.5 percent this year, driven by a recovery in exports and facilities investment, even if global trade growth weakens on the fear or the reality of deepening protectionism.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. home resales fell more than expected in December as the supply of houses on the market dropped to levels last seen in 1999, but the housing market recovery remained intact against the backdrop of a tightening labor market.
The National Association of Realtors said on Tuesday existing home sales decreased 2.8 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.49 million units. In addition to the lack of properties to purchase, rising home prices and mortgage rates also likely sidelined some buyers last month. 
The drop in sales followed three straight months of increases and probably does not signal impending housing weakness, with the labor market near full employment and the economy strengthening.
""The dip in housing sales is more a sign of the lack of homes to be bought than the desire to buy homes,"" said Joel Naroff, chief economist at Naroff Economic Advisors in Holland, Pennsylvania. ""It is hard to sell homes that are not for sale.""  
November's existing sales pace was revised up to 5.65 million units, which was the highest since February 2007, from the previously reported 5.61 million units. 
Economists had forecast sales declining 1.1 percent to a 5.52 million-unit pace in December. Sales increased 3.8 percent to 5.45 million units in 2016, the highest since 2006 when the housing market peaked.
Last month, the number of homes on the market fell 10.8 percent from November to 1.65 million units, the lowest level since December 1999.
Supply was down 6.3 percent from a year ago and has now declined for 19 straight months on a year-on-year basis. The dearth of inventory amid rising household formation could put pressure on homebuilders to ramp up construction. 
Homebuilding is currently running just above a 1.2 million-unit rate. The NAR estimates housing starts and completions should be in a 1.5 million to 1.6 million range to alleviate the chronic shortage. 
The PHLX housing index (HGX) rallied on expectations that the inventory squeeze would provide a boom for homebuilders. The index closed 3.29 percent higher, outperforming gains in the broader stock market.
Shares in the nation's largest homebuilder, D.R. Horton (N:DHI), surged 6.61 percent. The homebuilder also reported a better-than-expected quarterly profit after selling more homes. Shares in  Lennar  Corp (N:LEN) jumped 5.99 percent and Pultegroup (N:PHM) advanced 5.88 percent. 
The dollar rose marginally against a basket of currencies and prices for U.S. government bonds ended lower.
BUYERS OUT IN DROVES
""Buyers are out touring in droves, ready to pounce on new listings that fit the bill,"" said Nela Richardson, chief economist at Redfin in Washington. ""The only thing missing is homes for sale to satisfy demand, because there just aren't a lot of homes available to buy right now.""
Supply could remain a headache as builders continue to complain about a shortage of skilled workers and land.
With fewer homes available for sale, house prices continued to rise last month. The median house price increased 4.0 percent from a year ago to $232,200 in December. 
At the same time, the fixed 30-year mortgage rate increased 43 basis points in December from November to an average of 4.20 percent, according to data from mortgage finance firm Freddie Mac. That was the highest since April 2014. 
Mortgage rates could rise further as the Federal Reserve has forecast three rate hikes this year. The U.S. central bank raised its benchmark overnight interest rate in December by 25 basis points to a range of 0.50 percent to 0.75 percent. 
While the Realtors group is forecasting existing home sales increasing one percent this year to 5.52 million units, it expressed concerns over President Donald Trump's suspension last Saturday of a plan by the Obama administration to cut mortgage insurance premiums on federally insured home loans.
The reduction in Federal Housing Administration (FHA) mortgage insurance premiums, announced in the final days of Barack Obama's presidency and due to take effect on Jan. 27, had been estimated by the government to save eligible homeowners an average of $500 a year.
According to NAR, about 750,000 to 850,000 home buyers would face higher costs, and 30,000 to 40,000 new home buyers would be sidelined without the reduction.
Last month, existing home sales fell in the Northeast, the West and the Midwest. They were unchanged in the South. At December's sales pace, it would take 3.6 months to clear the stock of houses on the market, the fewest since January 2005. 
That was down from 3.9 months in November. A six-month supply is viewed as a healthy balance between supply and demand. 

With supply tightening, house prices notched their 58thconsecutive month of year-on-year gains in December. House prices increased 5.2 percent in 2016 to an average of $233,900. Higher prices are increasing equity for homeowners and might encourage some to put their homes on the market. But combined with higher mortgage rates, they could make it increasingly difficult for first-time buyers to purchase homes. First-time buyers accounted for 32 percent of transactions last month, well below the 40 percent share that economists and realtors say is needed for a robust housing market. They accounted for 32 percent of transactions in 2016.

The industry data showed that home resales fell 2.8% in December to a seasonally adjusted 5.49 million units from 5.65 million units in the previous month. November’s data was revised from an initial reading of 5.61 million units.
The consensus forecast was for a 1.1% decrease to 5.52 million units.
The data helps to gauge the strength of the U.S. housing market and is considered to be a key indicator of overall economic strength.
""Existing-home sales closed out 2016 as the best year in a decade, even as sales declined in December as the result of ongoing affordability tensions and historically low supply levels"", the NAR said in the release.
Total existing-home sales, which are completed transactions that include single-family homes, townhomes, condominiums and co-ops, finished 2016 at 5.45 million sales and surpassed 2015 (5.25 million) as the highest since 2006 (6.48 million), the report noted.
""Solid job creation throughout 2016 and exceptionally low mortgage rates translated into a good year for the housing market,"" NAR chief economist Lawrence Yun explained said.
""However, higher mortgage rates and home prices combined with record low inventory levels stunted sales in much of the country in December,"" he explained.

In a report, market research group Markit said that its flash manufacturing purchasing managers’ index (PMI) rose to 55.1 in January from the prior month’s final reading of 54.3. That was its strongest reading since March 2015.
Analysts had expected only slight increase to 54.5.
On the index, a reading above 50.0 indicates expansion, below indicates contraction.
Markit highlighted that the sharp increase in new work led to faster growth of output and purchasing activity, although the growth in new export work remained muted and the pace of job creation softened slightly.
“U.S. manufacturers are seeing a bumper start to 2017, with production surging higher in January on the back of rising inflows of new orders,” Markit chief economist Chris Williamson commented.
“The survey results suggest that faster manufacturing growth and inventory rebuilding should help boost GDP in the first quarter if current trends persist in coming months,” he said, adding that “rising factory employment should also help improve consumer morale and spending.”
Williamson did note however that the strong growth and increase in price pressures may spur speculation around the next rate hike by the Federal Reserve.

LONDON (Reuters) - The euro zone started 2017 by maintaining solid economic growth as a weaker currency boosted orders for goods and services, a survey showed, but rising political risks could soon take their toll.
Growth in Germany's private sector slowed slightly in January but in France activity rose to levels not seen in more 5-1/2 years on expectations the country's presidential election will yield a more business friendly environment.
Campaigning on plans to cut corporate tax and slash public spending, conservative former prime minister Francois Fillon is leading the polls to win a May 7 runoff in France's two-round presidential election.
But a surge in support for populist and euroskeptic political parties across the continent could rekindle some of the concerns about fragmentation that were evident in 2012, Fitch ratings agency warned.
""Using a composite financial shock of banking, bond and stock markets, we find that the real economic costs would be high in all large euro zone members,"" said Gergely Kiss, a director in Fitch's economics team.
Uncertainty from rising protectionist sentiments after the Brexit vote in June and Donald Trump's U.S. election win meant economists in Reuters polls have said the bloc does not have enough momentum to withstand any major political change.
Elections are also due this year in Germany, the Netherlands and possibly Italy.
European stocks (FTEU3) gained 0.3 percent as markets were comforted by the euro zone growth data, combined with a 2-1/2 year high in commodity shares and on a 1 percent jump in Italian stocks following a merger deal for two of its banks.
MOMENTUM MAINTAINED
IHS Markit's Euro Zone Flash Composite Purchasing Managers' Index, seen as a good overall growth indicator, only dipped slightly from December's five-year high of 54.4 to 54.3, comfortably above the 50-point line that indicates growth.
A Reuters poll had predicted a modest uptick to 54.5.
""While the PMI edged slightly down in January, this should not be taken as a sign of weakness. Momentum in the euro zone economy remains fairly strong,"" said Bert Colijn at ING.
Markit said the PMI, if maintained, pointed to first quarter economic growth of 0.4 percent, in line with a Reuters poll published earlier this month.
A sub-index measuring prices charged spent its third month above the break-even mark although it ticked down to 51.6 from December's 51.7, which was the highest since July 2011.
Any signs of ongoing inflationary pressures, however weak, will be welcomed by policymakers at the European Central Bank who for years have been unable to get prices to rise anywhere near as fast as they would like.
Prices in the 19-member bloc rose 1.1 percent in December on a year earlier. The ECB wants inflation below, but close to 2 percent and has bought more than a trillion euros worth of euro zone government bonds, putting cash into the banking system with the aim of stimulating price rises in the economy.
""In all, the survey has brought some more encouraging news. But, as headline inflation rises and political uncertainty damages investment, we still see growth slowing somewhat this year,"" said Jennifer McKeown at Capital Economics.
Activity in the bloc's manufacturing industry increased at the fastest pace since April 2011. Its PMI was 55.1, up from 54.9 and above the median forecast of 54.8 in a Reuters poll of 48 economists.
An index measuring output, which feeds into the composite PMI, nudged down to 55.9 from December's 32-month high of 56.1.
New export orders, which includes trade amongst member countries, held steady at last month's 54.8, the highest reading since the start of 2014.
""The weakening of the euro provides some tailwind here, as businesses report that stronger new orders in manufacturing are often coming from outside the euro zone,"" Colijn said.
The PMI for the bloc's dominant service industry slipped to 53.6 from 53.7, confounding the prediction for a rise to 53.9.

But in a sign that growth will probably be maintained in coming months, the PMIs showed an increase in demand. The new business index rose to 53.6 from 53.5, its highest in a year.

705,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 24, 2017 04:50AM ET</span>",UK public finances data suggest Hammond likely to hit deficit target,"LONDON (Reuters) - Britain cut its budget deficit by slightly less than expected last month but a better than previously thought performance in November could help finance minister Philip Hammond to hit his target for the current financial year.
Official figures on Tuesday showed public borrowing in December alone fell by 5 percent to 6.9 billion pounds, higher than a median forecast of 6.7 billion pounds in a Reuters poll of economists.
But borrowing in the first nine months of the 2016/17 tax year fell by a sharper 14.3 percent to 63.8 billion pounds compared with a year earlier, helped by a smaller than previously reported budget deficit in the month of November.
The Office for National Statistics revised the shortfall in November to 11.3 billion pounds from a previous estimate of 12.6 billion pounds.
Hammond is aiming to cut the full-year budget deficit by 10 percent to 68.2 billion pounds, which would still leave Britain with one of biggest shortfalls among the world's industrialized nations at about 3.5 percent of economic output.
Although the deficit in the year so far is running close to Hammond's target, income tax returns in January are likely to push the public finances into surplus for the month.
In the first three months of 2016, the deficit grew by a total of 1 billion pounds, an ONS official said.
Britain's budget forecasters had predicted in March that the government would be able to reduce its deficit by more than 20 percent in 2016/17. But in a November update, they reined in their projections for how much progress the government would make because of the impact of June's Brexit vote.
The Office for Budget Responsibility said later that Hammond could overshoot even the revised target with only a small deviation from its forecasts.
Tuesday's figures suggested rising inflation was adding to the government's debt costs which were up nearly 7 percent in the April-December period. But corporation tax revenues rose nearly 10 percent.
Hammond has dropped the goal of his predecessor George Osborne of eliminating the budget deficit by 2020, giving himself leeway to help the economy cope with the slowdown he expects as Britain prepares to leave the European Union.
Hammond told Reuters last week he did not plan to use any of this leeway for now, given the signs so far that Britain's economy has held up well to the shock Brexit vote in June.
Last year's budget deficit was 4.0 percent of GDP.
Public sector net debt jumped in December to its highest level at least since comparable records began in 1997 at 86.2 percent of GDP, reflecting the expansion of the Bank of England's bond-buying programs to the help the economy.

The BoE's actions also pushed up the public sector net cash requirement sharply.

The preliminary euro zone manufacturing purchasing managers’ index inched up to 55.1 this month from a final reading of 54.9 in December. Analysts had expected the index to drop to 54.8 in January.
On the index, a reading above 50.0 indicates industry expansion, below indicates contraction.
The start of the year also saw the largest monthly rise in employment since February 2008. Hiring gained momentum in both services and manufacturing on the back of sustained growth of new orders, the rate of increase of which held steady on December’s one-year high, as well as improved optimism about the year ahead.
Inflationary pressures meanwhile intensified further in January. Firms’ average input costs rose at the fastest rate since May 2011, with rates of increase accelerating in both services and manufacturing.

The Markit/Nikkei Japan Flash Manufacturing Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) rose to a seasonally adjusted 52.8 in January from a final 52.4 in the previous month.
The index remained above the 50 threshold that separates expansion from contraction for the third consecutive month and showed that activity expanded at the fastest since March 2014.
""The Japanese manufacturing sector started the New Year on a strong footing,"" said Amy Brownbill, economist at IHS Markit, which compiles the survey.
""The rise in total incoming new orders was driven in part by a sharp increase in international demand, as new export orders rose at the quickest rate in over a year.""
The preliminary index for new export orders rose to 53.2 from a final 51.1 in December, indicating the fastest gain in 14 months.
The flash index for new orders, which measures both domestic and external demand, rose to 54.1 from 53.2 in the previous month, the highest in 13 months.
Some economists have expressed concern about Japan's economic outlook because its exports could suffer if U.S. President Donald Trump adopts protectionist trade policies.
Trump took office only last week, and there is still a lot of uncertainty about the specific economic policies he will pursue.
The flash PMI index offers evidence that global trade is picking up, which is a benefit for Japan's export-focused economy.

The latest quarterly survey of 103 financial services firms by business lobby CBI and consultancy PwC found sentiment about Britain's overall business climate fell the most since December 2008, with banks especially pessimistic.
90 percent of banks surveyed said preparing for the impact of Britain's exit from the European Union was their top challenge.
""Uncertainty has contributed to the low levels of optimism reported by many financial services companies, particularly by the banks,"" Andrew Kail, Head of Financial Services at PwC, said in the report.
Banks have begun signaling how they will put plans into action to cope with a ""hard"" exit by Britain from the EU, after Prime Minister Theresa May said Britain will leave the single market.
Kail also said that greater clarity on the UK position on Brexit from the Prime Minister's speech this week was welcome, not least a commitment to a period of phased implementation. 
The survey revealed a more optimistic outlook for hiring, with 18 percent of financial firms saying they had increased employment in the period compared with 10 percent showing a decrease. IT was the biggest area for new jobs.
The survey also said firms considered increasing their dialogue with regulators as the biggest priority as Britain negotiates its EU exit.

China reported on Friday that its economy expanded by 6.8 percent in the fourth quarter thanks to strong consumer spending and record bank lending to stimulate the economy, despite rising debt concerns.
China's services sector contributed 58.2 percent to the country's economic growth in 2016, marking a rise of 5.3 percent from a year ago, the NBS said in a notice posted on its website on Sunday. The service sector accounted for 51.6 percent of China's total gross domestic product (GDP) in 2016. 
A detailed breakdown in economic growth by industry issued by the NBS showed growth in China's red-hot property market slow to 7.7 percent in the fourth quarter from 8.8 percent in the third quarter, adding to concerns that a cooling housing market would drag on economic growth.  
It also highlighted a sharp slowdown in the financial sector, which decelerated from 5.8 percent growth in the July-September period to 3.8 percent in the fourth quarter.     
    Growth in the construction sector also slowed marginally in the fourth quarter to 5.9 percent from 6.0 percent in the third quarter, despite a rebound in market confidence with new housing starts unexpectedly rising 12.5 percent in December compared to a month ago.
Despite signs of cooling in these sectors, state-owned newspaper Economic Daily warned on Sunday that some Chinese firms with large sum of capital have shown ""the dangerous tendency of overly favouring virtual industries than the real economy"", looking to the property market and financial markets for quicker profits.
    The overall service sector remained strong in the quarter, growing 8.3 percent compared to 7.6 percent in the third quarter.
    ""Other services"" overtook the real estate sector to become the fastest growing segment of the economy, with growth of 10.6 percent in the fourth quarter, up from 8.8 percent in the third. Other services includes many consumer services such as media and education, but also scientific research, social services and utilities.
    Growth in transportation, storage and postal services accelerated to 9.9 percent in the fourth quarter, compared to a 6.5 percent rise in the third quarter, Saturday's data showed. 
    The retail and wholesale sector also improved marginally to 7.2 percent for October-December from 7.0 percent in the third quarter as China's consumers kept spending.

Underlying inflation, a key measure watched by the ECB, is seen rising to just 1.1 percent this year, barely half of the bank's inflation objective, then inching up to 1.3 percent in 2018 and 1.5 percent in 2019, the ECB said in its quarterly Survey of Professional Forecasters.
The ECB kept its unprecedented stimulus measures in place on Thursday, arguing that the recent price surge is only temporary and due almost entirely to oil price rises. Underlying inflation, or prices excluding food and energy, lacked a convincing upward trend, the ECB said.
Headline inflation, now running at 1.1 percent, its highest level in over three years, is expected average 1.4 percent this year, 1.5 percent in 2018, then rise to 1.8 percent by 2021, still shy of the ECB's target. The central bank aims for inflation of below, but close to, 2 percent.
""There are no signs yet of a convincing upward trend in underlying inflation,"" Draghi told at a press conference on Thursday after reviewing the survey's results. ""Measures of underlying inflation are expected to rise more gradually over the medium term.""

Inflation has been far below the ECB's target for years with at least Ireland still in deflation, and Cyprus, Greece and Italy recording close to zero price growth, illustrating that the bloc is far away from fully recovering from one of the worst financial crises for decades.

734,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 20, 2017 03:50AM ET</span>",China GDP beats expectations but debt risks loom,"By Kevin Yao and Elias Glenn
BEIJING (Reuters) - China's economy grew a faster-than-expected 6.8 percent in the fourth quarter, boosted by higher government spending and record bank lending, giving it a tailwind heading into what is expected to be a turbulent year.
But Beijing's decision to prioritize its official growth target could exact a high price, as policymakers grapple with financial risks created by an explosive growth in debt.
China's debt to GDP ratio rose to 277 percent at the end of 2016 from 254 percent the previous year, with an increasing share of new credit being used to pay debt servicing costs, UBS analysts said in a note.
The fourth quarter was the first time in two years that the world's second-largest economy has shown an uptick in economic growth, but this year it faces further pressure to cool its housing market, the impact of government efforts at structural reforms, and a potentially testy relationship with a new U.S. administration.
    ""We do not expect this (Q4 GDP) rebound to extend far into 2017, when a slowdown in the property market and steps to address supply shortages in the commodity sector ought to drag again on demand and output,"" said Tom Rafferty, regional China manager for the Economist Intelligence Unit.
The economy expanded 6.7 percent in 2016, the National Bureau of Statistics said on Friday, near the middle of the government's 6.5-7 percent growth target but still the slowest pace in 26 years.
Economists polled by Reuters had expected 6.7 percent growth for both the fourth quarter and the full year.
Housing helped prop up growth again in the fourth quarter, with property investment rising a surprisingly strong 11.1 percent in December from 5.7 percent in November, even as house prices showed signs of cooling in some major cities.
Consumer spending was also strong, with retail sales in December rising at their fastest pace in a year on stronger sales of cars and cosmetics.
STABILITY A PRIORITY
Fixed asset investment grew 8.1 percent, the slowest pace since 1999, as investment by private firms slowed again in December on a monthly basis. Private sector fixed asset investment fell to 4.07 percent from 4.93 percent in November, according to Reuters calculations based on statistics bureau data.
Consumption contributed the bulk of growth last year, but income growth didn't pick up, and a measure of China's income inequality rose slightly last year, the statistics bureau said.
Amid signs of stabilization, policy sources told Reuters that China's leaders will lower their economic growth target to around 6.5 percent this year, giving them more room to push reforms to contain debt risks.
They will not want to let growth fall too sharply, however, ahead of a key party meeting in the autumn when a new generation of leaders will be picked.
""Economic stability is always important but will be an even higher priority ahead of the 19th Party Congress,"" said Tim Condon, Singapore-based economist at ING.
In a sign of the tasks ahead, the People's Bank of China unexpectedly cut the amount banks must keep in reserve on Friday, a measure aimed at easing tight liquidity ahead of the upcoming Lunar New Year holiday.
""Today's move seems to suggest that liquidity conditions are tighter than authorities' expectations, as capital outflows remain strong,"" said Zhou Hou, senior emerging markets economist at Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) in Singapore.
Capital outflows have been putting strong downward pressure on the yuan, which lost nearly 7 percent last year, making it the worst performing major Asian currency.
RISKS INCREASE
Rapid monetary expansion and expectations of slower economic growth at home, along with a rising U.S. dollar, also hit the yuan.
""The key risk to the Chinese economy in 2017 and 2018 is the possibility that faster than expected U.S. interest rate increases could intensify Chinese capital outflows and increase stresses on China's financial system,"" said Bill Adams, senior economist at U.S.-based PNC Financial Services Group (NYSE:PNC). 
China's sluggish exports could also come under fresh pressure if U.S. President-elect Donald Trump follows through on pledges to impose tough protectionist measures.
""Relations with a Trump administration is the biggest known unknown. Trump advisers and cabinet-nominees have identified the U.S.-China relationship as in need of adjustment to support the president-elect's objective of a manufacturing renaissance,"" said Condon.
China's central bank could slightly tighten credit conditions this year to encourage debt-laden companies to deleverage, but it's unlikely to rush to raise interest rates despite an expected pick-up in inflation, policy insiders said.

""Looking at the economic forces out there both globally and domestically, I think that China will face a few headwinds. Externally, mainly from a change in the climate in the U.S. with regards to China's exports...(and) within China I think we will see a bit of impact from the slowdown in property investment,"" said Louis Kuijs, head Of Asia economics at Oxford Economics in Hong Kong.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japanese manufacturers' morale rose for a fifth straight month in January to a 2-1/2 year high and the service sector's mood jumped to its highest levels since mid-2015, a Reuters poll showed, thanks to a weak yen and buoyant share prices.
The latest Reuters Tankan underscores growth prospects for the world's third largest economy, but uncertainty lies ahead after U.S. President-elect Donald Trump is inaugurated on Friday, with his protectionist agenda casting doubts over the smooth conduct of global trade. 
The Reuters' monthly poll - which tracks the Bank of Japan's key quarterly tankan - found confidence at manufacturers and service-sector firms slipping over the next three months.
In the poll of 531 large- and mid-sized firms, conducted between Jan. 4 and 17 and in which 266 responded, the sentiment index for manufacturers rose to 18 from 16 in December, driven by industries such as electronics and machinery.
It was the highest reading since August 2014, but is expected to fall back to 16 in April.
""I felt manufacturers were becoming positive about capital spending from last August or September. The yen weakening following the U.S. election spurred an upswing in the economy,"" a manager at a electric machinery firm wrote in the survey, which companies answer anonymously.
However, some companies also expressed cautious views about the future, and others complained about weak demand at home as well as in China and emerging market economies.
""The global economy's trend is unclear. Currencies and oil prices are fluctuating violently,"" a chemicals company said.
The service-sector index rose to 30 from 19 in December, boosted by retailers and wholesalers, somewhat easing concerns about the private consumption that constitutes about 60 percent of the economy.
It was the highest reading since June 2015, but it is seen slipping to 28 in April.
The BOJ's December tankan showed the mood among big Japanese manufacturers improved for the first time in six quarters to hit a one-year high, as the weakening yen and a pick-up in the global economy brightened prospects for exporters.
Japan's central bank last month held off on expanding stimulus, underscoring a market view that it will stand pat unless a severe external shock threatens to derail economic recovery.
It holds its next rate review at the end of this month.

The Reuters Tankan indexes are calculated by subtracting the percentage of pessimistic respondents from optimistic ones. A negative figure means pessimists outnumber optimists.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Hollywood mogul David Geffen's $70 million purchase of an oceanfront estate topped luxury home sales last year in New York's Hamptons, but a sharp price drop after the No. 2 spot reveals a dismal year, a local brokerage reported on Thursday.
A $63.8 million sale of another oceanfront property in East Hampton, New York, to liquefied natural gas entrepreneur Michael Smith was the second-most expensive home sold in 2016 in the Hamptons, according to Town & Country Real Estate in East Hampton.
But subsequent sales dropped below $30 million for the first time since 2012, said Judi Desiderio, chief executive of Town & Country. The lowest ranking on her annual list of the top 10 most expensive homes sold was $15.99 million, the lowest since 2010, she said.
""The high end sank like a stone in 2016. It wasn't one of those 'feel good' years for Wall Street,"" Desiderio said.
The Hamptons real estate market goes in cycles in lockstep with Wall Street's fortunes, according to Desiderio. Record sales are only shattered after outstanding years for U.S. stocks.
Billionaire investor Barry Rosenstein of Jana Partners paid $147 million for ocean-front property in East Hampton in 2014, a record for U.S. residential sales.
Smith's purchase of three adjacent properties totaled $110 million.
Geffen and Smith represent an elite whose wealth outstrips others with homes in the Hamptons, a cluster of towns, villages and hamlets on Long Island's east end, Desiderio said.
The market for overall sales in the Hamptons ended 2016 with a thud, she said. Of the 12 local markets that Town & Country monitors, only three last year experienced an increase in the number of homes sold.
But traffic to the brokerage's eight offices so far in January is up. Desiderio knew of three bidding wars, which is unusual for the month, and indications point to a better 2017, she said.

743,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 19, 2017 12:33PM ET</span>",U.S. economy shows strength on eve of Trump presidency,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. homebuilding rebounded sharply in December as a firming economy boosts demand for rental housing, while an unexpected drop in the number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits last week pointed to a further tightening in the labor market.
The economy's brightening prospects were underscored by other data on Thursday showing factory activity in the mid-Atlantic region accelerating to a two-year high this month, amid jumps in new orders, employment and inventories. 
In addition, manufacturers reported paying more for raw materials and asking for higher prices for their goods, mirroring other recent factory surveys. This suggests that a broad increase in inflation could be on the way. 
The reports came as Republican Donald Trump prepared to be sworn in as president on Friday, taking over from President Barack Obama, whose administration's policies have been credited with pulling the economy from the 2007-09 recession.
""The economy is doing great, whichever way you look at it,"" said Harm Bandholz, chief U.S. economist at UniCredit Research in New York. ""The labor market is close to full employment and the housing market continues to heal. Trump is inheriting a strong economy.""
Housing starts jumped 11.3 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.23 million units last month, the Commerce Department said. Starts were driven by a 57.3 percent surge in the construction of multi-family housing units, which offset a 4.0 percent drop in single-family starts.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast housing starts increasing to a 1.20 million-unit rate in December. Housing starts increased 4.9 percent in 2016. 
Permits for future home construction slipped 0.2 percent to a 1.21 million-rate last month as approvals for the multi-family segment fell 9.0 percent. However, permits for single-family homes construction rose 4.7 percent. 
The housing market remains on solid ground even as mortgage rates have jumped above 4 percent. 
The tightening labor market, marked by an unemployment rate near a nine-year low of 4.7 percent, is fueling demand for housing. Much of the demand, however, has been concentrated in the multi-family housing segment, in part as a shortage of houses on the market drives home prices higher. 
That has priced out some first-time homebuyers from the market, boosting rents. A broad measure of rents increased 3.9 percent in the year through December, the biggest rise since April 2007. With the labor market near full employment, demand for housing is likely to remain supported this year.
""Higher mortgage interest rates present downside risk. But today's data make clear that no slowdown is yet evident with starts likely to remain robust in January,"" said Andrew Hollenhorst, an economist at  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) in New York.
""This increases our conviction that residential investment will contribute positively to economic growth in 2017.""
LABOR MARKET TIGHTENING 
In a separate report, the Labor Department said initial claims for state unemployment benefits fell 15,000 to a seasonally adjusted 234,000 for the week ended Jan. 14. That was just shy of the 233,000 level touched in mid-November, which was the lowest since November 1973.
Economists had forecast first-time applications for jobless benefits rising to 254,000 last week. It was the 98th straight week that claims remained below 300,000, a threshold associated with a healthy labor market. That is the longest stretch since 1970, when the labor market was much smaller. 
The four-week moving average of claims, considered a better
measure of labor market trends as it irons out week-to-week
volatility, fell 10,250 to 246,750 last week, the lowest level since November 1973. The claims data covered the survey period for January's nonfarm payrolls.
The four-week average of claims fell 17,000 between the December and January survey periods, suggesting another month of solid job growth. Nonfarm payrolls increased by 156,000 jobs in December.
The dollar rose against a basket of currencies on the data and comments by European Central Bank chief Mario Draghi, suggesting the euro zone still needed support from monetary policy. Prices for U.S. government debt fell. U.S. stocks were little changed. 
Homebuilding is expected to make a modest contribution to economic growth in the fourth quarter after being a drag on gross domestic product in the prior two periods.
A survey on Wednesday showed homebuilders' confidence easing slightly in January, but remaining not far from levels last seen in July 2005. Construction remains constrained by shortages of lots and labor. Builders are hoping that the incoming Trump administration will streamline and reform regulations.
Trump has pledged to reduce regulations, among other policy initiatives. A third report on Thursday from the Philadelphia Federal Reserve showed its index for manufacturing activity in the mid-Atlantic region rose to a reading of 23.6 this month from 19.7 in December.
That was the highest reading since November 2014. Nearly 35 percent of firms in the survey reported paying more for inputs and 31 percent said they had asked for higher prices. The Philadelphia Fed's prices received sub-index increased 19 points this month to its highest reading since July 2008.

""The report adds to signs of upward momentum in manufacturing, although some of the improvement likely reflects sentiment after the election rather than a fundamental change yet in underlying trends,"" said Jim O'Sullivan, chief U.S. economist at High Frequency Economics in Valhalla, New York.

745,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 19, 2017 11:03AM ET</span>",U.S. Mid-Atlantic business activity highest in two years: Philly Fed,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Business activity in the U.S. Mid-Atlantic region increased in January to its strongest level in over two years due to a pickup in new orders and employment and an improved six-month outlook, the Philadelphia Federal Reserve said on Thursday.
The regional central bank's business condition gauge rose to 23.6 last month, which was the highest since November 2014 when it was 34.8. The December reading was revised down to 19.7 from an earlier 21.5. 
""The indexes for general activity, new orders, and employment were all positive this month and increased from their readings last month,"" the Philadelphia Fed said in a statement.
The barometer on Mid-Atlantic business activity, together with other sentiment indicators, has spiked in the aftermath of Donald Trump's U.S. presidential win.
Business owners and investors have anticipated Trump and a Republican-controlled Congress would enact tax cuts, infrastructure spending and looser regulations to promote faster economic growth.
The report's latest reading on new orders rose to 26.0 in January from a revised 14.90 in December, while the employment index jumped to 12.8 from 3.6.
The six-month business outlook increased to 56.6, the highest since August 2014.
Despite a rosier outlook, companies surveyed remained cautious in hiring more workers in the coming months.
When asked how they would meet higher output in the next quarter, only 13.6 percent of companies said they would do so by increasing its staff.
Economists are waiting to see whether the recent surge in business optimism portends faster factory output. 
""We will look to official industrial production and manufacturing data to see if this is translating into output growth for the sector,""  Barclays  (LON:BARC) economists wrote in a research note.

The Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors said its members expected a further slowdown in price rises over the next three months, although a clear majority thought prices in 2017 would be higher than last year.
The resilience of Britain's housing market since the referendum decision to leave the European Union has confounded warnings from former finance minister George Osborne of a sharp fall in prices if the country voted to leave the bloc.
RICS's headline house price balance slowed to +24 in December, its first fall since July, from November's seven-month high of +29. That was a bigger drop than any of the forecasts in a Reuters poll of economists although it still reflected solid price rises.
Gains were strongest in northwest England. Central London, where prices have fallen for 10 months due to concerns about Britain's exit from the European Union and higher tax on expensive properties, was the only region to see a decline.
RICS chief economist Simon Rubinsohn said a shortage of properties for sale was creating a vicious cycle. Existing homeowners were reluctant to move because of the poor choice on offer and high cost of buying a larger home.
""A familiar story relating to supply continues to drive both the sales and letting markets, impacting on activity, prices and rents,"" he said.
A narrow majority of surveyors reported a fall in the number of sales for the first time since a big drop-off in June around the time of the Brexit referendum. The proportion expecting sales to pick up in early 2017 fell sharply.
""It remains to be seen whether or not this is a temporary setback or the onset of a weaker trend,"" RICS said. Some of its members in Scotland and London reported concern about Brexit hurting the market.
The government is due to publish plans to boost house-building in the next few weeks, but Rubinsohn said it was unlikely to end the housing shortage fast.
Britain's economy expanded much faster than most economists expected in the six months after June's Brexit vote.
But consumers are now reporting a greater squeeze on their disposable income as inflation starts to pick up after a near 20 percent fall in the value of sterling since the referendum.

Leading mortgage lenders Lloyds Banking Group (LON:LLOY) and Nationwide Building Society predict house price growth will slow this year to roughly 2 percent, compared with an official price rise of 6.7 percent in the 12 months to November.

768,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 18, 2017 11:33AM ET</span>","Higher gasoline, rental costs boost U.S. consumer inflation","By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. consumer prices rose in December as households paid more for gasoline and rental accommodation, leading to the largest year-on-year increase in 2-1/2 years and signaling that inflation pressures could be building.
Other data on Wednesday showed U.S. industrial production recording its biggest increase in two years. Rising inflation and stronger economic growth, if sustained, may push the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates at a faster pace than currently anticipated.
""Further momentum in consumer prices could add to the perception of a more hawkish Fed and the potential for more aggressive tightening,"" said Jim Baird, chief investment officer at Plante Moran Financial Advisors in Kalamazoo, Michigan.
The Labor Department said its Consumer Price Index rose 0.3 percent last month after a 0.2 percent gain in November. In the 12 months through December, the CPI increased 2.1 percent, the biggest year-on-year rise since June 2014. The CPI rose 1.7 percent in the year to November.
The gains were in line with economists' expectations. The CPI increased 2.1 percent in 2016, up from a gain of 0.7 percent in 2015.
The dollar (DXY) rose against a basket of currencies on the inflation data, while prices for U.S. government bonds fell. U.S. stocks were trading mostly higher.
The so-called core CPI, which strips out food and energy costs, rose 0.2 percent last month after the same increase in November. As a result, the core CPI was up 2.2 percent in the 12 months through December, from 2.1 percent in November.
The Fed has a 2 percent inflation target and tracks an inflation measure which is currently at 1.6 percent. Rising wages due to a tightening labor market also is contributing to higher inflation.
Average hourly earnings increased in December at their quickest pace since June 2009, a government report showed earlier this month.
Price pressures are likely to remain on an upward trend amid expectations of fiscal stimulus from the incoming Trump administration. Republican businessman-turned-politician Donald Trump, who will be sworn in as U.S. president on Friday, has pledged to increase infrastructure spending and cut taxes.
""As the labor market continues to tighten, we expect businesses, particularly in the labor-intensive service sector, to pass on a greater share of cost increases and generate higher inflation,"" said Sarah House, an economist at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) Securities in Charlotte, North Carolina.
The U.S. central bank has forecast three rate hikes this year. It raised its benchmark overnight interest rate by 25 basis points to a range of 0.50 percent to 0.75 percent last month.
GASOLINE PRICES CLIMB
Underscoring the economy's momentum, a separate report from the Fed on Wednesday showed industrial production rose 0.8 percent in December. That was the biggest gain in industrial output since November 2014.
Output was driven by a surge in the utilities production as well as an increase in manufacturing.
""The small gain in manufacturing, the third of the past four months, is a positive sign from a sector that has moved sideways over much of the past two years,"" said Andrew Labelle, an economist at  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) in New York. ""The pickup in commodity prices is clearly providing a lift to manufacturing.""
The consumer inflation report showed gasoline prices climbed 3.0 percent last month after advancing 2.7 percent in November.
Housing also continued its upward march in December. Rental costs increased 0.3 percent last month, with owners' equivalent rent of primary residence also rising 0.3 percent. Rents jumped 4.0 percent in 2016.
 Consumers also paid more for healthcare last month. The cost of medical care rose 0.2 percent as did the cost of prescription medicine, while prices paid for hospital services jumped 0.3 percent.
There were also price increases for a range of other goods and services. The cost of motor vehicle insurance increased 0.8 percent and airline fares rose 1.9 percent after falling 1.3 percent in November. Prices for used cars and trucks increased 0.5 percent.

But households got some respite at supermarkets and department stores. Food prices were unchanged for a sixth straight month, with the cost of food consumed at home dropping for an eighth consecutive month. Apparel prices fell for a second straight month in December.

The Federal Reserve said on Wednesday industrial output rose 0.8 percent last month after a downwardly revised 0.7 percent decline in November.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast industrial production rising 0.6 percent. The U.S. central bank's measure of the industrial sector comprises manufacturing, mining, and electric and gas utilities.
Overall industrial production, however, fell at an annual rate of 0.6 percent in the fourth quarter.
The bulk of December's increase was due to the 6.6 percent rise in the utilities index, which had been hampered the previous month by unseasonably warm weather. 
Manufacturing output edged up 0.2 percent and mining production was unchanged. 
Overall manufacturing output rose at an annual rate of 0.7 percent in the fourth quarter while the index for mining surged 11.9 percent in the quarter. 
With overall output increasing in December, the percentage of industrial capacity in use rose 0.6 percentage point in December to 75.5 percent, from a slightly downwardly revised 74.9 percent in November.

Fed officials look to capacity use as a signal for how much further the economy can accelerate before sparking higher inflation.

The monthly Markit Household Finance Index fell to 43.9 from 45.2 in December, with price pressures playing a ""key role"" in dampening morale among households.
Britain had one of the world's fastest-growing advanced economies last year but the Bank of England has forecast growth will slow in 2017 as the slump in sterling pushes inflation rises above its 2 percent target.
Consumer prices rose in December at the fastest pace since mid-2014, according to official data released on Tuesday.
Wednesday's survey showed households' perceptions of inflation now and in the future rose to their highest levels in three years and their appetite for major purchases declined to the lowest level since the start of 2015.
Sixty-two percent of households expected the Bank of England to raise interest rates in the next 12 months, the highest proportion for a year and up from 56 percent in December.

Bank of England Governor Mark Carney said on Monday that he would keep a close eye on consumers this year to see if their buoyant mood since June's Brexit vote persists in the face of higher inflation.

BEIJING (Reuters) - Prices of new homes in China grew last year at the fastest rate since 2011, but moderated enough in December to calm fears of a speculative bubble bursting with disastrous economic consequences.
The price moderation will come as a relief to China's leaders as they wrestle with economic targets for 2017.
Sources have told Reuters that Beijing is prepared to accept a more modest growth target of 6.5 percent this year as leaders tackle a mountain of debt built up over years of heavy official borrowing to fund stimulus campaigns.
China depended heavily on the surging real estate market and government stimulus to drive economic expansion in 2016. Now it is widely expected to report on Friday that it met its annual GDP growth target of 6.5 to 7 percent.
Analysts say two forward-looking figures -- household loans and house sales -- have been indicative of the cooling trend in the property market.
""There's usually a two to three months' lag between housing transactions and prices. And housing sales really began to fall quite precipitously in November,"" said Jonas Short, head of investment bank NSBO's Beijing office.
Average new home prices in 70 major cities rose 12.4 percent in December from a year earlier, compared to November's record 12.6 percent rise, data from the National Bureau of Statistics(NBS) showed.
National monthly growth cooled to 0.3 pct versus 0.6 pct in November, the NBS said.
Twelve 12 of 15 markets that had been singled out by authorities as overheating had price falls, a significant increase from November.
""Slow growth or slight price declines are exactly what the government wants,"" said Short.
ROBUST PRICES
China's leaders have pledged to strictly limit credit flowing into speculative buying in the housing market in 2017, which would allow it to focus on defusing explosive growth in corporate debt.
Those sentiments have been echoed by some local government heads, although local authorities are not always seen as eager to follow Beijing's property clampdowns due to the hefty revenues they garner from land sales.
China's average home prices are forecast to rise 4.1 percent in 2017, while growth in property investment would rise 5.4 percent, a state-owned newspaper reported earlier this month, citing the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences.
But authorities will be walking a fine line between curbing excessive price gains and clamping down too hard on a sector which accounts for about 15 percent of the economy.
After 2016's record surge, further sharp gains may also require more aggressive policy curbs, adding to risks of a price crash and a sharp knock for the economy. 
While supply in popular big markets remained low, China's commercial housing inventory totalled 691 million square metres in November 2016, a mere 0.01 percent drop from the same time a year earlier, adding to headaches of policymakers who set destocking in smaller cities as a priority last year.
STILL UNAFFORDABLE
Wednesday's data showed eye-popping price rises in 2016, despite a slowdown in growth late in the year.
Prices in Shenzhen, Shanghai and Beijing prices rose 23.5 percent, 26.5 percent and 25.9 percent from 2015.
""To buy a house in Shanghai, I definitely can't do it alone, I'd need my parents to help,"" said 28 year-old Barret Xu, a designer in Shanghai. 
Even in some of China's second-tier cities, investors are becoming wary of the potential risks from very high prices. 
In Hefei, a long-time top price-rise performer, average new home prices rose 46.3 percent in 2016, Wednesday's data showed, despite posting a 0.2 price decline on a monthly basis in December.
A Hefei homeowner who only gave his last name as Zhou, who already has three properties in the city, said prices have skyrocketed and he is not willing to bet further on that market.
""The average prices are about 20,000 yuan per square metre and prices are still rising at about 1,000 yuan per month. It's way to high, Hefei is just barely a second-tier city,"" Zhou said.
""The rich people from Zhejiang province and Shanghai can afford to buy tens and hundreds of houses here, but the locals can't afford that,"" he said.

792,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 17, 2017 04:40AM ET</span>","UK inflation hits highest level since mid-2014, pushed up by Brexit hit to pound","LONDON (Reuters) - British inflation rose more strongly than expected in December to hit its highest level since mid-2014, propelled by higher air fares and the Brexit-fueled fall in the value of sterling.
Official data showed consumer prices rose 1.6 percent compared with a year earlier, the Office for National Statistics said, above economists' expectations in a Reuters polls for a 1.4 percent annual rise.
That was up from 1.2 percent in November.
The Office for National Statistics said rising air fares and food prices, combined with a smaller fall in petrol prices than in December 2015, were behind the increase.
The Bank of England is watching closely how quickly prices pick up as it tries to gauge the likely impact on consumer spending which has helped Britain's economy to withstand the shock of June's decision to leave the European Union.
The BoE forecast in November that inflation will exceed 2.7 percent by the end of this year as sterling's big fall after the Brexit vote pushes up the price of imports.
But since then the pound has weakened further - falling below $1.20 on Monday to hit one of its lowest levels in more than 30 years - and international oil prices have risen. Many private-sector economists predict that inflation will hit 3 percent, possibly as soon as this summer.
The pound is down almost 20 percent against the U.S. dollar and 13 percent against the euro since the June referendum.
Bank of England Governor Mark Carney has said there are limits to how much of an overshoot the central bank will tolerate above its 2 percent inflation target although financial markets are suggesting investors see little chance of a rate hike before 2019.
On Monday, Carney said Britain's recovery was increasingly reliant on consumers which made it vulnerable to the risk of a fall in spending power.
Retail price inflation - tracked by British inflation-linked government bonds - rose by 2.5 percent in December compared with the same month in 2015, the sharpest increase since July 2014.
Excluding oil prices - which have risen sharply in recent months - and other volatile components such as food, core consumer price inflation rose by 1.6 percent, compared with economists' expectations for 1.5 percent.
Data on factory gate prices underscored the inflationary pressures in the pipeline. Output prices rose 2.7 percent, their fastest annual rise since March 2012 although a bit weaker than forecasts of a 2.9 percent increase in the Reuters poll.

Prices paid by factories for materials and energy rose by 15.8 percent, the biggest jump since September 2011.

793,By Investing.com,"<span>Jan 17, 2017 04:32AM ET</span>",U.K. annual inflation rises more than expected in December,"Investing.com - Consumer price inflation (CPI) in the U.K. increased more than expected in December, official data showed on Tuesday.
In a report, the U.K. Office for National Statistics (ONS) said the rate of consumer price inflation rose from the year before by a seasonally adjusted 1.6% last month, above forecasts for a gain of 1.4% and compared to the 1.2% increase seen in November.
Month-over-month, consumer price inflation rose by 0.5% in December, compared to the prior month’s 0.2% increase and forecasts for a 0.3% gain.
""The main contributors to the increase in the rate were rises in air fares and the price of food, along with prices for motor fuels, which fell by less than they did a year ago,"" the ONS said in the release.
Still, Bank of England Governor Mark Carney will be expected to write an open letter to the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Philip Hammond, as inflation remains below the central bank's target of 2.0%.
Core CPI, which excludes food, energy, alcohol, and tobacco costs rose at a seasonally adjusted rate of 1.6% last monthbeating forecasts for a gain of 1.5% and compared to the 1.4% advance in November.
The retail price index (RPI) increased 2.5% in December, after rising by 2.2% the previous month. Analysts had expected a gain of 2.3%.
Month-on-month, RPI increased by 0.6% in December, compared to a 0.3% gain the prior month. Analysts had expected a 0.4% rise.
Core RPI increased at an annualized rate of 2.7% in December, after rising by 2.5% the previous month. Analysts had expected a gain of 2.5%.
Month-on-month, core RPI increased 0.6% last month, compared to November’s 0.3% advance and expectations for a rise of 0.4%.
The data also showed that the house price index rose 6.7% in December, above forecasts for a gain of 6.3% and following a 6.9% increase a month earlier.
About 10 minutes prior to the release, the inflation information was reportedly leaked, sending cable 1% higher.

Business confidence in December remained at its second-highest level since Britain voted to leave the EU in June, polling firm YouGov and the Centre for Economic and Business Research (CEBR), a think tank, said.
But the survey of 500 executives also showed expectations for investment softened after an increase in November.
The proportion of business decision-makers expecting investments to increase over the next 12 months fell to 29 percent from 31 percent in November, it showed.
""While these latest figures suggest that, for the moment at least, British businesses are weathering the immediate post-Brexit referendum storm, they are still hesitant,"" Scott Corfe, CEBR director, said. 
""Although the majority of companies are optimistic about their own prospects and domestic sales over the coming 12 months, they are cautious about making big investments at the moment,"" he said.
Business confidence slumped in July in the weeks after the vote. It fell too in October when Prime Minister Theresa May said she would begin Brexit negotiations by the end of March and suggested she would take a tough approach in the talks.
The Bank of England has identified a fall in business investment as one of the potential big drags on the British economy following June's Brexit vote. 
Separately on Tuesday, jobs advertising firm REED said the 110,000 new jobs posted on its website so far in 2017 represented a 16 percent rise from the same period in 2016.
But jobs in the training sector fell by more than 54 percent and apprenticeships were down by 26.5 percent.
""Although we must acknowledge the uncertainty in markets caused by Brexit, these areas are where the future of our economy lies, and should not be ignored,"" James Reed, chairman of reed.co.uk, said.

Britain's labor market has so far largely weathered the Brexit shock. Economists polled by Reuters expect official data due on Wednesday will show the unemployment rate remained at an 11-year low of 4.8 percent in the three months to November.

800,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 15, 2017 08:25PM ET</span>","Japan core machinery orders fall as Trump, demand uncertainty sets in","By Stanley White
TOKYO (Reuters) - Core orders for Japanese machinery fell in November at their fastest in seven months, a sign companies may be deferring capital expenditure as uncertainty over the incoming Trump Administration's trade policies and global demand worries take hold.
Core orders, a highly volatile data series regarded as a leading indicator of capital expenditure, fell 5.1 percent in November from the previous month, Cabinet office data showed on Monday, more than the median estimate for a 1.7 percent decline.
Many economists originally forecast that capital expenditure would gradually increase this year, but growing concerns that U.S. President-elect Donald Trump may adopt protectionist trade policies could cause companies to scale back investment.
Trump vowed to withdraw from the Trans-Pacific Partnership free trade pact, a blow for Japan because it was counting on the TPP to boost exports and drive structural reform in its farm sector.
""There is some uncertainty about the new U.S. government, but this has not been fully factored in yet,"" said Shuji Tonouchi, senior market economist at Mitsubishi UFJ  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) Securities.
""Depending on what happens, Japanese companies could be forced to rethink their capex plans. There are also worries that domestic consumer spending may not accelerate.""
Core machinery orders, which exclude ships and heavy electrical equipment, fell in November due to a decline in orders from chemicals makers, oil refiners and the transport sector, the data showed.
Orders from the wholesale and retail industries also fell in November.
Orders from the services sector fell 9.4 percent in November after a 4.6 percent increase in the previous month.
Orders from manufacturers rose 9.8 percent, following a 1.4 percent decline in the previous month.
Trump, who takes office on Jan. 20, has rattled Japanese automakers by threatening a large border tax on the cars they manufacture in Mexico and export to the United States.
Some economists worry that once Trump takes office his criticism could shift to the goods Japan manufacturers within its own borders for export the United States, which could discourage Japanese capital expenditure.

There are also concerns that trade friction with the United States could hurt Japanese consumer sentiment, which would then weigh on household spending.

801,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 13, 2017 01:20PM ET</span>",U.S. retail sales boosted by auto demand; producer prices climb,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. retail sales rose in December amid strong demand for automobiles and furniture, providing further evidence that the economy ended the fourth quarter with momentum and is poised for stronger growth this year.
The strengthening economy is causing inflation to perk up. Other data on Friday showed producer prices rising for a second straight month in December, notching their biggest year-on-year gain in just over two years, and consumers starting to anticipate paying more for goods and services.
Rising domestic demand and inflation come ahead of expected fiscal stimulus from the incoming Trump administration. That would increase the likelihood of the Federal Reserve raising interest rates at least three times this year, economists said.
""This is not the picture of an economy that requires the support of the central bank's policymakers,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG Union Bank in New York. ""We expect Fed officials to keep with their promise to raise rates two or three times this year.""
The Commerce Department reported that retail sales increased 0.6 percent last month after rising 0.2 percent in November. Sales were up 4.1 percent from December 2015. They rose 3.3 percent for all of 2016, up from 2.3 percent in 2015.
Excluding automobiles, gasoline, building materials and food services, retail sales rose 0.2 percent after being flat in November. These so-called core retail sales correspond most closely with the consumer spending component of gross domestic product. Economists had forecast overall retail sales increasing 0.7 percent and core sales gaining 0.4 percent last month. Despite the unexpectedly smaller gain in core retail sales, the consumer spending trend remains strong.
A second report showed the University of Michigan's consumer sentiment index slipped one-tenth of a percentage point to 98.1 in early January. Still, sentiment remained near a 13-year high.
Rising wages due to a tightening labor market also are expected to underpin consumer spending this year. Average hourly earnings rose 2.9 percent in the 12 months through December, the largest gain since June 2009, the government reported last week.
President-elect Donald Trump's pledge to cut taxes, boost infrastructure spending and relax regulations also is likely to lift economic growth.
The dollar (DXY) was slightly weaker against a basket of currencies, while prices for U.S. Treasuries fell. U.S. stocks were trading higher, boosted by better-then-expected quarterly profits from Bank of America (N:BAC), JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) and  Wells Fargo  (N:WFC).
UPBEAT SPENDING OUTLOOK
""There is no reason to suspect that consumption growth is going to weaken in the first half of this year,"" said Paul Ashworth, chief U.S. economist at Capital Economics in New York. ""Particularly not when households will be anticipating a potentially big decline in tax rates at some point this year.""
Friday's data added to surveys on manufacturing and the services sector in suggesting the economy regained speed at the end of the fourth quarter after appearing to lose some ground in November. The Atlanta Fed is forecasting GDP rising at a 2.8 percent annualized rate in the fourth quarter. The economy grew at a 3.5 percent pace in the third quarter.
In a separate report, the Labor Department said its producer price index for final demand increased 0.3 percent last month after advancing 0.4 percent in November.
That lifted the year-on-year increase in the PPI to 1.6 percent, the largest gain since September 2014. The PPI rose 1.3 percent in the 12 months through November. Producer prices increased 1.6 percent in 2016 after falling 1.1 percent in 2015.
""The broad strength in input prices suggests higher inflation is on its way,"" said Sarah House, an economist at Wells Fargo Securities in Charlotte, North Carolina.
Stirring inflation pressures were also underscored by the University of Michigan's survey of consumers, which showed five-year inflation expectations rising to 2.5 percent in early January from a record low 2.3 percent in December.
Inflation has persistently run below the Fed's 2 percent target, held back by tepid wage growth, a strong dollar and lower oil prices. Crude prices have since risen above $50 per barrel, which should ease some of the drag on inflation.
A 2.4 percent jump in auto sales accounted for much of the rise in retail sales in December. There was also a boost from a 2.0 percent rise in sales at service stations, reflecting higher gasoline prices.
Sales at building material stores increased 0.5 percent as did those at furniture shops. Receipts at clothing stores were unchanged. Department store giants Macy's (N:M) and Kohl's Corp (N:KSS) last week reported drops in holiday sales.
Those companies have faced stiff competition from online rivals including Amazon.com (O:AMZN). Sales at online retailers jumped 1.3 percent last month after gaining 0.3 percent in November.

Americans also spent more on sports and hobbies but cut back on eating out. Receipts at restaurants and bars fell 0.8 percent last month.

Online sales were a big contributor to the increase in overall sales, rising 12.6 percent to $122.9 billion versus NRF's estimate of 7-10 percent growth.
The NRF had forecast overall retail sales for November and December, excluding autos, gasoline and dining out, to increase 3.6 percent to $655.8 billion.
""The economy was clearly stronger in the fall and consumers were more active during the holiday season than they had been earlier in the year,"" NRF Chief Economist Jack Kleinhenz said.
""Economic indicators were up, retailers offered great deals, confidence improved and all of that empowered consumers to spend more,"" he added.
NRF's data comes after the Commerce Department said on Friday that core retail sales, which exclude gasoline and automobiles, building materials and food services, rose 3.4 percent in December from a year earlier. 
Core retail sales correspond most closely with the consumer spending component of gross domestic product.
Analysts have said a jump in consumer spending in the final stretch of December significantly offset a slow start to the U.S. holiday shopping season.

However, several retailers, particularly department store operators such as Macy's Inc (N:M) and apparel retailers reported weak sales for the period, citing poor traffic in stores.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japanese households' sentiment worsened in the three months to December and their expectations of inflation hit a four-year low, a central bank survey showed, underscoring the challenges of eradicating the country's sticky deflationary mindset.
The bleak reading suggests households remain doubtful that the Bank of Japan's aggressive monetary stimulus will heighten inflation to its 2 percent target, keeping the bank under pressure to do more to spur growth.
The BOJ's quarterly survey on people's livelihood showed the ratio of households who expect prices to rise a year from now stood at 64.7 percent in December, down from 65.1 percent in September and the lowest level since December 2012.
The ratio fell for six straight quarters, despite more than three years of massive monetary stimulus by the BOJ aimed at boosting public expectations of future price growth.
Of the total number of households, 77.6 percent expect inflation to pick up five years from now, down from 80.1 percent in September, the survey showed on Friday.
A separate index measuring households' confidence about the economy stood at minus 24.8 in December, worsening from minus 23.1 in September.
The index subtracts the ratio of households who feel economic conditions have worsened from those who believe they have improved. A negative reading means more households feel economic conditions have deteriorated.
The gloomy outcome underscores the dilemma the BOJ faces as it battles mounting external headwinds and a dwindling policy tool-kit.
Underscoring public doubts over the BOJ's policies, less than a quarter of households surveyed said they knew about the central bank's new policy framework that aims to control bond yields and keep borrowing costs low.
The survey was conducted on 4,000 households between Nov. 10 and Dec. 6.
The BOJ deployed a massive asset-buying program in April 2013 to meet its pledge to beat deflation and accelerate inflation to its ambitious 2 percent target.

After having failed to hit its price target despite more than three years of heavy money printing, the BOJ revamped its policy framework in September to one targeting interest rates.

817,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 13, 2017 05:35AM ET</span>",China posts worst export fall since 2009 as fears of U.S. trade war loom,"By Elias Glenn and Sue-Lin Wong
BEIJING (Reuters) - China's massive export engine sputtered for the second year in a row in 2016, with shipments falling in the face of persistently weak global demand and officials voicing fears of a trade war with the United States that is clouding the outlook for 2017.
In one week, China's leaders will see if President-elect Donald Trump makes good on a campaign pledge to brand Beijing a currency manipulator on his first day in office, and starts to follow up on a threat to slap high tariffs on Chinese goods.
Even if the Trump administration takes no concrete action immediately, analysts say the specter of deteriorating U.S.-China trade and political ties is likely to weigh on the confidence of exporters and investors worldwide.
The world's largest trading nation posted gloomy data on Friday, with 2016 exports falling 7.7 percent and imports down 5.5 percent. The export drop was the second annual decline in a row and the worst since the depths of the global crisis in 2009.
It will be tough for foreign trade to improve this year, especially if the inauguration of Trump and other major political changes limit the growth of China's exports due to greater protectionist measures, the country's customs agency said on Friday. 
""The trend of anti-globalization is becoming increasingly evident, and China is the biggest victim of this trend,"" customs spokesman Huang Songping told reporters.
""We will pay close attention to foreign trade policy after Trump is inaugurated president,” Huang said. Trump will be sworn in on Jan. 20.
China's trade surplus with the United States was $366 billion in 2015, according to U.S. customs data, which Trump could seize on in a bid to bring Beijing to the negotiating table to press for concessions, economists at Bank of America Merrill Lynch (NYSE:BAC) said in a recent research note.
A sustained trade surplus of more than $20 billion against the United States is one of three criteria used by the U.S. Treasury to designate another country as a currency manipulator.
China is likely to point out that its own data showed the surplus fell to $250.79 billion in 2016 from $260.91 billion in 2015, but that may get short shrift in Washington.
""Our worry is that Trump’s stance towards China’s trade could bring about long-term structural weakness in China’s exports,"" economists at ANZ said in a note.
""Trump’s trade policy will likely motivate U.S. businesses to move their manufacturing facilities away from China, although the latter’s efforts in promoting high-end manufacturing may offset part of the loss."" 
On Wednesday, China may have set off a warning shot to the Trump administration. Beijing announced even higher anti-dumping duties on imports of certain animal feed from the United States than it proposed last year.
""Instead of caving in and trying to prepare voluntary export restraints like Japan did with their auto exports back in the 1980s, we believe China would start by strongly protesting against the labeling with the IMF, but not to initiate more aggressive retaliation ... immediately,"" the BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research report said. 
""That said, even a 'war of words' could weaken investor confidence not only in the U.S. and China, but globally.""
CHINA'S DECEMBER EXPORTS FALL
China's December exports fell by a more-than-expected 6.1 percent on-year, while imports beat forecasts slightly, growing 3.1 percent on its strong demand for commodities which has helped buoy global resources prices.
An unexpected 0.1 percent rise in shipments in November, while scant, had raised hopes that China was catching up to an export improvement being seen in some other Asian economies.
China reported a trade surplus of $40.82 billion for December, versus November's $44.61 billion.
While the export picture has been grim all year, with shipments rising in only two months out of 12, import trends have been more encouraging of late, pointing to a pick-up in domestic demand as companies brought in more raw materials from iron ore to copper to help feed a construction boom.
China imported record amounts of crude oil, iron ore, copper and soybeans in 2016, plus large volumes of coal used for heating and in steelmaking.
""Trade protectionism is on the rise but China is relying more on domestic demand,"" said Wen Bin, an economist at Minsheng Bank in Beijing.
Prolonged weakness in exports has forced China's government to rely on higher spending and massive bank lending to boost the economy, at the risk of adding to a huge pile of debt which some analysts warn is nearing danger levels.
Data next Friday is expected to almost certainly show that 2016 economic growth hit Beijing's target of 6.5-7 percent thanks to that flurry of stimulus.
But signs are mounting that the red-hot property market may have peaked, meaning China may have less appetite this year for imports of building-related materials.
""It is hard to see what could drive a more substantial recovery in Chinese trade,"" Julian Evans-Pritchard, China Economist at Capital Economics, wrote in a note.
""Further upside to economic activity, both in China and abroad, is probably now limited given declines in trend growth. Instead, the risks to trade lie to the downside...,"" he said, saying the chance of a damaging China-U.S. trade spat has risen since Trump's appointment of hardliners to lead trade policy.

A decline in China's trade surplus in 2016, to just under $510 billion from $594 billion in 2015, may also reduce authorities' ability to offset capital outflow pressures, which have helped drive its yuan currency to more than eight-year lows, ANZ economists said.

When accounting for calendar adjustments, the deficit last month was $5 billion. That compared to a surplus of $27 billion in the same month in 2015.

Receipts last month came to $319 billion, a 9 percent decline from December 2015, while outlays stood at $347 billion, down 5 percent from the same month a year earlier.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits rose less than expected last week, pointing to a tightening labor market that is starting to spur faster wage growth.
Other data on Thursday showed import prices posting their largest gain in nearly five years in the 12 months through December, suggesting that inflation could soon push higher. Import prices are being driven by rising oil prices, but a strong dollar could limit some of the impact on inflation.
Initial claims for state unemployment benefits increased 10,000 to a seasonally adjusted 247,000 for the week ended Jan. 7, the Labor Department said. It was the 97th straight week that jobless claims remained below 300,000, a threshold associated with a healthy labor market. That is the longest stretch since 1970, when the labor market was much smaller.
""Jobless claims remain in a very constructive range and are still evidence of an environment in which turnover is low and employers are generally content to maintain and expand their payrolls,"" said Jim Baird, chief investment officer at Plante Moran Financial Advisors in Kalamazoo, Michigan. 
Economists had forecast first-time applications for jobless benefits rising to 255,000 in the latest week. 
Jobless claims data tends to be volatile around the holiday season. The four-week moving average, considered a better measure of labor market trends as it irons out week-to-week volatility, fell 1,750 to 256,500 last week.
The number of Americans still receiving jobless benefits after an initial week of aid fell 29,000 to 2.09 million in the week ended Dec. 31. That was the first decline in the so-called continuing claims since November.
U.S. financial markets were little moved by the data amid disappointment over the lack of details regarding president-elect Donald Trump's economic policy on Wednesday during his first press conference since his Nov. 8 election victory. 
Stocks on Wall Street were trading lower, while prices for U.S. government debt rose. The dollar fell against a basket of currencies also as minutes from the European Central Bank's last meeting revealed a few policymakers had not backed an extension of the ECB's bond buying program.
During his election campaign Trump pledged to cut taxes, increase spending on infrastructure and relax regulations. While he has offered few details on these election promises, economists are hoping that the proposed fiscal stimulus would boost economic growth this year. 
The stimulus would come against the backdrop of a labor market that is at or near full employment, with the unemployment rate near a nine-year low of 4.7 percent. 
With tightening labor market conditions starting to push up wage growth, that could stoke inflation pressures and prompt the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates at a faster pace than currently envisaged.
The Fed raised its benchmark overnight interest rate last month by 25 basis points to a range of 0.50 percent to 0.75 percent. The U.S. central bank has forecast three rate hikes for this year. Average hourly earnings increased 2.9 percent in the 12 months through December, the largest gain since June 2009.
In a second report, the Labor Department said import prices increased 0.4 percent last month as the cost of petroleum products surged 7.9 percent. Import prices slipped 0.2 percent in November.
In the 12 months through December, import prices jumped 1.8 percent, the largest gain since March 2012, after edging up 0.1 percent in the 12 months through November.
Import prices are rising as the drag from lower oil prices fades. Oil prices have risen above $50 per barrel. 
Import prices excluding petroleum, however, fell 0.2 percent in December after being unchanged the prior month. This decline in underlying import prices likely reflects sustained dollar strength. Prices of imported automobiles, consumer and capital goods fell last month. 
The dollar rose 4.4 percent against the currencies of the United States' main trading partners last year, with most of the gains coming in the wake of Trump's victory. 
""While the drag on import price inflation stemming from energy is fading, dollar headwinds have resurfaced,"" said Sarah House an economist at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) Securities in Charlotte, North Carolina. 

""We expect the renewed strength in the dollar to remain a challenge for import price reflation in the coming months, but the rebound in energy prices should more than offset any drag.""

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Industries across the euro zone cranked up output in November and Germany ended the year with its strongest growth in five years, data showed on Thursday, pointing to an economic spurt that may be arriving earlier than some ECB policymakers expect.
Euro zone industrial output in the 19-country currency bloc surged 1.5 percent on the month and 3.2 percent year-on-year as firms stepped up production before Christmas. Both figures were far better than expected.
That gelled with a surprisingly large increase in Italian industrial production, also reported on Thursday, and similarly robust numbers earlier this month from France. 
The German statistics office, meanwhile, estimated growth in the euro zone largest economy was around 0.5 percent for the fourth quarter and expanded by 1.9 percent in 2016, the strongest rate in five years.
Economists said these figures added to the evidence that euro zone gross domestic product will have picked up in the last quarter of last year.
The numbers are also relatively unexpected. Indeed, investment bank Citi ranked the euro zone at the top of its Economic Surprise Index at year-end, higher even than the rating for Britain's unforseen post-Brexit performance.
The strong rise of industrial output ""reinforces our belief that euro zone GDP growth could well have reached 0.5 percent quarter-on-quarter in the fourth quarter of 2016,"" said Howard Archer, economist at IHS Global Insight.
Euro zone GDP grew a modest 0.3 percent in second and third quarter of last year, after a 0.5 percent rise in the first quarter.
Thursday's figures add to a jump in the bloc's economic sentiment which in December reached its strongest level since March 2011.
Euro zone consumer confidence also hit a 20-month high in December and has been rising for four consecutive months, European Commission's estimates showed.
Monthly retail sales in the bloc did fall by 0.4 percent in November but only after a rise by 1.4 percent in October, by far the largest in years.
CAUTION
The surprising burst in economic activity may fire up criticism from economists and politicians in countries such as Germany that the European Central Bank is hanging on too long to its ultra-easy monetary policy, including asset purchasing.
The ECB, however, remains cautious about the outlook and will need sustained evidence before it moves.
Indeed, the improved outlook for the last quarter of the year may however not carry over to 2017 in part because it brings with it an increase in prices.
""We expect rising inflation to weigh on consumer spending growth, causing overall GDP growth to slow in 2017,"" Jack Allen of Capital Economics said. 
Euro zone consumer inflation in December was 1.1 percent, the highest level since September 2013, as oil prices are going up. It remains under the roughly 2 percent target sought by the ECB, however. 
A Reuters poll of over 65 economists released on Thursday showed little change in forecasts for euro zone growth and inflation with respondents citing uncertainty from rising protectionist sentiments after the Brexit vote last June and Donald Trump's U.S. election win.
In addition, the November euro zone industrial output data confirmed caution is still prevailing among firms, as political uncertainty over the coming months restrains investment.
The monthly output rose strongly for non-durable consumer goods, such as clothing or foodstuff, a sign that companies were betting on more consumption ahead of the Christmas shopping. 
Production grew markedly on the month also for intermediate goods and energy, but it rose only slightly for capital goods, like machineries, a sign of only limited appetite for long-term investment.

Output of durable goods, such as cars or refrigerators, was the only component of the indicator to record a drop, by 0.1 percent on the month, confirming firms' cautious approach as consumers were less keen to purchase more expensive items.

828,By Investing.com,"<span>Jan 12, 2017 08:31AM ET</span>",U.S. jobless claims rise less than expected,"Investing.com - The number of people who filed for unemployment assistance in the U.S. last week rose less than expected and remained in territory associated with a firming labor market, official data showed on Thursday.
In a report, the U.S. Department of Labor said the number of individuals filing for initial jobless benefits in the week ending January 7 increased by 10,000 to a seasonally adjusted 247,000 from the previous week’s total of 237,000 which was revised from an initial reading of 235,000.
Analysts had expected jobless claims to rise by 20,000 from the original reading to 255,000 last week.
First-time jobless claims below the 300,000-level are usually associated with a firming labor market.
Meanwhile, continuing jobless claims in the week ended December 31 unexpectedly fell to 2.087 million from 2.116 million in the preceding week, which was revised from 2.112 million.
Analysts had expected continuing claims to increase to 2.118 million.
The four-week moving average was 256,500, a 1,750 decrease from the previous week's 258,250 (initially 256,750).
The monthly average is seen as a more accurate gauge of labor trends because it reduces volatility in the week-to-week data.
The Department of Labor indicated that there were no special factors impacting this week’s initial claims and that it marked 97 consecutive weeks of initial claims below 300,000, the longest streak since 1970.
Immediately after the report, which was released simultaneously with import and export prices for December, the dollar continued to trade lower despite the better-than-expected data. EUR/USD was trading at 1.0652 compared to 1.0663 ahead of the release, GBP/USD was at 1.2280 from 1.2289 earlier, while USD/JPY traded at 114.31 compared to 114.16 before the publication.
The US dollar index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six major rivals, was at 100.99, compared to 100.88 ahead of the report.
Meanwhile, U.S. stock futures pointed to a lower open. The Dow futures fell 43 points, or 0.22%, the S&P 500 futures lost 6 points, or 0.25%, while the Nasdaq 100 futures traded down 16 points, or 0.31%.
Elsewhere, in the commodities market, gold futures traded at $1,201.00 a troy ounce, compared to $1,202.15 ahead of the data, while U.S. crude oil traded at $53.09 a barrel from $53.19 earlier."

BERLIN (Reuters) - The German economy expanded at the fastest pace in five years in 2016 and the growth momentum is expected to continue this year as rising private and state spending help Germany cement its position as the locomotive of the euro zone.
Europe's largest economy expanded by 1.9 percent last year, a preliminary estimate from the Federal Statistics Office showed on Thursday, as an environment of low interest rates and a record influx of refugees fuel household and state spending.
These factors have compensated for weakening exports, long the pillar of an economy where manufacturing makes up about a fourth of output.
Economists polled by Reuters had expected growth in gross domestic product (GDP) of 1.8 percent for 2016 after an expansion rate of 1.7 percent in the previous year. The growth rate of 1.9 percent matched the highest forecast in the poll.
The Statistics Office said it estimated growth was around 0.5 percent for the fourth quarter after it halved to 0.2 percent in the July-September period. The Ifo institute said it forecasts a growth rate of 0.5 percent January-March this year.
""The German economy in 2016 once again defied an entire series of downside risks, thanks to strong domestic demand,"" said ING economist Carsten Brzeski, adding that Germany's biggest risk now was complacency.
A breakdown of the 2016 GDP figures showed private consumption rose by an adjusted 2.0 percent on the year, contributing 1.1 percentage points to the overall growth rate.
STRONGEST SPENDING SINCE 1992
State spending jumped by 4.2 percent, adding 0.8 percentage points to the overall growth rate.
""This was the strongest increase in state consumption since 1992 following German reunification,"" the head of the Federal Statistics Office Dieter Sarreither said, adding this was due to spending on refugees as well as increased pension entitlements.
Economists expect the growth momentum to continue this year, although most forecasts point to a weaker expansion due to calendar effects.
""Taking a glimpse into 2017, the German economy remains fundamentally in good shape,"" said UniCredit's Andreas Rees. ""The growth drivers will change somewhat, since there will be a (moderate) shift from domestic demand to stronger export activity."" He expects growth of 1.5 percent this year.
The German economy ministry said incoming orders and sentiment indicators point to solid growth in production and a good start for this year.
""Overall, the picture of a solid, strong, domestically driven economy remains,"" it said in a monthly report.
Despite the optimism, economists and industry leaders warn that risks remain.
Rising inflation fueled mainly by higher oil prices is expected to eat into the purchasing powers of Germans this year, restraining the growth impetus from consumption. State spending could also shrink as refugee arrivals fall.
In addition, the possibilities of a protectionist trade policy by U.S. president-elect Donald Trump and state interference in China have been cited as events that could hurt German exporters.
COMPANIES INVESTING LITTLE
Still, the German GDP data reinforces expectations that euro zone growth, which stood at 0.3 percent in the second and third quarter of last year, accelerated in the last quarter.
Better-than-expected industrial output data for Italy and the euro zone as a whole, published on Thursday, heightened expectations. 
The European Union's statistics office Eurostat said industrial production in the 19-country single currency bloc rose by 1.5 percent during the month, and by 3.2 percent year-on-year. Both figures were much higher than market expectations.
Industrial output in Italy increased 0.7 percent in November following a marginal 0.1 percent gain in October, data showed.
A sustained recovery in the euro zone is good news for the German economy.
But economists say the government could turn the growth momentum into a longer term solid expansion by implementing structural reforms and increasing investments on infrastructure, digitalization and education.
Such suggestions are likely to face resistance from Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble who said on Thursday he wants to use the 6.2 billion euros budget surplus in 2016 on amortizing debt.
His focus on austerity, coupled with mounting political risks that are clouding the outlook for exporters, make it unlikely that German companies sitting on billions of euros will boost investments.
Thursday's data showed that investment in machinery and equipment contributed only 0.1 percentage points to overall growth and imports rose more than exports.

BRASILIA (Reuters) - Brazil surprised markets with a larger-than-expected interest rate cut on Wednesday, stepping up its monetary easing to revive an economy mired in its worst recession ever.
In a unanimous vote, the central bank's nine-member monetary policy committee, known as Copom, decided to cut its benchmark Selic rate <BRCBMP=ECI> by 75 basis points to 13.00 percent after two straight cuts of 25 basis-points each.
An overwhelming majority of analysts had expected a rate cut of 50 basis points with only a few predicting a more aggressive cut that brought rates to a near two-year low.
The surprise decision could help President Michel Temer breathe new life into the economy amid lingering political tensions, following last year's impeachment of President Dilma Rousseff, and a corruption investigation involving his own party.
In its post-meeting statement, the bank said it had considered a 50 basis points cut but decided to frontload the monetary easing as widespread disinflation and a halting recovery called for more aggressive action.
""The extension of the cycle and possible revisions of the pace of easing will continue to depend on inflation forecasts and expectations,"" the bank said.
The recession, the worst in Brazilian history, has left millions unemployed and bankrupted hundreds of companies. There has been heavy pressure on central bank chief Ilan Goldfajn to lower rates, which rank among the world's highest.

Interest rates on 30-year, fixed-rate conforming mortgages, the most widely held type of U.S. home loan, averaged 4.32 percent, lower than the prior week's 4.39 percent.
Conforming mortgages are those with balances of $417,000 or less and qualify for guarantees from federal mortgage agencies  Fannie Mae  (PK:FNMA) and  Freddie Mac  (PK:FMCC). 
Two weeks ago, interest rates on 30-year conforming mortgages averaged 4.45 percent, which was the highest since April 2014.
U.S. home borrowing costs have fallen in step with bond yields (US10YT=RR) due to renewed investor demand for U.S. government debt following a global bond market selloff stoked by fears about higher inflation and federal borrowing under a Trump administration and Republican-controlled Congress.
MBA's seasonally adjusted refinancing index rose 4.4 percent to 1,182.3 last week with the refinance share of overall loan activity falling to 51.2 percent from 52.2 percent the previous week.
The group's seasonally adjusted measure on total mortgage applications rose to 379.2, up 5.8 percent from the prior week.

847,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 11, 2017 05:11AM ET</span>",UK industrial output rebounds but record imports obliterate higher exports,"LONDON, Jan 11 (Reuters) - British industrial output rebounded in November, helped by a recovery in oil and gas and adding to signs that the economy kept its momentum in late 2016 despite June's shock Brexit vote.
But Britain's trade performance deteriorated, the data also showed. A record increase in imports completely outweighed exports which also hit an all-time high, showing the pound's drop since the referendum has yet to improve Britain's balance of trade.
The Office for National Statistics said industrial output rose 2.1 percent in November alone, recovering from a 1.1 percent drop in October and beating expectations for a 0.8 percent jump in a Reuters poll of economists.
Output in manufacturing rose 1.3 percent following a 1.0 percent contraction in October, compared with a forecast for a 0.5 percent increase in a Reuters poll.
The resilience of Britain's economy since June's decision to leave the European Union has been due almost entirely to the country's services sector. 
By contrast, official data has shown that manufacturing has yet to show a clear benefit from the post-referendum fall in the value of sterling and factories are facing a sharp rise in costs of imported goods.
The ONS said production output remained broadly flat over the last few months.
The large increase in industrial output in November largely reflected the reopening of the Buzzard oilfield in the North Sea - responsible for around a tenth of Britain's oil output - and an increase in the volatile pharmaceuticals sector.
The official data has been weaker for manufacturing than private sector business surveys have shown.
One survey last week showed British manufacturing grew at its fastest pace in two and a half years last month, adding to signs that the economy ended 2016 strongly.
Compared with a year ago, industrial output was up 2.0 percent, again much stronger than forecast in the Reuters poll. Manufacturing output grew by 1.2 percent compared with a year ago, recovering from a fall in October.
Separate figures from the ONS showed Britain's goods trade deficit with the rest of the world widened to 12.163 billion pounds in November, bigger than all forecasts in the poll.
While there was a record increase in goods exports to just over 27 billion pounds, imports also hit an all-time of nearly 39.2 billion pounds. Britain's trade deficit with the EU widened to a record 8.586 billion pounds.
Supporters of Britain's exit from the EU have said the size of the deficit strengthens the country's hand in the upcoming Brexit negotiations with the rest of the bloc.
The ONS also released figures for construction output in November, which fell 0.2 percent on the month and rose by 1.5 percent on the year. The Reuters poll had pointed to growth of 0.3 percent on the month and 2.0 percent on the year.

In a report, the U.K. Office for National Statistics said that manufacturing production increased by a seasonally adjusted 1.3%, surpassing expectations for a gain of 0.5% and following a decline of 1.0% a month earlier.
On an annualized basis, manufacturing production rose at rate of 1.2%, better than estimates for a gain of 0.4%, after declining at a rate of 0.5% in October.
The report also showed that industrial production increased by a seasonally adjusted 2.1%, compared to forecasts for a gain of 0.8% and following a decline of 1.1% in the preceding month.

849,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 10, 2017 10:20AM ET</span>",U.S. wholesale inventories post biggest rise in two years,"WASHINGTON, Jan 10 (Reuters) - - U.S. wholesale inventories in November rose slightly more than previously reported, posting their largest gain in two years and suggesting inventory investment would again support economic growth in the fourth quarter.
The Commerce Department said on Tuesday wholesale inventories rose 1.0 percent after slipping 0.1 percent in October. That was the largest increase since November 2014. The department reported last month that wholesale inventories rose 0.9 percent in November.
The component of wholesale inventories that goes into the calculation of gross domestic product - wholesale stocks excluding autos - increased 0.7 percent in November.
Inventory investment contributed half a percentage point to the economy's 3.5 percent annualized growth rate in the third quarter. Inventories had weighed on GDP growth since the second quarter of 2015.
A report last week showed stocks at manufacturers increased in November for a second straight month. Data on retail inventories due to be released on Friday could shed more light on the size of the boost to fourth-quarter GDP from inventory investment.
The Atlanta Federal Reserve currently forecasts GDP rising at a 2.9 percent pace in the fourth quarter.
In November, wholesale stocks of farm products surged 5.0 percent after a rise of 2.9 percent in October. Wholesale inventories of petroleum climbed 2.7 percent, while automobile stocks increased 3.2 percent.
Machinery inventories fell 0.2 percent in November.
Sales at wholesalers rose 0.4 percent in November after a gain of 1.1 percent in October. Sales were lifted by a 1.3 percent rise in sales of machinery as well as a 0.5 percent increase in sales of automobiles.
At November's sales pace it would take wholesalers 1.32 months to clear shelves, up from 1.31 months in October.
While that ratio has declined from the 1.37 months touched in January, which was the highest since March 2009, it remains relatively high. That suggests limited scope for a strong increase in wholesale inventory investment.

In the release of the monthly Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS), the U.S. Labor Department said that the number of job openings, excluding the farming industry, increased to 5.522 million in November from 5.451 million a month earlier, which was revised from the original reading of 5.534 million.
Analysts had expected the number of job openings to rise to 5.555 million.
The report has garnered more attention, as Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen cited the survey when assessing the state of the labor market.
Following the report, which was published simultaneously with the November wholesale inventories, EUR/USD was trading at 1.0599 from around 1.0593 ahead of the release of the data, GBP/USD exchanged hands at 1.2162 compared to 1.2169 previously, while USD/JPY was at 115.56 from 115.61 earlier.
The US dollar index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six major rivals, was at 101.72, compared to 101.67 ahead of the report.

The group's index of small business confidence rose to 105.8, its highest since December 2004. It was up 7.4 points from the prior month, which was its biggest monthly increase since the 14.52 point increase in July 1980. 
“The December results confirm the sharp increase that we reported immediately after the election,” NFIB's chief economist Bill Dunkelberg said in a statement.
“In this month’s report, we are also finding evidence that higher optimism is leading to increased business activity, such as capital investment,” Dunkelberg added.
Consumer and business sentiment about the economy has risen sharply based on the notion the incoming administration of Republican President-elect Donald Trump and a Republican-controlled Congress would enact big tax cuts and infrastructure spending and loosen regulations, which would boost spending and investments.
""The NFIB membership appears to be disproportionately Republican, so it is possible that the data will start overstating strength, opposite the pattern during the Obama administration. In general, however, confidence measures have been moving up,"" said Jim O'Sullivan, chief U.S. economist at High Frequency Economics.
Meanwhile, independent business owners were reluctant to hire more workers in December despite the burst of post-election optimism, NFIB said.
Job creation edged up by 0.01 workers per firm and job openings fell 2 points, according to NFIB jobs data released last week. It showed small business owners have struggled to find qualified workers.

""That’s good news for workers because they can command higher compensation, but many small business owners aren’t yet confident enough to raise prices to offset the higher labor costs,"" Dunkelberg said.

The survey of consumer expectations, an increasingly influential gauge of prices for the U.S. central bank, found that inflation is expected to accelerate over both one-year and three-year horizons.
It found that year-ahead inflation expectations shot up to a median of 2.8 percent in December from 2.5 percent in November. The prior month's reading had matched the survey's lowest recorded level. 
Three-year ahead expectations edged up to 2.8 percent from 2.7 percent, near a record low for the online survey that has shown a gradual decline in both price measures since it began in mid-2013.
Since Republican Donald Trump was elected U.S. president in November, a number of market-based inflation expectations have risen sharply. The Fed raised interest rates by a quarter point in December and is expected to raise them at least twice in 2017.
Survey respondents were also more optimistic about the job market and their own finances.
The probability of finding a new job in the event of losing a current one jumped to 55.6 percent last month from 53 percent in November, the survey found. And the median expected growth in household income rose to 2.8 percent from 2.4 percent a month earlier.

Consumer prices <MXCPIA=ECI> rose 3.36 percent from December 2015, national statistics agency INEGI said on Monday, the highest rate since December 2014, and topping the central bank's 3 percent target.
The figure was below the 3.40 percent analysts forecast in a Reuters poll and up from the 3.31 percent reached in November.
Consumer prices could be fanned further by a double-digit hike in gasoline prices announced by the government that went into effect this month. The increase has spurred protests, looting and blockades throughout the country.
Last month, Mexico's central bank raised interest rates for the fifth time in 2016, to 5.75 percent, taking borrowing costs to the highest level since April 2009.
In minutes of the central bank meeting, board members said they would remain attentive to potential pass-through from the exchange rate to inflation, after Donald Trump's U.S. presidential election win sent the peso to new lows [L1N1EO0NV].
Mexico's central bank sold dollars last week to shore up the peso in its first such intervention since February 2016 but Capital Economics said in a client note that interest rates will have to rise further to contain consumer prices.

In the United States, expectations of heavy spending under Trump to create jobs in the Rust Belt states that swung the election his way have helped lift consumer sentiment to multi-year highs.

BERLIN (Reuters) - German exports jumped more than expected in November, posting their steepest monthly rise in four-and-half years and pushing up overall industrial production which drove growth in Europe's biggest economy in the final quarter.
The data, released by the Federal Statistics Office and the Economy Ministry on Monday, reaffirmed expectations for a strong rebound in the fourth quarter of 2016 after the economy halved its quarterly growth pace in the third due to weaker exports.
""The New Year started with some mildly good news,"" ING economist Carsten Brzeski said, adding that the latest batch of figures brought evidence that the economy gained momentum in the final quarter of the year.
Industrial production rose for the second consecutive month in November, edging up 0.4 percent on the month, the Economy Ministry said. This was slightly weaker than the consensus forecast in a Reuters poll for a rise of 0.6 percent.
The increase was driven by a 1.5 percent jump in construction output, the strongest monthly gain since February. Manufacturing production was up 0.4 percent while energy output fell 0.4 percent.
The October reading was revised up to a rise of 0.5 percent from a previously reported rise of 0.3 percent.
""Production in manufacturing and construction clearly picked up after the weak summer semester,"" the Economy Ministry said.
""Both orders intake in manufacturing and construction orders as well as the sentiment indicators in these sectors are pointing to a solid output growth in the winter semester,"" it added.
Industrial orders data released on Friday had already pointed to a busy final quarter for factories with the government expecting the upswing to carry into 2017.
EXPORTS ARE BACK
Separate data released from the Federal Statistics Office showed on Monday that seasonally adjusted exports rose by 3.9 percent on the month.
This was the strongest monthly gain since May 2012 and was better than the consensus forecast in a Reuters poll for a rise of 0.5 percent.
""The weak euro helps German exporters,"" Helaba analyst Stefan Muetze said.
Imports increased by 3.5 percent which was the strongest monthly rise since June 2014 and also much stronger than a predicted increase of only 0.2 percent.
The seasonally adjusted trade surplus widened to 21.7 billion euros ($22.86 billion) from 20.6 billion euros in October. The November reading was above the Reuters consensus forecast of 21.2 billion euros.
A breakdown of non-adjusted trade data showed exports to countries outside the European Union jumped by 7.6 percent while demand from euro zone members rose by 5.2 percent in November.
""Today's industrial data have in our view prepared the grounds for a re-acceleration of GDP growth in the final quarter and a strong number for 2016 growth,"" Brzeski said.
Economists expect the German economy to have more than doubled its quarterly growth pace to some 0.5 percent in the fourth quarter.
For 2016 as a whole, the government predicts higher private consumption and state spending to have propelled growth to 1.8 percent, which would be the strongest in five years.

The Federal Statistics Office will publish preliminary GDP growth data for 2016 on Thursday.

The report comes among rising debate on whether the Chinese government will strategically defend the yuan or prevent depletion of its reserves.
The People’s Bank of China figures released on Saturday said that foreign exchange reserves fell by U.S. $41 billion in December to U.S. $3.01 trillion.
Forex reserves dropped by U.S. $319.8 billion for Beijing last year.
The government said later the central bank’s efforts to stabilize the yuan were the primary reason for the decline in its reserves during 2016.
“In terms of the situation in December, the central bank’s supply of foreign exchange to adjust market demand and supply, the depreciation of non-U.S. dollar currencies against the greenback, and other factors, led to the decline of foreign exchange reserves,” according to a statement by the regulatory authorities.
Forex analysts said the PBOC has regularly relied on foreign exchange reserves since the summer of 2015 to prevent a deep depreciation of the yuan and moderate risks of capital outflow.
For the coming year, the central bank said its goal is to stabilize market expectations and prevent undue financial risks.
On global forex markets on Monday, the euro/dollar index was trading at 1.0563, up 0.31% during intraday trading.
The dollar/yen pairing was down to 116.17, a decline of 0.63%.

879,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 07, 2017 01:23AM ET</span>","China December forex reserves fall for 6th month, near $3 trillion level","By Cheng Fang and Sue-Lin Wong 
BEIJING, Jan 7 (Reuters) - China's foreign exchange reserves fell to near six-year lows in December, but held just above the critical $3 trillion level, as authorities stepped in to support the weakening yuan ahead of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump's inauguration.
China's reserves shrank by $41 billion in December, slightly less than feared but the sixth straight month of declines, data showed on Saturday, after a week in which Beijing moved aggressively to punish those betting against the currency and make it harder for money to get out of the country.
Analysts had forecast a drop of $51 billion.
For the year as a whole, China's reserves fell nearly $320 billion to $3.011 trillion, on top of a record drop of $513 billion in 2015.
While the $3 trillion mark is not seen as a firm ""line in the sand"" for Beijing, concerns are swirling in global financial markets over the speed with which the country is depleting its ammunition to defend the currency and staunch capital outflows.
Some analysts estimate it needs to retain a minimum of $2.6 trillion to $2.8 trillion under the International Monetary Fund's (IMF's) adequacy measures. 
If pressure on the yuan persists, analysts suspect China will continue to tighten the screws on outflows via administrative and regulatory means, while pouncing sporadically on short sellers in forex markets to discourage them from building up excessive bets against the currency.
But if it continues to burn through reserves at a rapid rate, some strategists believe China's leaders may have little choice but to sanction another big ""one-off"" devaluation like that in 2015, which would likely roil global financial markets and stoke tensions with the new Trump administration. 
The yuan depreciated 6.6 percent against the surging dollar in 2016, its biggest one-year loss since 1994, and is expected to weaken further this year if the dollar's rally has legs.
Adding to the pressure, Trump has vowed to label China a currency manipulator on his first day in office, and has threatened to slap huge tariffs on imports of Chinese goods. 
That has left Chinese eager to get money out of the country, creating what some researchers describe as a potentially destructive negative feedback loop, where fears of further yuan falls spur outflows that pile fresh pressure on the currency.
""For 2016 as a whole we estimate total capital outflows to have been around $710 billion,"" Capital Economics' China economist Chang Liu told Reuters in an email.
Capital Economics estimated net outflows in November and December alone were $76 billion and $66 billion, respectively. 
The main reason China's forex reserves fell in 2016 was because the central bank used them to stabilize the yuan, the country's foreign exchange regulator said in a statement after the data.
With the dollar gaining ground, a decline in the value of other currencies held by China also contributed to the decline, the State Administration of Foreign Exchange (SAFE) said.
""Forex reserves are likely to fall again in January,"" China's SWS MU Fund Management said in a note, predicting the U.S. economy and the dollar would continue to strengthen.
CLAMPDOWN ON OUTFLOWS TIGHTENS 
China has stepped up efforts in recent weeks to shore up the yuan and curb capital outflows, sparking speculation it wants a firm grip on the currency ahead of Trump's inauguration on Jan. 20 and the long Lunar New Year holidays at the end of the month.
State banks have bought yuan and sold dollars and regulators have tightened restrictions on individuals and companies who want to move funds out of the country, while denying they are imposing fresh capital controls.
This week the central bank also set higher daily guidance rates for the yuan, hiking it the most in a decade on Friday, and Beijing was suspected of pushing up yuan borrowing costs in Hong Kong to discourage offshore investors from making bearish bets on the currency. [CNY/]
SAFE said in late December that net cross-border capital outflows were expected to narrow in the fourth quarter in 2016, while the People's Bank of China (PBOC) said last week that it would push reforms of the yuan regime, while keeping the currency basically stable in 2017.
The PBOC also raised reporting requirements for overseas transfers last Friday. The reporting threshold for cash and overseas transfers was cut to just 50,000 yuan ($7,230) from 200,000 yuan.
Regulators recently said they would step up monitoring of individual foreign exchange purchases to close loopholes, but the $50,000 yearly quota would not change.
While the yuan has soared this week as China bears down on the market, a Reuters poll showed it is expected to slide at least 4 percent this year, largely as expectations of interest rate hikes in the United States drive the dollar higher.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. employment increased less than expected in December but a rebound in wages pointed to sustained labor market momentum that sets up the economy for stronger growth and further interest rate increases from the Federal Reserve this year.
Nonfarm payrolls rose by 156,000 jobs last month, the Labor Department said on Friday. The gains, however, are more than sufficient to absorb new entrants into the labor market.
Fed Chair Janet Yellen has said the economy needs to create just under 100,000 jobs a month to keep up with growth in the work-age population. Employers hired 19,000 more workers than previously reported in October and November.

With the potential for stronger fiscal stimulus in the form of infrastructure spending and tax cuts, job creation appears likely to remain on a solid footing in 2017,"" said Jim Baird, chief investment officer for Plante Moran Financial Advisors in Kalamazoo, Michigan.
The economy created 2.16 million jobs in 2016. Average hourly earnings increased 10 cents or 0.4 percent in December after slipping 0.1 percent in November. That pushed the year-on-year increase in earnings to 2.9 percent, the largest gain since June 2009, from 2.5 percent in November.
While the unemployment rate ticked up to 4.7 percent from a nine-year low of 4.6 percent in November, that was because more people entered the labor force, a sign of confidence in the labor market. Economists had forecast payrolls rising by 178,000 jobs last month.
The dollar rose against a basket of currencies, while prices for U.S. government bonds fell. Stocks on Wall Street were trading higher.
Other data on Friday showed the trade deficit widening 6.8 percent to $45.2 billion in November as imports rose to their highest level in more than a year on higher oil prices.
The employment report added to data ranging from housing to manufacturing and auto sales in suggesting that President-elect Donald Trump is inheriting a strong economy from the Obama administration. The labor market momentum is likely to be sustained amid rising business and consumer confidence.
Trump, who takes over from President Barack Obama on Jan. 20, has pledged to increase spending on the country's aging infrastructure, cut taxes and relax regulations. These measures are expected to boost growth this year.
But the proposed expansionary fiscal policy stance could increase the budget deficit. That, together with faster economic growth and a labor market that is expected to hit full employment this year could raise concerns about the Fed falling behind the curve on interest rate increases.
Last month's wage growth left it just shy of the 3.0 percent to 3.5 percent range that economists say is needed to lift inflation to the Fed's 2.0 percent target.
""This is coming well before any fiscal stimulus hits. It plays to the idea that the Fed may already be behind the curve, not least because the impetus from lower oil prices has turned more inflationary as well,"" said Alan Ruskin, FX Research head at  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) in New York.
The U.S. central bank raised its benchmark overnight interest rate last month by 25 basis points to a range of 0.50 percent to 0.75 percent. The Fed forecast three rate hikes this year.
FACTORY JOBS INCREASE
A broad measure of unemployment that includes people who want to work but have given up searching and those working part-time because they cannot find full-time employment fell one-tenth to a more than 8-1/2-year low of 9.2 percent.
Employment growth in 2016 averaged 180,000 jobs per month, down from an average gain of 229,000 per month in 2015. The slowdown in job growth is consistent with a labor market that is near full employment.
There has been an increase in employers saying they cannot fill vacant positions because they cannot find qualified workers. The skills shortage has been prominent in the construction industry.
""The pool is all but drained especially for skilled workers. We can't bring factory jobs back because there's no one out there to run them,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at
MUFG Union Bank in New York.
The labor force participation rate, or the share of working-age Americans who are employed or at least looking for a job, rose one-tenth of percentage point to 62.7 percent in December.
The participation rate remains near multi-decade lows. Some of the decline reflects demographic changes.
December's job gains were broad, with manufacturing payrolls rising 17,000 after declining for four straight months. Construction payrolls fell 3,000 in December after three consecutive months of increases.
Retail sector employment rose 6,300 after increasing 19,500 in November. Department store giants Macy's (N:M) and Kohl's Corp (N:KSS) this week reported a drop in holiday sales. Macy's said it planned to cut 10,000 jobs beginning this year.
Department stores have suffered from stiff competition from online rivals including Amazon.com (O:AMZN). Temporary help declined 15,500 last month, the biggest drop since January.

Education and health services employment rose 70,000, the biggest increase since February. Government employment increased 12,000 in December.

Factory goods orders declined 2.4 percent, the Commerce Department said on Friday after an upwardly revised 2.8 percent increase in October. November's drop followed four straight months of gains and was the biggest decline since December 2015.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast factory orders decreasing 2.2 percent in November after a previously reported 2.7 percent gain in October.
The department also said orders for non-defense capital goods excluding aircraft -- seen as a measure of business
confidence and spending plans -- rose 0.9 percent in November as reported last month.
Shipments of these so-called core capital goods, which are used to calculate business equipment spending in the gross
domestic product report, gained 0.2 percent in November as previously reported.
A report this week showed factory activity hitting a two-year high in December, driven by a surge in new orders.
Manufacturing, which accounts for about 12 percent of the economy, is gaining some muscle after a prolonged period of decline, spurred by a strong dollar and lower oil prices. The sector is getting a lift from rising oil prices, which have led to an increase in well drilling.
Still, manufacturing remains constrained by dollar strength.
In November, orders for transportation equipment tumbled 13.2 percent, the largest drop since August 2014, reflecting a 73.8 percent decline in civilian aircraft orders.
Orders for primary metals jumped 2.2 percent, the biggest rise since December 2015. Machinery orders increased 1.4 percent, the largest gain since January last year.
There were increases in orders for computers and electronic products, and electrical equipment, appliances and components.
Shipments of overall factory goods slipped 0.1 percent in November after rising 0.2 percent the prior month. Inventories of factory goods increased 0.2 percent. That left the inventories-to-shipments ratio unchanged at 1.34 in November.

Unfilled orders at factories dipped 0.1 percent after rising 0.8 percent in October.

The Commerce Department said on Friday the trade gap increased 6.8 percent to $45.2 billion. October's trade deficit was revised down slightly to $42.4 billion from the previously reported $42.6 billion.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the trade gap little changed at $42.5 billion in November. When adjusted for inflation, the deficit increased to $63.6 billion from $60.3 billion in October.
Trade contributed 0.85 percentage point to the third quarter's 3.5 percent annualized rate of increase in gross domestic product. Economists expect trade will slice off more than one percentage point from GDP growth in the fourth quarter.
Despite the drag from trade, growth in the fourth quarter is expected to have been supported by consumer spending, a firming housing market and rising gas and oil well drilling. The Atlanta Federal Reserve is currently forecasting GDP rising at a 2.9 percent rate in the fourth quarter.
Imports of goods and services increased 1.1 percent to $231.1 billion in November, the highest level since August 2015. Part of the increase in the import bill reflects higher oil prices.
Inflation-adjusted petroleum imports were the highest since November 2012.
There were also increases in imports of industrial supplies and materials, which rose to their highest level since July 2015.
Imports of goods from China fell 2.7 percent in November.
Exports slipped 0.2 percent to $185.8 billion in November, hurt by shipments of capital goods, which fell to their lowest level since September 2011. Exports remain constrained by relentless dollar strength. There were, however, increases in exports of industrial supplies and materials, which hit their highest level since July 2015. Petroleum exports were also the highest since July 2015.

The politically sensitive U.S.-China trade deficit fell 2.0 percent to $30.5 billion in November.

BERLIN (Reuters) - Economic sentiment in the euro zone surged to a post-crisis record in December and German industrial orders pointed to a busy final quarter for factories in Europe's powerhouse with the government expecting the upswing to carry into 2017.
The overall strong data, released on Friday by the European Commission in Brussels and the Economy Ministry in Berlin, suggested vibrant business activity in the euro zone at the turn of the year despite increased political uncertainties.
It matched strong data this week from purchasing managers and signs of an uptick in inflation.
""The euro zone has started the year on a positive note,"" ING economist Bert Colijn said, adding that Italy's referendum last month and the subsequent concerns about its banking sector had not dented confidence in the currency bloc as a whole.
""Improving order books, strong employment expectations and strengthening assessments of production in recent months outweigh increased political volatility for the moment.""
The European Commission's monthly survey showed economic sentiment rose to 107.8 in December from 106.6 in November - its strongest level since March 2011 and well above the long-term average of 100.
Separately, the European Commission's business climate indicator rose to its highest level since June 2011 - above all forecasts in a Reuters poll. 
Together with the strong figures from Wednesday's Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI), the data suggested that ""the euro zone economy enjoyed a much-needed growth spurt at the end of 2016,"" Stephen Brown at Capital Economics said.
Berenberg economist Holger Schmieding agreed, saying the euro zone economy was now on course for a solid 2017 start after having delivered a robust finish to 2016.
""Together with the potential spillover from a strong fiscal boost in the United States, this introduces some upside risk to our forecast of 1.5 percent growth in 2017 after 1.6 percent last year,"" Schmieding added.
WEAK EURO
In Germany, industrial orders fell in November after surging in the prior month, but the monthly drop was widely expected and the broader picture remained bright as a weaker euro exchange rate helped to push up demand from countries outside the bloc. 
Contracts for ""Made in Germany"" goods were down 2.5 percent on the month, the Economy Ministry said. That was slightly weaker than the consensus forecast of a fall of 2.3 percent.
But revised figures showed orders had surged 5.0 percent in October, meaning that over the two months, bookings rose by 3.5 percent, with industrial orders from countries outside the euro zone jumping 6.4 percent. 
The Economy Ministry said the results together pointed to ""a very favorable development"" in the final quarter and that the expected upswing in the industrial sector was likely to carry into the first quarter of 2017.
Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) economist Marco Wagner said the overall positive picture reflected a slight pick-up in global demand. ""The euro has weakened in the past months - that clearly helps to push up demand from outside the bloc too,"" he said.
The German economy is widely seen to have rebounded in the fourth quarter after its quarterly growth rate halved to 0.2 percent in the third due to weaker exports.
Commerzbank's Wagner said he expected GDP growth of 0.5 percent in the three months to December and a similar rate in the first quarter of this year.
The data also prompted J.P. Morgan to upgrade its Q4 GDP growth estimate for Germany by 0.5 percentage points to 2.0 percent (q/q seasonally adjusted annual rate).
For 2016 as a whole, the government expects rising private consumption and increased state spending to have propelled growth in Europe's largest economy to 1.8 percent, which would be the strongest in five years.
Underpinning this prediction, German retail sales rose by between 1.8 and 2.1 percent on the year in 2016 in real terms, the Federal Statistics Office said on Friday.

Record-high employment, increased job security, rising real wages and ultra-low borrowing costs have boosted the spending power of Germans, making consumption the main driver of growth in a traditionally export-driven economy.

895,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 06, 2017 07:50AM ET</span>",Britain's productivity malaise persists into second half of 2016: ONS,"By David Milliken
LONDON (Reuters) - British productivity struggled to break out of its post-financial crisis rut in the three months after June's vote to leave the European Union, highlighting the long-term economic challenges ahead, official figures showed on Friday.
Robust growth in productivity - or how much value employees create during each hour at work - is key to boosting long-run living standards, but has been particularly weak in Britain since the 2008-09 recession.
Bank of England chief economist Andy Haldane said on Thursday that productivity at more than three-quarters of British companies was stagnant, and finance minister Philip Hammond pledged in November to spend 23 billion pounds ($28 billion) tackling the problem.
Figures from the Office for National Statistics on Friday showed that hourly output in the three months to the end of September was only 0.4 percent higher than the previous year, far below its pre-crisis average of just over 2 percent.
Partly, this reflects a slump at the end of 2015 when productivity fell 0.9 percent. Growth in the first nine months of 2016 was better, with quarterly rates of 0.4-0.5 percent.
Nonetheless, most economists see challenges ahead as Britain prepares to leave the EU.
""The UK has a lot of catching up to do,"" said Howard Archer, chief UK economist at IHS Markit. ""While the 2016 quarter-on-quarter increases in productivity ... indicate that there has recently been some much-needed improvement, it is notable that they follow a considerable period of poor productivity.""
The ONS said British productivity stood 15.5 percent below where it would have been if productivity growth had returned to its pre-crisis trend.
Explanations for weak productivity vary. Highly productive sectors such as financial services and oil and gas contracted after the financial crisis and there has been rapid growth in low-skilled, low-paid jobs.
Haldane on Thursday cited long-standing concerns about low public infrastructure investment and a patchy education system that has produced weak results for poorer and less able pupils.
While Britain's economy has grown strongly since June's vote to leave the European Union, most economists think future restrictions on migration and the probable increase in bureaucracy involved in trading with Europe will harm productivity growth.
""As we leave the EU, the country needs to work harder than ever to demonstrate our doors remain open to the world,"" said Yael Selfin, an economist at accountants KPMG.
June's Brexit vote has led to a fall of nearly 20 percent in the value of the pound, which businesses said this week was pushing prices up by the most in five years.
Friday's data suggested that underlying inflation pressures - which are not directly caused by the weak pound, and concern the BoE more - are also rising at their fastest rate in nearly three years. 
Unit labor cost growth, a measure of how much employers pay staff for a given amount of output, grew by an annual 2.3 percent, the most since the last three months of 2013.

Retail sales in the 19 countries sharing the euro fell by 0.4 percent in November from October, the European Union's statistics office Eurostat said, confirming market expectations.
The monthly drop follows an upwardly revised rise by 1.4 percent in October, by far the largest in the year. In its previous estimates, released in December, Eurostat put the monthly increase in October at 1.1 percent.
Year-on-year, euro zone retail sales increased in November by 2.3 percent, after a 3.0 percent rise in October which Eurostat also revised upwardly from its previous estimates of a 2.4 percent increase.
The fall in the monthly reading was mostly due to a 0.9 percent drop in purchases of non-food products, a wide category that includes clothing, electrical goods, pharmaceutical products and e-commerce. Detailed data were not available.
Sales of food, drinks and tobacco were down 0.4 percent, after a two-month rise.
Car fuel sales went up by 1.0 percent in the month, the only component of the reading that recorded a rise.

899,By Investing.com,"<span>Jan 06, 2017 02:14AM ET</span>","U.S. jobs report to close out 2016, shift focus to Trump impact on Fed","Investing.com – Market participants looked ahead to the publication of the last Employment Report of 2016 later on Friday in a release that could leave markets unmoved in a situation where full employment is already priced in and the focus has shifted to what incoming President Donald Trump could do for the economy and its corresponding effect on Federal Reserve (Fed) monetary policy.
The U.S. Labor Department will release its December nonfarm payrolls report at 8:30AM ET (13:30GMT).
The consensus forecast is that the data will show jobs growth of 175,000, following an increase of 178,000 in November. The slowdown would be in line with recent history as December job growth has eased when compared to the prior month for the last three years and occurred seven times out of the last ten.
The unemployment rate is forecast to inch up to 4.7% from 4.6%, but it should be kept in mind that November’s reading was an unexpected drop from the prior 4.9%, leading some experts to conclude that it may have been a statistical anomaly.
Though normally the two aforementioned data points are in the spotlight, recent considerations by Fed officials that the labor market is either at, or very close to, its goal of maximum employment, may take the wind out the data’s sails except in the case of a large miss or beat.
“I would say the labor market looks a lot like the way it did before the recession,” Fed chair Janet Yellen said at the December 14 press conference.
With this in mind, wage inflation could be a more important focal point in the December report. Average hourly earnings are expected to rise 0.3% after falling 0.1% a month earlier.
That brought the yearly rate down to 2.5% in November from its high at 2.8% in October. The reading is considered a key factor for the Fed as increased wage growth tends to correlate with upward inflationary pressure, increasing the probability that the central bank will need to tighten policy to keep prices under control.
In a twist to the norm, the minutes of the last Fed meeting released on Wednesday warned that ""many participants judged that the risk of a sizable undershooting of the longer-run normal unemployment rate had increased somewhat and that the Committee might need to raise the federal funds rate more quickly.”
In other words, a reading that is “too positive” could spin markets on their head as it forces the Fed to consider the need to accelerate policy tightening in order to make sure the jobless rate returns to a higher level that is healthier for the economy from a long-term perspective.
In any case, the December report is widely expected to do little to change the market outlook for the future path of monetary policy as the data closes the door on 2016, especially in a context where the labor market is close to, if not already at, maximum employment.
Much more relevant will likely be Trump’s inauguration on January 20 and his posterior steps on implementing fiscal policies.
The speed of their implementation and their final impact on the overall economy is what the Fed itself will be watching in order to make future policy decisions.
In the minutes, Fed members emphasized the “considerable uncertainty” surrounding the upcoming fiscal policy changes.
They also revealed that about half the policymakers had factored in expectations in December that the incoming President would implement expansionary fiscal policies when they evaluated that there could be three rate hikes in 2017.
In other words, the other half of the committee is on hold to see how those policies play out and their effect will guide future rate hike timing.
For the moment, the market remains skeptical with only a 36.2% probability of a third hike coming this year, according to Investing.com’s Fed Rate Monitor Tool."

""Also, the weak yen inflates income from investment overseas...so the current account surplus will likely stay at solid level for the moment.""
The yen has weakened sharply against the dollar since November on expectations the incoming Trump Administration's policies would encourage inflation, which would in turn prompt the U.S. Federal Reserve to raise interest rates.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. services sector activity held at a one-year high in December as new orders surged, while the number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits fell to near a 43-year-low last week, suggesting the economy ended 2016 with strong momentum.
The Institute for Supply Management (ISM) report on Thursday also showed a sustained increase in prices paid by services industries for inputs, potentially signaling that the days of very low inflation could be coming to an end. 
The economy is likely to get a boost from President-elect Donald Trump's plan to increase infrastructure spending and cut taxes. That, together with a tightening labor market and firming inflation, could allow the Federal Reserve to increase interest rates in March, economists say. 
""It appears that both growth and price pressures are beginning to pick up and we continue to project the next rate hike takes place at the March Fed policy meeting,"" said John Ryding, chief economist at RDQ Economics in New York.ISM said its non-manufacturing activity index was at 57.2 last month, matching November's reading, which was the highest since October 2015. A reading above 50 indicates expansion in the sector, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity.
Services industries reported new orders jumped 4.6 percentage points last month to their highest level since August 2015.
Prices paid by non-manufacturing industries for materials and services rose 0.7 percentage point, hitting their highest level in nearly 2-1/2 years and marking the ninth consecutive monthly increase. That suggested inflation, which has persistently run below the Fed's 2 percent target, was poised to rise in the coming months.
A measure of services sector employment fell 4.4 percentage points last month. The drop, however, followed a surge in November, which had lifted the subindex to a 13-month high. ISM noted that labor, especially in the construction sector, ""continue to be in short supply."" 
Economists do not believe that the decline in services employment last month will significantly impact December's nonfarm payrolls report, which the U.S. government is scheduled to release on Friday.
They also brushed aside another report on Thursday from payrolls processor ADP showing that private employers added 153,000 jobs in December after boosting payrolls by 215,000 in November. The ADP report, which is jointly developed with Moody's Analytics, has a poor record of predicting the private payrolls component of the government's closely watched employment report because of differences in methodology.
Nonfarm payrolls likely increased by 178,000 jobs in December after the same gain in November, according to a Reuters survey of economists.
""We don't view the data as strong evidence that payrolls will undershoot expectations on Friday,"" said Jim O'Sullivan, chief U.S. economist at High Frequency Economics in New York.
But traders took a different view, selling the dollar, which declined more than 1 percent against a basket of currencies. (DXY) Prices for U.S. government debt rose, while stocks on Wall Street fell.
TIGHTENING LABOR MARKET
Trump, who campaigned on a pledge to spur job growth largely by revitalizing U.S. manufacturing, will inherit a labor market that is considered to be at or near full employment, with a jobless rate at a nine-year low of 4.6 percent.
That strength was underscored by a third report from the Labor Department on Thursday showing initial claims for state unemployment benefits dropped 28,000 to a seasonally adjusted 235,000 for the week ended Dec. 31. That was close to the 233,000 touched in mid-November, which was the lowest level since November 1973.
Initial jobless claims have now been below 300,000, a threshold associated with a healthy labor market, for 96 consecutive weeks. That is the longest stretch since 1970, when the labor market was much smaller. 
But with claims data for six states and one territory estimated because of the New Year's holiday, last week's drop likely exaggerates labor market strength. The four-week moving average of claims, considered a better measure of labor market trends as it irons out week-to-week volatility, fell 5,750 to 256,750 last week. 
Tightening labor market conditions and gradually firming inflation allowed the Fed to raise its benchmark overnight interest rate last month by 25 basis points to a range of 0.50 percent to 0.75 percent. 
While the U.S. central bank forecast three rate hikes for 2017, minutes of the Dec. 13-14 policy meeting released on Wednesday suggested the pace of increases would largely be determined by the labor market and fiscal policy.
In a fourth report on Thursday, global outplacement consultancy Challenger, Gray & Christmas said U.S.-based employers announced plans to cut 33,627 jobs from payrolls last month, up 25 percent from November. Still, that was below the monthly average of 43,910 job cuts for 2016. 

Layoffs last month were led by the defense, automotive, energy, transportation and government sectors. Employers announced 526,915 layoffs last year, down 12 percent from 2015.

909,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 05, 2017 11:13AM ET</span>",U.S. 30-year mortgage rates post 1st fall since U.S. election: Freddie,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Interest rates on U.S. 30-year fixed-rate mortgages posted their first weekly decline since Donald Trump's U.S. presidential election victory on Nov. 8, mortgage finance agency  Freddie Mac  (PK:FMCC) said on Thursday.
The borrowing cost on 30-year mortgages, the most widely held type of U.S. home loan, averaged 4.20 percent in the week ended Jan. 5, it said. Last week, 30-year mortgage rates averaged 4.32 percent, which was the highest since 4.33 percent in the week of April 24, 2014. 
Home borrowing costs have retreated in line with U.S. bond yields as investors returned to the bond market.
Trump's surprise win had stoked bets on a surge in federal borrowing and inflation as a result of possible steep tax cuts and federal spending to stimulate business investment.
Mortgage rates advanced further in the latter half of December after the Federal Reserve on Dec. 14 hinted it might raise short-term interest rates at a faster pace than previously thought on an improving jobs market and signs of inflation moving up to its 2 percent goal. 
Benchmark 10-year Treasury yields (US10YT=RR) reached 2.64 percent on Dec. 15, which was the highest since September 2014, but have since subsided and stood at 2.41 percent early on Thursday.
While mortgage rates cooled in the latest week, their sharp rise has hurt refinancing activity, Freddie Mac chief economist Sean Becketti said.
The Mortgage Bankers Association said on Wednesday its index on refinancing applications  was up 1.7 percent in the week ended Dec. 30 but down 44 percent since the November election.

In a report, the U.S. Department of Labor said the number of individuals filing for initial jobless benefits in the week ending December 31 decreased by 28,000 to a seasonally adjusted 235,000 from the previous week’s total of 263,000 which was revised from an initial reading of 265,000.
Analysts had expected jobless claims to fall by 5,000 to 260,000 last week.
First-time jobless claims below the 300,000-level are usually associated with a firming labor market.
On the downside, continuing jobless claims in the week ended December 24 unexpectedly rose to 2.112 million from 2.096 million in the preceding week, which was revised from 2.102 million. The data showed continuous claims at their highest level since the beginning of September.
Analysts had expected continuing claims to decrease to 2.051 million.
The four-week moving average was 256,750, a 5,750 decrease from the previous week's 262,500 (initially 263,000).
The monthly average is seen as a more accurate gauge of labor trends because it reduces volatility in the week-to-week data.
The Department of Labor indicated that there were no special factors impacting this week’s initial claims and that it marked 96 consecutive weeks of initial claims below 300,000, the longest streak since 1970.

923,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 05, 2017 07:50AM ET</span>",Price pressures mount as UK economy records strong end to 2016,"By David Milliken
LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's economy finished 2016 strongly, growing at the fastest pace since mid-2015 according to one major survey, but higher prices look set to hit consumers soon as firms pass on a big rise in costs since June's vote to leave the European Union.
Companies in the dominant services sector reported activity rose at its fastest rate in 17 months in December, beating all forecasts in a Reuters poll and keeping Britain on track to be one of the world's fastest-growing advanced economies last year.
However, the Markit Purchasing Managers Index and a separate survey from the British Chambers of Commerce showed services firms are planning the most widespread price rises since 2011, raising the chance that inflation will climb rapidly.
Manufacturers in the BCC survey - which was conducted in November - plan the biggest price rises since the survey started asking about this nearly 20 years ago.
""Inflationary pressures (are) building throughout the supply chain,"" Capital Economics' analyst Scott Bowman said. ""A moderation in growth in 2017 seems likely as rising inflation eats into households' real income growth.""
Sterling's fall of nearly 20 percent against the U.S. dollar since the Brexit vote was cited by companies in both surveys.
The weak pound pushed up food and fuel prices strongly and costs for wages, plastic packaging and IT rose too, Markit said.
STRONG GROWTH
Britain's economy probably grew 0.5 percent in the final three months of 2016, barely slowing from the robust pace seen in the three months just after the Brexit vote, Markit said.
Separate figures showed households bought a record 2.69 million new cars last year.
""The UK economy continues to defy widely held expectations of a Brexit-driven slowdown,"" Markit's chief business economist, Chris Williamson, said.
But this is expected to change in 2017. A Reuters poll last month showed economic growth was forecast to halve to 1.1 percent this year as inflation approaches 3 percent from less than 1 percent last year.
Higher prices are likely to sap consumer spending - which is being supported by the fastest borrowing growth in 11 years - while the start of formal Brexit talks before the end of March will kick off a process that companies fear could lead to reduced access to EU markets.
This leaves the Bank of England in a quandary after it cut interest rates to a record-low 0.25 percent in August on fears of a sharp economic slowdown. In November the BoE said rates could move in either direction as it was only prepared to tolerate a limited overshoot of its 2 percent inflation target.
Samuel Tombs, an economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said the PMI data was still well below levels which had triggered past rate rises. ""We expect growth in activity to be far too weak and uncertainty about the economic outlook to be too pressing for the (BoE) to hike rates this year,"" Tombs said.

(Reuters) - Borrowing by small U.S. firms ticked up in November, data released on Thursday showed, as Americans unexpectedly elected Republican Donald Trump as their next president and investors bid up U.S. stocks on bets that tax cuts will boost profits.
The Thomson Reuters/PayNet Small Business Lending Index rose to 129.9 in November from a downwardly revised 119.8 in October. Measured from a year earlier, it was the first increase in six months. Movements in the index typically correspond with movements in gross domestic product growth a quarter or two ahead.
""Right now we've got this post-election bounce, because we know who will be in office,"" said Bill Phelan, PayNet's chief executive and founder. ""Is this going to continue into a new era of growth or no? That's unclear.""
Trump has embraced a range of potential new policies, including tax cuts and infrastructure programs that boosters say will feed growth and critics say could add to already high national debt, as well as changes to trade agreements that many economists, even those who support Trump, say could hurt U.S. growth overall.
Economic growth in the United States sped up in the third quarter to a 3.5 percent annual pace.
While the Atlanta Fed currently estimates economic growth eased to 2.9 percent in the fourth quarter, that is still well above the 2 percent that many economists believe is a sustainable long-term pace.
Small business borrowing is a key barometer of growth because small companies tend to do much of the hiring that drives economic gains.
Companies also are having an easier time paying back existing debts, PayNet data showed. The share of loans more than 30 days past due slipped in November to 1.67 percent, the first decline in nearly a year.

PayNet collects real-time loan information such as originations and delinquencies from more than 325 leading U.S. lenders.

927,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 05, 2017 05:10AM ET</span>","Euro zone producer prices rise in November, consumer goods prices subdued","BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Euro zone producer prices rose for the third consecutive month in November on a monthly basis, mostly driven by soaring energy prices which offset subdued prices for consumer goods, estimates released on Thursday by Eurostat showed.
The European Union's statistics office said prices at factory gates in the 19 countries sharing the euro increased 0.3 percent month-on-month in November and 0.1 percent from a year earlier.
Both figures were above market forecasts. Economists polled by Reuters had produced an average forecast of a 0.1 percent monthly rise and a 0.1 percent year-on-year decline.
The November increase of the monthly reading is slower than the 0.8 percent rise recorded in October, but confirms a positive trend begun in September when producer prices went up 0.1 percent, after falling 0.2 percent in August.
The monthly rise was driven in November by energy prices which were the strongest component of the reading. They increased 0.7 percent, slowing down from a 2.6 percent increase in October.
Producer prices are an indication of consumer price trends, because unless cushioned by intermediaries and retailers, their changes translate directly into the final prices of goods and services for consumers.
The rise of industrial prices is positive news for the European Central Bank which wants consumer prices to rise below, but close to 2 percent over a two-year horizon.
Consumer inflation in December was 1.1 percent, the highest level since September 2013, Eurostat estimated on Wednesday.
Subdued prices for consumer goods confirmed however that inflation trends were still not structurally changed and remained mostly driven by volatile energy prices.
In November, prices of non-durable consumer goods, such as clothing, went up 0.1 percent on the month, below the total industry average.
Prices of durable consumer goods, such as cars or refrigerators, were the only component to show a decline, easing 0.1 percent month-on-month.
Capital goods, like machinery, saw prices unchanged, signaling little appetite for new investment. Prices for intermediate goods went up by 0.5 percent.

In a report, market research group Markit said the seasonally adjusted Markit/CIPS services purchasing managers’ index (PMI) unexpectedly rose to 56.2 last month from a reading of 55.2 in November.
Analysts had expected the index to fall to 54.7.
On the index, a level above 50.0 indicates expansion in the industry, below 50.0 indicates contraction.
Markit indicated that this was the third straight month of acceleration with new business increasing at the fastest rate since July 2015.
However, the research group further noted output price inflation hit a 68-month record.
“A buoyant service sector adds to signs that the UK economy continues to defy widely-held expectations of a Brexit-driven slowdown.,” Markit chief economist Chris Williamson said in the report.
Combined with the other robust PMI surveys from manufacturing and construction, Williamson said the data pointed to economic growth of 0.5% in the fourth quarter.
“At face value, this improvement suggests that the next move by the Bank of England is more likely to be a rate hike than a cut, but policymakers are clearly concerned about the extent to which Brexit related uncertainty could slow growth this year,” this expert said, concluding that the combination of the two factors made it unlikely that there would policy changes in the short-term.

The strong pick-up mirrored improvements in manufacturing surveys earlier this week, as market watchers debate whether China's leaders will settle for a more modest growth target this year in order to focus on more pressing issues such as an explosive growth in debt.
The services PMI rose to 53.4 in December on a seasonally adjusted basis from 53.1 in November, the Markit/Caixin services purchasing managers' index (PMI) showed.
The December reading was the highest since July 2015, and well above the 50-mark that demarcates expansion in activity from contraction on a monthly basis.
New business for services firms also rose at the fastest pace in 17 months, while business expectations were at a 4-month high, though an employment sub-index remained stubbornly weak and input prices rose the fastest in nearly two years.
Companies surveyed said that higher raw materials prices were the biggest factor in higher prices, but strong competition meant they weren't able to pass along higher costs to customers, pointing to pressure on profit margins. An index of prices charged held basically stable at 50.5 in December.
Caixin's composite PMI covering both the manufacturing and services sectors matched a near 4-year high of 53.5 in December from the previous month's 52.9, pointing to solid and more balanced growth for the economy overall.
The upbeat findings broadly echo those of official and private manufacturing surveys earlier this week that showed improving conditions across broad sectors of the economy.
""The Chinese economy performed better in the fourth quarter than in the previous three quarters,"" Zhengsheng Zhong, director of macroeconomic analysis at CEBM Group, said in a note with the report, adding that full-year growth was certain to meet the government's target of 6.5-7 percent.
China is slowly making progress in shifting its economic growth model away from a heavy reliance on exports and investment, with consumption contributing 71 percent of growth in the first nine months of 2016.
But auto sales are forecast to slow to single-digit growth this year, home sales are on a downward trend and even China's red-hot film industry grew only 3.7 percent last year.
Even as fears of an economic hard landing have greatly diminished, other risks have become more pronounced.
The foreign trade environment looks increasingly uncertain amid threats by U.S. President-elect Donald Trump to slap tariffs on China's shipments into its largest export market, and to brand Beijing a currency manipulator.
Credit is growing significantly faster than GDP and likely hit a record high last year, while speculation in housing, commodities and even government debt markets have raised the risks of asset bubbles as overall leverage in the economy is still rising.
These risks have led to expectations that financial and monetary conditions will be tighter this year, while pressure from a weakening yuan and capital outflows will also keep the focus on risk containment at the expense of growth.
""All known macroeconomic risks of China are still elevated. Persistent loss of foreign reserves, rising debt-to-GDP ratio, the risk of bubble burst in the property market, and the liquidity crunch in the domestic bond market etc will continue to work in unison to pressure economic growth lower,"" DBS said in a note on Wednesday.

""It is no coincidence that the leadership is reportedly to accept even slower growth this year.""

The Markit/Nikkei Japan Services Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) rose to a seasonally adjusted 52.3 in December from 51.8 in November.
The index remained above the 50 threshold that separates expansion from contraction for the third consecutive month, and rose to its highest since January 2016.
New business expanded at the fastest rate since July 2015, Markit said, as surveyed companies opened new stores that reached new customers. December was the fifth straight month in which new business increased.
Services account for around two-thirds of Japan's gross domestic product (GDP), so expansion in that sector could help overall economic growth.
Economists expect Japan's GDP to expand by an annualized 0.6 percent in October-December, according to a Reuters poll of economists taken early last month.

That would be slower than the 1.3 percent annualized growth in July-September, but some economists could raise their forecasts after data in late December showed industrial production picked up pace and retail sales rose

DETROIT (Reuters) - U.S. sales of new cars and trucks hit a record high in 2016, automakers said on Wednesday, and investors bid up shares in the sector as strong consumer confidence and relatively low fuel prices bolstered the industry's outlook.
Shares of General Motors Co (N:GM) rose 5.5 percent and Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co Dow Jones Industrial Average, which was up only 0.3 percent.
Autodata Corp said 2016 U.S. auto sales of 17.55 million were 0.4 percent higher than the previous record set in 2015.
December sales rose 3 percent, and on a seasonally adjusted annualized basis were 18.43 million vehicles, Autodata said. That widely beat expectations of economists polled by Thomson Reuters of 17.7 million vehicles.
The results prompted executives from the three biggest sellers in the U.S. market, GM, Ford, and Toyota Motor Corp, (T:7203), to predict that this year's sales will be near 2016's record levels.
U.S. consumer confidence reached levels not seen in 15 years in December. Auto sales are an early indicator of consumer spending, and account for about a fifth of U.S. retail spending.
GM's December sales rose 10 percent, Ford was up 0.3 percent and Toyota increased 2 percent. All three automakers' results, lifted by strong demand for pickup trucks and SUVs, beat Wall Street expectations.
Ford said it sold 87,512 F-Series pickups in December, the lineup’s best overall sales month in 11 years. The F-series was the best-selling model line in the United States last year, for the 40th year in a row.
Rogue, a compact SUV from Nissan Motor Co, (T:7201) in December was the fourth best-selling model in the U.S. market and showed a sales increase of 53 percent from a year earlier. 
Pickups and SUVs accounted for 59.5 percent of 2016 auto sales, up from 55.8 percent in 2015.
Pickup trucks and compact SUVs held the first six spots in the monthly top-selling models list, as reported by the automakers.
Strong consumer discounts, also called sales incentives, also helped December's sales.
December consumer discounts averaged about $4,000 per vehicle, up by about $500 from a year earlier, according to J.D. Power data provided to Reuters.
Discounts erode automakers' profits but GM said the average transaction price for its vehicles rose $740 from November to $36,386 in December, reflecting in part strong sales of large SUVs such as the Chevrolet Tahoe. That is important to investors because Detroit's automakers make the bulk of their global profits from sales of trucks and SUVs in North America.
Industry executives have cautioned for several months that the U.S. market's post-financial crisis recovery was due for a slowdown, but such concerns seem to be easing.
“Key economic indicators, especially consumer confidence, continue to reflect optimism about the U.S. economy and strong customer demand continues to drive a very healthy U.S. auto industry,” said Mustafa Mohatarem, GM’s chief economist. 
 Fiat  Chrysler Automobiles NV FCAU.N> (MI:FCHA) was a laggard in December, as its sales slid 10 percent. FCA's Jeep brand reported sales down 6 percent.

The Washington-based industry group said its measure on requests for mortgages edged up to 358.5 in the week ended Dec. 30, 0.1 percent higher than the prior week.
Interest rates on 30-year, fixed-rate conforming mortgages, the most widely held type of U.S. home loans, averaged 4.39 percent, down from the prior week's 4.45 percent which was the highest since April 2014.
Conforming mortgages are those with balances of $417,000 or less and qualify for guarantees from federal mortgage agencies  Fannie Mae  (PK:FNMA) and  Freddie Mac  (PK:FMCC).
Interest rates on other types of mortgages were unchanged to 0.13 percentage point lower on the week.
Domestic home borrowing costs retreated along with a drop in U.S. bond yields as investors scooped up U.S. government debt at year-end following a global bond market selloff triggered by worries about a surge in inflation and federal borrowing under a Trump administration.
In early trading on Wednesday, the benchmark 10-year Treasury yield (US10YT=RR) was 2.45 percent. It had hit 2.64 percent on Dec. 15, which was its highest since September 2014, according to Reuters data.
A pullback in mortgage rates buttressed refinancing activity at the end of 2016. 
MBA's refinancing index was up 1.7 percent at 1,132.0 with the refinance share of overall loan activity rising to 52.2 percent from 51.8 percent the previous week.
The group's measure on loan applications to buy a home, which is seen as a proxy on future home sales, dipped 1.4 percent to 228.0.

LONDON (Reuters) - British consumer borrowing increased by the biggest amount in more than 11 years in November, boosting the unexpectedly robust post-Brexit vote economy in what could prove to be a big spending spree ahead of an expected rise in prices.
Net consumer lending beat expectations to jump by 1.926 billion pounds ($2.36 billion) in November - the biggest monthly rise since March 2005 - and is 10.8 percent higher than a year earlier, Bank of England data showed on Wednesday.
Overall economic growth in Britain is likely to have been among the fastest of advanced economies in 2016. But it will face a tougher test this year as the effect of sterling's sharp fall since June's Brexit vote to leave the European Union starts to show up in consumer prices.
Consumer spending was the main motor for British growth in the three months after the referendum, with households saving the smallest share of their income since 2008.
Wednesday's figures suggest this trend continued into the end of 2016, but it is unclear how much longer it will last. 
""Such rapid growth in unsecured credit is unsustainable over the medium-term, and the recent fall back in consumer confidence suggests that households will borrow more cautiously in 2017, subduing growth in consumption,"" Pantheon Macroeconomics economist Samuel Tombs said in a note to clients.
Consumer sentiment surveys have shown shoppers are concerned about the economic outlook as Britain prepares to start two years of talks to leave the EU, though they are still willing to make major purchases.
In a possible harbinger, major clothing retailer  Next  (L:NXT) cut its profit forecast for the current financial year on Wednesday after a poor Christmas and warned of a further decline in 2017-18.
The move sent shockwaves through the sector as Next was the strongest performer of the last decade.
BARGAINS
November's hefty borrowing figures could reflect shoppers taking advantage of Black Friday deals ahead of expected price rises, said Martin Beck, an adviser to forecasters EY ITEM Club.
The British Retail Consortium said high street prices fell in December at the slowest rate since mid-2015, and construction firms blamed a weaker currency for the biggest jump in costs since 2011 in a survey by financial data company Markit.
Economists expect overall consumer price inflation to approach 3 percent in 2017, up from less than 1 percent for 2016 as a whole, while output growth halves to little more than 1 percent.
House price growth is also likely to slow to around 2 percent from twice that in 2016, according to mortgage lender Nationwide Building Society.
The post-Brexit vote economy, however, has surprised many economists. Growth to date has been much stronger than forecast just a few months ago, and there is little immediate sign of this changing.
The Markit construction PMI showed activity rising at the fastest rate since March, bolstered by stronger house-building.

This tallied with the BoE data which showed robust demand for mortgages. Lenders approved 67,505 home loans in November, in line with economists' forecasts in a Reuters poll and the highest since March.

Eurostat said prices in the 19 countries sharing the euro rose 1.1 percent year-on-year last month, sharply accelerating from a 0.6 percent annual, increase in November and 0.5 percent in October.
The European Central Bank wants to keep inflation below, but close to 2 percent and has been buying 60 billion euros worth of euro zone government bonds each month to inject more cash into the banking system and stimulate price rises in the economy.
Eurostat estimated that energy prices jumped 2.5 percent year-on-year in December, the first rise in more than a year, while food alcohol and tobacco prices rose 1.2 percent and services were also 1.2 percent more expensive than a year earlier.

The factor that held inflation down was non-energy industrial goods, the prices of which rose only 0.3 percent year-on-year, the same as in the four previous months.

According to Eurostat, energy prices drove inflation higher, followed by services, and food, alcohol & tobacco.
Core CPI, which excludes food, energy, alcohol, and tobacco costs, unexpectedly increased by a seasonally adjusted 0.9% in December. Analysts had expected core inflation to remain stable at its prior 0.8% increase.

In a report, market research firm Markit and the Chartered Institute of Purchasing & Supply (CIPS) said that their U.K. construction purchasing managers' index rose to a seasonally adjusted 54.2 last month from November’s reading of 52.8.
Economists had expected the index to remain steady at 52.8 in December.
On the index, a reading above 50.0 indicates expansion, below indicates contraction.
Markit highlighted the robust and accelerated upturn in new work as construction output increased at the fastest pace since March.
The market research firm also noted that price pressure continued with the input cost inflation at the highest level since April.
“December’s survey data confirmed a solid rebound in UK construction output during the final quarter of 2016,” Markit senior economist Tim Moore commented in the report.
“All three main areas of construction activity have started to recover from last summer’s soft patch, but in each case growth remains much weaker than the cyclical peaks seen in 2014,” he added.
Moore pointed out the sustained acceleration in input cost inflation at its strongest since 2011 as the “main negative development in December”.
“UK construction companies noted that the weaker sterling exchange rate had resulted in higher costs for a wide range of imported materials, while some also reported that forward purchasing of inputs had led to depleted stocks among suppliers,” he explained.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. factory activity accelerated to a two-year high in December amid a surge in new orders and rapidly rising raw material prices, indicating that some of the drag on manufacturing from prolonged dollar strength and a slump in oil prices was fading.
Other data on Tuesday showed U.S. construction spending hit a 10-1/2-year high in November, providing a boost to a fourth-quarter economic growth estimate. The reports suggested President-elect Donald Trump would inherit a strong economy, with a labor market that is near full employment, from the Obama administration.
""The economy is ending the year on a high note with even the manufacturing sector showing signs of faster growth. It appears that President (Barack) Obama will be leaving his successor with a pretty good economy,"" said Joel Naroff, chief economist at Naroff Economic Advisors in Holland, Pennsylvania. 
The Institute for Supply Management (ISM) said its index of national factory activity rose 1.5 percentage points to 54.7 last month, the highest level since December 2014. A reading above 50 indicates an expansion in manufacturing, which accounts for about 12 percent of the U.S. economy. 
A gauge of new orders jumped 7.2 percentage points to its highest level since November 2014. Twelve industries, including petroleum, electrical equipment, appliances and components and machinery, reported growth in new orders last month.
Export orders also rose, but order backlogs were unchanged. A measure of factory employment hit its highest since June 2015 and the production sub-index rose 4.3 percentage points.
Manufacturers reported paying more for raw materials, which suggests producer inflation could push higher in coming months. The ISM's prices index surged 11 percentage points to its highest level since 2011. It was the 10th straight month of increases in raw materials prices.
Last month, 38 percent of supply executives in the ISM survey reported paying higher prices. 
""The sharp rise in the prices index plays into the global 'reflation' theme with investors pointing to rising input prices in China and elsewhere as signaling a potential return to higher inflation rates,"" said Andrew Hollenhorst, an economist at  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) in New York.
STRONG DOLLAR A THREAT 
A collapse in oil prices in 2015 and a surge in the dollar has hobbled manufacturing. Much of the impact has been through weak business spending on equipment, which has contracted for four straight quarters.
But with oil prices rising and touching 18-month highs on Tuesday, manufacturing is perking up. Gas and oil well drilling has risen over the last several months.
Renewed dollar strength following Trump's November election victory could, however, limit gains in factory activity. Trump has pledged tax cuts and massive infrastructure spending, an expansionary fiscal policy agenda that could fan inflation and spur a faster pace of interest rate increases by the Federal Reserve.
The dollar hit a fresh 14-year high against a basket of currencies on Tuesday's data, while prices for U.S. government debt fell. U.S. stocks traded higher.
In a separate report the Commerce Department said construction spending increased 0.9 percent to $1.18 trillion in November, the highest level since April 2006. It was boosted by gains in both private and public sector investment.
The solid increase in construction spending prompted the Atlanta Fed to raise its fourth-quarter GDP estimate by four-tenths of a percentage point to a 2.9 percent annual rate. The economy grew at a 3.4 percent pace in the third quarter.
Spending on private construction projects jumped 1.0 percent in November to the highest since July 2006 as single-family home building, as well as home renovations, increased.
Investment in private nonresidential structures, which include factories, hospitals and roads, rose 0.9 percent after tumbling 1.5 percent the prior month.
""The outlook for nonresidential investment spending lies in the as-yet-unknown infrastructure plans of the new administration,"" said John Ryding, chief economist at RDQ Economics in New York. 

""However, in nominal dollar terms, nonresidential construction spending is within one percent of the October 2008 high and this may be a further indication of the limited degree of slack in the construction sector that could be deployed on infrastructure projects.""Public construction spending rose 0.8 percent in November to the highest level since March. It was the fourth straight month of increases.

BERLIN (Reuters) - German inflation jumped to within a whisker of the European Central Bank target in December, hitting the highest level in more than three years and providing the euro zone bank with evidence its loose monetary policy is working.
The surprisingly strong surge in consumer prices, however, may put a damper on Germans' appetite for shopping as higher inflation means consumers have less real income to spend.
German consumer prices, harmonized to compare with other European countries (HICP), rose by 1.7 percent on the year after an increase of 0.7 percent in November, the Federal Statistics Office said on Tuesday.
The reading, close to the ECB's inflation target of at or just below 2 percent, was the highest inflation rate since July 2013 and stronger than a Reuters consensus forecast of 1.3 percent.
The strong recovery gives conservatives like Bundesbank President and ECB rate-setter Jens Weidmann more scope to argue for winding down the ECB's bond-buying program more quickly.
The ECB has been pouring money into the euro zone economy in an attempt to boost inflation from a near-deflationary level, and Tuesday's strong data intensified calls from fiscal conservatives to start reversing the ECB's stimulus.
""This jump in inflation is a signal to exit from the ECB's expansive monetary policy,"" Ifo chief Clemens Fuest told the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung. ""If these figures are confirmed for the euro zone as a whole (on Wednesday), the ECB should end the bond buy program in March 2017.""
Politicians from Chancellor Angela Merkel's conservative CDU/CSU bloc echoed Fuest's call.
""The policy of zero interest rates, coupled with rising inflation, is devastating for German savers,"" Bavarian Finance Minister Markus Soeder told Handelsblatt business daily.
A breakdown of the non-harmonized inflation data showed rising energy prices and higher food costs were the strongest drivers behind the overall increase.
DZ Bank economist Michael Holstein said negative base effects of past oil price drops were now fading out, meaning German inflation was likely to reach the ECB's target of nearly 2 percent in the coming months.
""For the whole of 2017, German inflation will rise to some 1.5 percent - roughly one percentage point higher than in the past year,"" Holstein said.
The data means that Wednesday's wider euro zone figure will probably come in stronger than expected as well
Economists polled by Reuters predict the euro zone HICP inflation figure will rise to 1.0 percent from 0.6 percent in November. Capital Economics analyst Jennifer McKeown said she now expected a sharper increase to around 1.2 percent.
Still, price pressures elsewhere in the euro zone remain more muted than in Germany, she added, pointing to French annual HICP inflation only creeping up to 0.8 percent in December after 0.7 percent in November.
""Accordingly... we doubt that this will lead the ECB to reconsider its policy support,"" McKeown said.
DENT TO REAL INCOMES
While rising prices may be good news for the ECB from a pan-euro zone perspective, they do not necessarily bode well for the German economy. It has been relying on private consumption, a booming construction sector and government spending for growth.
""Indeed, a temporary energy-related rise in inflation this year will dent real incomes growth, which is a key reason why we expect the economic recovery to slow,"" McKeown said.
The German government expects the economy to have grown by 1.8 percent in 2016 and predicts growth to slow to 1.4 percent this year, mainly due to fewer workdays and weaker exports.
Still, economists expect Germany's labor market to remain robust in 2017.
The Federal Labour Office said on Tuesday that unemployment fell more than expected in December, keeping the jobless rate at a record low.
""The strong increase in employment that has been going on for a long time slowed since the summer months, but demand for new workers remains at a high level,"" said Frank-Juergen Weise, head of the Federal Labour Office.
The seasonally adjusted jobless total fell by 17,000 to 2.638 million, the Labour Office said. That was more than three fold the 5,000 forecast in a Reuters poll.
The adjusted unemployment rate remained at 6.0 percent, the lowest level since German reunification in 1990.
In 2016 as a whole, a record 43.4 million people were employed in Germany - 1 percent more than in 2015 and the tenth consecutive year that the workforce expanded.
""Job creation should continue this year,"" said Joerg Zeuner of KfW bank. ""The expected rise in unemployment due to immigrants has so far not materialized.""

More than one million migrants, mainly refugees from the Middle East and Africa, arrived in Germany over the last two years. The government is investing billions on integrating them.

956,By Investing.com,"<span>Jan 03, 2017 05:01AM ET</span>",U.K. manufacturing PMI hits 30-month high in December,"Investing.com - Manufacturing activity in the U.K. registered an unexpected increase in December, hitting a 30-month high and bolstering confidence over the British economy, industry data showed on Tuesday.
In a report, market research group Markit said that its U.K. manufacturing PMI jumped to a seasonally adjusted 56.1 last month from a reading of 53.6 in November, that was revised from an initial 53.4.
Analysts had expected the index to slip to 53.3 in December.
On the index, a reading above 50.0 indicates industry expansion, below indicates contraction.
Markit pointed out that improved domestic and overseas demand boosted output and new order growth.
The research group further indicated that price pressures stayed elevated, though they eased further from recent highs.
“The UK manufacturing sector starts 2017 on a strong footing,” Rob Dobson, senior economist at survey compiler Markit, said.
“The headline PMI hit a two-and-a-half year high in December, with rates of expansion in output and new orders among the fastest seen during the survey’s 25-year history,” he added.
Dobson said the data signaled quarterly growth of 1.5% which he considered to be “a surprisingly robust pace given the lackluster start to the year and the uncertainty surrounding the EU referendum.”
This expert also noted that rates of inflation remained among the highest levels seen during the survey’s history.
“Of the companies citing a cause of higher costs, 75% linked the increase to the exchange rate,” he explained.
Following the report, the pound jumped to almost two-week highs against the euro following the report, with EUR/GBP down 0.63% to 0.8460."

In a report, Germany's Federal Statistics Office said the unemployment rate was unchanged at a seasonally adjusted 6.0% this month, in line with analyst expectations.
The number of unemployed people declined by a seasonally adjusted 17,000 from a month earlier, compared to forecasts for a drop of 5,000. Jobless claims fell by 6,000 in November.
EUR/USD was trading at 1.0434 following the release of the data, from around 1.0437 earlier, while EUR/GBP was at 0.8503 from approximately 0.8505 ahead of the report.
Meanwhile, European stock markets were broadly higher in early trade. Germany's DAX eased up 0.1%, the EURO STOXX 50 rose 0.45%, France’s CAC 40 added 0.5%, while London’s FTSE 100 tacked on 0.8%.

The Caixin/Markit Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' index (PMI) rose to 51.9 on a seasonally adjusted basis, from 50.9 in November and easily beating analysts' forecasts of 50.7.
The index has been slowly building momentum thanks to a lending and construction boom, and has now been above the 50-point neutral level which separates expansion in activity from contraction for six straight months.
Output rose at the fastest pace since January 2011, with a reading of 53.7, and new orders also increased significantly, though companies continued to cut staff and at a slightly faster rate from November.
Order growth was fueled by stronger domestic demand as new export orders remained sluggish.
The private survey tends to focus more on small and mid-sized Chinese firms, which have had a harder time gaining traction than larger, state-backed firms.
An official factory survey on Sunday showed activity in the sector expanded for a fifth month in December, though growth slowed a touch more than expected as government measures to rein in soaring asset prices start to have an effect on the broader economy.
After a rocky start to the year, China's economy looks set to hit Beijing's 2016 growth target of 6.5 to 7 percent, after expanding 6.7 percent for each of the first three quarters.
Data last week showed profits at industrial companies rose at the fastest pace in three months in November, with the extra income offering some relief for the many debt-laden companies in smokestack industries.
Profits in November rose 14.5 percent to 774.6 billion yuan ($111 billion) from a year earlier, the highest since August's record 19.5 percent spike, National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) said.
Prices charged by Chinese manufacturers for their goods increased for the 10th straight month, boding well for profit margins.
""The Chinese manufacturing economy continued to improve in December...,"" Zhengsheng Zhong, director of macroeconomic analysis at CEBM Group, said in a note with the report.
""However, it is still to be seen if the stabilization of the economy is consolidated due to uncertainties in whether restocking and consumer price rises can be sustainable.""
China's industrial sector has benefited this year from infrastructure and housing spending, which has spurred demand for materials from cement to steel. Reductions in excess capacity have further buoyed prices of raw materials.
But despite the rebound, most analysts say the economy will face challenges in 2017 as the impact of previous stimulus wears off and as the property sector slows. Auto sales could also slow from double-digit growth seen this year.
There are also signals from China's top leaders that more will be done in 2017 to crack down on asset bubbles and tackle a mountain of debt, even at the expense of slower growth, meaning additional stimulus measures could be limited.
China's massive export sector also faces risks next year after the surprise election of Donald Trump as the next U.S. president. Trump has threatened tariffs on Chinese imports.

The Chinese government should set a more flexible target for economic growth this year to give more space for reform efforts, a central bank adviser told the official Xinhua news agency in comments published on Sunday.

IHS Markit's final 2016 manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index for the euro zone registered 54.9 in December, in line with an earlier flash estimate and its highest since April 2011.
That was above both the 50 mark which separates growth from contraction and November's 53.7. An index measuring output, which feeds into the composite PMI, jumped to a 32-month high of 56.1 from 54.1.
""Euro zone manufacturers are entering 2017 on a strong footing, having ended 2016 with a surge in production,"" said Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit.
""To put the PMI data into perspective, the five-and-a-half-year high reached in December is broadly consistent with factory output growing at an impressive annual rate of approximately 4 percent.""
Suggesting this month will also be strong, a new orders sub-index climbed to 55.9 from 54.4, its highest since April 2011, even though companies raised prices at the fastest rate in over five years.
""Policymakers will be doubly pleased to see the manufacturing sector's improved outlook being accompanied by rising price pressures,"" Williamson said.
In a surprise move last month, the European Central Bank cut asset purchases but promised protracted stimulus to aid a still-fragile recovery and bolster weak inflation.

The Markit/ADACI Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) rose to 53.2 in December from 52.2 in November, above the 50 mark that separates growth from contraction.
The PMI also showed that manufacturing orders and output both increased to their highest levels since June. The sub-index for new orders rose to 54.7 from 53.2 in November, driven by orders from abroad.
The positive PMI is welcome news for Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni, who took over leadership of the euro zone's most chronically sluggish economy in December. 
The government forecasts 0.8 percent growth last year, less than half of what is forecast for the German economy. But growth rebounded in the third quarter, rising 0.3 percent from the previous three months, compared with a 0.1 percent increase in
the second quarter.

Data compiler IHS Markit said its final purchasing managers' index rose to 53.5 in December from 51.7 in November, unchanged from a preliminary reading.
The increase brought the index to its highest level since May 2011 and marked the third month in a row above the 50-point line dividing expansions in activity from contractions.
""Favorable demand conditions had encouraged firms to raise output, which resulted in the sharpest round of job creation in 5-1/2 years,"" IHS Markit economist Alexander Gill said.
""These are positive signs for France as the country contends with high levels of unemployment,"" he added.
Companies increased staffing levels as the flow of new orders grew at the strongest pace since May 2011, suggesting the spurt of activity in December may be more than a month-long blip.

967,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 02, 2017 04:00AM ET</span>",German factory growth reaches close to three-year high in December: PMI,"BERLIN, (Reuters) - German manufacturing growth reached its highest in almost three years in December, driven by rising demand from Asia and the United States, a survey showed on Monday, suggesting the sector will contribute to an expansion in the fourth quarter.
Markit's Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) for manufacturing, which accounts for about a fifth of the economy, rose to 55.6 from 54.3 in November to reach its highest level in 35 months.
That was slightly above a flash reading and well above the 50 line that separates growth from contraction.
""Strong growth in December meant that goods producers enjoyed their best quarter in nearly three years during Q4,"" Markit economist Philip Leake said. ""The manufacturing sector is therefore likely to help overall GDP growth accelerate from the modest 0.2 percent pace seen in the third quarter.""
He added that companies reported solid improvement in domestic demand as well as new business wins in Asia, Europe and the United States.
""There were also encouraging signs for further growth in 2017. Companies look set to hire in an effort to raise operating capacity, following the sharpest increase in backlogs of work since early-2014,"" Leake said.
Expansions of output and new orders underpinned the overall improvement in conditions, Market said, noting that new business increased for the 25th consecutive month with the rate of growth just below the record over that period.
Responding to the rising demand, manufacturers raised their output at a quicker pace. The rise in production was the highest since July, it said.
Inflationary pressures also increased in December. Input costs rose at the fastest pace since June 2011. The weaker euro helped to drive up import costs, Markit said. 
The survey was another positive sign after Ifo's closely watched business climate index showed last month that morale among executives rose in December to its highest level since February 2014.
The economy grew 0.7 percent in the first quarter and 0.4 in the second. For the year, economic institutes predict a growth rate of 1.9 percent, mainly driven by soaring private consumption and higher state spending on migrants.

The manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) slipped to 47.7 in December from 48.8 in November, according to the Istanbul Chamber of Industry and HIS Markit. Anything below 50 indicates contraction; anything above, expansion.
""The Turkish PMI remained below 50.0 in December, mainly reflecting the output and new orders components,"" Markit senior economist Trevor Balchin said. ""More positively, employment grew further during the month.
The depreciating lira was again responsible for an intensification of cost pressures, with input price inflation
accelerating further after a relatively moderate trend in the third quarter.""
The depreciation of the lira continued to put upward pressure on manufacturing input prices in December, with inflation continuing its upward trend, Markit said. As a result, output prices charged by manufacturers also rose at a higher rate, compared with the previous period.
The lira has hit a series of record lows this year, hurt by widening domestic concerns, particularly over security and a government crackdown following the failed coup in July.
The lira has lost around 20 percent of its value against the dollar this year.

974,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 02, 2017 12:20AM ET</span>",Cash crunch pushed Indian factory activity into contraction in December,"BENGALURU,(Reuters) - Indian factory activity plunged into contraction last month as a cash crunch following Prime Minister Narendra Modi's currency crackdown severely hurt output and demand, a survey found on Monday.
The Nikkei/Markit Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index fell to 49.6 in December from November's 52.3, its first reading below the 50 mark that separates growth from contraction since December 2015.
It was also the biggest month-on-month decline since November 2008, just after the collapse of Lehman Brothers triggered a financial crisis and brought on a global recession.
""Having held its ground in November following the unexpected withdrawal of 500 and 1,000 bank notes from circulation, India's manufacturing industry slid into contraction at the end of 2016,"" said Pollyanna De Lima, economist at survey compiler IHS Markit.
""Shortages of money in the economy steered output and new orders in the wrong direction, thereby interrupting a continuous sequence of growth that had been seen throughout 2016.""
The output sub-index at 49.0 was its lowest this year, though the rate of contraction was only slight.
The new orders sub-index which measures both foreign and domestic demand was also knocked to its weakest in 2016.
Contractions in momentum were reported across all major sub-indexes in the survey, such as purchasing activity and employment, highlighting the blow to the economy after the government's demonetization drive.
Modi's decision to scrap high-value banknotes as part of a crackdown on tax dodgers and counterfeiters removed 86 percent of the currency in circulation virtually overnight, denting consumption in a country where the vast majority of people still rely on cash for day-to-day activities.
Economists have begun slashing GDP forecasts and some of the more pessimistic views are that growth will halve from the 7.3 percent year-over-year rate clocked in July-September, especially as consumer spending accounts for over half of India's output.
The survey also showed output prices rose at a subdued pace last month, while input prices climbed sharply, suggesting manufacturers had little power to pass on rising costs.
With consumer inflation at a two-year low in November, that could fuel hopes of an interest rate cut by the Reserve Bank of India at its next policy review.
The central bank unexpectedly kept its key policy rate unchanged at 6.25 percent earlier this month, despite calls for action in the face of the intense cash shortage.

The RBI said the impact of the cash squeeze may be short-lived and it needed more time to see if the move would cause more lasting damage to economic activity.

The official Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) stood at 51.4 in December compared with 51.7 in November. A reading above 50 indicates an expansion on a monthly basis while one below 50 suggests a contraction.
December's reading was slightly below the forecast in a Reuters poll for 51.5.
A housing boom in the second half of 2016 and a government spending spree on infrastructure have helped boost prices for commodities from cement to steel, giving the manufacturing sector a much-needed lift. 
But the government is cracking down on speculative property buying, and signals from policymakers that more will be done to contain asset bubbles and rising debt - even at the expense of slower growth - means extra stimulus measures could be limited.
""Today's PMI figures suggest that the change of policy tone has taken its toll, as the authorities are seriously concerned about the asset bubbles,"" said Zhou Hao, senior economist at Commerzbank (DE:CBKG). 
Factory output slowed in December, with the sub-index hitting 53.3 compared with 53.9 the previous month.
Total new orders were flat at 53.2, logging the same as in November, while new export orders fell to 50.1 from 50.3.
Jobs were again lost, with the employment sub-index sitting at 48.9, compared to 49.2 in November, as the country pledged to cut excess capacity over a range of industries. 
A sub-index for smaller firms fell, and performance for larger companies also worsened.
The Markit/Caixin PMI, a private gauge of manufacturing activity which focuses more on small- and mid-sized firms, is due on Jan. 3.
Analysts in a Reuters poll expect it to fall to 50.7 from the previous month's reading of 50.9.
A separate reading on the services sector showed the pace of growth slowed in December, Sunday's data showed.
The official non-manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) stood at 54.5 in December, down from 54.7 in November, but well above the 50-point mark.
China is counting on growth in services - which account for more than half of gross domestic product - to offset persistent softness in exports that is dragging on the economy. Private investment has also remained stubbornly weak. 

But GDP still looks set to hit Beijing's 2016 growth target of 6.5 to 7 percent, after expanding 6.7 percent for each of the first three quarters.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A drop in U.S. exports last month pushed the country's trade deficit in goods higher while the number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits fell last week in a positive sign for the labor market.
The two reports released on Thursday suggested that when Donald Trump becomes America's president next month, the labor market will likely be at roughly full strength and international trade could be weighing on the economy.
In an initial estimate that does not include trade in services, the Commerce Department said the country exported $1.2 billion less in November than in October. Imports rose by $2.2 billion during the month. The full trade report for November is due on Jan. 6.
""It appears net trade will again be a drag"" on economic growth in the fourth quarter, said Michael Gapen, an economist at  Barclays  (LON:BARC) in New York. 
Further details in the report showed an increase in retail and wholesale inventories in November, which could provide a temporary boost to economic growth. 
Trump campaigned heavily on promises to reduce America's trade deficit and bring back jobs that moved abroad to countries with lower costs for manufacturing.
Working against him could be a stronger U.S. dollar which could weigh on U.S. exporters. The trade deficit for goods widened by $3.4 billion in November to $65.3 billion.
The dollar has surged about 5 percent since Trump won the Nov. 8 presidential election as investors bet wider budget deficits under his presidency will trigger higher inflation and more interest rate increases by the Federal Reserve. On Thursday, the dollar weakened and stocks rose slightly in light holiday-period trading.
Separately, initial claims for state unemployment benefits dropped 10,000 to a seasonally adjusted 265,000 for the week ended Dec. 24, the Labor Department said. 
It was the 95th straight week that claims were below 300,000, a threshold associated with a healthy labor market. That is the longest stretch since 1970, when the labor market was much smaller. 
The department said in a statement there were no special factors affecting claims last week although estimating the data can be more difficult around holiday periods. The department said the actual number of claims was estimated by government staff for 10 states.
Claims for the prior week were unrevised. 
Labor market strength contributed to the Federal Reserve raising its benchmark overnight interest rate earlier this month by 25 basis points to a range of 0.50 percent to 0.75 percent. The U.S. central bank forecast three rate hikes in 2017. 
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast first-time applications for jobless benefits falling to 264,000 in the latest week. 

The claims report also showed the number of people still receiving benefits after an initial week of aid rose 63,000 to 2.10 million in the week ended Dec. 17, the highest since September.

988,By Investing.com,"<span>Dec 29, 2016 08:31AM ET</span>", U.S. jobless claims fall slightly less than expected,"Investing.com - The number of people who filed for unemployment assistance in the U.S. last week decreased slightly less than expected last week but remained in territory consistent with a firming labor market, official data showed on Thursday.
In a report, the U.S. Department of Labor said the number of individuals filing for initial jobless benefits in the week ending December 24 decreased by 10,000 to a seasonally adjusted 265,000 from the previous week’s total of 275,000.
Analysts had expected jobless claims to fall by 11,000 to 264,000 last week.
The Department of Labor indicated that there were no special factors impacting this week’s initial claims and that it marked 95 consecutive weeks of initial claims below 300,000, the longest streak since 1970.
First-time jobless claims below the 300,000-level are usually associated with a firming labor market.
Continuing jobless claims in the week ended December 17 unexpectedly rose to 2.102 million from 2.039 million in the preceding week, which was revised from 2.036 million.
Analysts had expected continuing claims to decrease to 2.030 million.
The four-week moving average was 263,000, a 750 decrease from the previous week's 263,750.
The monthly average is seen as a more accurate gauge of labor trends because it reduces volatility in the week-to-week data.
Immediately after the report, which was published simultaneously with the goods trade balance and wholesale inventories, EUR/USD was trading unchanged at 1.0448, GBP/USD was at 1.2235 from 1.2244 earlier, while USD/JPY traded at 116.76 compared to 116.82 before the release.
The US dollar index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six major rivals, was at 103.00, compared to 103.02 ahead of the report.
Meanwhile, U.S. stock futures pointed to a flat open. The Dow futures inched down 2 points, or 0.01%, the S&P 500 futures advanced 1 point, or 0.04%, while the Nasdaq 100 futures slipped 1 point, or 0.02%.

Unprecedented stimulus, including negative interest rates and free central bank loans to the bank sector, are slowly making their way through the economy, even as key policymakers argue the impact of the measures is so far weaker than expected.
Lending to non-financial corporations grew by 2.2 percent in November, the highest since mid-2009, while lending growth to households accelerated to 1.9 percent, the fastest pace since mid-2011, the ECB said on Thursday.
The figures suggest that unprecedented stimulus, including negative interest rates and free central bank loans to the bank sector, are slowly making their way through the economy, even as key policymakers argue that impact of the ECB measures is so far weaker than expected.
Lending grew as composite corporate borrowing costs and household mortgage rates are both holding at record lows, well below 2 percent, thanks to years of monetary easing by the ECB.
Also suggesting firming growth, the M3 measure of money circulating in the euro zone, which has in the past predicted future economic activity, also accelerated to hit 4.8 percent in November, beating forecasts for 4.4 percent growth.
Still, the ECB has committed to maintaining its asset buys to help keep financing conditions low, at least until the end of next year, as inflation remains well short of its target.
Likely hitting 1 percent around the turn of the year, inflation is still well short of the ECB's target of 2 percent.
A weaker euro and a big rise in oil prices could boost inflation in the coming year, analysts said.

CHICAGO (Reuters) - A jump in consumer spending in the final stretch of December significantly offset a slow start to the U.S. holiday shopping season, and is likely to help many retailers beat sales forecasts, industry research groups said on Tuesday.
The December spending boost is in contrast to a muted November, when early holiday promotions and expectations among consumers that deals would always be available took a toll. Spending over the Thanksgiving weekend in November fell 3.5 percent from a year ago despite a strong jump in online sales, according to the National Retail Federation. 
""It was a hot start with Cyber Monday, followed by a lull for the last couple of weeks and then a big-bang finish,"" said Pete Madden, a director at retail consultancy AlixPartners. 
Sales data released on Tuesday showed the major shift in fortunes in late December 
Brick-and-mortar sales in the week ending Dec. 24 rose 6.5 percent year-over-year after having fallen for the rest of the month, according to data from analytics firm RetailNext. 
Strong demand for furniture, home furnishings and men's apparel from the start of November through Christmas Eve pushed U.S. retail sales up 4 percent, higher than the previously expected 3.8 percent, according to data from MasterCard's holiday spending report, also released on Tuesday. The report, which tracks spending by combining sales activity in MasterCard's payments network with estimates of cash and other payment forms, offers an early look into how the holiday season shaped up. 
Official government data and results from retailers will not be available until next month. 
The jump in spending prompted a prominent retail consultant to raise his holiday sales forecast. Craig Johnson, president of consultancy Customer Growth Partners, told Reuters that he now estimates sales growth of 4.9 percent in November and December, up from his initial estimate of 4.1 percent. 
Johnson said he expects this year to be the strongest since 2005, and sales momentum is likely to remain strong until the New Year. There is growing evidence that an improving job market, lower gasoline prices and growing consumer optimism all contributed to the surge.
President-elect Donald Trump attributed the spending increased to his impending arrival at the White House.
""The world was gloomy before I won - there was no hope. Now the market is up nearly 10 percent and Christmas spending is over a trillion dollars!"" Trump wrote on Twitter.
Whatever the reason, shoppers remained ebullient.
""I'm here just to shop,"" said Eddy Flores, 46, as he lugged three bags stuffed with clothing through Macy's in New York City. He was there to take advantage of post-Christmas deep discounts. 
LOSING OUT 
Despite the late-December surge, not every retailer will benefit. Department stores like Macy's (N:M), J.C. Penney (N:JCP), Kohl's Corp (N:KSS) and others are still heavily discounting items, as growth in women's apparel remained weak. 
J.C. Penney offered the deepest average discount level of any retailer this year, according to retail pricing and data analytics firm Market Track.
Jewelry retailers also had a lackluster season that could hurt the likes of Tiffany & Co (N:TIF) and Signet Jewelers (N:SIG), industry groups said. 
The verdict on electronics as a category remained mixed. MasterCard said electronics sales were weak while analytics firm Slice Intelligence said electronics was a top revenue-earner, with  Best Buy  (N:BBY) and Apple Inc (O:AAPL) gaining share the week leading up to Christmas. 

The biggest beneficiary of the holiday season continued to be Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN), which outperformed its rivals again this year, research firms said. Amazon on Tuesday called the holiday season its ""best ever.""

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's factory output rose in November and manufacturers expect to ramp up production in coming months, data showed on Wednesday, underscoring the central bank's view that a pick-up in global demand will underpin a steady economic recovery.
Retail sales also increased in November and inventory fell for three straight months, suggesting a broader improvement in the economy, with a recent rebound in exports also seen supporting growth.
The figures reinforce the dominant market view that the Bank of Japan will hold off on expanding monetary stimulus in coming months.
""While domestic demand still lacks strength, a pick-up in exports is driving up production,"" said Takeshi Minami, chief economist at Norinchukin Research Institute.
""Output will likely continue recovering moderately ahead.""
Industrial output rose 1.5 percent in November from the previous month, preliminary data released by the trade ministry showed, roughly matching a median market forecast for a 1.6 percent increase. 
It followed a 0.6 percent gain in September and a flat reading in October.
Manufacturers surveyed by the ministry expect output to increase 2.0 percent in December and rise 2.2 percent in January, a sign they are becoming more optimistic on the outlook for overseas demand.
""Industrial output is picking up,"" the ministry said, raising its assessment from last month when it said production was showing signs of a moderate pick-up.
Japan's economy recorded a third straight quarter of annual expansion in July-September, albeit at a modest pace as slow wage growth weighed on household spending.
But exports and factory output have recently shown signs of life on a recovery in global demand, offering some hope for policymakers struggling to pull the economy out of stagnation.
Separate data released by the government showed retail sales rose 1.7 percent in November from a year earlier, far exceeding a median market forecast for a 0.6 percent gain.

The BOJ offered an upbeat view of the economy at its rate review last week, while the government raised its assessment of the economy for the first time in nearly two years in December.

1006,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 27, 2016 11:37AM ET</span>",U.S. consumers ebullient; home prices gain,"(Reuters) - U.S. consumer confidence shot to its highest in more than 15 years in December as Americans saw more strength ahead in business conditions, stock prices and the job market following the election of Donald Trump as president in November.
House prices continued their steady recovery in October, although a spike in borrowing costs after Trump's Nov. 8 victory could present a headwind to sustained home value gains.
The Conference Board said on Tuesday its Consumer Confidence Index rose to 113.7 this month from an upwardly revised 109.4 in November. That topped estimates in a Reuters poll for a reading of 109.0, and was the highest since August 2001.
The gain in confidence was entirely due to rising expectations as consumers' assessments of current conditions dipped, and was led by surging optimism among older Americans, Lynn Franco, director of economic indicators at The Conference Board, said in a statement. The private economic forecasting group's Expectations Index hit its highest since December 2003.
The modest pullback in current conditions ""still suggests that economic growth continued through the final months of 2016,"" Franco said. ""Looking ahead to 2017, consumers' continued optimism will depend on whether or not their expectations are realized."" 
Benchmark U.S. stock indexes have surged to record highs following the election, in which Republican Trump surprised most pre-election polls to defeat Democrat Hillary Clinton.
The S&P 500 (SPX) has gained more than 6 percent since Election Day, while the blue chip Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) has risen by nearly 9 percent to near the 20,000 mark. Small cap stocks have outpaced both, with the Russell 2000 (RUT) gaining 15 percent in the same run.
All three indexes were up modestly on Tuesday in light, post-Christmas holiday trading.
Interest rates have also risen on expectations that Trump's economic plans will accelerate growth and inflation and the Federal Reserve will ratchet up the pace of hikes to its benchmark overnight lending rate. The Fed raised that rate earlier in December for the first time this year by a quarter percentage point to a range of 0.50 percent to 0.75 percent, and most forecasters expect at least two hikes in 2017.
Trump will inherit an economy that by most assessments is on solid footing, even if growth has been subdued for much of outgoing President Barack Obama's term. The unemployment rate recently dropped to 4.6 percent, its lowest since the Great Recession ended, and the economy has added an average of 188,000 new jobs a month over the past 12 months.
BORROWING COSTS, INCOME GROWTH POSE RISKS
With benchmark 10-year Treasury yields (US10YT=RR) around their highest in more than two years, the average rate on a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage has hit its highest since May 2014, potentially posing a risk to the U.S. housing price recovery, which continued apace in October. 
The S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller composite index of 20 metropolitan areas rose 5.1 percent in October on a year-over-year basis, up from a downwardly adjusted 5.0 percent climb in September and matching the estimate of a 5.1 percent gain from a Reuters poll of economists.
""Home prices and the economy are both enjoying robust numbers,"" said David M. Blitzer, managing director and chairman of the index committee at S&P Dow Jones Indices.
""However, mortgage interest rates rose in November and are expected to rise further as home prices continue to out-pace gains in wages and personal income,"" Blitzer said.
""With the current high consumer confidence numbers and low unemployment rate, affordability trends do not suggest an immediate reversal in home price trends. Nevertheless, home prices cannot rise faster than incomes and inflation indefinitely."" 
Prices in the 20 cities rose 0.6 percent in October from a revised 0.5 percent in September on a seasonally adjusted basis, the survey showed, outpacing expectations for a 0.5 percent increase.
On a non-seasonally adjusted basis, prices increased 0.1 percent from September. 
The biggest year-over-year gains were recorded in the West and Texas, including gains of more than 10 percent in the Seattle and Portland areas. Prices in the Denver and Dallas markets increased by more than 8 percent from a year earlier.

The smallest annual gain was in the New York metro area, where prices rose just 1.7 percent.

Industrial profits have had a solid rebound this year after falling last year, boosted by a recovery in commodity prices as supply tightened due to a capacity reduction drive and an infrastructure boom.
Profits in November rose 14.5 percent to 774.6 billion yuan ($111 billion) from a year ago, the highest since August's record 19.5 percent spike, National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) said on Tuesday. Profits in October rose 9.8 percent.
Industrial profits rose 9.4 percent in the first 11 months from a year earlier, up from 8.6 percent in January-October.
""Industrial profits rose relatively fast due to a lower base last year, and the growth was overly reliant on a price rebound in raw material industries such as oil refining, and iron and steel,"" He Ping, an NBS official, said in a note accompanying the data. 
Profits in manufacturing rose 13.7 percent for January-November from a year earlier, while those for the ferrous metal processing industry as well as oil and nuclear fuel refining more than tripled. 
BROADER CRACKDOWN?
Producer prices rose at the fastest pace in more than five years in November as prices of coal, steel and other building materials soared, boosting industrial profits and giving firms more cash to pay off mountains of debt.
But analysts say recent signals from China's top leaders that more will be done in 2017 to crack down on asset bubbles is putting pressures on raw material prices, casting doubts over the sustainability of such a price rebound. 
""The question is whether price rises in recent months resulted from a genuine improvement in demand, or financial speculation,"" said Zhou Hao, senior economist at Commerzbank (DE:CBKG).
""From what we are seeing, the leadership apparently thinks it's the latter."" 
Zhou said the government ""might introduce new policy measures to curb raw material price growth."" 
Chinese steel futures fell sharply on Monday to the lowest level in over a month, as traders took cues from market talk that Beijing may tolerate slower economic growth amid rising debt and an uncertain global environment.
STABLE GROWTH
Tuesday's data covers large enterprises with annual revenue of more than 20 million yuan from their main operations.
China's growth has stabilized this year, with 6.7 percent expansion in gross domestic product in the first three quarters. But corporate debt continues to rise, increasing risks as China looks to push ahead structural reforms. 
Firms are seeing more payments being delayed, as accounts receivable at the end of November rose 9 percent from a year earlier. That increase was biggest than the rise in revenue from main operations. 
""The difficulty in making repayments is still a relatively large hurdle that limits the production and operation of firms,"" NBS's He noted.
Tuesday's data also showed Chinese industrial firms' liabilities at the end of November were 5.6 percent higher than at the same point last year, despite rising at a slower pace than assets have.
China's industrial output should grow around 6 percent in 2017, like this year, a state-run newspaper quoted industry minister Miao Wei as saying on Monday.

1014,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 26, 2016 09:45PM ET</span>","Japan consumer prices slump in November, look for 2017 rebound","By Leika Kihara
TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's core consumer prices marked the ninth straight month of annual declines and household spending slumped in November, data showed on Tuesday, suggesting that the economy still lacks enough momentum to jump-start inflation toward the central bank's ambitious 2 percent target.
Core consumer prices in Tokyo, a leading indicator of nationwide price trends, fell at the fastest pace in nearly four years, highlighting the challenges policy-makers face in eradicating Japan's sticky deflationary mindset.
But analysts expect inflation to accelerate next year reflecting a recent rebound in oil costs and yen declines that push up import prices, easing pressure on the Bank of Japan to top up an already massive stimulus program.
""It's clear trend inflation was weak until December because prices were falling for many non-energy items,"" said Yoshiki Shinke, chief economist at Dai-ichi Life Research Institute.
""But inflation will turn positive and may accelerate to around 1 percent in summer or autumn next year. That's bad news for consumers but good news for the BOJ as it tries to achieve its price target.""
The core consumer price index, which includes oil products but excludes volatile fresh food prices, slipped 0.4 percent in November from a year earlier, government data showed, compared with a median market forecast for a 0.3 percent fall.
Core consumer prices in Tokyo, available a month before the nationwide data, fell 0.6 percent in December from a year earlier, as weak clothing sales forced retailers to cut prices.
It was the biggest annual drop since February 2013, when prices fell by the same margin, and exceeded the 0.4 percent drop projected by analysts in a Reuters poll.
SPENDING STILL WEAK
Japan posted a third straight quarter of annual expansion in July-September and analysts expect growth to pick up in coming quarters, thanks to a recent pick-up in exports and factory output driven by improvements in emerging economies.
The BOJ offered an upbeat view of the economy at its rate review last week, while the government raised its assessment of the economy for the first time in nearly two years.
Policy-makers hope that prospects of a sustained recovery will prompt companies to boost wages and household spending - a particularly soft spot in Japan's economy, the world's third-largest.
Separate data showed the jobs-to-applicants ratio rose to 1.41 from 1.40 in the previous month, matching a median market forecast and reaching the highest level since July 1991.
But household spending fell 1.5 percent in November from a year earlier to decline for the ninth straight month, suggesting that slow wage growth was keeping consumers from shopping.
A pick-up in inflation may prove to be short-lived if the rising cost of living hurts consumption, some analysts say.

The BOJ has repeatedly pushed back the timing for achieving its inflation target with more than three years of aggressive money printing having failed to spur public expectations that prices will rise ahead.

The central government, which includes federal ministries, social security and the central bank, had been expected to post a deficit of 34.5 billion reais, according to the median forecast in a Reuters poll of eight economists. 
Treasury chief Ana Paula Vescovi said the government will meet its 2016 primary deficit target of 163.9 billion reais and still be able to pay an extra 20 billion reais in accrued obligations that have been accumulated over the years. 
She also said the government expects the country's public sector debt to continue to climb in the next three to four years and only stabilize with the help of a mechanism that starts limiting public spending in 2017. The country's gross debt stands at 70 percent of gross domestic product. 

In October, the central government recorded a surplus of 40.8 billion reais thanks to income from a program that gave amnesty to Brazilians who paid fines and taxes over undeclared assets held abroad.

1020,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 26, 2016 01:58PM ET</span>",French jobless total falls for third straight month in November,"PARIS (Reuters) - The number of people out of work in France fell to the lowest point in almost four years in November, dropping for the third month in a row, Labour Ministry data showed on Monday.
The ministry said 3,447,000 people were registered as unemployed in mainland France last month - the lowest figure since January 2013, down 0.9 percent from October and 3.4 percent from November 2015.
It is the first time since February 2008 that the jobless figure has fallen for three consecutive months, Labour Minister Myriam El Khomri said in a statement.
""This decline in unemployment is significant,"" Khomri said, noting that it came after eight years of almost uninterrupted rises in unemployment.
Unemployment has remained stubbornly high throughout the five-year term of President Francois Hollande, contributing to his record unpopularity.
Hollande, who had staked his political future on reversing the trend in unemployment, has decided not to seek a second term in next year's presidential election.

Speaking at an event in the north of Paris, Hollande said that the November jobless numbers were satisfactory but that there was still a long way to go.

1021,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 26, 2016 11:50AM ET</span>","UK Boxing Day online sales up 11.5 percent, footfall down 6 percent","(Reuters) - The number of Britons who hit the shops on Boxing Day morning, a traditional shopping day, fell 6 percent versus the same period last year, while online transactions rose 11.5 percent year-on-year, retail data company Springboard said. 
British retail sales grew at the fastest rate in more than a year in late November and early December, which may have taken some of the buzz out of the period around the Christmas holiday.
Boxing Day sales have traditionally been an indicator of the strength of the Christmas shopping period. But as online transactions grow in importance, discounting periods are being spread more evenly over the year and fewer people are visiting shops to make purchases.
In further evidence of changing shopping habits, Springboard said the number of people in shopping centers on Boxing Day morning fell 16.6 percent versus the same period last year.
Britain's The Telegraph newspaper said huge volumes of returns from Black Friday in November meant that many items would not make it back into shops in time for Boxing Day, hampering shops' sales further, citing data from Clear Returns which tracks online shopping returns. 
A record 1 billion pounds worth of items are expected to be returned after this year's Black Friday as online customers adopted a ""buy now and decide later"" stance, The Telegraph said.

Clear Returns was not immediately available to comment.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - New U.S. single-family home sales rose more than expected in November and consumer sentiment hovered near a 13-year high this month, strengthening the view that the economy will gain further momentum next year.
President-elect Donald Trump's plan to cut taxes and increase infrastructure spending is expected to boost economic growth, though it already has sparked a surge in mortgage rates that could hurt the housing market in the long term.
""Home buyers are confident in their futures and this means the outlook is likely to be brighter next year than we thought,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG Union Bank in New York.
The Commerce Department on Friday said new home sales increased 5.2 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 592,000 units last month. That was the second highest pace since 2007. Economists had forecast single-family home sales, which account for about 9.5 percent of overall home sales, rising 2.1 percent to a 575,000-unit rate last month.
Sales rose 16.5 percent from a year ago, boosted by a 43.8 percent jump in the Midwest to a nine-year high. Sales surged 7.7 percent in the West, their highest level since January 2008, but fell 3.1 percent in the South. They were unchanged in the Northeast.
Separately, the University of Michigan said its consumer sentiment index edged up to a reading of 98.2 from 98 earlier this month. That was the highest reading since January 2004.
The University of Michigan said a record 18 percent of respondents ""spontaneously mentioned the expected favorable impact of Trump's policies on the economy."" Consumers anticipated that a stronger economy would create more jobs, with the share expecting higher income rising to a one-year high.
""Greater income growth prospects for consumers serves as a good leading indicator of real spending activity,"" said Michael Brown, an economist at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) in Charlotte, North Carolina.
U.S. financial markets were little moved by the upbeat data in light pre-holiday trading. The U.S. dollar (DXY) was steady against a basket of currencies, while prices of U.S. Treasuries rose. Stocks on Wall Street were little changed.
RISING MORTGAGE RATES
While Trump's envisaged policies have boosted confidence among households and businesses, his agenda to increase spending is expected to stoke inflation. Mortgage rates have risen rapidly since the business mogul's Nov. 8 election victory.
The interest rate on a fixed 30-year mortgage has increased more than 70 basis points to an average of 4.30 percent, the highest level since April 2014, according to data from mortgage finance firm Freddie Mac.
Mortgage rates are likely to rise further after the Federal Reserve raised its benchmark overnight interest rate last week by 25 basis points to a range of 0.50 percent to 0.75 percent. The U.S. central bank forecast three rate hikes for next year.
Higher mortgage rates in the near term could boost home sales by luring in buyers who fear further increases in borrowing costs. A report on Wednesday showed sales of previously owned homes rose to near a 10-year high in November.
""We have yet to see any clear signs in the housing data reported to date that higher rates have depressed activity,"" said Daniel Silver, an economist at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) in New York. ""That said, we think that at some point higher rates will weigh at least somewhat on the housing market.""
Higher borrowing costs come at a time when house price increases are outstripping wage gains, which could make purchases unaffordable for many first-time buyers.
Despite the rise in sales last month, the inventory of new homes on the market increased 1.6 percent to 250,000 units, the highest level since September 2009. Still, the supply of new houses for sale remains about half of what it was at the peak of the housing market boom.

The inventory rise, if sustained, could slow the pace of house price increases. At November's sales pace it would take 5.1 months to clear the supply of houses on the market, down from 5.2 months in October. A six-month supply is viewed as a healthy balance between supply and demand.

LONDON, (Reuters) - Britain's economy grew more strongly than expected in the third quarter, showing no sign of any slowdown from June's Brexit vote, but the country's current account deficit rose back towards record levels.
The economy expanded 0.6 percent in the three months to September, the Office for National Statistics said on Friday, revised up from an earlier reading of 0.5 percent that economists had expected to remain unchanged.
But growth was revised down by 0.1 percentage points in the first and second quarters of the year to 0.3 and 0.6 percent respectively.
While the figures confirmed that Britain's economy performed more robustly than economists expected after the vote to leave the European Union, there was no sign that sterling's sharp fall had boosted exports.
The figures showed a markedly worse picture for trade and growth was more reliant on domestic demand than previously thought.
""Robust consumer demand continued to help the UK economy grow steadily in the third quarter of 2016,"" ONS statistician Darren Morgan said.
Net trade acted as a drag of 1.2 percentage points on third quarter growth, the biggest drag since early 2012 and compared with an initial estimate that trade had offered a 0.7 percentage point boost to the growth rate.
This reflected corrections the ONS recently made to trade data due to a miscalculation in the trade of gold.
Britain's current account deficit widened to 25.494 billion pounds from a downwardly revised 22.079 billion pounds in the second quarter.
While lower than the 27.45 billion pounds expected by economists, it caused the deficit to rise to 5.2 percent of gross domestic product from 4.6 percent - approaching a record 6.0 percent seen in late 2013.
In the run-up to June's referendum, Bank of England Governor Mark Carney said Britain relied on the ""kindness of strangers"" to meet its financing needs - something that could fade if Britain became a less attractive investment destination.
Sterling tumbled after the Brexit vote, which most economists think should ultimately reduce Britain's current account deficit by curbing imports, and boosting exports and the sterling returns from Britain's overseas investments.
But some economists warn Britain could still be vulnerable if its overseas funders become nervous about their investments - particularly if it looks like Britain will end up with a bad deal in its divorce from the European Union.
Rising inflation caused by the pound's post-referendum plunge looks set to squeeze household spending and economists said they still expected business investment to slow.
Compensation of employees rose at its fastest annual rate since the second quarter of 2013, up 4.5 percent on the year but rising inflation meant that in real terms, household income growth on the year slowed to 0.3 percent - its weakest rate in two years.
Households ate into their savings, with the savings ratio dropping to its lowest since the third quarter of 2008.
Growth in business investment slowed, revised down to 0.4 percent on a quarterly basis from 0.9 percent.

Pollster YouGov and the Centre for Economics and Business Research (Cebr) said their gauge of consumer morale fell by one point to 108.1 in December, the lowest level since July.
The survey found a sizeable drop-off in optimism about household finances over the coming 12 months, with inflation set to rise sharply.
""The slow creep of inflation is starting to be both seen in the economy at large and felt in consumers' wallets throughout the country,"" Scott Corfe, director at Cebr, said.
""Despite things being better than many expected, looking ahead to 2017 there is a feeling that a slight slowdown is on the way."" 
The YouGov/Cebr report chimed with a separate survey by GfK on Thursday which showed a deterioration in consumers' outlook for 2017, despite morale improving overall.
Sterling has fallen more than 10 percent against the dollar since June's EU referendum and while some retailers have raised prices already, others are expected to wait until after the highly competitive holiday season.
So far, the British economy has largely weathered the initial Brexit shock better than many economists had expected.
But a rise in inflation next year is likely to strain the spending power of households who have driven the recovery in the economy since the financial crisis of 2007-09.
Britain's inflation rate in the 12 months to November stood at 1.2 percent and the Bank of England has previously said it expects it to peak at 2.8 percent in early 2018.

The BoE is prepared to let inflation run above its 2 percent target in 2017 but there are limits to tolerating the overshoot, Governor Mark Carney has said.

1041,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 22, 2016 04:20PM ET</span>",Argentina recession lingers as economy shrinks in third quarter,"By Luc Cohen
BUENOS AIRES (Reuters) - Argentina's economy shrank in the third quarter, remaining in recession as inflation ate into consumer purchasing power and weak activity in top trading partner Brazil hurt manufacturing, government data showed on Thursday. 
Economic activity fell 0.2 percent in the July-to-September period, marking the fourth straight quarter of contraction. Compared with the same period in 2015, the economy shrank 3.8 percent, the second straight quarter of year-on-year declines, government statistics agency INDEC said. 
Growth has been elusive during the first year of center-right President Mauricio Macri's administration. Since taking office last December, ending more than a decade of leftist rule, Macri has implemented free-market measures to revive the economy and attract foreign investment. 
Earlier this year, Finance Minister Alfonso Prat-Gay said the economy would likely grow in the third quarter. But investments have been slow to arrive and inflation reaching 40 percent this year has hurt domestic consumption. 
Cumulatively, the economy fell 2.4 percent during the first three quarters of the year compared with the same period last year. 
""This confirms that the recovery has been delayed longer than we expected,"" said Alejo Costa, chief strategist at Buenos Aires-based brokerage Puente. 
The government expects the economy will expand 3.5 percent next year, though private economists' forecasts are lower at a median of 3.0 percent. 
The quarter-on-quarter contraction was less severe than the previous three quarters, boosted by higher public works spending and a more expansionary monetary policy from the central bank, Costa said. 
He added that November data showed signs that a rebound was beginning, with public works boosting construction activity, increasing demand for materials like steel and cement. Government data on November economic activity is expected next week. 
Macri is counting on public works spending to drive growth next year ahead of legislative elections in October to prevent his ""Let's Change"" coalition, which lacks a majority, from losing ground in Congress. 
The public sector grew 1.2 percent in the third quarter, while social services and health care grew 2.4 percent. 
The country's key agriculture sector fell 2.8 percent in the third quarter compared with the same period last year, while manufacturing activity fell by 8 percent. Construction fell 12.9 percent year-over-year. 

INDEC revised its GDP figures for the first and second quarters to contractions of 0.8 percent and 1.9 percent, respectively, compared with 0.5 percent and 2.1 percent previously.

1042,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 22, 2016 03:26PM ET</span>",U.S. consumer spending slows; business investment perking up,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. consumer spending increased modestly in November as household income failed to rise for the first time in nine months, suggesting the economy slowed in the fourth quarter after growing briskly in the prior period.
The economy, however, remains on solid footing as other data on Thursday showed new orders for capital goods rising last month amid demand for machinery, indicating that some of the oil-related drag on business spending was fading.
And while the number of Americans applying for unemployment aid hit a six-month high last week, it remained below a level that is associated with labor market strength. The slowdown in growth is likely to be temporary given the strong economic foundation that could be bolstered by President-elect Donald Trump's plan to slash taxes and boost infrastructure spending.
""The fourth quarter is coming in soft. The economy is going to end the year on a disappointing note, but we should see growth accelerate in the first half of 2017,"" said Ryan Sweet, a senior economist at Moody's Analytics in West Chester, Pennsylvania.
The Commerce Department said consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, rose 0.2 percent after increasing 0.4 percent in October. When adjusted for inflation, consumer spending edged up 0.1 percent last month after a similar gain in October. 
The moderation in consumer spending is, however, likely to be a blip. The labor market is near full employment, house prices are rising and the stock market has rallied close to record highs. In addition, consumer confidence is at the highest level since July 2007.
In another report on Thursday, the Commerce Department said the economy grew at a 3.5 percent clip in the third quarter instead of the previously reported 3.2 percent pace. That was the strongest growth rate since the third quarter of 2014 and followed the second quarter's anemic 1.4 percent pace. 
The upward revision reflected stronger growth in consumer spending, business investment in structures and intellectual property products than previously estimated, underscoring the economy's solid fundamentals, which contributed to the Federal Reserve raising interest rates last week.
The U.S. central bank lifted its benchmark overnight interest rate by 25 basis points to a range of 0.50 percent to 0.75 percent, also encouraged by a sturdy labor market. The Fed anticipates three rate hikes in 2017.
The Atlanta Fed is forecasting GDP rising at a 2.5 percent rate in the fourth quarter.
The dollar was flat against a basket of currencies as traders took profits from a recent rally that had hoisted the greenback to a 14-year high. Prices for U.S. government bonds and stocks on Wall Street were trading lower in late trade. 
INFLATION RETREATS 
While slower consumer spending last month held back inflation, economists said that was unlikely to worry Fed officials as they expected the tightening labor market and the incoming Trump administration's fiscal policy proposals to drive up price pressures.
The personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index, excluding food and energy, was unchanged after edging up 0.1 percent in October. That lowered the year-on-year increase in the core PCE price index to 1.6 percent. 
The core PCE index increased 1.8 percent in October, which was the biggest gain since July 2014. The core PCE is the Federal Reserve's preferred inflation measure and is running below its 2 percent target.
""We think that the trend will keep firming over time, in part because we expect the labor market to continue to tighten,"" said Daniel Silver, an economist at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) in New York.
Personal income was flat last month as wages and salaries fell 0.1 percent. Income increased 0.5 percent in October. With consumer spending outpacing incomes, savings fell to their lowest level since May 2015.
While consumer spending might be cooling, business investment is perking up after a prolonged slump. 
In a third report, the Commerce Department said non-defense capital goods orders excluding aircraft, a closely watched proxy for business spending plans, increased 0.9 percent after gaining 0.2 percent in October. 
A collapse in oil prices last year, together with a surge in the dollar, weighed on business spending on equipment, which has contracted for four consecutive quarters. Oil prices now are hovering above $50 per barrel, leading to gas and oil well drilling rising over the last several months.
Trump's perceived business-friendly policies, which also include removing some regulations, are expected to boost investment next year. But renewed dollar strength in the wake of the business mogul's Nov. 8 election victory could limit gains.
""Some businesses may have delayed investments as they awaited the outcome of the presidential election. These factors argue for a pickup in business investment,"" said Andrew Hollenhorst, an economist at  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) in New York. ""On the other hand, some businesses may now delay investments as they wait for further clarity regarding tax policy.""
A fourth report from the Labor Department showed initial claims for state unemployment benefits increased 21,000 to a seasonally adjusted 275,000 for the week ended Dec. 17, the highest since June.

Despite the increase, it was the 94th straight week that claims were below 300,000, a threshold associated with a healthy labor market. That is the longest stretch since 1970, when the labor market was much smaller.

WardsAuto, a publication and industry consultant, said sales for December will fall about 0.46 percent from a year earlier, at 1.625 million vehicles.
The forecast would bring a new annual sales record of about 17.41 million vehicles, beating 2015's mark of 17.39 million vehicles reported by WardsAuto.
Automakers report December U.S. sales on Jan. 3.
Auto sales are an early snapshot of U.S. consumer spending. Earlier on Thursday, the U.S. Commerce Department reported that consumer spending increased modestly in November as household incomes failed to rise for the first time in nine months, suggesting economic growth slowed in the fourth quarter.
Also earlier Thursday, auto industry consultancies J.D. Power and LMC Automotive forecast that December U.S. auto sales would fall about 2 percent, and that 2017 sales would be robust at between 17.4 million to 17.5 million.
LMC Automotive and J.D. Power agreed with WardsAuto that 2016 will narrowly top last year's record high, but said it will be the seventh and final year of growth since the 2008-2009 recession. LMC and J.D. Power said 2017 sales would remain strong but fall a fraction of a percentage point from this year. 

Each of the three biggest U.S. automakers, General Motors Co (N:GM),  Ford Motor Co  (N:F) and  Fiat  Chrysler Automobiles (MI:FCHA) (N:FCAU) recently announced production cuts for light-selling vehicles, mainly sedans. Consumers have shifted toward SUVs and pickup trucks and away from sedans at a greater rate than the automakers had planned.

1044,By Investing.com,"<span>Dec 22, 2016 02:28PM ET</span>",U.S. economy grew at 3.5% pace in third quarter,"Investing.com - The U.S. economy grew at a 3.5% rate during the third quarter, the fastest pace in two years. But the U.S. economy, overall, is expected to finish 2016 with one of its worst performances since the Great Depression. 
The growth was powered strength in consumer spending, business investment and the government sector, the Department of Commerce said Thursday. The government had previously estimated last quarter’s annual growth rate at 3.2%.
The data indicates the American consumer is healthy, emboldened by ongoing gains in employment, increases in wages, and solid balance sheets at the office. 
The economy’s growth during last quarter marked a dramatic increase from the sluggish annual growth of 0.8% in the first quarter and 1.4% during the second. Still, growth is expected to slow to a roughly 1.5% annual rate in the October-December quarter.
Growth for the entire year of 2016 is poised report at 1.5%, a decline from 2.6% in 2015 and, overall, the weakest performance since the economy shrank 2.8% in 2009 at the bottom of the worst economic downturn since the 1930s, under the leadership of President Obama.
Obama's $1 trillion stimulus package, passed by the Congress immediately upon his installation as president, failed to revive the U.S. economy, and his green regulatory agenda is said to have hamstrung manufacturing during the last eight years. "

Power and LMC Automotive said on Thursday in a forecast that highlights the pressure on Detroit automakers.
While U.S. auto sales for all of 2016 could eke out a record, Power and LMC forecast manufacturers' discounts offered to close sales would hit a record high of more than $4,000 per vehicle in December. The consultancies estimated sales at 17.5 million vehicles on a seasonally adjusted annualized basis this month, flat with a year ago.
Detroit automakers are moving to cut production of certain vehicles, particularly small and mid-sized sedans, as they concede that the market is hitting a plateau where the cost of pushing additional sales in of certain cars outweighs the potential profit. 
General Motors Co (N:GM) plans to lay off 3,300 workers indefinitely at three U.S. car factories. 
 Ford Motor Co  (N:F) and  Fiat  Chrysler Automobiles NV (MI:FCHA) (N:FCAU) have ordered temporary cutbacks at several factories. Fiat will extend a Christmas shutdown by one week at the Windsor, Ontario, plant that builds its new Pacifica minivan and at a Brampton, Ontario, factory that assembles Chrysler 300 and Dodge Challenger sedans.
The speed that U.S. consumers, emboldened by cheap gasoline, have turned their backs on small cars to embrace larger sport utility vehicles and pickups has caught Detroit automakers flatfooted. 
Light trucks, including SUVs, have surged to 59 percent of the total U.S. light vehicle market for the first 11 months of 2016, compared with 52 percent in the comparable 2014 period. That tilt has forced cutbacks at factories dedicated solely to car production when oil prices were high, such as GM's Lordstown, Ohio, plant, which will lay off workers on its third production shift next month.
How close automakers come to beating a full-year sales record will depend on both consumer demand and the companies' decisions on how many vehicles they sell to rental car fleets.
In 2015, U.S. sales totaled 17.39 million vehicles, according to WardsAuto, and 17.47 million, according to Autodata. The two consultancies differ on the number of large trucks they include in the ""light vehicle"" sales figures they report.

In a separate forecast, TrueCar Inc's (O:TRUE) ALG automotive consultancy said December sales would fall 2.6 percent to a seasonally adjusted annualized rate of 17.41 million vehicles.

The Commerce Department said on Thursday that consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, rose 0.2 percent after an upwardly revised 0.4 percent increase in October.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast consumer spending advancing 0.3 percent last month. Spending in October was
previously reported to have risen 0.3 percent. 
When adjusted for inflation, consumer spending edged up 0.1 percent last month after a similar gain in October. 
That suggests some cooling in consumer spending in the fourth quarter after it increased at a 3.0 percent annualized rate in the July-September period. 
But the moderation in consumer spending is likely to be temporary against the backdrop of a labor market that is near full employment and consumer confidence that is at cycle highs.
Still, last month's modest gain in consumer spending came on the heels of weak industrial production and housing starts in
November. That implies gross domestic product estimates for the fourth quarter, currently around a 2.6 percent rate, could be trimmed.
The Commerce Department reported earlier on Thursday that the economy grew at a 3.5 percent rate in the third quarter. 
Slower spending last month held back inflation. The personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index was unchanged after rising 0.3 percent in October. In the 12 months through November the PCE price index rose 1.4 percent after increasing by the
same margin in October.
Excluding food and energy, the so-called core PCE price index was also unchanged after edging up 0.1 percent in October. That lowered the year-on-year increase in the core PCE price index to 1.6 percent, the smallest gain since July. The core PCE index increased 1.8 percent in October, which was the biggest increase since July 2014.
The core PCE is the Federal Reserve's preferred inflation measure and is running below its 2 percent target. 
Overall consumer spending last month was restrained by a 0.6 percent drop in purchases of long-lasting manufactured goods such as automobiles. Spending on services rose 0.3 percent. 
Personal income was flat last month after increasing 0.5 percent in October. Wages and salaries fell 0.1 percent.
Savings fell to $780.9 billion, the lowest level since May 2015, from $809.1 billion in October.

Gross domestic product increased at a 3.5 percent annual rate instead of the previously reported 3.2 percent pace, the Commerce Department said in its third GDP estimate on Thursday.
Growth was the strongest since the third quarter of 2014 and followed the second quarter's anemic 1.4 percent pace. 
Output was also lifted by upward revisions to business investment in structures and intellectual property products, underscoring the economy's solid fundamentals, which contributed to the Federal Reserve raising interest rates last week.
Economists polled by Reuters had expected that third-quarter GDP growth would be revised up to a 3.3 percent rate.
When measured from the income side, the economy grew at a 4.8 percent pace, instead of the previously reported 5.2 percent
clip. That was the fastest pace of increase in gross domestic income since the second quarter of 2014 and followed a 0.7 percent rate of increase in the second quarter. 
Consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, increased at a 3.0 percent rate in the third quarter and not the 2.8 percent pace reported last month. That was still a slowdown from the second quarter's
robust 4.3 percent pace.
Spending on nonresidential structures, which include oil and gas wells, increased at a 12.0 percent rate, the fastest pace since the first quarter of 2014. Nonresidential outlays were previously reported to have increased at a 10.1 percent pace.
The export growth estimate was revised a touch lower to a 10.0 percent rate from the previously reported 10.1 percent pace. It was the fastest pace since the fourth quarter of 2013.
The spike in exports largely reflected a surge in soybean exports after a poor soy harvest in Argentina and Brazil. 
Businesses accumulated inventories at a $7.1 billion rate in the last quarter, rather than the $7.6 billion pace reported last month.

The Commerce Department said gross domestic product grew at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 3.5% in the three months ended September 30, up from a previous estimate of 3.2% and above expectations for a reading of 3.3%.
Preliminary data initially pegged U.S. growth at 2.9% in the third quarter. The U.S. economy grew 1.4% in the second quarter.
The report showed personal consumption rose 3.0% in the third quarter, above forecasts for 2.8% and up from an initial estimate of 2.7%. Consumer spending typically accounts for nearly 70% of U.S. economic growth.

LONDON (Reuters) - British consumers are downbeat about the economy's prospects next year, when higher inflation is likely to erode their spending power, a major survey showed on Thursday, despite signs that growth has remained robust since June's Brexit vote.
A big jump in households' appetite to make major purchases helped market research company GfK's monthly consumer sentiment index inch up to -7 in December from -8 in November, but this concealed a deterioration in consumers' outlook for 2017.
Expectations for the year to come are now the weakest since just after June's vote to leave the European Union, and before that they were last lower in April 2013, when the economy had suffered a period of sluggish growth.
""Confidence in the general economic situation for the UK has collapsed in the face of uncertainty about the future both at home and abroad,"" GfK analyst Joe Staton said.
GfK did not give a reason for the big jump in households' willingness to make major purchases, although on Wednesday the Bank of England said it had heard anecdotal evidence that consumers were bringing forward big purchases in anticipation of price rises in 2017.
Consumer spending has been robust this year, and earlier this week the Confederation of British Industry said its members reported the fastest retail sales growth in over a year in recent weeks.
Sterling has fallen more than 10 percent against the dollar since June's vote, and while some retailers have raised prices already, others are expected to wait until after the highly competitive holiday season.
Meanwhile wages look unlikely to keep pace with inflation, which the BoE forecasts will rise to 2.7 percent within a year from 1.2 percent now, according to pay data company XpertHR. 
Average pay rises at large companies in the three months to November stood at 1.6 percent compared with 1.5 percent in the three months to October.
""Employers have acted with caution over the past year when it comes to rewarding employees, and we expect this to continue when pay bargaining gets into full swing again in the New Year,"" XpertHR said.
Prime Minister Theresa May also plans to start two years of formal talks to leave the EU early next year, which GfK said was likely to weigh further consumer sentiment.
""Against a backdrop of Brexit negotiations ... and the prospect of higher inflation impacting purchasing power, we forecast that confidence will be tested,"" said GfK'S Staton.
Households' downbeat outlook contrasts with a more buoyant mood among British business.
The largest proportion of firms in a year reported higher output in the three months to December, and businesses see a broadly similar outlook for the next three months, the CBI said.
Separate figures from Britain's automotive industry showed car production heading for its best year since 1999.

Firms selling direct to British households were an exception to the upbeat mood, however, and the CBI predicts overall growth will slow to 1.3 percent next year from about 2 percent in 2016.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. home resales unexpectedly rose in November, reaching their highest level in nearly 10 years, likely as buyers rushed into the market to lock in mortgage rates in anticipation of further increases in borrowing costs.
The third straight monthly increase in existing home sales, reported by the National Association of Realtors on Wednesday, suggested housing would contribute to economic growth in the fourth quarter after being a drag in the previous two quarters.
""The strength in home sales, if it holds, will provide a big boost for consumer spending in 2017 and makes us more confident about our outlook for stronger growth next year,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG Union Bank in New York.
Existing home sales increased 0.7 percent to an annual rate of 5.61 million units last month, the highest sales pace since February 2007. October's sales pace was revised down to 5.57 million units from the previously reported 5.60 million units.
Economists had forecast sales slipping 1.0 percent toa 5.50 million-unit pace in November. Sales were up 15.4 percent from a year ago. They rose in the Northeast and South, but fell in the Midwest and West last month. Mortgage rates have surged in the wake of Donald Trump's victory in the Nov. 8 presidential election. Trump's proposal to increase infrastructure spending and slash taxes is seen as inflationary. 
Since the election, the interest rate on a fixed 30-year mortgage has increased about 60 basis points to an average 4.16 percent, the highest level since October 2014, according to data from mortgage finance firm Freddie Mac.
Mortgage rates are expected to rise further after the Federal Reserve raised its benchmark overnight interest rate last week by 25 basis points to a range of 0.50 percent to 0.75 percent. The U.S. central bank forecast three rate hikes next year.
The prospect of higher mortgage rates could be pushing undecided buyers into the market. But the combination of higher borrowing costs and rising house prices, which are outstripping wage growth, could hurt home sales. 
House prices have been marching ahead amid a chronic shortage of properties for sale. The median house price was $234,900 last month, a 6.8 percent increase from a year ago. 
Economists, however, expect higher mortgage rates to have a minimal impact on home sales as the labor market nears full employment and the economy strengthens.
'AT A CROSSROADS'
""This is a housing market at a crossroads,"" said Stephen Phillips, president of Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRKa) Home Services in California. 
""The higher mortgage rates we've seen since the election will likely slow activity and price increases, but faster income growth might more than offset that trend as we look toward next year's spring market.""
A separate report from the Mortgage Bankers Association on Wednesday showed applications for loans to buy a home increased 3 percent last week from the previous week.
The dollar (DXY) was trading lower against a basket of currencies after the data, while prices for U.S. government bonds rose. U.S. stocks were slightly weaker, with the Dow Jones industrial average (DJI) still hovering near the 20,000 mark.
The PHLX housing index (HGX) rose 0.30 percent as shares in the nation's largest homebuilder, D.R. Horton Inc (N:DHI), gained 0.32 percent.
Last month's increase in home resales means more brokers' commissions, which are included in the residential component of the gross domestic product report. 
The Atlanta Fed is forecasting GDP rising at a 2.6 percent annual rate in the fourth quarter. The economy grew at a 3.2 percent pace in the July-September period. 
Existing home sales remain constrained by a persistent shortage of properties available for sale. Last month, the number of unsold homes on the market fell 8.0 percent from October to 1.85 million units. 
Supply was down 9.3 percent from a year ago and has now declined for 18 straight months on a year-on-year basis. At November's sales pace, it would take 4.0 months to clear the stock of houses on the market, down from 4.3 months inOctober. A six-month supply is viewed as a healthy balance between supply and demand. 
Housing inventory could remain an obstacle, with a report last week showing a plunge in home construction in November. With supply tightening, house prices notched their 57th consecutive month of year-on-year gains in November. 
Rising house prices are increasing equity for homeowners and encouraging some to put their homes on the market, but making it more difficult for first-time buyers to purchase homes. 

First-time buyers accounted for 32 percent of transactions last month, well below the 40 percent share that economists and realtors say is needed for a robust housing market.

A flash estimate said euro zone consumer morale rose for a fourth consecutive month to -5.1 points, reaching its highest level since April 2015.
The figure beat market expectations of -6.0 points from economists polled by Reuters.
""This reinforces hopes that the euro zone will have seen some pick-up in (economic) ...growth in the fourth quarter and is set to see a decent start to 2017,"" said Howard Archer, economist at IHS Global Insight.
The 19-country currency bloc grew 0.3 percent in both the second and third quarters. 
In the European Union as a whole, consumer sentiment rose by 1.2 points to -4.6.

The Washington-based industry group said its measure for requests for mortgages rose in the week ended Dec. 16 to 407.3, up 2.5 percent from the prior week's 397.5, its lowest since 328.6 in the week ended Jan. 1.
The average rate on 30-year conforming loans with balances of $417,000 or less, which mortgage agencies  Fannie Mae  (PK:FNMA) and  Freddie Mac  (PK:FMCC) guarantee, jumped to 4.41 percent, the highest since May 2014, the MBA said.
The average 30-year conforming rate was 4.28 percent in the previous week.
Home borrowing costs have climbed as U.S. 10-year Treasury bond yields (US10YT=RR) surged - reaching their highest since September 2014 last week.
Traders have bet on faster economic growth and inflation if U.S. President-elect Donald Trump and the Republican-controlled Congress enact big tax cuts, boost federal spending as well as loosen regulations and shake up trade policies. 
The rise in U.S. bond yields accelerated after the Federal Reserve signaled a week ago it might raise interest rates at a faster pace due to an improving jobs market and signs that domestic inflation would reach its 2 percent goal.
Interest rates on other types of mortgages also rose on the week. 
The average 15-year mortgage rate hit 3.64 percent, its highest since January 2014, while the average five-year adjustable rate reached 3.45 percent, the highest since September 2013.
The MBA's seasonally adjusted refinancing index climbed 3.0 percent to 1449.4 last week from the prior week's 1,407.0, its lowest since the week of Jan. 8.

The group's seasonal gauge of applications to buy a home, seen as a proxy for future home sales, rose 2.7 percent to 232.9 last week.

The industry data showed that home resales rose 0.7% in November to a seasonally adjusted 5.61 million units from 5.57 million units in the previous month. October’s data was revised from an initial reading of 5.60 million units.
The consensus forecast was for a 1.0% decrease to 5.50 million units.
The data helps to gauge the strength of the U.S. housing market and is considered to be a key indicator of overall economic strength.
NAR indicated that a big surge in the Northeast and a smaller gain in the South pushed existing-home sales up in November for the third consecutive month.
November's sales pace is now the highest since February 2007 (5.79 million) and is 15.4% higher than a year ago (4.86 million).
""The healthiest job market since the Great Recession and the anticipation of some buyers to close on a home before mortgage rates accurately rose from their historically low level have combined to drive sales higher in recent months,"" NAR chief economist Lawrence Yun explained.
""Furthermore, it's no coincidence that home shoppers in the Northeast — where price growth has been tame all year — had the most success last month,"" he added.
The report showed that the median existing-home price for all housing types in November was $234,900, a 6.8% increase from the same month last year, marking the 57th consecutive annual increase in home prices.

LONDON (Reuters) - British companies' costs for materials and imports rose at the fastest pace in around five years in the during the past three months, which will boost inflation noticeably next year, a Bank of England survey showed on Wednesday.
Growth in both services and the manufacturing sector improved a little in the fourth quarter, helped by the strongest reading for factory exports since the third quarter of 2014, according to the BoE survey, which is based on the findings of its staff based across the United Kingdom.
The survey added to signs that Britain's economy has sustained a solid pace of growth through the last three months, with scant evidence of any hit to companies' day-to-day business from June's shock Brexit vote.
But it also highlighted growing worries about inflation since the pound's post-Brexit drop, as well as weak investment.
Prices paid for materials by companies rose at the fastest pace since the end of 2011, while import costs rose at the fastest pace since the start of 2012, the BoE report showed.
""The BoE agents' survey supports the view that the pound's devaluation will be passed through (to consumers) quicker. Brexit hedging was low and the shock is seen as persistent,"" said Philip Rush, chief economist of consultancy Heteronomics.
A separate survey from Citi and pollster YouGov showed expectations of inflation over the next five to 10 years among the British public rose this month to the highest level seen for a couple of years at 3.0 percent.
The BoE's agents' report pointed to anecdotal evidence that households had brought forward purchases of larger items such as furniture or electrical goods in anticipation of higher prices next year. 
Last month, the BoE said it expected inflation to reach 2.7 percent by the end of next year, up from 1.2 percent now.
The latest BoE agents' survey suggested sterling's weakness boosted manufacturing factory exports in the fourth quarter, which is at odds with the Markit/CIPS business surveys that are more closely watched by the market.
But the BoE noted that the increased cost of importing equipment had started to deter some firms from investing, although there were also examples of companies bringing forward investment ahead of expected price rises.
""Some customers had switched to domestic suppliers from foreign ones following the fall in sterling,"" the BoE said.
Economists expect rising inflation will squeeze household spending and slow growth next year, putting pressure on Britain's public finances.

Official figures on Wednesday showed a slightly bigger-than-expected budget deficit in November, but the government looked on track to meet new, less ambitious deficit reduction goals set out last month by finance minister Philip Hammond.

""Although recent announcements by the government on housing are very welcome, the ongoing shortfall of stock across much of the sales and lettings markets is set to continue to underpin prices and rents,"" said RICS chief economist Simon Rubinsohn.

Earlier this week mortgage lender Nationwide Building Society predicted house price growth of around 2 percent against a backdrop of a weaker economy.

Companies signed up for $6.4 billion in new loans, leases and lines of credit last month, the Washington-based trade group said on Tuesday. However, their borrowings were down 22 percent from October.
President-elect Donald Trump's proposals to spend more on infrastructure, simplify regulations and reform the tax code could boost U.S. economic performance, ELFA Chief Executive Ralph Petta said in a statement.
Credit approvals for all applications submitted in November was 76 percent, compared with 77.3 percent in October, said ELFA, which reports economic activity for the $1 trillion equipment financing sector.
The trade group's leasing and finance index measures the volume of commercial equipment financed in the United States. The index is designed to complement the U.S. Commerce Department's durable goods orders report.
ELFA's index is based on a survey of 25 members that include Bank of America Corp (N:BAC), BB&T Corp (N:BBT), CIT Group Inc (N:CIT) and the financing affiliates or subsidiaries of  Caterpillar  Inc (N:CAT), Deere & Co (N:DE),  Verizon Communications  Inc (N:VZ),  Siemens  AG (DE:SIEGn), Canon Inc (T:7751) and Volvo AB (ST:VOLVb).
The Equipment Leasing & Finance Foundation, ELFA's non-profit affiliate, said its confidence index rose sharply to 67.5 in December from 54.6 in November.

The index is an indicator of the outlook for the equipment finance market, with a reading of above 50 suggesting a positive outlook.

1092,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 20, 2016 08:38AM ET</span>","Defying sliding lira, Turkish central bank holds rates","By Daren Butler
ISTANBUL (Reuters) - Turkey's central bank kept interest rates on hold on Tuesday, defying predictions it would hike, as the sliding lira currency took a back seat to President Tayyip Erdogan's push for cheaper credit.
The currency has lost 17 percent of its value against the dollar this year, hit by investor concerns about a crackdown by authorities after a failed coup in July and by a resurgent dollar following Donald Trump's U.S. presidential election win.
Erdogan wants the central bank to reduce borrowing costs to help spur flagging economic growth. He has described himself as an ""enemy"" of high interest rates and railed at banks for what he views as overcharging for credit.
But investors want to see more aggressive rate hikes to prop up the lira, which faces further selling if the Federal Reserve continues to raise U.S. interest rates, pulling more money out of emerging markets and into dollar-denominated assets.
""In an environment, where the Fed is tightening and where regional and domestic politics are not in good shape, the decision is negative for (the lira) in the medium term,"" said Muammer Komurcuoglu, economist at Is Investment.
The bank kept its benchmark one-week repo rate unchanged at 8 percent. Thirteen of 18 economists in a Reuters poll had expected a rise in the repo rate. 
""Exchange rate movements due to recently heightened global uncertainty and the increase in oil prices pose upside risks on the inflation outlook,"" the central bank's monetary policy committee said in a statement.
""The aggregate demand developments restrain these effects.""
It said economic activity had shown a partial recovery for the final quarter after a deceleration in the third quarter and the recovery was expected to continue at a moderate pace.
The lira weakened on Monday after the Russian ambassador to Turkey was shot dead as he gave a speech in the capital Ankara but rebounded on Tuesday before the rate decision on relief that Moscow and Ankara had struck a unified tone after the attack.
After rates were left on hold, the lira  tumbled as far as 3.5440 against the dollar from 3.5095 beforehand.
""This is a central bank that's damned if it does and damned if it doesn’t because of the lack of credibility and ineffectiveness of monetary policy to address the multiple challenges confronting Turkey right now,"" said Nicholas Spiro, a partner with Lauressa Advisory in London.
The bank kept its overnight lending rate at 8.5 percent. Fifteen of the 18 economists had forecast a hike in the lending rate, which is the upper band of the bank's interest rate corridor.

The bank, which uses multiple interest rates to provide funding to the market, kept the lower band - the overnight borrowing rate - at 7.25 percent.

The BoJ will seeks to stabilize the 10-year government bond yield, the benchmark for long-term borrowing costs,around zero percent and keep the overnight interest rate around -0.1%. The goal is to correct the excessively flat yield curve caused by its negative interest rate policy that took effect in February.
The BoJ will also maintain its inflation-overshooting commitment, continuing monetary easing until inflation rises to 2% from slight drops now and becomes anchored around that level.
The nine-member board also slightly revised up its assessment of Japan's lukewarm economy, saying it ""has continued its moderate recovery trend."" It was the first upgrade since May 2015 in light of firmer indicators -- a pickup in exports and factory output as well as improving emerging economies.

Minutes of the Monetary Policy Meeting of the Reserve Bank Board
Sydney – 6 December 2016

Domestic Economic Conditions
Members commenced their discussion of the domestic economy by noting that the unemployment rate was unchanged at 5.6 per cent in October, somewhat more than ½ percentage point below its peak in mid 2015. Despite a rise in full-time employment in October, all of the growth in employment over 2016 had been in part-time employment, with an increased share of people in the labour force reporting that they would like to work more hours. Members discussed various measures of labour underutilisation, including those that account for the number of hours sought by the unemployed and the additional hours desired by those who are underemployed (and who are also recorded as actively searching for additional hours). Such hours-based measures of underutilisation had declined to a similar extent as the unemployment rate since late 2015 and, unlike the heads-based measure, had not increased recently.
Wage growth had remained low and continued to be lower than implied by the historical relationship with the unemployment rate. The wage price index (WPI) had increased by a little less than expected in the September quarter and year-ended growth in the WPI had eased a little further. Although there had been some evidence from enterprise agreements that growth in construction wages had picked up recently, these agreements covered a relatively small share of the total workforce.Members noted that the September quarter national accounts would be released the day after the meeting. Based on recent data, GDP growth was likely to be weaker than expected at the time of the November Statement on Monetary Policy and lower in year-ended terms than estimates of potential growth.
Consumption growth was expected to have remained below average in the September quarter. The volume of retail sales, which represent around one-third of total consumption, had been little changed in the quarter, pointing to continued weakness in growth of goods consumption. In contrast, in recent months, the value of retail sales had grown at an above-average pace and liaison with retailers suggested that trading conditions had remained steady. Households' perceptions of their personal finances had remained at above-average levels.
Members noted that the work done on residential construction had fallen in the September quarter, suggesting that the national accounts measure of dwelling investment was likely to have declined in the same period. Although residential building approvals had declined sharply in October, the significant amount of work in the pipeline suggested that the level of dwelling investment activity would remain high. Nevertheless, the contribution of dwelling investment to growth was expected to decline over the forecast period.
Overall, conditions in the established housing market had strengthened over recent months. Members noted, however, that supply and demand conditions had continued to vary across the country. In Sydney and Melbourne, housing price inflation had picked up and auction clearance rates were at high levels. Outside of Sydney, increases in prices of apartments had generally been smaller than increases in prices of detached houses. Investor housing loan approvals had picked up noticeably and credit growth had also increased a little over recent months, particularly in New South Wales. In contrast, housing market conditions had remained weak in Perth. Rental markets had been subdued overall and continued to be particularly weak in Perth.
Business investment looked to have been a little weaker than expected in the September quarter. The ABS capital expenditure survey and separate data on non-residential building work done had suggested that mining investment fell in the quarter. Further falls were anticipated, but the subtraction from GDP growth in 2016/17 was expected to be smaller than in 2015/16. Capital expenditure for the non-mining activity covered by the survey, which is less than half of the activity covered in the national accounts measure of non-mining business investment, was little changed over the year to September. Capital expenditure survey data on investment intentions continued to point to a decline in non-mining investment in 2016/17. Members also noted that, over the past few years, the national accounts had tended to report slightly stronger outcomes for non-mining business investment than implied by the data on capital expenditure intentions. Non-residential building approvals had increased in recent months, but the pipeline of non-residential construction work was low. Private sector survey measures of business conditions and non-mining capacity utilisation had been above their long-run averages, but had eased since earlier in the year.
Export volumes increased in the September quarter, led by service exports. Prices for a number of Australia's key commodities, including coking coal, iron ore and base metals, had increased noticeably over the June and September quarters, which had contributed to the increase in Australia's terms of trade of about 6 per cent over that period. Commodity prices had risen further over November, suggesting that an increase in the terms of trade in the December quarter was likely. Oil prices had increased over recent months, partly in response to announcements by OPEC about reductions to supply.
International Economic Conditions
Growth in GDP of Australia's major trading partners had picked up a bit over recent months, although growth remained a little below average. Members noted that there had been a general improvement in survey measures of global business conditions. They also noted that the downside risks to global inflation appeared to have diminished somewhat, in part because commodity prices had increased significantly over 2016 to date. Prospects for fiscal expansion in some countries had also contributed to expectations that inflation would increase. However, inflation had remained below most central banks' targets and monetary policies had continued to be accommodative.
Economic activity in China had continued to be supported by accommodative financial conditions and public spending, particularly on infrastructure. However, high and rising levels of debt remained a risk to the outlook over the longer term. Members observed that measures had been introduced to dampen housing price inflation in a number of cities and that this posed an additional risk that growth in housing market activity might be lower in the period ahead. Producer prices had increased over the preceding year, following declines over several years, and measures of consumer price inflation had edged higher.
In the United States, GDP growth had been around estimates of potential over the past year. While business investment had been weak, consumption growth had continued to be supported by strong labour market outcomes. Members noted that it was too early to know much about the effect of the outcome of the US Presidential election on the outlook for US economic activity and inflation, or the potential spillovers to other economies. There was uncertainty about the policy agenda of the incoming administration. A range of estimates suggested that the plans for fiscal policy could provide a boost to economic activity over the next few years and place some upward pressure on inflation. Working in the other direction, however, if policies were enacted to restrict trade, there could be significant adverse effects on the economic outlook in the United States and beyond.
Economic activity in the euro area had continued to recover. Members noted that some economies in the euro area were facing larger structural challenges than others. In Italy, the level of GDP remained lower than it had been prior to the global financial crisis, non-performing loans had remained at a high level and gross public debt was around 135 per cent of GDP.
Labour market conditions had continued to tighten in most advanced economies. In the United States, this had led to a modest pick-up in nominal wage growth, but unit labour costs had been rising at an above-average rate. Growth in wages and unit labour costs had also been above average in Japan. In the United States, core inflation had been only a little below the Federal Reserve's goal during 2016, while core inflation in Japan had moderated over the course of the year to date and inflation expectations had remained relatively low. In the euro area, inflation had remained lower than the target of the European Central Bank, but measures of longer-run inflation expectations had stabilised.
Financial Markets
Members commenced their discussion of financial markets by noting that there had been some large market movements following the outcome of the US Presidential election, but that movements had been generally orderly and the increase in volatility had been short-lived.
US Treasury yields had risen sharply following the outcome of the US Presidential election, reflecting the assessment in financial markets that the Trump administration's policies overall were likely to boost growth and inflation, although there was considerable uncertainty around this. Sovereign bond yields had also increased in the other major economies, though by less than in the United States. Members observed that the increase in US Treasury yields, while large, was not as large as some other movements in recent decades and yields remained very low by historical standards.
The US Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) left the policy rate unchanged at its November meeting. Members noted that markets had fully priced in an increase in the policy rate at the FOMC's December meeting and expected a steeper, although still gradual, path for future rate increases owing, in part, to the fiscal stimulus expected to be pursued by the Trump administration.
European sovereign bond spreads to German Bunds had widened ahead of the Italian referendum and upcoming elections in some other countries. There had been little movement in corporate bond spreads in the major economies in the previous month.Share market indices in the United States fell immediately following the outcome of the US Presidential election, but very quickly recovered to be higher over November as a whole. The sectoral pattern of movements across US stocks reflected the expected effects of the Trump administration's policies as well as higher oil prices. In Japan, the depreciation of the yen and better-than-expected growth had contributed to a rise in share prices. European share prices had declined slightly in November.
Emerging market bonds and equities were generally sold off following the outcome of the US Presidential election, reflecting market expectations of a possible increase in trade protection and increased US dollar debt-servicing costs for firms in emerging market economies, given higher US yields and exchange rate depreciations against the US dollar. The depreciation of the Mexican peso against the US dollar was particularly marked. Several emerging market central banks had intervened in the foreign exchange market. The US dollar had also appreciated against most advanced economy currencies. A notable exception was the appreciation of the UK pound against the US dollar during November.
The Chinese renminbi had appreciated on a trade-weighted basis over November, but had depreciated against the US dollar. Net private sector capital outflows had increased over the September quarter and the Chinese authorities had recently introduced a number of measures to increase scrutiny of capital outflows.
Members noted that the Australian dollar had depreciated by 2 per cent against the US dollar since the previous meeting but had appreciated against the yen and some other Asian currencies, to be little changed on a trade-weighted basis.
Australian government bond yields and share prices rose in November. As in other markets, resource stocks had outperformed the broader market, reflecting higher commodity prices, while high-dividend yielding stocks had fallen owing to higher bond yields. Australian banks' bond issuance was above average in November and strong in 2016 overall. Banks had issued more longer-term bonds in recent years in response to increased demand from investors searching for yield and the forthcoming introduction of new prudential requirements.
Members noted that banks' deposit rates had been little changed during November. While the cost of new bond issuance had increased, it remained below that seen at the start of 2016. Some banks had announced increases to advertised lending rates, mostly for housing and in particular to investors.Pricing in domestic financial markets indicated that market participants did not expect a reduction in the cash rate at the December meeting.
Considerations for Monetary Policy
In considering the stance of monetary policy, members discussed the policy decisions made throughout the easing phase since late 2011, during which the cash rate had been lowered in aggregate by 3¼ percentage points. The lower rates had helped support the economy in the transition following the mining investment boom and, more recently, had been in response to lower-than-expected inflation. Members discussed the effect of lower interest rates on asset prices and the decisions by households to borrow, particularly given the already high levels of household debt. Over recent years the Board had sought to balance the benefits of lower interest rates in supporting growth and achieving the inflation target with the potential risks to household balance sheets. Members recognised that this balance would need to be kept under review.
Turning to the policy decision for the December meeting, members noted that the international environment had been more positive in recent months, while observing that significant risks to the outlook for global activity persisted. The Chinese economy had remained resilient, supported by expansionary fiscal policy and rapid growth in financing. International financial markets had interpreted the outcome of the US election, specifically the implications for infrastructure spending, as being positive for growth and inflation in the United States. At the same time, there were increased expectations that the Federal Reserve would increase policy rates at the next meeting of the FOMC. Rising commodity prices had also contributed to an assessment that the outlook for global inflation was more balanced than it had been for some time, although inflation remained below most central banks' targets.
Domestically, data that had become available over the previous month indicated that GDP growth in the September quarter was likely to be lower than the forecast at the time of the November Statement on Monetary Policy. Year-ended growth was expected to decline before picking up to be above potential later in the forecast period, supported by low interest rates and the lower exchange rate since 2013. Members noted that these factors had assisted the economy in its transition following the mining investment boom and that an appreciating exchange rate could complicate the adjustment. Falls in mining investment were expected to subtract less from GDP growth over time and resource exports were expected to continue to make a substantial contribution to growth.
There was still considerable uncertainty about the momentum in the labour market. The unemployment rate had declined over the past year, as had measures of excess capacity that accounted for the number of additional desired hours of work. Part-time employment had grown strongly over the previous year, but employment growth overall had slowed. Members noted that there was expected to be excess capacity in the labour market for some time, which was consistent with further indications of subdued labour cost pressures. This suggested that inflation would remain low for some time before returning to more normal levels.
Housing market conditions had strengthened overall over preceding months, although there was considerable variation across the country and between houses and apartments. Housing credit growth had picked up a little, particularly for investors. The supervisory measures that had strengthened lending standards in the housing market had led some lenders to take a more cautious attitude to lending in certain segments. At the same time, the increase in global bond yields had led some lenders to increase their rates on fixed-interest rate loans.
Taking into account the information that had become available over the previous month, and having eased monetary policy earlier in the year, the Board judged that holding the stance of policy unchanged would be consistent with sustainable growth in the economy and achieving the inflation target over time.
The Decision
The Board decided to leave the cash rate unchanged at 1.5 per cent.

1101,By Investing.com,"<span>Dec 19, 2016 09:46AM ET</span>",U.S. services PMI unexpectedly falls in December - Markit,"Investing.com – Activity in the U.S. services sector unexpectedly fell in December, dampening optimism over the state of the U.S. economy, according to preliminary data released on Monday.
In a report, market research group Markit said that its flash services purchasing managers’ index (PMI) fell to 53.4 in December, from the prior month’s reading of 54.6.
Analysts had expected the reading to increase to 55.2.
On the index, a reading above 50.0 indicates expansion, below indicates contraction.
Services make up approximately 80% of the U.S. economy which makes the data key for interpreting growth.
Markit indicated in the report that despit the fact that business activity growth eased to a three-month low, there was a robust improvement in new work and job creation hit a nine-month high.
“Although service sector growth cooled in December, the PMI surveys indicate that the economy continued to show solid, steady growth at the end of the year,” Markit chief economist Chris Williamson said.
According to this expert, the data suggested fourth quarter growth in gross domestic product (GDP) of 2.0%, fueled mainly by improving domestic demand.
“With the new year bringing a change of government and a shift in emphasis towards fiscal stimulus, economic growth and the labor market look set to strengthen further in 2017,” Williamson added.
“We expect GDP growth to accelerate to a steady but unexciting 2.3% in 2017, accompanied by three further quarter point rate hikes by the Fed,” he concluded.
Following the report, EUR/USD traded at 1.0440 from 1.0428 prior to the release, GBP/USD was at 1.2385 from 1.2375 earlier, while USD/JPY was at 117.14 compared to 117.08 previously.
The US dollar index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six major rivals, was at 102.87, compared to 102.94 ahead of the report.
Meanwhile, U.S. stocks were trading higher after the open. The Dow 30 gained 34 points or 0.17%, the S&P 500 advanced 5 points, or 0.23%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite traded up 22 points or 0.41%.
Elsewhere, in the commodities market, gold futures traded at $1,140.05 a troy ounce, compared to $1,141.15 ahead of the data, while crude oil changed hands at $52.91 compared to $52.66 previously."

BERLIN (Reuters) - German business morale rose in December, hitting its highest level since February 2014, the Ifo economics institute said on Monday, while the Bundesbank said it was now expecting growth to have jumped this quarter.
Economists welcomed the upbeat Ifo business reading as a sign of economic resilience in the face of uncertainties that are clouding the outlook for Germany, including Britain's decision to leave the European Union, unpredictable U.S. policy under president-elect Donald Trump, and financial concerns over Greece and Italy.
The Munich-based institute said its business climate index, based on a monthly survey of some 7,000 firms, rose to 111.0 after from 110.4 in November.
The December reading compared with a Reuters consensus forecast for a value of 110.7. 
""The German economy is making a strong finish to the year,"" Ifo chief Clemens Fuest said in a statement. He added that both the manufacturing and wholesaling indices rose and manufacturers were planning to ramp up production in the months ahead.
The upbeat reading came after Ifo said on Friday the German economy will rebound more strongly than previously expected in the fourth quarter and this growth momentum will carry through into 2017.
The Bundesbank said shortly after the Ifo survey release that German growth is expected to have accelerated significantly in the fourth quarter and inflation, depressed for years, may exceed 1 percent this month on the back of higher oil prices.
""The exceptionally large increase of new orders, combined with favorable corporate sentiment, is expected to stimulate industrial activity throughout the quarter,"" the Bundesbank said. ""Household consumption is also an important pillar of the economy, which is reflected in the sharp rise in retail sales in October.""
ING economist Carsten Brzeski said growth next year will be weaker than in 2016, as the three main economic drivers - construction, consumption and government spending - will lose momentum because interest rates are unlikely to drop further, inflation will edge up and the unemployment rate stagnate.
""Unfortunately, as with so many good things, the current positive growth cycle is also coming to an end. Gradually, not abruptly,"" he wrote in a note to clients.
He added: ""Real risks to the German outlook mainly seem to stem from the outside. The still unknown impact from President-elect Trump on trade and economic policies, the ongoing Brexit uncertainty and renewed political tensions in Europe due to several elections or a new flaring up of the Greek crisis are in our view the biggest risks for 2017.""
The economy has been sending mixed signals. 
A jump in industrial orders and upbeat sentiment surveys have indicated a rebound in the last three months of the year. Ifo's current business situation index reached its highest level since February 2012.
But exports and industrial output rose less than expected in October, tapering expectations for a strong rebound in the fourth quarter after the growth pace halved to 0.2 percent over the summer months.

Ifo's business climate index for wholesaling rose to its highest level in almost three years, reflecting the economy's shift to consumption for growth.

1106,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 19, 2016 05:46AM ET</span>","China’s moves to cool home-price spike kick in, but issues linger","BEIJING (Reuters) - China's home prices rose at a slower pace in November as government lending curbs took out some heat in major cities, but a supply shortage in some places and sizable inventories elsewhere underscored challenges policymakers face trying to stabilize a polarized market. 
Analysts say government tightening measures in recent months appeared to have dented speculative demand, a particularly welcome sign given underlying worries the overheated property market could crash and knock the economy hard.
New home prices increased 0.6 percent month-on-month in China's 70 major cities, slowing from October's 1.1 percent, according to Reuters calculations from data issued by the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) on Monday. 
""The slowdown is within our expectations. It showed the concerted efforts from the central government to local government have been quite effective in curbing prices,"" said Tang Li, a property analyst at investment bank NSBO.
Regulators have told banks to strengthen risk management around property loans. More restrictions on home purchases have been implemented to curb soaring prices.
The curbs seem to be working, with home sales and new property investment slowing significantly in November.
Despite the slowdown, however, market watchers are wary of a price rebound in the biggest cities due to a supply shortage that has fed persistently strong demand.
MORE CURBS FOR 2017?
Prices in first-tier cities such as Shenzhen, Shanghai and Beijing rose 27.9 percent, 29.0 percent and 26.4 percent, respectively, from a year earlier, but their monthly pace slowed significantly. 
""It's likely there could be a rebound in first-tier cities and some second-tier cities in a few months,"" Tang said. 
A surging real estate market has been a major driver of economic growth this year, which the government said has been running at 6.7 percent, only fractionally below the 2015 level.
But policymakers have become concerned that a property frenzy will fuel price bubbles, and market watchers say messages from a top economic work conference now under way hinted that current property curbs would continue or even intensify in 2017.
""What they are doing now is to squeeze as much bubble as possible in order to support the real economy. I think the consensus that they [policymakers] reached this time is that the previous destocking policy was ineffective,"" NSBO's Tang said. 
Destocking was a top 2016 priority for the property market. However, the combination of record bank lending and relaxed housing policies has led to unexpected property overheating this year, while smaller cities still struggled with a large glut of homes.
NEW POLICY TONE
Top leaders said last Friday that curbing property speculation would be the new property policy tone for the year ahead, signaling a shift in policy focus. 
NSBO's Tang said current curbs targeted at China's biggest cities would be kept in place for all of 2017.
""Chances are slim that the biggest cities would relax the curbs in 2017, because property restrictions are consistent with their policies on curbing population inflow,"" Tang said.
But Zhang Dawei, a Beijing-based senior analyst at property agency Centaline, estimated current curbs should last about six to nine more months before the economy risks losing steam in the third quarter of 2017.
Analysts are already expecting the property sector to be a drag on growth next year. The challenge for policymakers will be to ensure home ownership remains attractive even as they put in place curbs to temper a speculative rally. 

China's economy will grow at around 6.5 percent year-on-year in 2017, from an expected 6.6-6.8 percent this year, government think tank China Academy of Social Sciences (CASS) said on Monday.

In a report, the German research institute, Ifo said its Business Climate Index  rose to a seasonally adjusted 111.0 this month from a reading of 110.4 in November, above forecasts for 110.7.
The Current Assessment Index increased to 116.6 in December from 115.6 a month earlier and beating expectations for 115.9.
The Business Expectations Index, which measures attitudes toward business prospects over the next six months, inched up to 105.6 this month from 105.5, in line with expectations.
The monthly index is based on a survey of around 7,000 German firms in the manufacturing, construction, wholesale and retail sectors.

1109,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 18, 2016 08:30PM ET</span>",Half of employers see UK's allure fading with Brexit: CBI survey,"LONDON (Reuters) - Half of British employers think the country's attractiveness as a place to invest and hire will diminish over the next five years as it leaves the European Union, an annual business survey showed on Monday.
The Confederation of British Industry (CBI) and recruitment agency Pertemps Network Group said there was scant sign that uncertainty around Brexit had hurt companies' hiring plans for next year or plans for pay increases.
But worries about the longer-term outlook escalated sharply.
Some 50 percent of companies thought Britain would end up a less attractive or much less attractive place to do business in five years' time - double the proportion in last year's survey.
Twenty-nine percent thought Britain's allure for businesses would increase.
Britain's labor market has been resilient to the shock of June's vote to leave the EU, but the Bank of England expects unemployment to rise next year as growth slows. 
""However, this year's survey does show a greater sense of concern about the UK's long-term attractiveness as a place to create jobs,"" CBI deputy director-general Josh Hardie said.
Worries about access to highly skilled migrants topped the list of threats to Britain's labor market competitiveness in the next five years, jointly with long-running complaints about skill shortages.
In last year's survey, access to migrants ranked fifth in this list.
Last week, finance minister Philip Hammond said he could not conceive of a situation in which Britain would choke off the supply of highly skilled and highly paid workers, though it is unclear if all his colleagues share that view.
Fifty-seven percent of firms said they planned to increase pay by at least the rate of retail price inflation (RPI) in their next pay review, up from 51 percent last year.
RPI rose to 2.2 percent in November and looks likely to head much higher next year, as the pound's drop since June's Brexit vote pushes up the cost of imports.
Other surveys, such as one from the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development, show little sign that companies are likely to ramp up wage settlements.
The CBI report showed more than a quarter of companies raised prices after the introduction of a new higher minimum wage in April, and would continue to do so as the minimum wage rises in coming years.
By contrast, 41 percent said they had absorbed the cost of the higher minimum wage.

The survey of 353 companies took place between August and October.

1110,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 18, 2016 07:43PM ET</span>","Japan November exports beat expectations as yen tumbles, volumes rise","By Stanley White
TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's export performance improved strongly in November as rapid decline in the yen and a recovery in overseas demand boosted shipments from the trade sector, handily beating economists' expectations. 
Ministry of Finance (MOF) data showed on Monday that exports fell 0.4 percent in the year to November. That compares with the 2.0 percent annual decline expected by economists in a Reuters poll, and follows a 10.3 percent decline in the year to October.
The value of exports to China, Japan's largest trading partner, rose an annual 4.4 percent, the first increase in nine months due to higher shipments of car parts.
In terms of volume, exports in November rose 7.4 percent from a year ago, more than a 1.4 percent annual decline in the previous month in a sign that external demand is picking up.
The data is likely to offer encouragement to the Bank of Japan, which is leaning toward upgrading its economic outlook at a meeting ending Dec. 20 because officials are becoming increasingly confident that global trade is emerging from the doldrums, four sources said.
""The weak yen helped a lot, but volumes show there is a genuine recovery in exports,"" said Shuji Tonouchi, a senior market economist at Mitsubishi UFJ  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) Securities.
""There could be a slight moderation in exports after the year-end shopping season. However, the BOJ will view this data in a positive light.""
Exports fell in November at a slower pace, because the value of car and steel shipments declined less than the previous month, the data showed.
The yen  tumbled by 8.4 percent in November as expectations for U.S. interest rate hikes sparked a rally in the dollar, which pushed up the yen value of Japan's exports.
The yen has fallen further this month, and is now within distance of a 10-month low.
Exports to the United States, in terms of value, fell 1.8 percent year-on-year versus an 11.2 percent annual decline in October. An increase in car exports helped slow the overall decline in U.S.-bound exports, the data showed.
Imports fell an annual 8.8 percent versus the median estimate of a 12.6 percent fall as imports of pharmaceuticals, oil and liquefied natural gas fell.

The trade balance came to a surplus 152.5 billion yen ($1.29 billion), versus the median estimate for a 227.4 billion yen surplus.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. homebuilding fell more than expected in November, tumbling from a nine-year high as construction activity declined broadly, the latest sign of slower economic growth in the fourth quarter.
But the housing market remains on solid ground, with Friday's report from the Commerce Department showing permits for the future construction of single-family homes, the biggest segment of the market, rising to a nine-year high in November. 
""The economy won't be flying as high without new construction that leads to additional consumer purchases of furniture and appliances and cars. The economy has some risks to the downside,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG Union Bank in New York.
Groundbreaking on new housing projects dropped 18.7 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.09 million units, the Commerce Department said. Last month's percentage decline was the largest in nearly two years, and unwound the bulk of October's 27.3 percent surge.
Housing starts data are choppy month-to-month, with much of the volatility coming from the multi-family segment of the market. October's starts were revised up to a 1.34 million-unit rate, the highest since July 2007, from the previously reported 1.32 million rate. Economists had forecast housing starts slipping to a 1.23 million-unit rate last month.
The report came on the heels of data this month showing a widening in the trade deficit in October and weak retail sales and industrial production in November. The Atlanta Federal Reserve is forecasting GDP rising at a 2.4 percent annualized rate in the fourth quarter after increasing at a brisk 3.2 percent rate in the third quarter.
Residential construction has been a drag on economic growth since the second quarter, but economists expect it will contribute to GDP this quarter.
Despite the weak report, the PHLX housing index (HGX) rose 0.4 percent, tracking a broadly firmer U.S. stock market. Shares in the nation's largest homebuilder, D.R. Horton (N:DHI), gained 0.6 percent and  Lennar  Corp (N:LEN) advanced 0.3 percent.
U.S. Treasury debt prices rose marginally, while the dollar was little changed against a basket of currencies after scaling a 14-year high on Thursday.
PERMITS DATA UPBEAT
Starts fell in all four regions last month. October's surge in home building had widened the gap between permits and starts. With last month's drop in groundbreaking activity, building permits are now leading starts, which augurs well for the housing market.
Permits fell 4.7 percent in November to a 1.20 million-unit rate. They have remained above the 1.20 million-unit level for three straight months, the longest stretch since 2007. 
Single-family permits rose 0.5 percent last month to their highest level since November 2007. Building permits for multi-family units, however, dropped 13.0 percent.
""The trends in the single-family data still appear to be moving higher over time, which is a favorable signal regarding upcoming single-family construction activity,"" said Daniel Silver, an economist at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) in New York.
Economists expect housing to continue growing even with mortgage rates having jumped to their highest in more than two years following the election of Donald Trump as the next president. Trump has advocated for an expansionary fiscal policy, which could fan inflation pressures.
A survey on Thursday showed homebuilders' confidence in December hitting its highest level since July 2005, with builders anticipating strong sales. 
Since the Nov. 8 presidential election, the fixed 30-year mortgage rate has increased about 60 basis points to average 4.16 percent in the week ending Dec. 15, the highest since October 2014, according to data from mortgage finance firm Freddie Mac.
Mortgage rates could rise further after the Federal Reserve raised its benchmark overnight interest rate on Wednesday by 25 basis points to a range of 0.50 percent to 0.75 percent. The U.S. central bank forecast three rate hikes in 2017.
Last month, single-family home building fell 4.1 percent to an 828,000-unit pace after hitting a nine-year high in October.

Housing starts for the volatile multi-family segment tumbled 45.1 percent to a 262,000-unit pace.

""Our share will not fall, it may even increase,"" said Liu Hongkuan, an official with the National Development and Reform Commission, referring to FDI.
But the size of global foreign investment flows next year will depend on economic conditions, Liu told a briefing of foreign reporters.
Fan Wenjie, an official with the commerce ministry, said China's FDI in 2016 could match that of last year.
FDI in China rose 3.9 percent to 731.8 billion yuan ($105.53 billion) in the first 11 months of this year from a year earlier, while non-financial outbound direct investment jumped 55.3 percent to 1.07 trillion yuan, ministry data showed.
China will continue to open up its economy, improve its investment environment, and ease restrictions on foreign investors, including foreign equity holdings, officials said.
China has not changed its policies to allow repatriation of profits by foreign firms, the officials said, echoing earlier comments by the foreign exchange regulator.
Tighter rules on outbound capital flows have raised barriers for European and U.S. companies to get money out of the country, with one saying dividend payments had been affected, business lobbies for U.S. and E.U. firms said last week.

The Confederation of British Industry's monthly industrial orders balance improved to 0 in December from -3 in November, its highest level in 20 months. Economists polled by Reuters had expected a decline to -5.
Britain's economy has defied expectations of a sharp slowdown following June's vote to leave the European Union and forecasters, including those at the Bank of England, have raised their predictions for growth next year. 
""It’s good to see our manufacturers ending the year on a high note with growth in production the strongest since summer 2014 and total orders still robust,"" Rain Newton-Smith, the CBI's chief economist, said.
""But the weakness of sterling is pushing up the cost of imports, and our survey shows strong signs of this feeding through to higher factory gate prices,"" she said.

Eurostat said consumer prices in the 19 countries sharing the euro fell 0.1 percent month-on-month in November for a 0.6 percent year-on-year rise, an acceleration from the annual increases of 0.5 percent in October and 0.4 percent in September.
The European Central Bank wants to keep inflation below, but close to 2 percent and has been buying 80 billion euros ($83.6 billion)worth of government bonds a month to inject more cash into the banking system and induce higher lending to the economy to boost prices.
Volatile energy prices fell 0.2 percent on the month for a 1.1 percent year-on-year decline in November while also volatile unprocessed food costs rose 0.4 percent month-on-month for a 0.7 percent annual gain.
To gauge core inflation, the ECB looks at a measure of inflation without these volatile components, which showed prices easing 0.1 percent month-on-month for a 0.8 percent annual rise.
This is up from 0.7 percent year-on-year in October, but the same as in four previous months, which suggests that core inflation has not yet responded to the ECB's ultra-loose monetary policy.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Rising rents lifted underlying U.S. inflation in November, pointing to a steady build-up of price pressures in the economy that could support more interest rate increases from the Federal Reserve next year.
The prospects of further monetary policy tightening in 2017 were also bolstered by other data on Thursday showing a drop in the number of Americans filing for unemployment aid last week.
The Fed raised interest rates on Wednesday for the second time since the 2007-2009 financial crisis and forecast three rate hikes in 2017. In addition to rising oil prices and a tight job market, inflation is likely to get a boost from U.S. President-elect Donald Trump's proposed expansionary fiscal policy agenda.
""Inflation is moving in the right direction, all the conditions for stronger inflation are in place. I don't think the Fed is behind the curve. We expect the next rate increase in March,"" said Ryan Sweet, senior economist at Moody's Analytics in Westchester, Pennsylvania.
The Labor Department said its Consumer Price Index excluding volatile food and energy costs rose 0.2 percent last month after edging up 0.1 percent in October. Rents accounted for most of the increase in the so-called core CPI last month. 
The core CPI advanced 2.1 percent in the 12 months through November after a similar gain in October. The overall CPI rose 0.2 percent as gasoline price increases slowed and food costs remained soft. With oil prices hovering around $50 per barrel, gasoline prices are likely to push higher.
The overall CPI shot up 0.4 percent in October. In the 12 months through November, the CPI increased 1.7 percent, the biggest year-on-year gain since October 2014. It rose 1.6 percent in the year to October.
The Fed has a 2 percent inflation target and tracks an inflation measure which is currently at 1.7 percent. 
In raising its benchmark overnight interest rate by 25 basis points to a range of 0.50 percent to 0.75 percent, the U.S. central bank on Wednesday noted that inflation had increased since ""earlier this year"" and said it expected it to rise to its target ""over the next couple of years."" 
Fed Chair Janet Yellen said the rate hike was ""a vote of confidence in the economy."" 
The incoming Trump administration plans to boost infrastructure spending and cut taxes to foster a faster pace of economic growth. The fiscal stimulus, however, will come at a time when the economy is expected to be at full employment.
""Inflation is warming up and there will only be more price pressures if Trump and his advisors can pump up the volume on economic growth,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG Union Bank in New York. 
In a second report, the Labor Department said initial claims for state unemployment benefits fell 4,000 to a seasonally adjusted 254,000 for the week ended Dec. 10. It was the 93rd straight week that claims were below 300,000, a threshold associated with a healthy labor market. That is the longest stretch since 1970, when the labor market was much smaller.
The dollar (DXY) soared to a 14-year high against a basket of currencies as the data backed the Fed's hawkish stance. Prices for U.S. government bonds fell, with the yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note hitting more than a two-year high. Stocks on Wall Street were trading higher.
UPBEAT DATA
Other reports on Thursday also struck a positive note, with upbeat assessments on manufacturing and the housing market. 
The National Association of Home Builders/Wells Fargo Housing Market Index, a measure of homebuilder confidence, surged this month to its highest level since July 2005. Builders anticipated strong sales despite rising mortgage rates.
Separately, the New York Fed said factory activity expanded in New York State in December, driven by a surge in new orders. 
The Philadelphia Fed also reported a pickup in manufacturing in the mid-Atlantic region this month. Both regional Fed surveys showed manufacturers reporting they were paying higher prices for inputs. In New York State, factories were also increasing prices for their goods. 
Rising input costs and prices for manufactured goods should feed through to higher inflation over time.
Last month, gasoline prices rose 2.7 percent after jumping 7.0 percent in October. Housing continued its upward march in November, with rents increasing 0.3 percent last month. Owners' equivalent rent of primary residence also gained 0.3 percent after a similar rise in October.
There were increases in the prices of a range of other goods and services last month including used cars and trucks, which rose for the first time since February. The cost of motor vehicle insurance increased 1.0 percent.
But consumers got some relief. Food prices were unchanged for a fifth straight month and food consumed at home declined for a seventh consecutive month. While the cost of doctor visits increased 0.6 percent, prices for prescription medicine fell 0.6 percent and the cost of hospital services slipped 0.1 percent. 
Apparel prices also fell, reversing October's increase. Airline fares declined for a second straight month and prices for new motor vehicles were down.

In a report, market research group Markit said that its flash manufacturing purchasing managers’ index (PMI) rose as expected to 54.2 in December from the prior month’s final reading of 54.1.
On the index, a reading above 50.0 indicates expansion, below indicates contraction.
Markit highlighted that the stock of inputs accumulated at the fastest pace since the survey began in May 2007 and was accompanied by “robust rises in output, new orders and jobs”.
The research firm considered the data to show a “strong end to 2016 with business conditions improving at the fastest pace since March 2015.”
According to Markit chief economist Chris Williamson, the data put “the sector on the starting blocks ready for a further upturn as we move into 2017” and added that the goods producing sector looked on track for 2% to 2.5% growth in the fourth quarter.
“The combination of solid growth and rising price pressures adds to the likelihood of further Fed action in 2017, with three more quarter point hikes anticipated next year by IHS Markit,” Williamson concluded.
In an immediate reaction, EUR/USD was trading at 1.0441 from around 1.0438 ahead of the release of the data, GBP/USD was at 1.2490 from 1.2488 earlier, while USD/JPY was at 118.17, compared to the prior 118.08.
The US dollar index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six major rivals, was at 102.94, compared to 102.96 ahead of the report.

The Commerce Department said the current account deficit, which measures the flow of goods, services and investments into and out of the country, fell to $113.0 billion from a downwardly revised $118.3 billion the second quarter. 
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the current account deficit declining to $111.6 billion from a previously reported $119.9 billion shortfall.
The third-quarter current account deficit represented 2.4 percent of gross domestic product, down from 2.6 percent in the second quarter. The current account deficit has dropped from a record high of 6.3 percent of GDP in the fourth quarter of 2005 as rising domestic oil production and lower global oil prices keep the import bill in check.
Goods exports increased by $15.7 billion to $375.9 billion, boosted by soybean shipments.

In the third quarter, the surplus on primary income - which includes dividends - fell to $43.4 billion from $44.2 billion in the second quarter. The deficit on secondary income, worker remittances and grants increased to $39.9 billion from $37.7 billion in the second quarter.

The Labor Department said on Thursday its Consumer Price Index rose 0.2 percent last month as gasoline price increases slowed and food costs remained soft. The CPI advanced 0.4 percent in October.
In the 12 months through November, the CPI increased 1.7 percent, the biggest year-on-year gain since October 2014. The CPI rose 1.6 percent in the year to October.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the CPI rising 0.2 percent last month and climbing to 1.7 percent from a year ago.
The so-called core CPI, which strips out food and energy costs, rose 0.2 percent last month after edging up 0.1 percent in October. Rents accounted for most of the increase in the core CPI last month. Despite the increase, the year-on-year increase in the core CPI was unchanged at 2.1 percent.
The Fed on Wednesday raised its benchmark overnight interest rate by 25 basis points to a range of 0.50 percent to 0.75 percent, in what Chair Janet Yellen said was ""a vote of confidence in the economy.""
The U.S. central bank forecast three rate hikes in 2017 in anticipation of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump's expansionary fiscal policy agenda aimed at boosting growth through infrastructure spending and tax cuts.
The Fed has a 2 percent inflation target and tracks an inflation measure which is currently at 1.7 percent.
The central bank noted that inflation had increased since ""earlier this year"" and expected it to rise to its target ""over the next couple of years."" Trump's proposed fiscal policy would come when the economy is at full employment and fans inflation.
Last month, gasoline prices rose 2.7 percent after jumping 7.0 percent in October. Food prices were unchanged for a fifth straight month. Food consumed at home declined for a seventh consecutive month.
Within the core CPI basket, housing continued its upward march in November. Rents increased 0.3 percent last month, with owners' equivalent rent of primary residence also gaining 0.3 percent after a similar rise in October.
The cost of medical care services rose 0.2 percent after being unchanged for two straight months. The cost of doctor visits increased 0.6 percent, while prices for prescription medicine fell 0.6 percent. The cost of hospital services slipped 0.1 percent.

Core CPI increased at annualized rate of 2.1% in November, below the forecast for a gain of 2.2%. Annual core inflation rose 2.1% in October.
Core prices are viewed by the Federal Reserve (Fed) as a better gauge of longer-term inflationary pressure because they exclude the volatile food and energy categories. The central bank usually tries to aim for 2% core inflation or less.

LONDON, (Reuters) - Sterling's strong performance over the past month suggests inflation may overshoot the Bank of England's target by less than it forecast in November, the central bank said on Thursday.
BoE policymakers agreed unanimously to keep interest rates on hold at a record low 0.25 percent and left plans for government and corporate bond purchases unchanged after their December policy meeting, as economists polled by Reuters had expected.
Last month Bank policymakers dropped their plan for another interest rate cut and instead adopted a neutral stance for policy, after Britain's economy suffered much less immediate damage from June's Brexit vote than early data had suggested.
Sterling has appreciated by over 6 percent on a trade-weighted basis since the BoE's last set of forecasts published on Nov. 3.
""(This) would by itself point to less of an overshoot in inflation relative to the target in the medium term, though month-to-month volatility was to be expected as market participants' views on the United Kingdom's future relationship with the European Union continued to evolve,"" the BoE said.
On Wednesday the U.S. Federal Reserve raised its main interest rate by 0.25 percentage points to a target range of 0.5-0.75 percent, as expected, tightening policy for only the second time in a decade.
Some economists say the BoE would likely be following suit, were it not for uncertainty created by EU exit talks due to start early next year.
BoE policymakers said there had been little news over the last month about Britain's economy. The global economy had strengthened, but so too had the risks facing it.
""The global outlook has become more fragile, with risks in China, the euro area and some emerging markets, and an increase in policy uncertainty,"" the BoE said.
Expectations of looser fiscal policy after the election of Donald Trump as U.S. President had pushed up long-term bond yields, the BoE said.
British inflation hit its highest rate in more than two years last month, though at 1.2 percent it still remains below the BoE's 2 percent target. Average prices were pushed up by more expensive clothing and the impact of June's Brexit vote on the prices consumers paid for technology goods.
In October, inflation dipped to 0.9 percent, requiring BoE Governor Mark Carney to write a letter to finance minister Philip Hammond, which the BoE published on Thursday.
""The MPC remains committed, as always, to taking whatever action is needed to ensure that inflation expectations remain well anchored, and that inflation returns to the target in a sustainable fashion and over an appropriate horizon,"" Carney said.
Hammond said the government had ""absolute"" commitment to the central bank's operational independence and inflation targeting.
The BoE forecast last month that inflation would surge to about 2.7 percent by this time next year, as sterling's plunge after Britain's vote to leave the EU pushes up the cost of imports and squeezes living standards and household spending.
Sterling is currently down about 15 percent against the U.S. dollar and 8 percent against the euro since the June 23 referendum, making suppliers and retailers battle for profits as imported goods become more expensive.
Crude oil prices hit their highest since mid-2015 this week after OPEC members and some of their rivals reached the first deal since 2001 to jointly reduce output to tackle global oversupply and boost prices.
Business surveys suggest Britain's economy has continued to grow robustly going into 2017, and labor market data released on Wednesday was mostly strong, despite employment falling for the first time in over a year.
The BoE said on Thursday that it was possible that pay growth might respond more to higher inflation than it had done in the past now that unemployment was back to its pre-financial crisis lows.

Last month the BoE bumped up its forecast for economic growth in 2017 to 1.4 percent from 0.8 percent previously, though this would still be the weakest growth in five years and below a rate of 2.2 percent penciled in for 2016.
Carney has repeatedly said the BoE could tolerate some overshoot to its 2 percent inflation target, while warning that there are limits to this.
Last week he reiterated that higher inflation would squeeze household spending, a key driver of the economy, resulting in slower-than-average growth over the next few years."
1148,By Investing.com,"<span>Dec 15, 2016 07:06AM ET</span>","Bank of England holds, expects slightly lower inflation path","Investing.com - The Bank of England said on Thursday it was leaving interest rates on hold at record lows at the conclusion of its final monetary policy meeting of 2016.
The BoE said its nine member monetary policy committee was unanimous in the decision to keep interest rates at a record low of 0.25%.
Policymakers also voted 9-0 to keep the bank's bond-buying program target at £435 billion and to continue with its new plan to buy up to £10 billion of corporate bonds.
The bank expects inflation to rise to its 2% target within six months.
The appreciation in sterling and the increase in oil prices since the banks last meeting are expected to result a slightly lower path for inflation than envisaged in the November inflation report, the meeting minutes said.
The bank still feels inflation is likely to overshoot the target later in 2017 and through 2018.
The bank noted that there are limits to the extent to which above-target inflation can be tolerated.
Those limits depend on the cause of the inflation overshoot, the extent of second-round effects on domestic costs, the evolution of inflation expectations, and the scale of the shortfall in economic activity below potential the bank said.
Data on Tuesday showed that the rate of inflation in the UK jumped to a two-year high of 1.2% in November from a year earlier as the sharp fall in the pound since the vote to leave the European Union fed through into prices.

Markit's flash composite Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI), which tracks the manufacturing and services sectors that account for more than two-thirds of the economy, edged down to 54.8 in December from 55.0 in November.
That was in line with the consensus forecast in a Reuters poll and comfortably above the 50 mark that separates growth from contraction.
Together with a reading of 55.1 in October, the PMI data for the final three months of 2016 pointed to the strongest quarter since the second quarter of 2014, IHS Markit said.
The survey showed activity among manufacturers accelerated more strongly than expected to 55.5, a 35-month high, thanks to a rise in goods production, an uptick in new orders and as firms increased their stocks of purchases.
""Germany's manufacturing sector appears to be in particularly good health,"" said Philip Leake, an economist at IHS Markit.
""Encouragingly, goods producers look to be preparing for further sales in 2017 as stocks of purchases were built up for the first time since October 2014,"" Leake said.
While activity among services companies grew at its slowest rate since September and below the Reuters consensus forecast, firms remained optimistic, pointing to a further increase in activity in 2017.
Businesses are facing mounting cost pressures, however, as the weaker euro puts upward pressure on commodity prices. The rate of input-price inflation reaching its highest level in five and a half years.
The PMI survey added to other data suggesting company executives are shaking off the political uncertainty sparked by Britain's decision to leave the European Union and the election of Donald Trump as U.S. president.
Business morale remained buoyant in Germany in November, while German analysts and investors also stayed relatively upbeat about the economy's growth prospects.
IHS Markit Chief Economist Chris Williamson said the PMI data pointed to an acceleration of German growth to around 0.5 percent or higher in the fourth quarter. This would mark a sharp rebound after Germany's quarterly growth rate halved to 0.2 percent in the third quarter as exports weakened.

1163,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 14, 2016 10:19PM ET</span>",Full-time work makes a welcome comeback in Australia,"By Wayne Cole
SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australian employment proved surprisingly strong in November as full-time jobs made a comeback after a very tough year, a welcome counterweight to recent gloom over weak third-quarter growth.
Thursday's data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics showed employment rose a net 39,100 in November, handily outpacing forecasts of a 20,000 gain. October's report was also revised upward to show an increase of 15,200.
The unemployment rate did tick up to 5.7 percent, from a three-year low of 5.6 percent, but only because more people went looking for work.
Crucially, full-time jobs bounced by 39,300 and brought the gains since September to over 84,000, almost recovering all the losses suffered since January.
""Suddenly the trend for full-time employment looks to be improving relative to part-time employment,"" said Shane Oliver, head of economics at AMP Capital. ""The figures look a bit stronger than previously thought.""
The prevalence of part-time work over full-time has been a feature of the labor market this year and one not welcomed by the government since it crimps both incomes and tax revenue.
That will be a much-needed tonic for Treasurer Scott Morrison who has to hand down the government's mid-year budget review next week and faces the threat of a credit downgrade if his path to a surplus is not seen as credible.
S&P Global has repeatedly warned it could cut Australia's prized AAA rating if the budget outlook continues to slip, a real risk given the economy shrank by 0.5 percent in the third quarter for the first contraction since 2011.
The better jobs data also helped steady the local currency around $0.7420 <AUD=D4>, after a hike in U.S. interest rates lifted its U.S. counterpart across the board.
The futures market <0#YIB:> slightly pared back the chance of a cut in interest rates from the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA), though the probability had already been under 20 percent.
There were even some tentative signs of a jobs turnaround in the states of Western Australia and Queensland, which have been particularly hard hit by a long slump in mining investment.
All the losses in full-time jobs up to October had been concentrated in those two states, but November saw an increase of 25,300 in Queensland and 11,100 in Western Australia.
The outlook for miners has brightened in recent months as prices for key commodities rallied sharply. Just this week coking coal contract prices for the first quarter of 2017 were set at $285 a ton, the highest since late 2011 and up from $81 at the start of this year.
The RBA estimates the rundown in mining investment is now more than 80 percent complete, a point emphasized by Governor Philip Lowe in a speech last month.

1164,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 14, 2016 07:50PM ET</span>",Japan December flash PMI shows factory activity growth fastest in 11 months,"TOKYO, Dec 15 (Reuters) - Japanese manufacturing activity grew at the fastest pace in almost a year in December as new orders improved in a sign that domestic demand is gathering strength, a survey showed on Thursday.
The Flash Markit/Nikkei Japan Manufacturing Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) for December rose to a seasonally adjusted 51.9 from a final 51.3 in November.
The index remained above the 50 threshold that separates expansion from contraction for the fourth consecutive month and showed activity expanded at the fastest pace since January.
""Latest survey data pointed to a further improvement in the Japanese manufacturing sector,"" said Amy Brownbill, economist at IHS Markit, which compiles the survey. ""Output and new orders both increased at sharper rates, with new work inflows rising at the quickest pace since January.""
The index for new orders, which measures both domestic and external demand, rose to a preliminary 52.8 from 51.1 in the previous month, also the highest in 11 months.
However, the flash index for new export orders eased slightly to 51.7 from 51.9 in the previous month.
Sentiment among large manufacturers hit a one-year high in December as a weak yen brightened the outlook for exports, the Bank of Japan's closely-watched tankan business sentiment survey showed on Wednesday.
Companies also maintained upbeat capital expenditure plans in the tankan survey, suggesting the economy will pick up pace next year.

1167,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 14, 2016 04:31PM ET</span>","U.S. retail sales, industrial output data point to slowing growth","By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. retail sales barely rose in November and industrial production recorded its biggest drop in eight months, suggesting some loss of momentum in economic growth in the fourth quarter.
The weak retail sales and industrial output readings reported on Wednesday did not deter the Federal Reserve from raising interest rates 25 basis points to between 0.50 percent and 0.75 percent. The Fed signaled a faster pace of increases in 2017, against the backdrop of steadily rising inflation and a tightening labor market.
Other data showed producer prices notching their largest increase in five months in November amid a jump in the cost of services. The moderation in retail sales came after two straight months of strong gains. With incomes rising, household wealth at record highs and robust consumer sentiment, the cool-off in retail sales is likely to be temporary.
""Consumer spending remains the main engine of growth for the economy,"" said Harm Bandholz, chief U.S. economist at UniCredit Research in New York. ""Solid employment growth and accelerating wage gains will continue to support household spending. This dynamic allowed the Fed to raise rates today and gave them confidence to signal further rate hikes next year."" 
Retail sales edged up 0.1 percent last month as households cut back on motor vehicle purchases after rising 0.6 percent in October, the Commerce Department said. Sales were up 3.8 percent from a year ago. Excluding automobiles, gasoline, building materials and food services, retail sales also nudged up 0.1 percent last month after gaining 0.6 percent in October.
These so-called core retail sales correspond most closely with the consumer spending component of gross domestic
product. Economists had forecast overall retail sales increasing 0.3 percent and core sales also gaining 0.3 percent last month.
In another report, the Fed said industrial production
fell 0.4 percent last month, pulled down by a 4.4 percent drop in utilities output as warmer-than-normal temperatures cut demand for heating. The drop in industrial production was the largest since March. 
Manufacturing production slipped 0.1 percent, held back by a 2.3 percent drop in motor vehicle output. Excluding autos, manufacturing output rose 0.2 percent. Mining production surged 1.1 percent amid rising oil and gas well drilling as the drag from last year's collapse in oil prices fades.
Nevertheless, the soft retail sales and industrial production, together with a another report from the Commerce Department showing business inventories recording their biggest drop in 11 months in October, implied the economy was slowing in the fourth quarter after growing at a brisk 3.2 percent annualized rate in the July-September period.
The Atlanta Fed trimmed its fourth-quarter GDP growth estimate by two-tenths of a percentage to a 2.4 percent rate after the data. 
The dollar reversed losses against a basket of currencies, rallying to a near 14-year high after the Fed suggested it would raise borrowing costs three times next year. 
Prices for U.S. government bonds fell, with yields on two-year Treasury (US2YT=RR) notes rising to their highest level since August 2009. Stocks on Wall Street ended lower. 
The U.S. central bank hiked its overnight benchmark interest rate last December for the first time in nearly a decade. 
The Fed's anticipated faster pace of rate increases in 2017, is likely in response to president-elect Donald Trump's planned expansionary fiscal policy agenda aimed at boosting growth through infrastructure spending and tax cuts.
INFLATION PERKING UP
A third report from the Labor Department showed its producer price index for final demand increased 0.4 percent last month, the largest gain since June, after being unchanged in October. 
In the 12 months through November, the PPI rose 1.3 percent, the biggest gain in two years. The PPI rose 0.8 percent in the 12 months through October.
A 0.5 percent increase in the cost of services accounted for more than 80 percent of the rise in the final demand PPI last month. The increase, which followed a 0.3 percent decline in October, was the largest since January.
With producer prices pushing higher, overall inflation is expected to steadily move toward the Fed's 2 percent target.
""The prospects of strengthening demand point to upward inflation pressures in 2017,"" said Sam Bullard, a senior economist at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) Securities in Charlotte, North Carolina.
Last month's weak retail sales figures came despite consumer confidence rising to cycle highs, leaving some economists to expect that the numbers would revised higher when the government releases December's report in January.
Sales at clothing stores were flat last month. Department stores like Macy's (N:M) and Kohl's (N:KSS) are facing intense competition from online retailers such as Amazon (O:AMZN), which have snatched a large chunk of the market share. 
But online retail sales rose marginally last month. There were solid gains in sales at furniture, food and beverage, as well as building material stores. Americans also spent more at restaurants and bars last month.

""We are a bit skeptical of this morning's numbers,"" said Michelle Girard, chief economist at NatWest Markets in Stamford, Connecticut. ""Given anecdotal evidence and the rise in consumer confidence, we suspect the November figures could get revised higher or will be followed by a much improved performance.""

1168,By Investing.com,"<span>Dec 14, 2016 04:18PM ET</span>","Federal Reserve hikes as expected, sees up to three increases in 2017","Investing.com - The Federal Reserve hiked its policy rate by 25 basis points on Wednesday for the first increase in a year and said as many as three more hikes could come in 2017.
For the full-text statement, see:
Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in November indicates that the labor market has continued to strengthen and that economic activity has been expanding at a moderate pace since mid-year. Job gains have been solid in recent months and the unemployment rate has declined. Household spending has been rising moderately but business fixed investment has remained soft. Inflation has increased since earlier this year but is still below the Committee's 2 percent longer-run objective, partly reflecting earlier declines in energy prices and in prices of non-energy imports. Market-based measures of inflation compensation have moved up considerably but still are low; most survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations are little changed, on balance, in recent months.
Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability. The Committee expects that, with gradual adjustments in the stance of monetary policy, economic activity will expand at a moderate pace and labor market conditions will strengthen somewhat further. Inflation is expected to rise to 2 percent over the medium term as the transitory effects of past declines in energy and import prices dissipate and the labor market strengthens further. Near-term risks to the economic outlook appear roughly balanced. The Committee continues to closely monitor inflation indicators and global economic and financial developments.
In view of realized and expected labor market conditions and inflation, the Committee decided to raise the target range for the federal funds rate to 1/2 to 3/4 percent. The stance of monetary policy remains accommodative, thereby supporting some further strengthening in labor market conditions and a return to 2 percent inflation.
In determining the timing and size of future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will assess realized and expected economic conditions relative to its objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation. This assessment will take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial and international developments. In light of the current shortfall of inflation from 2 percent, the Committee will carefully monitor actual and expected progress toward its inflation goal. The Committee expects that economic conditions will evolve in a manner that will warrant only gradual increases in the federal funds rate; the federal funds rate is likely to remain, for some time, below levels that are expected to prevail in the longer run. However, the actual path of the federal funds rate will depend on the economic outlook as informed by incoming data.
The Committee is maintaining its existing policy of reinvesting principal payments from its holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities in agency mortgage-backed securities and of rolling over maturing Treasury securities at auction, and it anticipates doing so until normalization of the level of the federal funds rate is well under way. This policy, by keeping the Committee's holdings of longer-term securities at sizable levels, should help maintain accommodative financial conditions.
Voting for the FOMC monetary policy action were: Janet L. Yellen, Chair; William C. Dudley, Vice Chairman; Lael Brainard; James Bullard; Stanley Fischer; Esther L. George; Loretta J. Mester; Jerome H. Powell; Eric Rosengren; and Daniel K. Tarullo.

The European Union's statistics office Eurostat said on Wednesday industrial production in the 19-country single currency bloc in decreased in October by 0.1 percent during the month, although was up 0.6 percent year-on-year.
A Reuters poll of economists had forecast an average monthly rise of 0.2 percent for a 0.8 percent increase year on year.
The figures for September were revised to minus 0.9 percent month-on-month for a 1.3 percent increase from a year earlier, compared with the initial estimates of -0.8 and 1.2 percent respectively.
The figures meant the end of a seven-month pattern in which decreases in one month were followed by increases the following month and vice versa.
The monthly fall of production in October was mostly due to a 1.5 percent drop in the output of non-durable consumer goods, such as clothing, after a 0.1 percent increase in September.
Intermediate good production also fell by 0.5 percent.
However, output of durable goods, such as cars or fridges, picked up 1.5 percent after a sharp 5.5 percent decline in September. Production of capital goods, such as industrial machinery, and of energy rose by 1.0 and 0.8 percent respectively.

1186,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 14, 2016 04:40AM ET</span>",UK sees employment fall but wages defy Brexit shock,"LONDON (Reuters) - The number of people in work in Britain fell for first time in more than a year in the three months to October, official data showed on Wednesday, suggesting a slowing in the labor market after the Brexit vote.
Britain's unemployment rate stayed at 4.8 percent - in line with a forecast by economists in a Reuters poll - and basic pay rose at its strongest pace since the summer of 2015.
But the number of people in work fell by 6,000, the first decline since the second quarter of last year, the Office for National Statistics said.
""The labor market appears to have flattened off in recent months. While the employment rate remains high, it is slightly down on the record set recently,"" ONS statistician David Freeman said.
The number of people out of work also fell, by 16,000, as fewer people sought work.
Britain's economy has largely weathered the initial shock of the referendum decision to leave the European Union.
Several companies, such as technology giants Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL), have announced plans to create jobs in Britain in recent weeks, adding to a sense of business-as-normal despite the vote.
However, the unemployment rate is widely expected to rise next year as companies hold off from hiring as they wait for more clarity on the country's future ties to the EU, which could take years to be negotiated.
The Bank of England expects the jobless rate to stand at 5.6 percent in two years' time.
The ONS said the number of unemployment benefit claimants - which is considered to be a potential early warning sign of an economic downturn - rose by 2,400 in November and by 13,300 in October, more than previously though.
Economists had expected the number of benefit claimants to rise by 5,500 in November.
Wages in the August-October period showed solid gains, possibly reflecting pressure on employers to hold on staff and attract new hires as the labor market approaches capacity.
The ONS said workers' total earnings including bonuses rose by an annual 2.5 percent, compared with 2.4 percent in the three months to September and the joint strongest rate in more than a year.
Economists taking part in a Reuters poll had expected wage growth of 2.3 percent.
Excluding bonuses, earnings rose by 2.6 percent year-on-year against expectations for a 2.5 percent rise. It was the strongest increase since the three months to August 2015.
A report published last week by a British recruitment industry body showed the starting salaries for permanent workers hired via agencies rose at their fastest rate in six months.
However, wages are not expected to keep pace with inflation in 2017, calling into question whether consumers will be able to continue driving Britain's economy with their spending.

Inflation rose to 1.2 percent in November, its highest level in more than two years, and is expected to climb sharply toward 3 percent by the end of next year, reflecting the sharp fall in the value of the pound since the Brexit vote.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The average sales price of an apartment in Manhattan is expected to top $2 million this year for the first time, but prices are seen leveling off in 2017 after nearly doubling over the past decade.
Prices were pushed higher by a jump in sales of condominiums valued at $10 million or more, which skewed results, CityRealty, a real estate listings and data website for New York City, said on Wednesday.
The opening of 432 Park Avenue, a 96-story tower marketed by developers as the tallest residential building in the Americas, had an outsized effect on prices, said CityRealty research director Gabby Warshawer.
Fifty-two of the 75 units sold at the tower overlooking Central Park fetched more than $10 million, she said. Some units are priced at more than $40 million.
An increase in new developments and a rise in the price of existing units also lifted the market, Warshawer said.
Prices have climbed every year since 2011 but are expected to flatline next year. A lack of expensive, large new buildings will act to keep prices in check in 2017, CityRealty said.
The potential impact on sales and prices of the recent rise in mortgage rates was not analyzed, Warshawer said.
Mortgage rates have shot up since the Nov. 8 U.S. election as interest rates have climbed broadly on expectations of faster economic growth and accelerating inflation under stimulus programs President-elect Donald Trump wants to enact.
The interest rate for a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage now averages 4.27 percent, a two-year high, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association, up from about 3.60 percent in the weeks before the election.
CityRealty examined sales registrations from New York City's Department of Finance. Much of Harlem and nearby areas were excluded because it is a small piece of the market and affordable housing data is more difficult to glean, she said.
December 2016 sales were extrapolated based on the year's data through Nov. 30. 
The average co-op and condo price in Manhattan excluding Harlem and nearby areas rose to $2.2 million in 2016 from a record $1.9 million the year before, CityRealty estimated. For all of Manhattan, the average sales price was $2.1 million.
A condo is owned directly, but the buyer of a co-op obtains shares in a corporation that owns the building.
The median price for apartments, or the middle of all sales considered, also set a record at $1.2 million, up from $1.1 million last year, in the area examined. 
A decade ago, the price of new condo units was almost the same as existing ones, but prices at new developments since 2008 have outpaced those of existing ones.

The average price for an apartment in the area of Manhattan examined was 91 percent higher than in 2006, CityRealty said.

The projections have not yet been finalised and can change slightly by the time the government announces the figures on Dec. 20, the sources said on condition of anonymity because they are not authorized to speak to media.
The growth projections will be used to compile next year's budget draft, expected to be endorsed by the cabinet on Dec. 22.
The projections compare with this fiscal year's forecast of a 0.9 percent expansion in price-adjusted real terms and 2.2 percent nominal growth.

The government usually issues economic projections for the coming fiscal year in December when compiling the annual budget, and revises them around mid-year.

1199,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 13, 2016 10:19PM ET</span>","Asia confidence slips as firms fret about sluggish demand, political uncertainty: Thomson Reuters/INSEAD poll","By Liz Lee
KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - Confidence in Asia toward business conditions over the coming six months dropped in the final quarter of 2016 to its lowest level in a year as firms fretted about sluggish demand in a persistently low-growth economic environment, a Thomson Reuters/INSEAD survey found.
Firms also flagged political uncertainty as a key near-term risk, including that brought by the election of Donald Trump to the U.S. presidency - an outcome some cited as a key risk in the same survey three months prior.
The Thomson Reuters/INSEAD Asian Business Sentiment Index, representing the half-year outlook of 118 firms, fell to 63 from 68 in the September quarter, although it remained above the 50 mark separating optimism from pessimism.
""The fall in the business sentiment index confirms what we have seen over the past few years: The world economy is growing but in a way that looks suboptimal,"" said Singapore-based economics professor Antonio Fatas at global business school INSEAD. ""It seems very difficult to regain a high state of confidence.""
Asian companies are particularly reliant on demand from China where slowing economic performance has been the main cause for concern over the past few years. But in recent weeks, political worries have come to the fore.
Trump has advocated more U.S.-centric trade relations and the cancellation of the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade pact. He has also vowed to repatriate jobs such as in the outsourcing industry which flourishes in the Philippines, where new president Rodrigo Duterte is known for anti-American rhetoric.
In South Korea, lawmakers have voted to impeach President Park Geun-hye over an influence-peddling scandal after weeks of protests, while in India, Prime Minister Narendra Modi abolished 86 percent of the country's cash overnight to tackle corruption.
Firms have to navigate such events ""with the possibility of either 'muddling through' as we have managed to do over the last two years or hitting a wall because one of these uncertain events turns negative,"" said Fatas.

AUSTRALIA MOST OPTIMISTIC
Thomson Reuters and INSEAD polled firms across Asia from Nov. 28 through Dec. 9. Of 118 respondents, just over 42 percent were positive toward business prospects over the next six months, 41 percent were neutral and 16 percent were negative.
Respondents included Australia's Transurban Group, India's Reliance Industries Ltd, PT Telekomunikasi Indonesia (Persero) Tbk, Japan's Asahi Group Holdings Ltd, Korea Aerospace Industries Ltd and the Philippine National Bank.
Firms in Australia were the most positive with their subindex of 86 although that was still 2 points lower than three months prior. Only Singaporean firms were negative with a subindex of 46, albeit an improvement from the 38 of September.
Sentiment tumbled the most in the usually upbeat Philippines, to 70 from 94. Though optimistic, the subindex compared with that economy's average of 91 over the survey's seven-year life.
Sentiment fell in China, to 80 from 90, in India to 70 from 75 and in Thailand to 60 from 72. But in South Korea it rose to 57 from 50 despite the political turmoil.
""Outside of Thailand, we expect to see a slower pace of economic growth in our main markets in Asia-Pacific, including Australia, China and Singapore in the near term,"" said Chairman and Chief Executive William Heinecke of Thai hotelier and retail distributor Minor International PCL.
Heinecke also said his company expected global tourism to be resilient in the current climate, and that the retail food service industry would be stable in its key markets.
By sector, the retail and leisure subindex fell to 56 in the fourth quarter from 68 in the third. Household, food and beverage firms were the most optimistic at 79, up from 72, whereas those in the autos sector were the most pessimistic at 40 from 60.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Big Japanese manufacturers' sentiment improved for the first time in six quarters in the three months to December to hit a one-year high, a closely watched central bank survey showed, as stock gains and yen falls brightened prospects for the export-reliant economy.
Companies also maintained their upbeat spending plans, the Bank of Japan's ""tankan"" quarterly survey showed on Wednesday, reinforcing market expectations that the Bank of Japan will hold off on expanding stimulus measures in the coming months.
But service-sector confidence was unchanged from three months ago as bad weather hurt private consumption, the survey showed, underscoring the fragile and patchy nature of recovery in the world's third largest economy.
The headline index measuring big manufacturers' business sentiment rose to plus 10 from plus 6 three months ago, the tankan survey showed, matching a median market forecast and hitting the highest level since December 2015.
""Manufacturing sentiment is doing well, reflecting a recovery in global trade,"" said Hidenobu Tokuda, senior economist a Mizuho Research Institute.
""I think the economy will continue to grow due to exports and public works spending. The chance of additional monetary easing has receded.""
The BOJ is likely to keep monetary policy steady and give a more upbeat view of the economy at next week's rate review, reflecting brighter prospects for global trade, sources have told Reuters.
Auto and machinery makers saw sentiment brighten in the survey, taken days after the U.S. presidential election last month, suggesting that sharp yen falls triggered by the election of Donald Trump spurred hopes for higher earnings.
Big firms plan to increase capital expenditure by 5.5 percent for the current fiscal year to March 2017, slightly below projections made three months ago but in line with downward revisions that tend to occur at year-end, analysts say.
""Capital spending held firm. Taken together this tankan confirmed a gradual economic recovery, which backs up the BOJ's upbeat view,"" said Takeshi Minami, chief economists at Norinchukin Research Institute.
""It should be taken as another factor for the central bank to stand pat on policy for the time being.""
DRAG FROM CONSUMPTION
Despite more than three years of aggressive money printing by the BOJ, Japan's economy has failed to emerge sustainably from the doldrums as soft global demand and slow wage growth weigh on exports and private consumption.
The tankan showed big non-manufacturers' mood was flat from three months ago at plus 18, as sentiment soured for restaurants, retailers and hotels hurt by soft consumption.
Big manufacturers and non-manufacturers expect business conditions to worsen slightly in the coming three months, suggesting that companies remain cautious on whether the positive market trend will continue.
But recent data offer signs of hope. Japanese firms' order books rose in November on robust Asian demand, and consumption edged up after slumping on bad weather that kept shoppers home.
Big manufacturers based their profit estimates on an assumed average dollar/yen rate of 104.90 for the current fiscal year.

That is much stronger than current levels around 115 yen, suggesting that corporate profits may be revised up sharply if the current weak-yen trend continues, analysts say.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. import prices recorded their biggest drop in nine months in November on declining petroleum costs, with renewed dollar strength threatening to keep imported inflation subdued.
The Labor Department said on Tuesday import prices fell 0.3 percent last month after a downwardly revised 0.4 percent gain in October. Last month's drop was the biggest since February and followed two straight months of increases. 
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast import prices falling 0.4 percent last month after a previously reported 0.5 percent increase. 
In the 12 months through November, import prices dipped 0.1 percent, the smallest decrease since July 2014, after slipping 0.3 percent in the 12 months through October. 
The soft import price reading is unlikely to change expectations that the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates on Wednesday, given a tightening labor market and firming economy. The U.S. central bank's policy-setting committee was due to start its two-day meeting later on Tuesday.
The Fed hiked its benchmark overnight interest rate last December for the first time in nearly a decade.
The dollar (DXY) fell against a basket of currencies after the data on Tuesday. Prices of U.S. Treasuries and U.S. stock index futures were trading higher.
The dollar's surge against the currencies of the United States' main trading partners between June 2014 and January 2016 resulted in imported deflation, helping to keep inflation below the Fed's 2 percent target.
The greenback's rally appeared to fade for much of the year, easing some of the pressure on import prices. But the dollar resumed its upward move in the wake of Donald Trump's victory in the Nov. 8 presidential election. It has gained 3.5 percent on a trade-weighted basis since the election.
But with oil prices hovering around $50 per barrel and wages expected to accelerate as the labor market nears full employment, some of the dollar's drag on price pressures could be mitigated, allowing inflation to rise toward its target.
EXPORT PRICES FALL 
Imported petroleum prices dropped 4.7 percent last month, also the largest decline since February, after increasing 7.3 percent in October. That offset a 10.6 percent jump in imported natural gas prices.
Import prices excluding petroleum were unchanged after dipping 0.1 percent in the prior month. 
The cost of imported food rose 1.5 percent. Prices for imported capital goods fell 0.2 percent, while the cost of imported automobiles slipped 0.1 percent. Imported consumer goods prices excluding automobiles fell 0.1 percent last month. 
The report also showed export prices decreasing 0.1 percent in November after rising 0.2 percent in October. Export prices were down 0.3 percent from a year ago. That was the smallest decline since August 2014 and followed a 1.0 percent decline in October.

Agricultural exports increased 0.6 percent last month, driven by an 11.5 percent surge in vegetable prices. But prices for industrial supplies and materials exports fell 0.3 percent.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's October core machinery orders rose for the first time in three months to beat expectations, government data showed - a tentative sign of a pickup in capital expenditure.
Core orders, a highly volatile data series regarded as an indicator of capital spending in the coming six to nine months, rose 4.1 percent in October from the previous month, Cabinet office data showed on Monday. The results handily beat the economists' median estimate of a 1.0 percent increase.
"" Machinery orders are basically flat but picking up slightly,"" said Takeshi Minami, chief economist at Norinchukin Research Institute.
""If this pick up continues, capital expenditure might increase in fiscal 2017,"" Minami said, adding that improvement in domestic demand may help boost capital expenditure.
October's results are welcome news for Japanese policymakers, who are counting on capital spending to foster sustainable growth in the world's third largest economy.
A Cabinet Office official said machinery orders for Oct-Dec, which manufacturers had previously predicted would decrease 5.9 percent, may not fall as much as expected because orders improved in October. However, the official cautioned that orders may not continue to rise steadily.
The government maintained its assessment that a slowdown in the pick up of machinery orders can be seen.
Capital expenditure fell in the July-September quarter for the first time in nearly four years, in a worrying sign that uncertainty over the economic outlook is eroding companies' confidence.

Japan's economy also grew much slower than initially estimated in the third quarter as capital expenditure dried up and companies ran down inventories.

The Commerce Department said on Friday that wholesale inventories decreased 0.4 percent after rising 0.1 percent in September. The department reported last month that wholesale inventories declined 0.4 percent in October.
The component of wholesale inventories that goes into the calculation of GDP - wholesale stocks excluding autos - also fell 0.4 percent in October.
Inventory investment contributed half a percentage point to the economy's 3.2 percent annualized growth rate in the third quarter. Inventories had weighed on GDP growth since the second quarter of 2015.
With a report this week showing stocks at manufacturers were unchanged in October, economists believe inventories' contribution to growth in the fourth quarter will be modest.
Still, strong consumer demand, against the backdrop of a labor market that is near full employment, should keep the
economy on solid ground. The Atlanta Federal Reserve is forecasting GDP rising at a 2.6 percent pace this quarter.
In October, wholesale stocks of farm products increased 2.0 percent after rising 3.9 percent in September. Wholesale inventories of petroleum rose 1.9 percent, while automobile stocks gained 0.3 percent. Machinery inventories tumbled 1.0 percent in October.
Sales at wholesalers jumped 1.4 percent in October after rising 0.4 percent in September. Sales were buoyed by a 1.1 percent increase in sales of machinery as well as a 6.6 percent jump in sales of petroleum.
At October's sales pace it would take wholesalers 1.30 months to clear shelves, down from 1.32 months in September.
While that ratio has declined from the 1.37 months touched in January, which was the highest since March 2009, it remains relatively high. That suggests the wholesale inventory drawdown could continue for a while.

BERLIN (Reuters) - German exports rebounded by less than expected in October, dampening hopes that trade will make a significant contribution to a predicted expansion in Europe's biggest economy in the final quarter of this year.
The data suggests that German industry, whose output rose less than expected in October due to stagnating factory output, will only witness a mild recovery in the last three months of this year.
Exports have almost stagnated over the last 12 months, growing on average by 0.1 percent monthly from a historical average of 0.3 percent.
""Looking ahead, however, the latest weakness of the pound sterling and possible protectionist policies under the new president in the U.S. do not bode well for the outlook for German exports,"" said ING economist Carsten Brzeski.
""It seems as if exports' troubles gaining momentum will not be over any time soon.""
Seasonally adjusted exports rose by 0.5 percent on the month, data from the Federal Statistics Office showed, while imports increased by 1.3 percent.
The data reinforces a trend of weakening exports, which have been losing their traditional role as the main growth driver in Germany.
A Reuters poll had pointed to exports rising by 1.0 percent and imports posting a 0.9 percent increase.
The jump in imports narrowed the seasonally adjusted trade surplus to 20.5 billion euros from 21.1 billion euros in September. The October reading was below the Reuters consensus forecast of 21.5 billion euros.
Exports for September were revised down for a fall of 1.0 percent from a previously reported drop of 0.7 percent.
Private consumption and increased state spending have been fuelling German growth.
But the positive effects of private consumption are likely to wane next year, as rising consumer prices and weaker wage increases are expected to discourage Germans from spending.

1249,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 08, 2016 07:44PM ET</span>",Japan's big manufacturers' mood improves as companies cut capex,"By Stanley White
TOKYO (Reuters) - Large Japanese manufacturers turned more optimistic about economic conditions in the fourth quarter but they lowered their capital expenditure plans for the current fiscal year, suggesting firms remain wary over future business conditions.
Large manufacturers said they expect sentiment to worsen slightly in January-March, offering additional evidence that companies see some risks to the economy.
The survey, which was taken a week after Donald Trump's U.S. presidential election victory, follows a large downward revision to gross domestic product data in the third quarter.
The revision was due to a fall in capital expenditure and lower inventories, raising concerns about corporate vitality.
""The survey reflects some uncertainty about Trump's policies,"" said Daiju Aoki, economist at UBS Securities.
""Companies are also skeptical about the rapid decline in the yen. They don't expect the yen to remain weak and don't think the benefits will last long."" 
The joint survey by the Ministry of Finance and the Economic and Social Research Institute, an arm of the Cabinet Office, recorded a business survey index (BSI) of sentiment among large manufacturers at plus 7.5 in October-December from plus 2.9 in July-September. 
Large manufacturers expect their sentiment index to worsen to plus 4.6 in January-March, the survey published on Friday showed.
Japanese companies plan to raise capital expenditure by 2.5 percent in the fiscal year that started in April, down from their previous projection of a 4.9 percent increase.
While campaigning, Trump regularly suggested he would enact protectionist trade polices, which could potentially harm Japan's export-dependent economy.
Since winning the presidency, Trump has softened his tone on some issues, but there is still a lot of uncertainty about how he will run the government given his free-wheeling style and lack of political experience, economists say.
The yen  skidded to an eight-month low versus the dollar after Trump's election win. 
Normally, Japanese exporters would welcome a weak currency because it boosts overseas revenues, but the BSI survey suggests companies think the yen could easily reverse course.
If there is increased volatility in currencies, this could make it difficult for companies to draw up capital expenditure plans, Aoki also said.
The BSI measures the percentage of firms that expect the business environment to improve from the previous quarter minus the percentage that expect it to worsen. 

Japan's economy grew much more slowly in the third quarter than initially estimated, revised data showed, as capital expenditure dried up and companies ran down inventories.

DETROIT (Reuters) - U.S. auto sales will fall to about 17.2 million new vehicles next year from an expected 17.4 million in 2016, to be followed by further softening in 2018, industry consultant and publication WardsAuto said on Thursday.
WardsAuto analyst Haig Stoddard said 2018 will be the near-term low for U.S. sales, and that they will rise slightly in 2019, but through 2023 will not match records reached last year and this one.
Stoddard, speaking at WardsAuto industry conference, said consumer discounts as a percentage of new vehicle selling prices have been at record highs in recent months.
Automakers' discipline in keeping profit-eating discounts in check would be tested in the early months of 2017, he said.
Paul Traub, senior business economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, also pointed to the same issue as key to coming sales levels.
""I'm kind of concerned about the steps the auto companies are making now"" in raising consumer discounts to keep pace with record auto sales of about 17.4 million this year and last. Automakers are likely stealing sales from future months with their current large incentives, he said.
Traub said he would advise automakers to abandon efforts to maintain market share with discounts, also called incentives. Rather, they should let overall economic trendlines work themselves out over time, given that auto sales near 17 million are healthy enough, he said.
Traub, who said he would not comment on the likelihood of a rise of interest rates this month by the Fed, said the rise of 3-year-old vehicles with negative equity being traded in for new vehicles was a ""dangerous slope in my mind.""
This week, Experian said the length of new-vehicle loans was 68 months in the third quarter, up from 67 months a year earlier.
General Motors Co (N:GM) is poised to make the largest U.S. market share gains in the coming years, because of a fresher lineup, including new versions of its mainline pickup trucks, Stoddard said.
Stoddard said  Ford Motor Co  (N:F) is pretty much stuck in place when it comes to U.S. market share, due to fewer new products than Detroit rival GM.
WardsAuto forecasts that through 2022 the low for U.S. auto sales will be 16.8 million in 2018. Automotive consultant LMC Automotive forecasts 17.4 million in 2017 U.S. auto sales, while  Barclays  (LON:BARC) is among the most conservative at 16.8 million.

1254,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 08, 2016 11:27AM ET</span>","Lower for longer, ECB scales back asset buys","By Balazs Koranyi and Francesco Canepa
FRANKFURT (Reuters) - The European Central Bank trimmed back its asset buys in a surprise move on Thursday but promised protracted stimulus to aid a still fragile recovery, and dismissed any talk of tapering the program away.
With still no sign of a sustained rebound in underlying inflation and heightened political risk from looming elections in four of the euro zone's five biggest economies, the ECB promised to keep borrowing costs depressed longer than predicted, even reserving the right to raise back purchases if the outlook sours.
Although the cut in the volume of monthly assets buys suggests a concession to conservative countries such as Germany and the Netherlands, the underlying message was seen as dovish, catering to nations on the periphery and a boost for financial markets.
Catching financial markets off-guard, ECB President Mario Draghi said the bond buys would be cut to 60 billion euros a month from 80 billion euros starting April but they would go on until the end of 2017, three months longer than expected.
""There is no question about tapering,"" Draghi said. ""We can even go back to 80 (billion)... there’s a range of options.""
""The key message... is to show that there is no tapering in sight, to show that the ECB is going to stay in the market, to show that we will continue to exert pressure on market prices,"" Draghi added.
The euro weakened 1.3 percent on the ECB's move and stocks surged 1 percent (STOXX), boosted by bank shares that have rallied all week. 
ELECTIONS
With elections looming in France, Germany, the Netherlands and possibly Italy, and all facing strengthening populist movements, the ECB can hardly afford to ease back on the accelerator.
But much of its firepower is exhausted and Germany is growing increasingly frustrated with its unprecedented stimulus, so the bank has been under pressure to make at least a token nod to the haws, signaling that quantitative easing cannot go on forever.
""During the Q&A session, ECB president Draghi had difficulties sending a very clear message to markets on how to read today’s message,"" ING economist Carsten Brzeski said. ""Throughout the press conference, he sounded more and more dovish.""
The ECB has already spent more than 1.4 trillion euros ($1.5 trillion) buying bonds and is at risk of running out of assets. The Bundesbank argues that this blurs a legal line and can be considered central bank financing of budgets.
To make further buys possible, the ECB relaxed some of its self imposed rules, increasing the pool of eligible assets.
Bonds with maturity between 1 and 2 years will now be included in the asset buys and the bank will also purchase bonds yielding less than its -0.4 percent deposit rate, if necessary.
But in another small victory for conservative euro zone members, the ECB decided not to allow bond purchases to deviate from countries' shareholding in the bank, an issue considered a red line Germany's Bundesbank.
HAWKISH AND DOVISH
""By surprising on the dovish side with duration and at the same time tapering the purchase rate, the ECB has made a shrewd move in our view,"" HSBC economist Simon Wells said. 
""By tapering, albeit conditionally, it has made a sop to its critics who think policy is already too loose,"" Wells said. ""But it has also bought itself time and side-stepped a series of potentially difficult discussions about further extensions during 2017.""
Underlying its promise for extensive stimulus, the ECB predicted inflation at 1.7 percent in 2019, arguing that higher energy prices could lift consumer prices even without lifting the underlying trend.
But when asked if the 1.7 percent met its goal of below but close to two percent, Draghi said: ""Not really, so we have to persist.""
""Uncertainty prevails everywhere,"" Draghi told a news conference.
Much to Draghi's concern, wage growth has also disappointed, suggesting that companies have cut their inflation expectations.
This is a hard-to-break cycle that could entrench anemic price growth, making it harder to get it back to the desired at-or-just-below 2 percent. 
Even consumption, the key driver of growth is not as good as it looks. Consumption has been driven a jump in disposable income due to oil price falls and loose ECB policy. But Brent crude (LCOc1) is up 14 percent in the past three months, leaving monetary policy as the chief driver of consumption.
Interest rates, seen by most to have bottomed out, were kept unchanged, with the deposit rate kept deep in negative territory. 
Euro zone economic growth is shrugging off Britain's decision to leave the European Union, and Germany, the bloc's growth engine, seems to be picking up speed again. 
Ironically, the collapse of Italy's government this week may hasten instead of delay the recapitalization of ailing lender Monte dei Paschi (MI:BMPS), much to the ECB's relief. It has pointed to weak banks as an obstacle to transmitting stimulus. 
""The vulnerabilities that both the banking system and Italy have been there for a long time. And so they ought to be coped with, and I am confident the government knows what to do and they will be dealt with,"" Draghi said.

Claims offer a real-time look into the rate of layoffs and job losses, since many people file for benefits soon after they lose their jobs. This data series, at the lowest level since the 1970s, has been proof of the labor recovery after the recession and the reduction of slack in the market. "

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits fell from a five-month high last week, pointing to labor strength that underscores the economy's sustained momentum.
A tight labor market together with signs of a strengthening economy and steadily rising inflation will likely push the Federal Reserve to hike interest rates next week.
Initial claims for state unemployment benefits dropped 10,000 to a seasonally adjusted 258,000 for the week ended Dec. 3, the Labor Department said on Thursday. Claims for the prior week were unrevised.
It was the 92nd straight week that claims were below 300,000, a threshold associated with a healthy labor market. That is the longest stretch since 1970, when the labor market was much smaller.
U.S. financial markets were largely unmoved by the data as investors focused on the European Central Bank's unexpected decision to cut its asset purchases starting in April. 
Prices for U.S. government debt were trading lower, while U.S. stock index futures were higher. The U.S. dollar was stronger against a basket of currencies.
Last week's drop in first-time applications for jobless benefits was in line with economists' expectations. Claims hit a 43-year low in mid-November. 
Economists had dismissed the recent back-to-back increases in filings, which had pushed claims to a five-month high, as an aberration. Claims tend to be volatile around this time of the year because of different timings of the Thanksgiving holiday.
A Labor Department analyst said there were no special factors influencing last week's data and that no states had been estimated. The four-week moving average of claims, considered a better measure of labor market trends as it irons out week-to-week volatility, rose 1,000 to 252,500 last week.
The labor market is near full employment, with the government reporting last week that the unemployment rate fell to a nine-year low of 4.6 percent in November amid solid increases in nonfarm payrolls.
The Fed's policy-setting committee meets next Tuesday and Wednesday. Economists expect the U.S. central bank to increase borrowing costs by at least 25 basis points at that meeting. The Fed raised its benchmark overnight interest rate last December for the first time in nearly a decade. 
Thursday's claims report also showed the number of people still receiving benefits after an initial week of aid fell 79,000 to 2.01 million in the week ended Nov. 26. That followed two straight weekly increases. 

The four-week average of the so-called continuing claims slipped 9,500 to 2.03 million.

1267,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 08, 2016 05:32AM ET</span>",Chinese trade data shows signs of industrial recovery,"By Yawen Chen and Kevin Yao
BEIJING (Reuters) - China's imports grew at the fastest pace in more than two years in November, fueled by its strong thirst for commodities from coal to iron ore, while exports also rose unexpectedly, reflecting a pick-up in both domestic and global demand. 
The upbeat data adds to signs of a modest industrial recovery in the world's largest economies, even as China and other Asian exporters brace for a potential trade war once protectionist U.S. President-elect Donald Trump takes office.
""The improvement reflects a strengthening in global demand, with recent business surveys suggesting that developed economies are on track to end the year on a strong note,"" Julian Evans-Pritchard, China economist at Singapore-based Capital Economics, said in a note.
""But while global demand has recovered somewhat recently, lower trend growth in many developed and emerging economies means that further upside is probably limited.""
China's November imports expanded 6.7 percent on-year, confounding expectations for a drop of 1.3 percent and the strongest gain since September 2014, data showed on Thursday.
Exports rose 0.1 percent from a year earlier, defying predictions for a 5 percent slide. Demand from all of China's major trading partners improved significantly, especially Europe and the United States, though shipments to emerging economies remained weak.
That left the country with a trade surplus of $44.61 billion for the month, the General Administration of Customs said, versus forecasts of $46.30 billion and October's $49.06 billion.
Analysts polled by Reuters had expected a more modest drop in November exports after a 7.3 percent contraction in October, while imports had been seen falling at roughly the same pace.
MAN OF STEEL
China's imports of major commodities including iron ore, crude oil, coal, soybeans and copper all surged in November, despite a sharp weakening in its yuan currency.
While some analysts have worried that sharp commodity price rises could be masking still sluggish demand, the data showed imports rose in both value and volume terms.
A government infrastructure building spree and housing rally have fueled a construction boom in China this year, spurring demand for building materials from steel bars to cement.
China imported 91.98 million tonnes of iron ore in November, the third highest monthly tally on record, while imports of copper, used in plumbing and wiring, surged 31 percent.
China also imported its largest volume of coal in 18 months, as utilities rebuilt stocks to cope with higher winter demand. Its strong appetite has helped fuel a reflationary pulse in global commodities worldwide.
Some market watchers, however, suspected the spike in metal imports may have been due to shipments being delayed from October during the country's long National Day holiday. Top suppliers Australia and Brazil may have also ramped up iron ore exports to China to meet annual targets as the year-end nears.
""The rise in copper imports reflected in part a rise in Shanghai Futures Exchange inventories and stronger demand from the Chinese power and construction sectors,"" said Vivek Dhar, a commodities analyst with Commonwealth Bank in Melbourne.
""The debate dividing the market is whether this growth can be sustained into next year, or will things flatten out. This isn't necessarily clear just yet.""
ROCKY ROAD AHEAD?
The better-than-expected trade figures cement expectations that China's government will once again meet its full-year growth target, which this year was set at 6.5 to 7 percent.
But the world's largest trading nation could be heavily exposed to protectionist measures next year if Trump follows through on campaign pledges to brand it a currency manipulator and impose heavy tariffs on imports of Chinese goods. 
South Korea and Taiwan are worried, too. Both also reported stronger-than-expected exports in November. 
""We would not think of the positive (China) numbers as an inflection point. Of all the high frequency economic data over the year, trade headwinds are likely to be the most severe, and the most uncontrollable, due to trade policies of other countries,"" said Chester Liaw, an economist at Forecast Pte Ltd in Singapore.
China is squarely in Trump's sights. Its trade surplus with the United States has widened steadily over the past years, expanding 6.5 percent to $367.11 billion in 2015, U.S. Census Bureau data showed. 
Even if Trump does not try to impose punitive measures, growing protectionist sentiment could have a chilling effect on trade and investment worldwide.
The chief of China's sovereign wealth fund said on Thursday he expected Trump to be very careful in considering whether to increase tariffs in line with his election promises because it would not be in U.S. interests. The United States is China's largest trading partner.
Stubbornly weak export demand has dragged on China's economic growth to the point where Beijing did not even set a trade target this year.
That has forced policymakers to rely on higher government spending and record bank lending to boost activity, even at the risk of adding to a mountain of debt.
China's exports in the first 11 months of the year fell 7.5 percent from the same period a year earlier, while imports dropped 6.2 percent.

Analysts have warned that a property boom which has generated a significant share of economic growth this year may be peaking, threatening to snuff out a spectacular months-long rally in Chinese commodities prices.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's economy grew much slower than initially estimated in the third quarter, revised data showed, as capital expenditure dried up and companies ran down inventories - renewing concerns about Japan's growth prospects. 
The Cabinet Office said on Thursday the economy grew at a 1.3 percent annualized rate in July-September, a severe revision from the 2.2 percent annualized growth first estimated and barely over half the median estimate for a 2.4 percent annualized expansion.
Capital expenditure fell 0.4 percent in the quarter, versus the preliminary estimate of 0.0 percent, as steel and real estate companies reduced investment.
On the positive side, consumer spending was revised up and separate data showed services sector sentiment improved. However, weak capital expenditure may temper optimism that the economy could accelerate heading into next year. 
""Capex and consumer spending are the twin engines of domestic demand, and I'm not convinced that both will recover strongly,"" said Norio Miyagawa, senior economist at Mizuho Securities.
""We have government stimulus and a weak yen, so the economy will continue to grow, but growth will be modest.""
Inventories subtracted 0.3 percentage point from growth, more than a preliminary reading of a 0.1 percentage point contraction, which showed that a recent buildup in inventories was slowing, and a positive sign that companies were able to sell excess goods, Miyagawa said.
Net exports added 0.3 percentage point to growth in July-September, less than a 0.5 percentage point contribution in the previous quarter.
However, economists were optimistic that exports would pick up in the future as the yen  had fallen to an eight-month low after Donald Trump was elected U.S. president. 
Japan's government has also approved a stimulus package with 7.5 trillion yen of spending on public works, which should marginally support growth next year, economists say.
Private consumption, which accounts for roughly 60 percent of the economy, rose 0.3 percent, versus the preliminary estimate of 0.1 percent growth, as households spent more on food and beverages, TV sets and domestic travel.
The government adopted a new base year for calculating gross domestic product, which lifted nominal GDP closer to the Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's target level.
The new calculation method, which will include research and development as capital expenditure for the first time to conform with international standards, has been applied to GDP data going back to 1994.
Because of this change, business investment was 17 percent higher last quarter than previous data had suggested, according to Marcel Thieliant, senior Japan economist at Capital Economics in Singapore.
Cabinet Office data showed the new calculation method added 19.2 trillion yen to capital expenditure in fiscal 2015, versus an 18.5 trillion yen contribution in the previous fiscal year.
""The changes have made the capital expenditure data more accurate,"" said Hiroshi Miyazaki, senior economist at Mitsubishi UFJ  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) Securities.
""This won't change the overall pace of growth. I expect capital expenditure to bottom out in the current quarter.""

An index of sentiment among so-called ""economy-watcher"" service-sector workers, such as taxi drivers and restaurant staff, rose to 53.5 in November, the highest since March 2014, as a stock market rally and a falling yen made employees more optimistic.

The JOLTS report also contains the quits rate, which Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen has endorsed as a preferred metric. The rate — or the number of quits divided by the number of employees who worked or were paid for work — once again stayed unchanged at 2.1%.
A higher quits rate sends a positive message about the labor market because people are more likely to quit their jobs if they feel confident about finding a new one quickly, or if they already have another offer. It could also suggest that workers are leaving their jobs for better-paying ones, and so be  a predictor of wage growth and inflation.
Additionally, the layoffs and discharges rate stayed unchanged at 1.0%."

1284,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 07, 2016 10:09AM ET</span>",Poll: U.S. bull market seen extending into 2017 but Trump a wild card,"By Caroline Valetkevitch
NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. stock market's bull run since 2009 will extend into 2017 if President-elect Donald Trump's plans to stimulate the economy with infrastructure spending and financial deregulation come to pass, according to strategists in a Reuters poll. 
But limiting the enthusiasm are threats by Trump to consider imposing new import tariffs and the prospect of a potentially stronger dollar, with the S&P 500's end-2017 forecast up about 6 percent from current levels. 
The benchmark index will end 2017 at 2,350 and finish 2016 at 2,210, according to the median forecast of around 40 strategists polled by Reuters over the past week. It closed Tuesday at 2,212.23. 
Wall Street has rallied and hit record highs since Republican Trump unexpectedly won his White House bid in the Nov. 8 U.S. election. 
Worries about his controversial policies leading up to the election have given way to optimism over promises for lower taxes, fewer regulations and more spending. The S&P 500 is up 8 percent year-to-date, having gained over 2 percent in the weeks since the election. 
""Right now it looks as if the bull market is on, and the risks are that even guys like me who put out a very optimistic call were too conservative,"" said Jonathan Golub, chief equity strategist for RBC Capital Markets in New York. His forecast for the S&P 500 to end 2017 at 2,500 was among the highest in the poll. 
The S&P 500 has gone up every year since 2009 except in 2011, when it ended flat, and in 2015, when it posted a slight loss. Part of the expected stock gains will be fueled by a rebound in corporate profits following weak growth in 2016, strategists said. 
Analysts expect S&P 500 companies' profit growth of 12.4 percent for 2017 compared with a forecast gain of just 0.9 percent in 2016, Thomson Reuters data shows. A year ago, 2016 profits were expected to grow 8.3 percent. 
Profits need to pick up to prevent stocks from getting too expensive though, strategists said, with the S&P 500 now trading about 17 times forward earnings, compared with a long-term average of about 15, according to Thomson Reuters data. 
Sectors many of the strategists expect to do well next year are technology, industrials and other cyclicals that tend to benefit from an improving economy. Many also favor financials, which have had a strong run since the election on Trump's plans to cut regulations for the group. 
On the flip side, strategists see a less favorable year for utilities and other sectors that tend to underperform in a rising interest rate environment. 
Investors expect the Federal Reserve to raise rates in December, and some strategists worry that the pace of future rate hikes to deal with a potential pickup in inflation might be too fast for the economy to handle. 
While the deck seems stacked in favor of further gains next year, uncertainties abound, especially since no one knows yet which of Trump's plans will actually materialize into policy.
Strategists cited possible trade friction and protectionist policies as among the biggest worries for next year. 
Trump has said he would quit the North American Free Trade Agreement unless it is renegotiated to his satisfaction and that he would declare China a currency manipulator to force negotiations for better trade terms.
His suggestions that his administration could impose 45 percent across-the-board tariffs on goods from China have drawn threats of retaliation by Chinese state media against U.S. soybeans and companies such as Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co and Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) 
During the presidential campaign, Trump said his administration would put a 35 percent import tariff on goods made by American manufacturers that moved jobs offshore. 
""The rally could be cut short if Trump embarks on the more confrontational trade agenda,"" said John Praveen, managing director at  Prudential  (LON:PRU) International Investments. 
The dollar, which has strengthened sharply since the election, is likely to dampen earnings for U.S. multinationals if it stays on the same path. 
This poll's 2017 year-end S&P 500 target is up from a forecast of 2,310 in the October stocks poll. 
The Dow Jones industrial average will end 2017 at 20,450, a gain of 6 percent from Tuesday's close of 19,251.78, the Reuters poll showed.

The Washington-based industry group said 30-year fixed-rate conforming mortgages averaged 4.27 percent, the highest level since October 2014.
The average rate on 30-year conforming loans with balances of $417,000 or less, which mortgage agencies  Fannie Mae  and  Freddie Mac  guarantee (PK:FNMA) (PK:FMCC), was 4.23 percent in the prior week.
Interest rates on 15-year fixed-rate mortgages averaged 3.53 percent, their highest since September 2014.
MBA's seasonally adjusted mortgage market index declined 0.7 percent in the week ended Dec. 2 to 414.1, the lowest since 398.5 in the week of Jan. 8.
Weekly mortgage activity excluding seasonal factors, however, jumped 39 percent from the previous week, MBA said.
Home borrowing costs have climbed with a surge in U.S. 10-year Treasury bond yields (US10YT=RR), which hit their highest levels since July 2015 last week, following Donald Trump's U.S. presidential election victory.
Traders have bet on faster economic growth and inflation if Trump and the Republican-controlled Congress enact big tax cuts and federal spending, together with stricter trade policies.
The spike in 30-year mortgage rates, which have risen about 0.50 percentage point since the Nov. 8 election, has reduced refinancing activity.
MBA's seasonally adjusted refinancing index dipped 0.7 percent to 1,459.3 last week, its lowest level since early January.

On the other hand, the group's seasonal gauge on applications to buy a home, seen as a proxy on future home sales, edged up 0.4 percent to 234.5.

1287,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 07, 2016 05:44AM ET</span>",India central bank unexpectedly keeps rates unchanged as cash crunch roils economy,"By Suvashree Choudhury and Rafael Nam
MUMBAI (Reuters) - India's central bank unexpectedly kept its key policy rate unchanged at 6.25 percent on Wednesday, despite calls for action in the face of an intense cash shortage that threatens to slam the brakes on the world's fastest growing large economy.
The Reserve Bank of India's monetary policy committee voted 6-0 to leave the repo rate unchanged, saying it needed more time to assess if the recent cash squeeze would cause more lasting damage to the economy.
Pressure on the RBI and Governor Urjit Patel to act has grown since Modi stunned the country on Nov. 8 with a drastic plan to abolish 500 and 1,000 rupee notes ($7.35-14.70), removing 86 percent of the currency in circulation in a bid to crack down on India's ""shadow economy."" 
While shortages of new bank notes are still being reported and some companies' cash-reliant supply chains have been left in tatters, the government insists conditions will steadily improve by the end of the year.
The RBI has also said it expected the impact from the measures to ebb as new notes come into circulation, even as it trimmed its growth forecast for year ending in March 2017. 
""While supply disruptions in the backwash of currency replacement may drag down growth this year, it is important to analyze more information and experience before judging their full effects and their persistence,"" the RBI said in a statement.
""Short-term developments that influence the outlook disproportionately warrant caution with respect to setting the monetary policy stance. If the impact is transient as widely expected, growth should rebound strongly.""
A majority of the 56 analysts polled by Reuters had expected a rate cut of at least 25 bps, after a similar move at the RBI's last review in October.
But 18 analysts had forecast policy would remain unchanged.
As expected, the central bank did withdraw the temporary 100 percent hike in the cash reserve ratio announced late last month that was intended to absorb the extra liquidity created after the country banned higher-value notes.
STILL EYEING INFLATION? 
In keeping its policy settings steady, the central bank also appeared to remain concerned about the risk of a flare-up in inflation.
Although consumer inflation  eased in October to 4.20 percent, the slowest pace in 14 months, prices in India have traditionally been dependant on volatile food and fuel prices. Global crude oil prices have spiked in the last week.
The RBI also cited concerns about the ""high volatility"" in global financial markets, and the spillover into emerging market countries, especially as the U.S. Federal Reserve gears up to raise interest rates next week. 
The benchmark 10-year bond yield  rose sharply, and was up 17 bps from levels before the decision. The NSE stock index (NSEI) was down 0.5 percent, while the rupee  weakened slightly to 67.87.
India's economy grew by an annual 7.3 percent between July and September, the fastest rate for a large economy in the world but still below the levels needed to sustain full employment.
Economists warn that expansion is now threatened after data so far shows Modi's action has hit the cash-dependent economy more than expected: auto sales plunged and services sector activity dived into contraction last month for the first time in 1-1/2 years.
That could raise expectations the RBI could cut rates at its next review in February, according to analysts.
""We certainly expect the RBI to cut rates in the next policy meet. It will become a big problem otherwise."" said Samrat Dasgupta, chief executive, Esquire Capital Investment in Mumbai.

""Inflation will remain low. This was an opportunity for the governor to cut rates; so I think it is a missed opportunity.""

In a report, the U.K. Office for National Statistics said that manufacturing production fell by a seasonally adjusted 0.9% in October, worse than expectations for a gain of 0.2% and following a rise of 0.6% in the prior month. October's decline is the weakest since February.

The report also showed that industrial production unexpectedly decreased by a seasonally adjusted 1.3% in October, compared to forecasts for a 0.2% rise and following the 0.4% decline in the preceding month. That was the largest decline in output since September 2012.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japanese manufacturers' confidence rose for a fourth straight month to a 16-month high in December and the service sector's mood also rose, a Reuters poll showed, with a weaker yen brightening prospects for exporters.
The monthly Reuters Tankan - which tracks the Bank of Japan's key quarterly tankan - found sentiment at manufacturers and service-sector firms both up from three months ago, pointing to improvement in the central bank's survey out next week.
In the poll of 531 large- and mid-sized firms, carried out between Nov. 22 and Dec. 2 and in which 268 responded, the sentiment index for manufacturers rose to 16 from 14 in November, driven by steel and transport equipment makers.
It was the highest reading since August 2015, but it is expected to fall to 10 over the next three months.
Compared with three months ago, the index was up 11 points, indicating an improvement in the headline big manufacturers' index in the BOJ tankan due Dec. 14.
In written comments, Japanese exporters expressed concerns about uncertainty over the global outlook following the shock U.S. election victory by Donald Trump, while a subsequent dollar rebound buoyed sentiment among manufacturers.
""It's good that the yen has weakened. But the outlook is highly unclear,"" a manager at a chemicals firm wrote in the survey, which companies answer anonymously. ""There's a mountain of problems such as Trump, South Korea, China and Russia.""
The service-sector index rose to 19 from 15 in November, up five points compared with three months ago, a good sign for the upcoming BOJ tankan. It was the highest reading since May, and it is seen edging up further to 20 in March.
In a worrying sign for private consumption that constitutes about 60 percent of the economy, however, retailers' sentiment fell to minus 14 from zero in November, reflecting weak domestic demand.
""Sales from inbound tourism are slowing and clothing sales remain poor,"" one retailer said. Another retailer said business conditions were not so good due to ""high input prices caused by a weak yen, and a spike in unit costs of foodstuffs.""
The BOJ's last tankan on Oct. 3 showed big Japanese manufacturers' mood held steady in the third quarter while service-sector sentiment fell to its lowest in nearly two years.

The central bank last month held off on expanding stimulus, underscoring a market view that it will stand pat unless a severe shock threatens to derail economic recovery. It holds the next rate review Dec. 19-20.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. trade deficit recorded its biggest increase in more than 1-1/2 years in October as exports of soybeans and other goods dropped, suggesting that trade would be a drag on growth in the fourth quarter.
The Commerce Department said on Tuesday the trade gap widened 17.8 percent to $42.6 billion. That was the largest percentage increase since March 2015.
Economists had forecast the trade gap increasing to $41.8 billion in October after a previously reported $36.4 billion shortfall. When adjusted for inflation, the deficit rose to $60.3 billion from $54.2 billion in September.
""This puts net exports on a weaker footing as the fourth quarter began. We were already penciling in net exports to subtract 0.8 percentage point from GDP growth ahead of today's figure,"" said Jennifer Lee, a senior economist at BMO Capital Markets in Toronto. 
Exports contributed 0.87 percentage point to the third quarter's 3.2 percent annualized rate of increase in gross domestic product. The jump in exports in the last quarter largely reflected a surge in soybean shipments after a poor harvest in Argentina and Brazil.
While the reversal in soybean shipments, which is weighing on exports, suggests trade is likely to subtract from GDP growth in the fourth quarter, consumer spending and a firming housing market are expected to keep supporting the economy.
Rising gas and oil well drilling in response to increasing oil prices is also expected to boost growth this quarter.
Firming oil prices are starting to have an impact on manufacturing. A second report from the Commerce Department on Tuesday showed new orders for manufactured goods rose 2.7 percent in October after increasing 0.6 percent in September. 
That was the largest increase since June 2015 and marked four straight months of gains. Unfilled orders at factories increased 0.7 percent, the biggest rise since July 2014, ending four consecutive months of decline.
The report pointed to an upturn in manufacturing, which accounts for about 12 percent of the economy, after a prolonged slump that had helped to erode economic growth. 
The Atlanta Federal Reserve is currently forecasting gross domestic product to rise at a 2.9 percent rate in the fourth quarter. 
Prices for U.S. government debt were slightly weaker in mid-morning trading, while U.S. stocks were largely unchanged. The dollar (DXY) rose against a basket of currencies.
DOLLAR DRAG
Exports fell 1.8 percent to $186.4 billion in October. They were held down by declining shipments of food, industrial supplies and materials, automobiles and consumer goods.
Exports of soybeans, which helped power the economy in the third quarter, fell in both October and September. However, exports of capital goods were the highest in October since December 2015.
Some of the drag on exports reflects the residual effects of the dollar's surge against the currencies of the United States' main trading partners between June 2014 and January 2016. 
With the dollar resuming its rally in the wake of Donald Trump's victory in the Nov. 8 presidential election, exports could struggle in 2017. The greenback has gained 4.1 percent on a trade-weighted basis since the election.
In October, exports to the European Union fell 1.1 percent, with goods shipped to the United Kingdom tumbling 12.2 percent. But exports to China surged 32.8 percent to their highest level since December 2013, while shipments to Japan were the highest in more than two years.
Imports of goods and services increased 1.3 percent to $229.0 billion in October, the highest level since August 2015. There were increases in food, capital goods and consumer imports. But imports of automobiles and industrial supplies and materials fell.
Imports of petroleum goods were the highest in a year, reflecting an increase in crude oil prices.
Imports from China rose 4.2 percent to their highest level in a year. With exports outpacing imports, the politically sensitive U.S.-China trade deficit fell 4.2 percent to $31.1 billion in October.
In a third report on Tuesday, the Labor Department said non-farm productivity, which measures hourly output per worker, rose at an unrevised 3.1 percent rate in the third quarter.

While the increase snapped three straight quarters of decline, the trend in productivity remains weak. Productivity was unchanged compared to the third quarter of 2015.

The Commerce Department said on Tuesday new orders for manufactured goods rose 2.7 percent after an upwardly revised 0.6 percent gain in September. That was the largest increase since June 2015 and marked four straight months of gains.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast factory orders increasing 2.6 percent in October after a previously reported 0.3 percent gain in September. Unfilled orders at factories increased 0.7 percent, the biggest rise since July 2014, ending four consecutive months of decline.
The report added to factory surveys in suggesting an upturn in manufacturing, which accounts for about 12 percent of the economy. Despite signs of stability, progress is likely to be limited by renewed dollar strength in the wake of Donald Trump's victory in the Nov. 8 U.S. presidential election.
The dollar's surge against the currencies of the United States' main trading partners between June 2014 and January 2016 helped to undercut manufacturing activity.
With the dollar rally having appeared to fade for much of the year, some of the drag had eased. But the dollar has gained 4.1 percent on a trade-weighted basis since the election. In October, orders for transportation equipment jumped 12 percent, the biggest rise in a year. Motor vehicle orders, however, slipped 0.7 percent.
There were increases in orders for computers and electronic products, capital goods, and electrical equipment, appliances and components. Orders for machinery were unchanged.
The Commerce Department also said orders for non-defense capital goods excluding aircraft - seen as a measure of business confidence and spending plans - rose 0.2 percent instead of the 0.4 percent increase reported last month.
Shipments of these so-called core capital goods, which are used to calculate business equipment spending in the gross domestic product report, fell 0.1 percent in October instead of the previously reported 0.2 percent rise.

That suggested business spending on equipment will likely remain weak in the fourth quarter. Shipments of overall factory goods increased 0.4 percent in October after rising 0.9 percent the prior month. Inventories of factory goods were flat. That left the inventories-to-shipments ratio unchanged at 1.34.

In unadjusted terms, the consumer confidence index <MXCONC=ECI> fell to 84.4 percent.

Eurostat confirmed gross domestic product growth in the 19 countries sharing the euro rose 0.3 percent quarter-on-quarter. However, it revised up its figure for year-on-year growth to 1.7 percent from the 1.6 percent it previously reported.
Second quarter growth compared with a year earlier was similarly raised by one tenth of a percentage point to 1.7 percent.
The biggest contribution to growth came from household spending, which added 0.2 percentage points to the final result, with changes of inventories and public sector spending also each adding another 0.1 points.
The impact of exports was zero, while increased imports cut 0.1 points from the growth figure. Investment made no contribution to growth, after expansion in previous quarters.
Unlike the second quarter, when France's and Finland's economy contracted by 0.1 percent, all economies grew in the third quarter, those of Slovenia, Greece and Portugal by most.

For the full-text statement, see:
Statement by Philip Lowe, Governor:Monetary Policy Decision
At its meeting today, the Board decided to leave the cash rate unchanged at 1.50 per cent.
The global economy is continuing to grow, at a lower than average pace. Labour market conditions in the advanced economies have improved over the past year. Economic conditions in China have steadied, supported by growth in infrastructure and property construction, although medium-term risks to growth remain. Inflation remains below most central banks’ targets, although headline inflation rates have increased recently. Globally, the outlook for inflation is more balanced than it has been for some time.
Commodity prices have risen over the course of this year, reflecting both stronger demand and cut-backs in supply in some countries. The higher commodity prices have supported a rise in Australia’s terms of trade, although they remain much lower than they have been in recent years. The higher prices are providing a boost to national income.
Financial markets are functioning effectively. Government bond yields have risen further with the adjustment having been orderly. Funding costs for some borrowers have also risen, but remain low. Globally, monetary policy remains remarkably accommodative.
In Australia, the economy is continuing its transition following the mining investment boom. Some slowing in the year-ended growth rate is likely, before it picks up again. Further increases in exports of resources are expected as completed projects come on line. The outlook for business investment remains subdued, although measures of business sentiment remain above average.
Labour market indicators continue to be somewhat mixed. The unemployment rate has declined this year, although some measures of labour underutilisation are little changed. There continues to be considerable variation in employment outcomes across the country. Part-time employment has been growing strongly, but employment growth overall has slowed. The forward-looking indicators point to continued expansion in employment in the near term. Inflation remains quite low. The continuing subdued growth in labour costs means that inflation is expected to remain low for some time, before returning to more normal levels.
Low interest rates have been supporting domestic demand and the lower exchange rate since 2013 has been helping the traded sector. Financial institutions are in a position to lend for worthwhile purposes. These factors are assisting the economy to make the necessary adjustments, though an appreciating exchange rate could complicate this.
Conditions in the housing market have strengthened overall, although they vary considerably around the country. In some markets, prices are rising briskly, while in others they are declining. Housing credit has picked up a little, although turnover of established dwellings is lower than it was a year ago. Supervisory measures have strengthened lending standards and some lenders are taking a more cautious attitude to lending in certain segments. Considerable supply of apartments is scheduled to come on stream over the next couple of years, particularly in the eastern capital cities. Growth in rents is the slowest for some decades.
Taking account of the available information, and having eased monetary policy earlier in the year, the Board judged that holding the stance of policy unchanged at this meeting would be consistent with sustainable growth in the economy and achieving the inflation target over time.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. services sector activity hit a one-year high in November, with a surge in production boosting hiring, further evidence of strength in the economy that clears the way for the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates next week.
Monday's bullish report from the Institute for Supply Management (ISM) followed data last week showing strong job gains in November which helped drive the unemployment rate to a nine-year low of 4.6 percent.
""The U.S. economy looks solid heading into year-end and, backed by a tightening labor market, the Fed is set to raise rates next week,"" said Robert Kavcic, a senior economist at BMO Capital Markets in Toronto.
The ISM said its non-manufacturing activity index jumped 2.4 percentage points to 57.2, the highest reading since October 2015. A reading above 50 indicates expansion in the sector, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity.
Services industries reported a 4 percentage point surge in production last month. A measure of services sector employment soared 5.1 percentage points to a 13-month high. 
While industries reported a modest decline in new orders, the new orders gauge remained well above expansionary territory. A sub-index for export orders increased solidly last month.
The strong services sector sentiment was also captured in a separate survey from data firm Markit, which showed a gauge on new orders rising to its highest level since August 2015 and a measure of new business at a one-year high.
Prices for U.S. Treasuries fell on Monday, with the 30-year Treasury bond briefly falling one point on the data before reversing losses following a large block purchase of ultra bond futures. The dollar traded lower against a basket of currencies, while U.S. stocks rose.
The Fed is expected to increase borrowing costs at the Dec. 13-14 policy meeting. The U.S. central bank raised its benchmark overnight interest rate last December for the first time in nearly a decade. 
The services sector survey added to last week's upbeat manufacturing survey and data on consumer spending in suggesting the economy maintained its momentum early in the fourth quarter after growing at a brisk 3.2 percent annualized rate in the July-September quarter.
With November's strong gains, a GDP-weighted composite of the ISM manufacturing and non-manufacturing indexes rose to 56.7, the highest reading since October 2015, from 54.5 in October.
""This level has typically been consistent with about a 3.5 percent annual rate in real GDP growth,"" said Jim O'Sullivan, chief U.S. economist at High Frequency Economics in Valhalla, New York. ""Growth has been a bit weaker than suggested by the ISM data in the past year, but, even so, the data suggest good upward momentum.""
The Atlanta Federal Reserve is currently forecasting gross domestic product rising at a 2.9 percent rate in the fourth quarter. Last month, the ISM said the majority of industries surveyed offered positive comments about business conditions and the direction of the overall economy.

Fourteen services industries reporting growth in November included retail trade, construction, finance and insurance, information and wholesale trade. The two industries reporting contraction were real estate, rental and leasing, and public administration.

In a report, the Institute of Supply Management (ISM) said its non-manufacturing purchasing manager's index (PMI) rose to 57.2 last month from 54.8 in October. That was the 82nd consecutive month of growth and its highest reading since October 2015.
Analysts had expected the index to increase to 55.4.
On the index, a reading above 50.0 indicates the non-manufacturing sector economy is generally expanding, below 50.0 indicates the sector is contracting
The Non-Manufacturing Business Activity Index increased to 61.7, 4.0 points higher than October’s reading of 57.7. Analysts had forecast it to rise to 58.0.
The New Orders Index registered 57.0 in November, 0.7 points lower than the reading of 57.7 in the previous month.
The Employment Index increased 5.1 points to 58.2 from Obtober’s reading of 53.1.
The Prices Index decreased 0.3 points to 56.3 from October’s 56.6.
The ISM indicated that the majority of comments from the respondents were positive about business conditions and the direction of the overall economy.
The ISM further noted that all 14 non-manufacturing industries reported growth in November.
Immediately following the report, EUR/USD unchanged at 1.0728, GBP/USD was at 1.2712 from 1.2716 earlier, while USD/JPY was at 114.62 from 114.37 earlier.
The US dollar index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six major rivals, traded at 100.50 compared to 100.44 prior to the release.
Meanwhile, U.S. stock markets were trading higher after the open. The Dow 30 gained 0.49%, the S&P 500 rose 0.72%, while the Nasdaq Composite traded up 1.00%.
Elsewhere, in the commodities market, gold futures traded at $1,161.95 a troy ounce, compared to $1,165.65 ahead of the data, while crude oil traded at $52.09 a barrel from $52.24 earlier."

The Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) for Brazilian services, compiled by research firm Markit, rose on a seasonally adjusted basis to 44.4 in November from 43.9 in October.
Still, it remained well below the 50 mark that separates contraction from expansion, extending a negative streak that started in February 2015.
Confidence over the outlook for the next 12 months among service providers remained positive, but the degree of optimism fell to a three-month low, Markit said.
Markit's Composite Index <BRPMCP=ECI>, which takes into account manufacturing and services activity, also rose slightly to 45.3 in November from 44.9 in October.
""Composite PMI data for the fourth quarter so far point towards a further contraction of gross domestic product, continuing the downturn of Brazil's economy that began in the first quarter of 2015,” Markit economist Pollyana de Lima said.
Services activity fell sharply, while backlogs of work dropped at the quickest rate in the survey history, Markit said. Staff levels were also down.
Services account for about 60 percent of Brazil's gross domestic product. Economists have cut their forecasts for Brazil's 2017 growth, expecting only a meager recovery from a two-year-long recession.

1330,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 05, 2016 06:16AM ET</span>","British services PMI hits 10-month high, points to solid fourth quarter growth","By David Milliken
LONDON (Reuters) - Businesses in Britain's dominant services sector grew at their fastest pace since January last month and the broader economy maintained momentum, even if firms have some worries about the year ahead, a survey showed on Monday.
The Markit/CIPS services purchasing managers' index (PMI) - a closely watched gauge of the services sector - rose to 55.2 in November from 54.5 in October, beating all the forecasts in a Reuters poll of economists.
However, businesses reported the second-weakest level of optimism about the future in four years, due to the unexpected result of the U.S. presidential election, the value of sterling and ongoing uncertainty about how Britain will leave the European Union.
Despite a dip in the equivalent survey of manufacturers published last week, overall the November PMIs suggest the economy as a whole will maintain the third quarter's solid 0.5 percent growth rate through to the end of the year, Markit said.
""The pace of UK economic growth remains resiliently robust in the fourth quarter, despite ongoing uncertainty caused by Brexit,"" said Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit, the company that compiles the survey.
Most economists and the Bank of England said Britain's economy would slow sharply after June's vote to leave the EU. But strong consumer demand and a boost to exporters from the heavy post-referendum fall in sterling have kept growth going.
A separate survey by manufacturing lobby EEF released earlier on Monday showed a boost in new orders and a better-than-expected recovery in output.
Last month the Bank of England revised up its forecasts to pencil in 0.4 percent growth for the last three months of 2016. But it also said annual growth would slow to 1.4 percent next year from 2.2 percent in 2016 as higher inflation squeezes household incomes.
""Elevated price pressures and drop in expectations suggest that a slowdown remains on the cards for next year,"" HSBC economist Elizabeth Martins said. ""Inflation is likely to outpace wage growth over the coming year or so, bearing down on domestic demand and causing growth to slow.""
Businesses are already starting to feel the pinch of costlier imports due to the fall in sterling, and Markit said business costs had risen by the most in five-and-a-half years during the past two months.
""These higher costs will inevitably feed through to consumers in the form of higher prices,"" Williamson said.
The BoE forecasts inflation will surge to 2.7 percent next year from 0.9 percent in the most recent data, and many private-sector economists think it could rise even faster.

However, very few expect the BoE to reverse August's rate cut in response. On Friday the central bank's chief economist, Andy Haldane, warned against hasty action. BoE Governor Mark Carney will speak on the economy later on Monday.

1331,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 05, 2016 06:10AM ET</span>",Political uncertainty weighs on euro zone sentiment: Sentix,"BERLIN (Reuters) - Investor sentiment in the euro zone deteriorated in December due to political uncertainty over the future of the 19-member currency bloc, a survey showed on Monday.
The Frankfurt-based Sentix research group's euro zone index fell to 10.0 points after reaching a year high of 13.1 in November. The December reading undershot the consensus of a stable reading in a Reuters poll of analysts. <EUSTCS=ECI>
""The euro zone is self-absorbed and preoccupied with its own voters. Austria, Italy and also the important elections in 2017 are creating uncertainty,"" Sentix said in a statement.
""Every election is declared as being a vital vote for or against the euro and this clouds the outlook for investors and companies who would prefer a clear picture for investment decisions.""
Investors viewed the euro zone's current conditions more skeptically, with a sub-index falling to 8.3 in December from 12.3 in November. Expectations for economic developments in the euro zone also deteriorated, edging down to 11.8 from 14.0.
An index tracking Germany, the euro zone's largest economy, fell to 27.8 in December from 29.2 in November.
The survey contrasts with the Ifo business sentiment index published on Nov. 24 that showed company executives remaining upbeat in the face of increased uncertainties following Donald Trump's victory in the U.S. presidential election.
Sentix polled 1,005 investors between Dec. 1 and Dec. 3, meaning the election results of the Italian referendum and the Austrian presidential run-off are not reflected in the survey.
In Italy, the euro zone’s third-largest economy, Prime Minister Matteo Renzi said he would resign after suffering a crushing defeat in a referendum on Sunday on constitutional reform, raising fears of political turmoil.

However, Austrians rejected a far-right candidate in a presidential election in favor of a pro-European environmentalist.

LONDON (Reuters) - Euro zone business activity grew at its quickest pace this year in November and firms, which benefited from a weaker euro, raised prices faster than at any time in five years, a survey found on Monday.
Policymakers at the European Central Bank this week are expected to announce a six-month extension to their asset purchase program to try to boost inflation, further denting the currency and offering support to exporters. [ECB/INT]
IHS Markit's final composite Purchasing Managers' Index for the euro zone was 53.9 in November, below a 54.1 flash estimate but beating October's 53.3 and its highest since December.
The index has been above the 50 mark that divides growth from contraction since mid-2013.
""The composite PMI was revised down slightly but it's still consistent with a pickup in euro zone GDP growth which is quite positive,"" said Stephen Brown at Capital Economics.
Adding to the more upbeat picture, retail sales rose more than expected in October, official data showed earlier.
The PMI for the dominant services industry jumped to 53.8 from 52.8, below the flash 54.1 but its highest level this year. Manufacturers enjoyed their best month since the start of 2014 in November, a sister survey showed last week.
[EUR/PMIM]
With activity picking up, the PMI points to fourth quarter economic growth of 0.4 percent, IHS Markit said, matching the prediction in a Reuters poll on Friday.
Activity in the German services sector hit a six-month high in November, supporting overall solid growth in the private sector and adding to signs that Europe's largest economy has rebounded in the current quarter.
France's recovery extended into a fifth month, and growth accelerated in both Spain and Italy.
New orders also jumped, suggesting the pickup may continue through to the end of the year. The new orders index for the service industry climbed to a 10-month high of 53.5 from 52.6.
Years of ultra-loose monetary policy have so far failed to get inflation anywhere near the ECB's close-to-2-percent target but pressures are mounting slowly. The composite output price index rose to 50.6 from 50.0, its highest since August 2011.

""It has been rising but it's not consistent with a rise in core inflation so we still think that the ECB will extend purchases when it meets on Thursday,"" Brown said.

1333,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 05, 2016 05:20AM ET</span>","China November data to show steady growth, but yuan, capital controls a worry","BEIJING (Reuters) - A flood of data from China in coming weeks is expected to show the economy continued to grow at a steady pace in November, with inflation quickening and credit expanding at a faster pace despite concerns about rising debt, a Reuters poll showed.
However, concerns about the impact of tighter capital controls are also growing as China closes off more channels for cash to leave the country after the yuan slid to more than 8-year lows.
China's foreign reserves, though still the world's largest, may have fallen to the lowest since early 2011 in November, data is expected to show on Wednesday.
A Reuters poll of 26 analysts expects the world's largest reserves fell to $3.091 trillion in November from $3.121 trillion in October - the fifth straight month of declines.
In recent weeks, Beijing has clamped down on outbound investments and used its foreign exchange stockpile to keep the yuan from falling too rapidly, but traders are wondering how long it can maintain its yuan defense and withstand a prolonged drain on reserves if the U.S. dollar continues to rise.
The yuan  has fallen over 3 percent against the dollar since Sept. 30, and analysts polled by Reuters expect it to recoil further to 7.14 per dollar in a year, which would mark its lowest level in nearly a decade.
The yuan has continued to skid despite unexpected signs of stabilization in the economy this year, which are largely due to a construction boom fueled by higher government infrastructure spending and a blistering housing rally.
However, that has also left economic growth more reliant on government spending, state-owned companies and ""old economy"" industries such as steel and mining which Beijing has been trying to restructure and streamline via capacity cuts.
Trade and inflation data will follow on Thursday and Friday, respectively, with fixed asset investment, retail sales, and industrial output on Dec. 13. Loan and money data is expected Dec. 10-15. 
Industrial profits and factory activity have rebounded over the last few months, but the gains have relied too much on higher commodity prices than a sustained increase in real demand, the statistics bureau said last week.
China's commodities futures prices have surged this year as speculators piled in, with coal prices hitting records in recent weeks, but economists say growth driven by loose money policies won't last.
Buoyed by higher prices for steel and coal, producer price inflation is expected to jump to 2.2 percent in November - the highest in five years - from 1.2 percent in October.
Consumer price inflation is expected to quicken to 2.2 percent from 2.1 percent, according to a median forecast of 47 analysts.
Exports are expected to remain stubbornly weak, even as worries grow of trade frictions with the United States next year after President-elect and vocal China critic Donald Trump takes office.
November exports likely fell 5 percent from a year earlier, not as bad as a 7.3 percent drop in October but pointing to sluggish global demand. Imports may have dropped 1.3 percent, after falling 1.4 percent in October.
China's trade surplus is forecast to have been $46.30 billion in November, versus October's $49.06 billion, with growing attention on its large trade surplus with the United States.
Industrial output is expected to rise 6.1 percent in November from a year earlier - unchanged from October.
Activity in China's manufacturing sector grew more than expected in November, expanding at its strongest pace in more than two years, according to an official survey
Retail sales growth may have picked up slightly to 10.1 percent as many shoppers splurged on ""Single's Day"" on Nov. 11. Chinese e-commerce giant  Alibaba  Group Holding Ltd (N:BABA) said it racked up more than $5 billion in transactions in the first hour. 
Growth in fixed-asset investment is forecast to be 8.3 percent in January-November, the same pace as in the first 10 months, according to the poll. 
China watchers will be looking more closely at property investment details as the housing rally which has been one of the economy's main drivers starts to show signs of fatigue. 
New yuan loans may have increased to 720 billion yuan ($104.52 billion) last month from 651.3 billion yuan in October.
Bank lending is on pace to hit a record this year, and has been led by home mortgages over the last few months, though growth of outstanding loans likely eased slightly to 13 percent. 

Growth of M2 money supply likely moderated slightly in November, with analysts expecting an increase of 11.5 percent, versus October's 11.6 percent.

In a report, market research group Markit said the seasonally adjusted Markit/CIPS services purchasing managers’ index (PMI) unexpectedly rose to 55.2 last month from a reading of 54.5 in October.
Analysts had expected the index to fall to 54.0.
On the index, a level above 50.0 indicates expansion in the industry, below 50.0 indicates contraction.
On the downside, Markit indicated that business sentiment was at its weakest since July.
The research group further noted that input price inflation remained sharp, but eased for the first time since May.
“The further upturn in the vast services sector shows that the pace of UK economic growth remains resiliently robust in the fourth quarter, despite ongoing uncertainty caused by Brexit,” Markit chief economist Chris Williamson said in the report.
He said that the data collected so far pointed to fourth quarter growth of 0.5%.
Williamson noted that the rising prices due to the weaker pound were a “big concern” and suggested that inflation was set to lift higher.
“The sustained improvement in the business surveys and sharp rise in prices suggest that the odds will continue to shift away from the Bank of England adding more stimulus,” Williamson commented.

The survey, along with solid factory activity readings last week, suggest building momentum for China's economy at the end of a year that saw growth stabilize, though economists say an unsustainable rebound in prices is largely responsible for the recent strength.
The Caixin/Markit services purchasing managers' index (PMI) rose to 53.1 in November on a seasonally adjusted basis from 52.4 in October.
A reading above the 50-mark suggests expansion in activity on a monthly basis. The November number marked the highest for the survey since July 2015.
Input prices for services companies rose at the fastest pace since February 2015, with a number of companies surveyed indicating higher commodities prices and wages. However, intense competition limited how much they could pass higher prices along to customers, raising the specter of slimmer profit margins.
A survey of manufacturers last week suggested prices are rising at the fastest pace in over five years, with higher commodity prices contributing to a boost in industrial profits.
The government has said organic growth remains relatively weak, and analysts believe a boost from prices will be short-lived without a corresponding increase in demand.
""(Price pressure) likely reflects currency moves and the bounce in commodity prices. That can't be good for margins. And at time when financial conditions are tightening, this is bound to weigh on investment,"" HSBC co-head of Asian economics research Frederic Neumann wrote in a note on Friday after the factory PMIs.
While service companies added staff at the fastest pace in a year-and-a-half, their business expectations hit a 13-month low in November, with Markit saying ""the degree of positive sentiment was one of the lowest seen in the series history.""
Indeed, Chinese companies say higher wages continue to put pressure on margins as sales growth hasn't kept up..
""Price inflation, rather than a structural improvement, seems to be the main reason behind the recent recovery of the economy in general. The economy may remain stable in the fourth quarter, but it will still face significant downward pressure next year,"" Zhengsheng Zhong, director of macroeconomic analysis at CEBM Group, said in a note with the report.
New business for services companies continued to expand but at a slightly slower pace from October.
The upbeat findings broadly echo those of an official services survey last week which showed growth picked up to levels not seen since 2014.
China is counting on growth in services and consumption to offset persistent weakness in exports that is dragging on the economy.

Caixin's composite PMI covering both the manufacturing and services sectors was unchanged in November from the previous month's 52.9, also pointing to solid growth.

1347,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 02, 2016 05:12PM ET</span>","U.S. jobless rate falls to nine-year low, payrolls rise","By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. unemployment rate fell to a nine-year low of 4.6 percent in November, as employers added another 178,000 jobs, making it almost certain that the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates later this month.
The unemployment rate hit its lowest level since August 2007 because more people found work but also because the labor force shrank as more people retired, lowering the number of working-age people in the labor force to 62.7 percent.
U.S. nonfarm payrolls increased by 178,000 jobs last month after increasing by 142,000 in October, the Labor Department said on Friday.
Economists had forecast payrolls rising by 175,000 last month and the unemployment rate remaining unchanged at 4.9 percent.
""The decline in the unemployment rate and the unambiguous decrease in labor market slack are likely to place further upward pressure on inflation. This report easily clears the bar for a December rate hike,"" said Michael Gapen, chief economist at  Barclays  (LON:BARC) in New York.
Wages slipped for the first time in nearly a year though after two straight months of increases. Economists partially blamed the drop in average hourly earnings on a calendar quirk, which they expect Fed officials will overlook at their Dec. 13-14 policy meeting.
Average hourly earnings fell three cents, or 0.1 percent, after rising 0.4 percent in October and gaining 0.3 percent in September. Average hourly earnings fell for workers in mining, manufacturing and utilities in November.
Last month's drop in wages lowered the year-on-year gain to 2.5 percent in November from October's 2.8 percent increase, which was the largest rise in nearly 7-1/2 years.
""This is likely to be a temporary setback, as further tightening in labor market conditions should increase competition for skilled labor and support stronger wage growth,"" said Jim Baird, chief investment officer at Plante Moran Financial Advisors in Kalamazoo, Michigan.
A broad measure of unemployment, that includes people who want to work but have given up searching and those working part-time because they cannot find full-time employment, fell two-tenths of a percentage point to 9.3 percent, the lowest level since April 2008.
After a rally of about 6.0 percent in the past three weeks, U.S. stocks ended little changed in the wake of the jobs data on Friday.
U.S. Treasury bond yields on Friday eased from multi-month highs after the worst sell-off in debt markets in nearly eight years following the election of Donald Trump as U.S. president in early November.
Trump's plan to increase infrastructure spending and cut taxes could encourage companies to boost hiring and spur an even faster pace of economic growth over the coming years, analysts said.
BROAD GAINS
Job gains have slowed from an average of 229,000 per month in 2015 to an average of 180,000 this year as the labor market nears full employment. Still, the monthly increases are more than enough to absorb new entrants into the labor market.
Fed Chair Janet Yellen has said the economy needs to create just under 100,000 jobs a month to keep up with growth in the working-age population.
""It is not that firms aren't trying to hire, they just cannot find qualified workers at the wages they want to pay,"" said Joel Naroff, chief economist at Naroff Economic Advisors in Holland, Pennsylvania. 
The jobs report added to data on consumer spending, the housing market and manufacturing in suggesting the economy continued to gain momentum in the fourth quarter after output rose at its fastest pace in two years in the third quarter.
About 226,000 people dropped out of the labor force last month. As a result, the labor participation rate, or the share of working-age Americans who are employed or at least looking for a job, fell 0.1 percentage point to 62.7 percent.
The participation rate is near multi-decade lows, partly reflecting demographic change. Economists believe that the low participation rate is hindering faster wage growth.
Job gains last month were broad, though manufacturing shed another 4,000 jobs. Manufacturing payrolls have now dropped for four straight months. Construction employment increased by 19,000 jobs last month after rising by 14,000 in October.
The retail sector shed 8,300 jobs in November, which could reflect a shift toward online shopping that has forced department stores such as Macy's Inc (N:M) to close several stores. Retail jobs have declined for two straight months.
Professional and business services payrolls increased by 63,000 last month. Healthcare and social assistance employment increased by 34,700. Temporary-help jobs, a harbinger for future hiring, rose by 14,300.

Government employment gained 22,000 jobs. There was a surge in local government hiring, which could have been driven by the Nov. 8 U.S. election.

The Markit/CIPS UK Construction Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) edged up to 52.8 from 52.6 last month, helped by improved readings for commercial and civil engineering activity, as well as solid growth in house building.
A Reuters poll of economists had forecast a reading of 52.2.
""UK construction companies experienced a steady recovery in business activity during November, which continues the rebound from the downturn seen over the third quarter of 2016,"" said Tim Moore, a senior economist at the survey's compiler, Markit. 
Companies cited a resumption in projects delayed after the Brexit vote as a factor for the improvement, although optimism about the coming year remained near lows last seen in early 2013.
Britain's economy has performed much better than expected since the Brexit referendum. But a bigger test will come next year, when inflation is expected to rise, eating into households' spending power.
Like Thursday's manufacturing PMI, the latest construction survey pointed to a rapid buildup of inflationary pressure. Its gauge of prices companies paid for materials rose to its highest since 2011.
Wednesday's 10 percent surge in crude oil prices - after OPEC and Russia agreed to restrict production - pushed the dollar cost of oil close to levels not seen in 18 months, and drove home the cost pressures facing British firms. 
The fall in sterling caused the Bank of England to raise its inflation forecasts in November to allow for a bigger overshoot of its price target than at any time since it gained independence in 1997.

Construction firms quickened their pace of hiring for a fourth month in a row, with jobs growth hitting a six-month high.

In a report, market research firm Markit and the Chartered Institute of Purchasing & Supply (CIPS) said that their U.K. construction purchasing managers' index inched up to a seasonally adjusted 52.8 last month from October’s reading of 52.6.
Economists had expected the index to slip to 52.2 in November.

The report showed that business activity rose at the fastest since March and commercial work picked up for the first time in six months.
Markit also indicated that thesuppliers continued to pass on higher imported raw material costs.
Markit senior economist Tim Moore also warned that subdued investor sentiment meant that optimism towards the year-ahead outlook remained close to its lowest since early 2013.
“Input cost inflation accelerated to its fastest for five-and-a-half years, driven by sharply rising imported raw material prices,” Moore commented.

1359,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 02, 2016 02:10AM ET</span>",Japan third-quarter GDP seen revised up on increased capital spending,"By Kaori Kaneko
TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's third quarter economic growth is forecast to be revised up slightly thanks to better-than-expected capital investment, a Reuters poll showed, though recovery is still seen likely to be slow given feeble domestic demand. 
The Japanese economy, the world's third-largest, was thought likely to expand an annualized 2.4 percent in July-September versus 2.2 percent annualized growth seen in a preliminary reading, the poll of 16 economists found. 
This increase would translate into 0.6 percent growth from the previous quarter, revised up from the initial 0.5 percent reported. 
""There is some weakness in domestic demand but the economy is picking up moderately and has escaped from prolonged economic stagnation,"" said Yoshiki Shinke, chief economist at Dai-ichi Life Research Institute.
The poll showed that capital expenditure, a key component of gross domestic product, was expected to rise 0.6 percent for the quarter, revised up from the 0.5 percent growth seen in the preliminary reading.
Analysts expect public investment to be revised up for the quarter from the initially reported 0.7 percent decline - which would also contribute to an improved growth reading.
The government is to adopt a new base year for calculating gross domestic product which analysts said made forecasting revised third quarter GDP growth more difficult.
The new calculation method, which will include research and development for the first time, will be applied to GDP data going back to 1994.
The revision raises the level of nominal GDP across time, but the impact on GDP growth rates will be small, government officials have said.
The Cabinet Office will issue the revised GDP data at 8:50 a.m on Thursday (2350 GMT Wednesday).
The poll also forecast a current account surplus of 1.5772 trillion yen ($13.84 billion)for October.
The current account data, which will be released at the same time as the GDP figures, is expected to show a 28th straight month of surplus, helped along by some recovery in exports and income gains from overseas investment.

DETROIT (Reuters) - Hefty discounts helped boost November U.S. auto sales 3.7 percent, automakers reported on Thursday, putting the industry within reach of the annual sales record set in 2015.
But some analysts worried that near-record high discounts, also called incentives, were artificially inflating demand to extend a sales boom that began after the 2008-09 economic crisis.
Auto shopping website and industry consultant TrueCar Inc (O:TRUE) said profit-eroding discounts rose 13 percent in November from a year earlier.
Bob Carter, senior vice president for Toyota Motor Corp’s (T:7203) U.S. sales arm, was upbeat nonetheless. “We have a very positive outlook on the U.S. economy over the next three years,” Carter told Reuters.
Annualized November U.S. sales were 17.87 million vehicles, down from 18.25 million a year earlier, industry consultant Autodata Corp said. Trucks and sport utility vehicles accounted for 59 percent of new vehicle sales in November, up from 55 percent a year earlier, Autodata said.
WardsAuto, which provides data used by the U.S. government for economic analysis, said annualized sales were 17.75 million vehicles, from 17.96 million in November 2015.
The two consultancies differ on the number of large trucks they include in the ""light vehicle"" sales figures they report.
Two more selling days last month made comparisons to year-ago sales easier to top, but the annualized sales rate was more difficult to match.
Each month, auto sales offer an early snapshot of U.S. consumer spending.
“All economic indicators show significantly improved optimism about the U.S. economy including consumer and business sentiment, which continue to drive a very healthy U.S. auto industry,” said Mustafa Mohatarem, General Motor Co's (N:GM) chief economist.
“We believe the U.S. auto industry is well-positioned for sales to continue at or near record levels into 2017.”
Brian Johnson of  Barclays  (LON:BARC) said an expected rise in interest rates and a tightening of easy credit may pressure sales in 2017. But he said a stronger economy may lead to ""a continued plateau"" for sales, rather than the ""eroding plateau"" Barclays now forecasts.
Robust November sales helped drive up automaker and auto dealer shares. Closing prices Thursday showed GM up 5.5 percent, Ford up 3.9 percent, and leading auto dealer group AutoNation Inc (N:AN) up 3.7 percent. 
Market leader GM's sales rose 10.2 percent to 252,644 new vehicles in November.
GM reported lofty sales for its big SUVs and pickup trucks, which are higher priced than sedans and other passenger cars.
J.D. Power data provided to Reuters showed that GM spent big on those truck sales. Discounts rose to an average of $5,752 per truck sold at GM, up 46 percent from a year ago.
That compared with a rise of 5 percent to an average $4,467 at Ford, and a 19 percent increase to an average of $6,6062 per Ram truck sold by  Fiat  Chrysler Automobiles (MI:FCHA) (N:FCAU).
Those figures include heavy duty as well as the most prevalent trucks, which are the F-150 from Ford, the Silverado 1500 and Sierra 1500 at GM and the Ram 1500.
Ford U.S. sales chief Mark LaNeve said on a conference call that even though oil prices may be on the way to $60 per barrel after OPEC cut production quotas, consumers will still favor SUVs and pickup trucks.
Fiat Chrysler's sales ran counter to the trend, dropping 14 percent. 
Toyota outsold Ford by fewer than 100 vehicles. Ford sales rose 5 percent, outpacing expectations, while Toyota matched estimates with a 4.3 percent gain over a year earlier.
Usually, Ford is No. 2 in U.S. sales.

Nissan Motor Co (T:7201) beat expectations with a 7.5 percent rise in U.S. sales to 115,136 vehicles. Honda Motor Co (T:7267) showed a sales rise of 6.5 percent.

1365,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 01, 2016 01:13PM ET</span>","U.S. factory activity at five-month high, bottlenecks emerging","By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. factory activity accelerated to a five-month high in November amid a pickup in new orders and production, suggesting that the manufacturing sector was regaining its footing after a prolonged slump.
Thursday's report from the Institute for Supply Management (ISM), which also showed some bottlenecks in the supply chain that could drive prices higher, was the latest indication that the economy continued to gain momentum in the fourth quarter. 
The ISM said its index of national factory activity rose 1.3 percentage points to a reading of 53.2 last month, the best since June. A reading above 50 indicates an expansion in manufacturing, which accounts for about 12 percent of the U.S. economy. 
""The factory sector has started to show some building momentum, strengthening the case for Federal Reserve action at the December policy meeting,"" said Kevin Cummins (NYSE:CMI), senior economist at RBS (LON:RBS) in Stamford, Connecticut.
Manufacturing is recovering as some of the drag from the dollar's past rally eases and oil prices continue to stabilize after last year's collapse. Gains in factory activity are, however, likely to be modest amid renewed dollar strength following the election of Donald Trump as the next president. 
Since the Nov. 8 election, the dollar has surged more than 4 percent against the currencies of the United States' main trading partners as investors viewed the president-elect's proposed fiscal policy as inflationary. 
But Trump's plan to increase infrastructure spending could offer some boost to manufacturing and benefit heavy machinery makers such as  Caterpillar  (N:CAT), whose profit has been hurt by poor demand for construction equipment.
Last month, the ISM production sub-index increased 1.4 percentage points and a gauge of new orders rose 0.9 percentage point. While a measure of factory employment fell last month, manufacturing payrolls remained above expansion territory.
The ISM survey also showed bottlenecks starting to emerge, with a measure of supplier deliveries surging 3.5 percentage points last month to its highest reading since December 2014, indicating longer delivery delays.
Manufacturers who participated in the ISM survey reported increasing demand, some tightness in the labor market and plans to reduce inventory by the end of the year. 
""While we are gaining confidence that the manufacturing sector is starting to improve, the recent dollar appreciation may prove to be a headwind for the sector over time,"" said Daniel Silver, an economist at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) in New York. 
The dollar was trading lower against a basket of currencies on Thursday. Prices for U.S. government bonds also fell as did stocks on Wall Street.
CLAIMS RISE
Though a second report on Thursday showed the number of Americans claiming unemployment benefits rising to a its highest level in five months last week, labor market strength remains intact, with layoffs falling 12 percent in November. 
The Labor Department said initial claims for state unemployment benefits increased 17,000 to a seasonally adjusted 268,000 for the week ended Nov. 26. That was the highest reading since June and marked the second straight week of increases. 
Despite the increase, claims remained below the 300,000 threshold, which is associated with a healthy labor market, for the 91st straight week. That is the longest run since 1970, when the labor market was much smaller.
Jobless claims, which hit a 43-year low in mid-November, tend to be volatile at this time of the year as the model the government uses to strip out seasonal fluctuations from the data does not fully account for changes in the timings of different holidays.
The four-week moving average of claims, considered a better measure of labor market trends as it irons out week-to-week volatility, edged up 500 to 251,500 last week.
""The ongoing low level of claims should give the Fed comfort that labor markets continue to tighten. We view incoming claims data as very supportive of further improvement in labor market conditions this year,"" said Rob Martin, an economist at  Barclays  (LON:BARC) in New York. 
Last week's claims data has no bearing on November's employment report, which is scheduled for release on Friday, as it falls outside the survey period. 
New filings for jobless benefits fell between the October and November survey weeks, supporting expectations for another month of solid employment gains. According to a Reuters survey of economists, nonfarm payrolls probably increased by 175,000 jobs last month after rising 161,000 in October.
In a third report, global outplacement consultancy Challenger, Gray & Christmas said U.S.-based employers announced plans to lay off 26,936 workers last month, down from the 30,740 job cuts announced in October.

Jobs cuts in November were concentrated in the retail sector, with 4,850 announced layoffs, most of which stemmed from the bankruptcy of American Apparel. The retail losses were, however, more than offset by a surge in holiday hiring.

The Institute of Supply Management and Markit Economics released their monthly reports on US manufacturing on Thursday.
The ISM purchasing manager's index (PMI) rose to 53.2 in November (52.5 expected.) Regional data received over the past month suggested improvement in the sector and had pointed to a strong national reading.
ISM's report showed that manufacturing production and new orders improved in November, while employment slipped. Business inventories remained in contractionary territory, with a sub-index reading of 49 — below the 50 threshold of expansion.
US manufacturers are slowly picking themselves out of a rut that was triggered, in part, by the dollar's rapid rise in 2014. The dollar rose as investors bet that higher interest rates and inflation were coming. They turned super bullish again in November after Donald Trump was elected, sending the dollar to the  highest level since 2003. A stronger dollar makes it more expensive for people outside the US to buy American products.
""The stronger dollar is hurting exporters, but the flip-side of the exchange rate appreciation is lower import costs, which have in turn helped to ameliorate the impact of rising global commodity prices compared to other countries,"" said Chris Williamson, Markit's chief business economist.
Markit  reported its index at 54.1, up from 53.9 in its flash reading. Manufacturing output rose at the fastest pace in 20 months. Many contacts told Markit that clients were more willing to spend with the  uncertainty over the election over.
""Both production and order books are growing at impressive rates, fueled predominantly by rising domestic demand for goods from both consumers and businesses,"" Williamson said."

1371,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 01, 2016 09:19AM ET</span>",Global factories had bumper November but growth may have peaked,"By Jonathan Cable and Saikat Chatterjee
LONDON/HONG KONG (Reuters) - Manufacturers around the globe performed strongly in November, but concerns about the protectionist leanings of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump and an OPEC-induced oil price rally could curtail future growth.
Factories across Asia and Europe ramped up activity and data due later on Thursday from the United States are expected to show manufacturers in the world's largest economy also pushed harder on the accelerator.
But some analysts cautioned November might be as good as it gets as the effects of vast monetary stimulus from central banks wear off.
""The strength in PMI numbers is unlikely to be sustained as much of it can be explained by previous stimulus measures,"" said Julian Evans-Pritchard at Capital Economics. 
Policymakers at the European Central Bank are expected to announce an extension to their asset purchase program when they meet next week even after euro zone manufacturers enjoyed their best month in November since the start of 2014 and inflationary pressures, while still mild, picked up. 
IHS Markit's final manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index for the euro zone chalked up its highest reading since January 2014 in November, registering 53.7, in line with an earlier flash estimate and ahead of October's 53.5. Anything above 50 indicates growth. 
But British manufacturing growth cooled unexpectedly as factories grappled with soaring costs caused by the slump in sterling after Britain voted to leave the European Union. The weaker pound also failed to boost export orders as much as in previous months. 
The Markit/CIPS UK PMI fell to 53.4 from 54.2, confounding expectations for a rise to 54.5 in a Reuters poll of economists.
James Smith at ING noted the British PMI figure was still higher than the immediate post-Brexit dip, but forecast a tougher environment ahead.
""We expect domestic demand to slow quite considerably next year as consumer spending gets hit by falling real wages and investment slows in response to post-Brexit uncertainty,"" he said.
Britain's economy has performed much better than expected since the vote to quit the EU. But a bigger test will come next year when inflation is predicted to rise sharply, eating into households' spending power that had just started to recover.
Also consuming cash will be more expensive oil. Crude prices bubbled to a six-week high on Thursday after the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries agreed on Wednesday to cut output for the first time since 2008. [MKTS/GLOB]
ASIAN TIGERS PURRING 
There were stronger PMIs in China, Taiwan and Vietnam, and while activity in Japan's factories was still growing in November, the pace was slower. However, an uncertain outlook for global trade is worrying for Asia's export-driven economies.
""We are still waiting very much to see what the Trump presidency will mean for things like trade policies and trade restrictions,"" Louis Kuijs, head of Asia economics at Oxford Economics, said. 
Trump has declared his intention to withdraw from an Asia-Pacific free trade agreement once he is inaugurated on Jan. 20, and his protectionist comments while campaigning for the presidency could herald problems for Asia.
China's official PMI rose to 51.7 in November from 51.2. The index was stronger than economists polled by Reuters had expected and matched a level last seen in July 2014.
But analysts noted a worrying lack of expansion in new export orders for Chinese factories, suggesting the stronger headline number was a consequence of demand coming from its frothy property sector, which authorities are trying to cool.
The unofficial Caixin survey showed a more modest increase in activity, perhaps because it focuses on smaller firms which benefit less from government support for the economy.
While growth in activity was slower in Japan, a sub-index for new orders, which measures both domestic and external demand, rose to a 10-month high. 
Elsewhere in Asia, the pace of growth in India's factory activity slowed, resulting in the biggest month-on-month decline in its PMI since March 2013.
Analysts said the slowdown was probably due to a slump in demand after Prime Minister Narendra Modi ordered 500 and 1,000 rupee banknotes to be removed from circulation.
South Korean factories showed a fourth consecutive month of slowdown underlying a fragile recovery for Asia's fourth-biggest economy.
In Malaysia, where the ringgit currency has fallen sharply due to capital outflows, the PMI fell to a five month low, hurt by falls in production and new orders.

And in Australia, lower business investment has opened the possibility that the economy shrank last quarter for the first time in almost six years.

1372,By Investing.com,"<span>Dec 01, 2016 08:31AM ET</span>", U.S. jobless claims rise more than expected,"Investing.com - The number of people who filed for unemployment assistance in the U.S. last week increased more than expected last week, but remained in territory consistent with a firming labor market, official data showed on Thursday.
In a report, the U.S. Department of Labor said the number of individuals filing for initial jobless benefits in the week ending November 26 increased by 17,000 to a seasonally adjusted 268,000 from the previous week’s total of 251,000.
Analysts had expected jobless claims to rise by just 2,000 to 253,000 last week.
First-time jobless claims below the 300,000-level are usually associated with a firming labor market.
The Department of Labor indicated that there were no special factors impacting this week’s initial claims and that it marked 91 consecutive weeks of initial claims below 300,000, the longest streak since 1970.
Continuing jobless claims in the week ended November 19 unexpectedly rose to 2.081 million from 2.043 million in the preceding week.
Analysts had expected continuing claims to decrease to 2.040 million.
The four-week moving average was 251,500, a rise of 500 from the previous week's 251,000.
The monthly average is seen as a more accurate gauge of labor trends because it reduces volatility in the week-to-week data.
Immediately after the report, EUR/USD was trading at 1.0625 from around 1.0623 ahead of the release of the data, GBP/USD was at 1.2643 from 1.2639 earlier, while USD/JPY traded at 114.26 compared to 114.28 before the release.

1373,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 01, 2016 07:30AM ET</span>",Italy's GDP revisions give Renzi good news before referendum,"By Gavin Jones and Isla Binnie
ROME (Reuters) - Italy's economy rebounded in the third quarter and estimates of growth in previous quarters were revised upwards, which could help Prime Minister Matteo Renzi in a referendum on which he has staked his career.
Gross domestic product rose 0.3 percent quarter on quarter from July to September, the national statistics bureau ISTAT reported on Thursday, in line with its preliminary estimate issued last month.
However, on a year-on-year basis, growth was revised up to 1.0 percent from 0.9 percent, and ISTAT also raised its previous estimates of growth in the second and the first quarters.
As a result, the government looks likely to meet or slightly exceed its forecast for growth in 2016 of 0.8 percent, which it lowered in September from 1.2 percent.
In a post on his Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) page, Renzi called the data ""a great result"" three days before a referendum on constitutional reform.
The premier has said he will resign if Italians reject his proposals to drastically reduce the role of the upper house, the Senate, and take back powers from regional authorities.
The growth rate of 0.3 percent in July-to-September compared with the previous three months marked an acceleration from 0.1 percent in the second quarter, which was revised up from a previous flat reading.
However, Renzi's full-year growth target of 0.8 percent this year is only marginally above last year's 0.7 percent and would leave Italy in its customary position as one of the most sluggish euro zone economies.
All opinion polls on the referendum published in the month before a Nov. 18 legal cut-off put the 'No' camp ahead, and dissatisfaction with the economy has weighed on Renzi's popularity.
""If you look around, you see stagnation. More businesses keep closing, the real estate market has fallen,"" said Giorgio Marchini, a 60-year-old bank manager from Rome. ""I feel so angry that so many years have been lost. Of course, signs of growth are encouraging, but it's not sufficient.""
ISTAT also reported on Thursday that the unemployment rate edged down to 11.6 percent in October. But some 30,000 jobs were lost from the month before and, as with economic growth, Italy's rate compared badly with its euro zone partners.
Average joblessness in the 19-nation currency bloc declined to a seven-year-low of 9.8 percent, Eurostat reported.
""There are zero possibilities in Italy, except for those entirely based on precarious work,"" said Emilio Bellezza, a 28- year-old sociology student from Rome. ""There is a total lack of prospects, they just don't exist.""
Italian joblessness has been oscillating between 11.4 percent and 11.7 percent for the last 15 months, despite a contested labour market reform introduced by Renzi last year intended to make hiring and firing easier.
October's rate was down from 11.7 percent in September but higher than August's 11.5 percent.
Moreover, the marginal fall in the unemployment rate was caused by people withdrawing from the labour market altogether, not to more people finding work. A net 30,000 jobs were lost from the month before.
Italy's overall employment rate, one of the lowest in the euro zone, slipped to 57.2 percent in October from 57.3 percent in September.

The third-quarter GDP data showed consumer spending, investments and inventory accumulation each contributed 0.1 percentage points to quarterly growth. That was partly offset by a negative contribution from trade flows.

1374,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 01, 2016 05:10AM ET</span>","U.S. small business borrowing falls, delinquencies tick up","By Ann Saphir
(Reuters) - Borrowing by small U.S. firms slipped in October to the lowest since January, and the percentage of firms late on repaying existing loans rose to its highest in nearly four years, data released on Thursday showed.
The Thomson Reuters/PayNet Small Business Lending Index fell to 121.3 from a downwardly revised 128.8 in September. Measured from a year earlier, it was the fifth straight monthly decline, with the index at its lowest point since January.
Companies also struggled to pay back existing debts, PayNet data showed. Loans more than 30 days past due rose in October to 1.68 percent, the seventh straight monthly increase and the highest delinquency rate since November 2012.
Still, PayNet CEO and founder Bill Phelan sees a glass half full in the numbers, noting that a delinquency of 2 percent or higher was the norm for most of the pre-crisis era when the lending index was at a similar level.
Now that the U.S. presidential election is over, Phelan said, ""we are getting more clarity"" on the direction of policy, a positive point for small business. A reduction in uncertainty, he said, ""will remove some of the funk.""
Movements in the index typically correspond with movements in gross domestic product growth a quarter or two ahead. Economic growth in the United States sped up in the third quarter to a 3.2 percent pace, data released this week showed.
Small business borrowing is a key barometer of growth because small companies tend to do much of the hiring that drives economic gains.
PayNet collects real-time loan information such as originations and delinquencies from more than 325 leading U.S. lenders.

Thursday's Markit/CIPS UK Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) fell to 53.4 from 54.2 in October, undershooting expectations for a rise to 54.5 in a Reuters poll of economists.
Survey compiler IHS Markit said manufacturing looks set to contribute to economic growth in the fourth quarter, pointing to a ""solid"" rate of expansion that remains above its long-run trend.
Britain's economy has performed much better than expected since June's vote to quit the EU. But a bigger test will come next year when inflation is expected to rise sharply, eating into households' spending power.
The PMI's gauge of prices paid by factories for materials and energy shot up at a rate just shy of October's near six-year high, while prices of finished goods also rose sharply again.
A clear majority of respondents who offered a reason for rising costs pointed to the weakness of the pound, which is down around 19 percent against the U.S. dollar compared with its level before June's vote for Brexit.
""The concern is that higher costs may in time offset any positive effect of the weaker exchange rate, especially given that export order-book growth has already waned markedly from September's five-and-a-half year high,"" said Rob Dobson, senior economist at IHS Markit.
Almost all economists polled by Reuters expect consumer price inflation to overshoot the Bank of England's 2 percent target next year.
A manufacturing survey from the Confederation of British Industry published last week showed the biggest increase in price pressures for nearly three years, although new orders rose at the fastest rate since before the Brexit vote.
The outlook for business investment is another doubt hanging over the British economy next year. The IHS Markit survey showed signs of weakness.
""The trend in new orders for investment goods such as plant and machinery has eased sharply so far in the fourth quarter and will need to improve if investment is to continue to contribute positively to economic growth,"" Dobson said.
Manufacturers hired staff at a slightly slower pace than in October, the PMI showed.
The PMI surveys often differ with official data on Britain's manufacturing sector. In the July-September period, manufacturing shrank by almost 1 percent in quarterly terms, the Office for National Statistics said last week.

1378,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 01, 2016 04:38AM ET</span>",Solid growth in German manufacturing points to fourth-quarter rebound,"BERLIN (Reuters) - German manufacturing growth slowed slightly in November, but solid demand from domestic and foreign customers kept it robust overall, a survey showed on Thursday, suggesting that factories will contribute to a rebound in the fourth quarter.
Markit's Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) for manufacturing, which accounts for about a fifth of Europe's largest economy, fell to 54.3 from 55.0 in October, which was the highest level in nearly three years.
The November reading was a tick below a flash reading of 54.4 points, but comfortably above the 50 line that separates growth from contraction.
IHS Markit economist Oliver Kolodseike said the average reading over the fourth quarter so far was the best since the beginning of 2014, suggesting manufacturing should make a positive contribution to growth at the end of the year.
New order intakes rose a bit less sharply than in the previous two months. Still, the overall growth pace was robust, with panellists pointing to increased demand from both the domestic and foreign markets such as China and Russia.
Sector data showed producers of consumer and intermediate goods recorded solid growth. Manufacturers of investment goods reported weaker expansions.
Supporting this mixed picture in manufacturing, orders for German machines fell by 10 percent in real terms from the previous year in October, the VDMA engineering association said on Thursday.
The drop was driven by a 15 percent decline in orders from abroad, while demand from domestic customers rose 1 percent.
Production in engineering nearly stagnated in the first nine months of 2016, edging up by just 0.4 percent on the year.
""This meets our expectations of overall stagnating production in the engineering sector in the whole year,"" VDMA chief economist Ralph Wiechers.
In the broader manufacturing sector, companies continued to hire new staff in November as they tried to raise capacity, the PMI survey showed. Although the rate of job creation slowed, it remained among the strongest seen in the past five years.
""Moreover, with backlogs rising sharply and companies ramping up their purchasing activity, it is likely that the positive trend in the sector continues into the new year,"" Kolodseike said.
German economic growth slowed over the summer as exports weakened, with growth in gross domestic product halving to 0.2 percent on the quarter in the three months through September. The economy is expected to rebound in the fourth quarter.

For 2016 as a whole, the government expects domestic demand to propel growth of 1.8 percent, the highest in five years. For 2017, Berlin predicts a slowdown to 1.4 percent because of weaker exports and fewer working days.

1379,By Investing.com,"<span>Dec 01, 2016 04:32AM ET</span>",U.K. manufacturing PMI unexpectedly drops in November on weak pound,"Investing.com - Manufacturing activity in the U.K. registered an unexpected decline in November due to a weak pound that is driving price pressures, industry data showed on Thursday.
In a report, market research group Markit said that its U.K. manufacturing PMI fell to a seasonally adjusted 53.4 last month from a reading of 54.2 in October.
Analysts had expected the index to increase to 54.5 in November.
On the index, a reading above 50.0 indicates industry expansion, below indicates contraction.
Markit pointed out that the weak exchange rate was driving up input costs and noted that while growth of production and orders lost impetus, it remained above long-run trends.
The report indicated that it was the fourth consecutive month of growth for the U.K. manufacturing sector.
“There were also signs that the weak exchange rate was having a continued sharp cost inflationary impact, leading to higher selling prices at the factory gate,” the market research group said.
Rob Dobson, senior economist at survey compiler Markit, noted that the exchange rate was having a “major impact” at manufacturers.
“On the plus side, the boost to export competitiveness is leading to increased inflows of new export business,” Dobson said.
“However, 84% of manufacturers offering a reason for higher purchase prices made at least some reference to rising import costs due to the exchange rate,” he added noting that selling prices rose to one of the greatest extents in the past five-and-a-half years.
Dobson warned that the concern would be if higher costs offset any positive effect of the weaker exchange rate.
“As the recent period of uncertainty recedes, fears over rising inflation and the ambiguity around the possible impact of Brexit negotiations, could restrain additional growth in the coming months,” Dave Nobel, chief executive of the Chartered Institute of Procurement & Supply that participates in the elaboration of the survey, concluded.
Immediately after the report, GBP/USD was trading at 1.2512 from around 1.2527 ahead of the release of the data, EUR/GBP was at 0.8480 compared to 0. 8473 prior to the report, and GBP/JPY traded at 143.00 compared to 143.04 earlier.
Meanwhile, European stock markets were trading lower. London’s FTSE 100 lost 0.65%, the  Euro Stoxx 50 gave up 0.68%, France's CAC 40 fell 0.53%, while Germany's DAX traded down 0.72%."

That will please policymakers at the European Central Bank, who are expected to announce an extension to their asset purchase program when they meet next week, a Reuters poll found last month [ECILT/EU].
IHS Markit's final manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index for the euro zone chalked up its highest reading since January 2014 in November, registering 53.7, in line with an earlier flash estimate and ahead of October's 53.5. Anything above 50 indicates growth.
However, a sub-index measuring output, which feeds into a composite PMI due on Monday that is seen as a good overall growth indicator, dipped to 54.1 from 54.6.
""The November survey provided firm evidence that the weaker euro is providing a meaningful stimulus to manufacturing,"" said Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit.
""While the ECB looks poised to extend its quantitative easing program at its December meeting, the upturn in growth and inflationary pressures will further fuel talk of whether we could see the ECB start tapering its asset purchases next year.""
An index measuring output prices climbed to 51.4 last month, up from October's 50.8. The November reading was the highest in more than five years.

Euro zone inflation inched up another tenth of a percentage point in November, official data showed on Wednesday. Consumer prices rose 0.6 percent year-on-year, still well below the ECB's target of close to but below 2 percent.

BEIJING (Reuters) - Activity in China's manufacturing sector grew more than expected in November, expanding at its strongest pace in more than two years, as the world's second-largest economy picks up momentum heading into what promises to be a tumultuous 2017.
After a rocky start to the year, China's factories have perked up in recent months, buoyed by a government infrastructure building spree and a housing boom that is starting to show signs of fatigue.
Growth has also accelerated in the services sector to levels not seen since 2014, pointing to improvement not only in heavy industries like steel but also in the broader economy.
""The next move by the central bank will be an (interest rate) hike instead of a cut,"" said Raymond Yeung, chief economist of Greater China for ANZ in Hong Kong.
""But we believe that won't happen over the next 12 months because the current environment is still very vulnerable.""
The official Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) rose to 51.7 in November from previous month's 51.2 and above the 50-point mark that separates growth from contraction on a monthly basis.
November's reading was above the prediction of a Reuters poll for 51.0 and matched a previous high in July 2014. The last time China's PMI was higher was in April 2012, when it was 53.3.
The official survey also pointed to building inflationary pressures, as the construction frenzy and reductions in excess industrial capacity have spurred a spectacular months-long rally in Chinese commodity prices.
A sub-index for raw materials prices jumped to 68.3 in November from 62.6 in October, and a drop in inventories suggested a fresh round of factory restocking ahead.
But ANZ's Yeung doesn't think the higher producer prices will present immediate challenges for the central bank as they won't filter through to consumers until the end of next year.
Moreover, commodities' futures prices have plunged this week, with steel seeing its worst one-day plunge on record, as major trading exchanges took further steps to curb speculation.
ECONOMY STABILIZING, BRACING FOR A BUMPY RIDE
China's economy expanded at a steady 6.7 percent clip in the third quarter and looks set to hit Beijing's full-year target of 6.5 to 7 percent, fueled by stronger government spending, record bank lending and the red-hot property market that are adding to its growing pile of debt.
Factory output quickened in November, with the sub-index rising to 53.9 from 53.3, the official survey showed.
Total new orders saw another month of solid improvement, rising to 53.2 from October's 52.8.
But large firms continued to outperform smaller ones, with the gap widening in November, highlighting that the government's dependence on big state firms for growth this year has not changed.
Indeed, an independent factory survey published by Caixin/Markit on Thursday focusing on smaller companies showed more modest growth that slowed from October.
""Overall, we judge that the economy has gained momentum in the short term but the quality of growth may have deteriorated, as evidenced by a further drop in the official PMI for small enterprises and a drop in the Caixin PMI,"" economists at Nomura said in a note.
A measure of construction industry activity in a separate non-manufacturing survey published Thursday stood at 60.4, softening from 61.8 in October but still high as the government races to build new roads, rail lines and ports to buoy growth.
But the property sector saw a not-too-surprising fall as the sizzling housing market cools down following a slew of tightening measures imposed by policymakers who are fearful of a property bubble.
New export orders also increased, though they were barely in expansionary territory.
Any pickup in external demand will be welcome for China's massive factory sector as the housing boom looks set to fade and worries grow about a potential trade war with the United States as President-elect Donald Trump prepares to take charge.
During the election campaign, Trump had threatened to slap high tariffs on Chinese goods and said he would brand China a currency manipulator on Jan. 20, his first day in office.
Trump's upset win has already fueled a surge in the U.S. dollar, helping to push the yuan currency to 8-1/2-year lows and threatening China's policymakers with a surge in capital outflows.
A separate reading on the services sector also showed the pace of growth quickened in November from the previous month.
The official non-manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) stood at 54.7 in November, the strongest since June 2014.
That compared with the previous month's reading of 54.0 and remained well above the mark that separates growth from contraction on a monthly basis.

NEW YORK/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President-elect Trump's nominee for Treasury Secretary, Steven Mnuchin, on Wednesday waded into the long-running battle over the future control of  Fannie Mae  and  Freddie Mac , the largest players in the U.S. home mortgage market, saying that the lenders should be returned to private control. 
Fannie and Freddie stood at the center of the 2008 financial crisis. When the U.S. housing market collapsed beginning in 2006, it crippled their finances and forced a taxpayer-financed rescue totaling $188 billion to help thwart the disintegration of the U.S. financial system.
The Obama administration has argued for the past eight years that Congress should pass legislation to reform the housing-finance system but repeated efforts since the 2008 crisis to reform the two lenders and cut their ties to the federal government have foundered. 
On Wednesday, Trump's pick for Treasury secretary said extracting Fannie and Freddie from government control would rank as a ""top 10"" priority for the next administration.
""We've got to get Fannie and Freddie out of governmentownership,"" Mnuchin said in comments that sent shares of Fannie (PK:FNMA) and Freddie (PK:FMCC) rocketing to their highest levels since September 2014. ""It makes no sense that these are owned by the governmentand have been controlled by the government for as long as theyhave,"" Mnuchin said in an interview on Fox Business Network. 
Since they were rescued in 2008, both lenders have operated under the ""conservatorship"" of the U.S. Treasury but both are now profitable again and have returned more than $240 billion to federal government coffers. The two so-called government-sponsored enterprises, or GSEs, help the U.S. housing finance market by buying the mortgage loans made by banks, freeing up space on lenders' balance sheets to generate more loans. 
Fannie and Freddie bundle those loans into marketable debt securities, highly prized by global investors because they enjoy an effective guarantee against default from the U.S. government. 
In turn, that keeps American mortgage rates low and allows borrowers to finance homes at fixed rates for as long as 30 years, a unique feature of the U.S. housing market.
Any significant change to that special guarantee relationship could send U.S. home financing costs higher, or even lead to the elimination of some products like the 30-year fixed-rate loan.But the government backing also allows Fannie and Freddie to tap global debt markets at rates far below other private borrowers and are seen as crowding out private lending in the mortgage market while raising the risk to the government of future defaults. 
On Tuesday, Mnuchin said he planned to eliminate government control of the companies but offered few details.
While the incoming Trump administration could tinker with Fannie and Freddie policies, reforming the agencies would take an act of Congress. ""We'll make sure that when they're restructured, they'reabsolutely safe and they don't get taken over again,"" saidMnuchin, a former Goldman Sachs (N:GS) banker. Fannie shares soared 32 percent on Wednesday to $4.08, whileFreddie rose 31 percent to $3.99.
REFORM FIGHT
Any reform push for Fannie and Freddie will likely pit housing market advocates, who argue the two companies help keep mortgage rates low and encourage U.S. home ownership, against fiscal conservatives in Congress.
Without a secondary market, mortgage interest rates would be unnecessarily higher and unaffordable for many Americans, a spokesman for the National Association of Realtors said on Tuesday.
But Texas Republican Congressman Jeb Hensarling, the chair of the House Financial Services Committee, has argued that Fannie and Freddie should be wound down, while Tennessee Republican Senator Bob Corker also backs the elimination of Fannie and Freddie to reduce the government's risk. 
Market participants were skeptical a full separation from the government was in the offing.
""People don't expect the government to just step away from the GSEs,"" said Larry Milstein, head of government and agency trading at R.W. Pressprich & Co in New York.
The federal government has controlled both Fannie and Freddie since 2008 and the U.S. Treasury has warrants that give it the right to a 79.9 percent ownership stake but has not exercised those warrants.
So both lenders' shares are still publicly traded and backed by some prominent investors who have advocated for their return to private control.
Mutual fund Fidelity, along with Bill Ackman's Pershing Square (NYSE:SQ), and the Fairholme Funds, run by Bruce Berkowitz, are major shareholders. 

Both Fairholme and Ackman have lawsuits outstanding over governments control of Fannie and Freddie.

The bank noted the ""strong dollar"" was a headwind for the economy, indicating there was mild demand for manufactured goods overall. The study of the 12 fed districts across the U.S. said that employment ""continued to expand,"" and the wage growth was moderate.
Most Fed districts reported higher retail sales, most significantly in apparel and furniture. Single family housing construction starts were a bit higher in most districts. Car sales declined, however.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. economy continued to expand in October and November, the Federal Reserve said on Wednesday, but there were only modest gains in wages and prices and the strong dollar was weighing on manufacturers.
Seven of the U.S. central bank's 12 districts around the country reported a tightening in labor market conditions, the Fed said in its Beige Book report of anecdotal information collected from business contacts.
The Fed said activity varied across regions but that the outlooks were mainly positive, with six districts expecting ""moderate"" growth.
""As in the past four Beige Books, wage growth was characterized generally as modest, on balance, by district contacts,"" the Fed said.
A lack of wage pressures has been a thorn in the Fed's side as it seeks to raise interest rates. Despite the U.S. labor market nearing full employment, economists have yet to see that spark broad-based higher wages and in turn higher inflation.
U.S. central bank policymakers have sought in recent weeks to lay the groundwork for a possible interest rate hike this year after holding off earlier amid economic uncertainty.
Uncertainty over the Nov. 8 presidential election was reported as causing a modest softening of activity in some districts, including vehicle sales in the St. Louis and Richmond districts and hiring activity in Cleveland, the Fed said.
Hiring activity was uneven among districts, as Boston reported ""fairly strong activity"" with staffing firm revenues increasing 10 percent to 25 percent year-on-year. Staffing firms in Cleveland attributed a modest decline in job openings and placements to election uncertainty.
Motor vehicle sales declined slightly in most reporting districts during the reporting period, with Kansas City reporting sales well-below year-earlier levels. New vehicle sales in Chicago were characterized as strong, but supported by high incentives.
The Fed raised rates from near zero for the first time in a decade last December, and has emphasized the pace of any further interest rate rises will be historically slow.
The Beige Book was compiled by the Cleveland Fed with information collected on or before Nov 18, 2016.

1404,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 30, 2016 11:18AM ET</span>","U.S. private jobs, consumer spending data support Fed rate hike","By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. private employers stepped up hiring in November and consumer spending increased last month, the latest signs of economic strength that could further cement the case for an interest rate hike from the Federal Reserve next month.
The data on Wednesday also showed income rising solidly and savings climbing to a seven-month high in October, positioning households to boost spending in the future.
""There is nothing in today's reports that put a roadblock in front of a Fed rate hike in December. The economy continues to move ahead powered by the American consumer who has got the income to both spend and save for a rainy day,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG Union Bank in New York.
The ADP National Employment Report showed that private payrolls increased by 216,000 jobs this month, well above economists' expectations for a gain of 165,000 jobs. The report is jointly developed with Moody's Analytics.
The ADP figures come ahead of the Labor Department's more comprehensive employment report on Friday, which includes both public and private sector payrolls. Economists polled by Reuters are looking for nonfarm employment to have risen by 175,000 jobs in November after increasing by 161,000 jobs in October.
In a separate report, the Commerce Department said consumer spending, which accounts for about 70 percent of U.S. economic activity, increased 0.3 percent after an upwardly revised 0.7 percent gain in September. Spending in September was previously reported to have risen 0.5 percent. 
A third report showing a marginal increase in contracts to buy previously owned homes last month, however, put a wrinkle in an otherwise brightening economic outlook.
The consumer spending and private hiring reports added to data on residential construction, home sales, inflation and manufacturing that have suggested the economy sustained its momentum early in the fourth quarter after growing at its quickest pace in two years in the July-September period.
The government reported on Tuesday that gross domestic product increased at a 3.2 percent annual rate in the third quarter, driven by strong consumer spending and a surge in soybean exports. 
A strengthening economy, together with a labor market that is near full employment could make the Fed comfortable to hike rates at its Dec. 13-14 policy meeting. The U.S. central bank raised its overnight benchmark interest rate last December for the first time in nearly a decade. 
The dollar (DXY) was trading higher against a basket of currencies, while prices for U.S. government bonds fell. Stocks on Wall Street generally rose, with both the Dow Jones industrial average (DJI) and the S&P 500 index (SPX) hitting record intraday highs.
INFLATION GAINING
Consumer spending could get further support next year if U.S. President-elect Donald Trump's proposals to cut taxes and boost spending are approved by Congress.
With consumer spending firming, inflation continued to gain in October. The personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index rose 0.2 percent after similar increases in both August and September. In the 12 months through October the PCE price index rose 1.4 percent, the biggest advance since October 2014, after increasing 1.2 percent in September.
Excluding food and energy, the so-called core PCE price index gained 0.1 percent after rising by the same margin in September. That left the year-on-year increase in the core PCE at 1.7 percent in October. The core PCE has increased by that same margin for three straight months.
The core PCE is the Fed's preferred inflation measure and is running below its 2 percent target.
""The bottoming out in energy prices earlier this year has contributed to stronger overall inflation,"" said Gus Faucher, deputy chief economist at PNC Financial (NYSE:PNC) in Pittsburgh. 
""Inflation will continue to pick up over the next couple of years. Stronger wage growth as the labor market continues to tighten will lead firms to raise prices, as will the pass-through of higher energy prices throughout the broader economy.""
The sustained uptick in price pressures, however, curbed the gain in inflation-adjusted consumer spending, which increased 0.1 percent last month after rising 0.5 percent in September. That suggests some moderation in consumer spending this quarter from the third quarter's solid 2.8 percent pace.
Overall consumer spending in October was supported by a 1.0 percent increase in purchases of long-lasting manufactured goods such as automobiles. Spending on services fell 0.2 percent. 
Personal income rose 0.6 percent last month after increasing 0.4 percent in September. Wages and salaries advanced 0.5 percent for a second straight month. 

Savings increased to $860.2 billion, the highest level since March of this year, from $814.1 billion in September.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India posted on Wednesday the world's fastest growth rate for a large economy in the September quarter, yet that offered cold comfort after misery inflicted by the government's unexpected move to remove high denomination banknotes from circulation.
Gross domestic product (GDP) <INGDPQ=ECI> clocked an annual 7.3 percent growth between July and September, faster than 7.1 percent in the previous quarter and higher than China's 6.7 percent.
That impressive headline figure, however, failed to mask the underlying weakness in Asia's third-largest economy.
Not only was the overall growth lower than expected, it was primarily driven by consumer and government spending. Contraction in capital investment deepened.
With Prime Minister Narendra Modi's decision this month to scrap 500 rupee and 1,000 rupee banknotes as part of a crackdown on tax dodgers and counterfeiters denting consumer spending, which makes up 55 percent of India's economy, the outlook for upcoming quarters is not encouraging.
In a country where most people are paid in cash, and buy what they need with cash, Modi's decision has removed 86 percent of the currency in circulation virtually overnight. His shock therapy has left companies, farmers and households suffering.
""Post-demonetization the situation is really grim whether you look at any sector or talk to people,"" said Devendra Kumar Pant, chief economist at India Ratings & Research.
KNOCK-ON EFFECTS
Economists agree the economy will take a hit this quarter and for several quarters to follow. But opinions on the scale of damage vary widely.
Finance Minister Arun Jaitley expects a minor impact lasting for a quarter or two. Private economists, however, reckon the impact would be felt through 2018.
The most optimistic forecasts suggest that India will finish this fiscal year in March with a respectable, but slightly lower, growth rate of 7.3 percent.
But the most pessimistic forecast, from Mumbai-based brokerage Ambit Capital, is for a precipitous drop to 3.5 percent growth.
Modi has sold the move as an attack on the illicit ""black economy"", it is also aimed at shrinking the cash economy which has lasted so long because few Indians have bank cards and infrastructure for online transactions is poor.
According to  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) more than 90 percent of consumer purchases are made in cash, while another study shows 85 percent of workers are paid in cash.
The crackdown will also have a spillover effect for India's formal economy.
Take India's construction sector, for example. It relies on so called ""black money"" for funding, but it accounts for about eight percent of GDP, employs about 40 million people and has a direct bearing on steel, cement and manufacturing companies.
""In terms of the policy implications, today's release is unlikely to have much of an impact,"" said Shilan Shah, India Economist with Capital Economics. ""Attention has already turned to the impact of the government's demonetization measures.""
STRANDED TRUCKS
Supply chains at small, medium and even larger companies are already crumbling. Trucks are stranded with no money for fuel, workers won't load goods for free, and distributors can't pay up. Wholesale markets in many cities are shut.
In the wheat-growing states, farmers have told Reuters they have run out of cash, and as a consequence sales of seeds and fertilizer have plunged halfway through the sowing season.
At least the potential for lower inflation holds out some hope that the Reserve Bank of India will extend its easing cycle with a quick interest rate cut - possibly as early as next month.
""We think that it will attempt to cushion the blow from demonetization,"" said Shah, who expects a 25 basis rate cut at the central bank's policy review meeting on Dec. 6-7.

1415,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 30, 2016 08:31AM ET</span>",Brazil likely to avoid hefty rate cut despite deepening recession,"By Alonso Soto and Silvio Cascione
BRASILIA (Reuters) - Brazil's central bank is widely expected to keep its moderate pace of interest rate cuts on Wednesday due to growing political and market uncertainty clouding the path to recovery from a grueling two-year recession.
Brazil's economy shrank for a seventh straight time in the third quarter, raising pressure on the bank to keep easing policy. However, market turmoil triggered by the election of Donald Trump to the White House and a political scandal at home have investors betting on caution. 
Fifty-four out of 64 analysts surveyed by Reuters believe the bank will cut its benchmark Selic rate  by another 25 basis points to 13.75 percent, its lowest in over a year. The remainder forecast a rate cut of 50 basis points. 
Economic output shrank 0.8 percent in the third quarter from the second, statistics agency IBGE said. There were no bright spots as investments dropped sharply, farmers, manufacturers and service providers all reduced production, and families and government agencies consumed less.
""Fourth-quarter numbers do not give much reason for optimism either. Confidence indicators are signaling they could fall, reflecting some disappointment with how long the economy is taking to lift off,"" said Newton Rosa, chief economist at SulAmerica Investimentos. 
The government last week cut its 2017 growth estimate to 1 percent from 1.6 percent, but some analysts do not rule out a third year of recession with lingering doubts over the government's capacity to shore up its depleted public accounts.
Following Trump's surprise victory on Nov. 8, market volatility spiked on expectations his promises for fiscal stimulus could raise U.S. interest rates and spark a flight of capital from riskier markets. The Brazilian currency  has dropped by more than 6 percent this month, adding pressure on inflation that, despite a recent slowdown, remains well above the 4.5 percent target.
More recently an ethics scandal within President Michel Temer's cabinet has raised fears he could lose support in Congress to push ahead austerity reforms key to allow the central bank to keep lowering some of the world's highest interest rates. 
Even after the Senate approved Temer's proposal to cap federal spending in a first-round vote late on Tuesday, violent demonstrations outside Congress rekindled fears of more street turmoil ahead.
Most analysts predict the bank will wait until its next meeting in January to step up monetary easing in the face of what could be the country's worst recession on record. 

""One possibility is that the board will cut by 25 basis points again but adopt more dovish language, to start paving the way for a faster rate-cutting pace next year,"" analysts with  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP) wrote in a research note.

BRUSSELS/FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Euro zone inflation hit a 31-month high in November, data showed on Wednesday, providing modest relief for the European Central Bank ahead of an interest rate decision next week as price growth finally ticks up after years of flirting with deflation.
Consumer prices rose 0.6 percent year-on-year in November from 0.5 percent a month earlier, the Eurostat data showed, in line with analysts' expectations and the highest reading since April 2014. 
The ECB has provided unprecedented stimulus for years to revive consumer price growth and its president, Mario Draghi, predicted on Wednesday that inflation would finally rise back to the bank's target of almost 2 percent by 2018 or 2019 after missing it for more than three years.
Market-based inflation expectations  are also near their 2016 high in anticipation of a more expansionary U.S. fiscal policy under the new Republican administration with positive spillovers for global, including euro zone, growth. 
However, most of the acceleration in inflation seen so far is the statistical effect of past oil price drops being knocked out of the base figures. The ECB has also warned that underlying inflation remains weak, raising concerns about the sustainability of the current acceleration.
Indeed the key core inflation measure watched by the ECB that excludes volatile unprocessed food and energy prices stood at just 0.8 percent, up from 0.7 percent in October, after flatlining much of this year.
""There are no signs of the underlying price momentum picking up in the eurozone,"" Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) said. ""Today’s data strengthen our expectation that the ECB will extend the bond-buying program by six months to September 2017 at its meeting next week.""
""The ECB is likely to revise its projection for the core inflation rate downwards once again,"" it added.
The ECB will decide next Thursday whether to continue its 1.74 trillion euro bond-buying program beyond its scheduled end next March and markets have fully priced in an extension of the scheme.
""All in all, risks to our projected headline inflation outlook remain balanced. Energy prices momentum may return but we think that core prices remain surrounded by downside risks,""  Barclays  (LON:BARC) said in a note to clients.
Energy prices were 1.1 percent lower in November than a year earlier and services recorded the biggest price growth at 1.1 percent.

Eurostat's flash estimate for the month does not include a monthly calculation.

1424,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 30, 2016 06:30AM ET</span>",Strong German retail sales reinforce hopes of rebound in fourth quarter,"By Joseph Nasr and Michael Nienaber
BERLIN (Reuters) - German retail sales rose at their fastest pace in more than five years in October, data showed on Wednesday, reinforcing expectations that private consumption will propel growth in Europe's largest economy in the fourth quarter.
But the positive effects of private consumption are likely to wane next year, as rising consumer prices and weaker wage increases are expected to discourage Germans from spending.
In addition, the outlook for German exports is clouded by uncertainty linked to Britain's vote to leave the European Union and the election of Donald Trump as U.S. president, who could pursue a protectionist trade agenda.
""The German economy remains on a good path but the outlook for 2017 leads to a foggy environment in which the ship could go slightly off course,"" KfW economist Joerg Zeuner wrote in a note to clients.
The construction sector, which has also been providing impetus for the economy as exports weaken, will also witness a slowdown next year, Zeuner added.
Retail sales rose by 2.4 percent on the month in real terms, the Federal Statistics Office said, the highest increase since June 2011 and more than double the forecast in a Reuters poll for a 1.0 percent rise.
A breakdown of the data suggested that the rise was mainly driven by growth in e-commerce as well as clothing and shoes sales as winter and Christmas approach.
The data, which is often subject to revisions, supports expectations that the economy will grow 0.5 percent in the last quarter, after growth halved to 0.2 percent in the July-Sept. period.
Germany is benefiting from record high employment, which is boosting household spending and government tax receipts. The European Central Bank's expansive monetary policy is also encouraging consumer and state spending.
UNEMPLOYMENT FALLS
Unemployment fell for the 16th consecutive month in November and the jobless rate remained at a record low, data from the Federal Labour Office showed on Wednesday.
The economy is benefiting from increased state spending, mainly to accommodate a record number of more than one million migrants who entered the country since the beginning of 2015.
Bayern LB economist Stefan Kipar said there is no indication that the new arrivals were fuelling unemployment among locals.
""Given the high number of job vacancies, the preconditions for managing the integration into the labor market remain relatively good,"" Kipar added.
The government has also raised funding for urgently needed maintenance work on infrastructure such as schools, bridges and highways.
Chancellor Angela Merkel's cabinet passed a draft law on Wednesday to increase investment in school building renovation, doubling its contribution to a municipal fund to a total of 7 billion euros ($7.5 billion).

In a report, Eurostat said consumer price inflation rose by a seasonally adjusted 0.6% this month, in line with forecasts and following a final reading of a 0.5% advance in October. That was the biggest increase since April 2014.
Core CPI, which excludes food, energy, alcohol, and tobacco costs, increased by a seasonally adjusted 0.8% in November, matching expectations. Core inflation has been at this level for four consecutive months.
Despite the uptick in the headline number, inflation continues to remain far below the ECB’s 2% target despite unprecedented monetary stimulus.
The ECB will hold its next monetary policy meeting on December 8 and is widely expected to announce the extension of its asset purchase program which is currently scheduled to end in March 2017.
ECB president Mario Draghi has recently refused to give further hints on what policy moves the euro area central bank will make at the next meeting.
Both in testimony given yesterday to the European Parliament and in an interview given to the Spanish newspaper El País on Wednesday, Draghi insisted that “this is for the Governing Council to decide and it will do so on December 8.”
Draghi is scheduled to give a keynote speech at the 100th anniversary of the University of Deusto Business School in Madrid, Spain at 7:45AM ET (12:45GMT).

Market research firm GfK said its gauge of consumer confidence slipped to -8 in November from -3 in October.
That was weaker than a median forecast of -4 in a Reuters poll of economists and the index's lowest level since July when it touched -12.
""The slump across the board this month points to continuing uncertainty about the state of the economy among consumers,"" Joe Staton, head of market dynamics at GfK, said.
The index measuring major purchases fell to 5 from 14 in October, also touching its lowest level since July.
""This will be an acute concern for retailers as they
gear-up for the key Christmas selling period,"" Staton said.
""Many are saying that fears about the British economy have been overstated, but time will tell if the pessimism shown in the Index is misplaced or not.""
Recent economic data has shown that consumers did not rein in their spending after the Brexit vote. But that resilience faces a test in 2017 when inflation is expected to rise sharply, hurting spending power.
The European Commission's consumer sentiment survey on Tuesday showed the biggest increase on record for its gauge of British consumer price expectations in the next 12 months, which dates back to 1985.
A separate survey by pensions firms Scottish Friendly showed over half of households are worried about rising food prices and more than four in 10 are anxious about petrol prices.
And another survey commissioned by Lloyds (LON:LLOY) Bank showed overall business confidence among companies fell by five points in November, while a measure of optimism about the economy hit a three-month low.
But confidence in business prospects hit a 10-month high.
""Our November survey shows a small decline in overall confidence but the results as a whole, are consistent with solid economic growth continuing in the fourth quarter,"" Hann-Ju Ho, senior economist for Lloyds Bank Commercial Banking, said.

The GfK survey of 2,039 people was conducted between Nov. 1 and 15. The Scottish Friendly survey of 2,000 people was carried out in October. The Lloyds survey of around 200 companies with turnover above 1 million pounds was conduced between Nov. 2-9.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. economy grew faster than initially estimated in the third quarter, notching its best performance in two years, buoyed by strong consumer spending and a surge in soybean exports.
In a separate report, U.S. home prices rose 5.5 percent in the year to September, meaning house prices overall have now fully recovered from their plunge during the 2008 financial crisis. 
A third report showed U.S. consumer confidence rebounded in November to its highest level in nine years despite uncertainty surrounding the policies of President-elect Trump. 
U.S. stock prices edged higher on Tuesday after the data, with the benchmark S&P 500 index (SPX) now up about 6.0 percent since the Nov. 8 elections. U.S. Treasury yields ended slightly lower on Tuesday but the benchmark ten year note (US10YT=RR) yield has risen about 0.5 percent in the past two weeks, helping to push the U.S. dollar up to its highest levels in more than a decade against major currencies (DXY).
U.S. ECONOMIC GROWTH FASTEST SINCE 2014
U.S. gross domestic product increased at a 3.2 percent annual rate instead of the previously reported 2.9 percent pace, the Commerce Department said in its second GDP estimate on Tuesday. Economists had forecast third-quarter GDP growth being revised up to a 3.0 percent rate.
Growth was the strongest since the third quarter of 2014 and followed the second quarter's anemic 1.4 percent pace. Output was lifted by upward revisions to business investment and home building. 
Exports grew at their quickest pace since the fourth quarter of 2013, driven by a surge in soybean exports after a poor soy harvest in Argentina and Brazil. International trade contributed 0.87 percentage point to GDP growth and not 0.83 percentage point as reported last month. 
Data ranging from housing to retail sales and manufacturing output also suggest the economy retained its momentum early in the fourth quarter even as exports appear to be faltering amid a reversal of the boost to growth provided by soybean exports in the third quarter. 
The Atlanta Fed is currently forecasting GDP rising at a 3.6 percent rate in the fourth quarter, supporting market expectations that the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates next month.
Economic growth could also be supported next year if President-elect Donald Trump succeeds in pushing through Congress a fiscal stimulus plan that includes massive infrastructure spending and tax cuts, analysts said.
""Couple that with an increasingly enthusiastic consumer supported by stronger wage gains and the economy appears well-positioned to remain on a growth path heading into 2017,"" said Jim Baird, chief investment officer at Plante Moran Financial Advisors in Kalamazoo, Michigan.
When measured from the income side (GDI), the economy grew at a 5.2 percent clip amid a rebound in corporate profits. That was the fastest pace of increase in gross domestic income in nearly two years and followed a 0.7 percent rate of expansion in the second quarter. 
The average of GDP and GDI, which economists consider to be a more accurate measure of current economic growth and a better predictor of future output, increased at a 4.2 percent rate in the third quarter, the fastest pace in two years. 
That followed a 1.1 percent rate of increase in the second quarter and likely exaggerates the economy's strength.
CONSUMER SPENDING AND CONFIDENCE UP
The Commerce Department said consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, increased at a 2.8 percent rate in the third quarter and not the 2.1 percent pace reported last month. That was still a slowdown from the second quarter's robust 4.3 percent pace.
With a tight labor market lifting wage growth and boosting household sentiment, consumer spending is likely to gain further momentum for the rest of the year and in 2017. 
A separate report from the Conference Board showed its consumer confidence index surged in November, climbing back to levels seen before the 2008 recession. Consumers were upbeat about the labor market and current business conditions.
Rising house prices are also likely to keep consumption supported. The Standard & Poor's CoreLogic Case-Shiller national home price index rose 5.5 percent in the year to September and is now just above the peak seen in July 2006.
BUSINESS SPENDING MIXED 
Spending on non-residential structures, which include oil and gas wells, was revised sharply higher to show it increasing at its fastest pace since the first quarter of 2014. 
Business spending on equipment, however, fell at a steeper rate than previously reported, declining for a fourth straight quarter. With after-tax corporate profits rising at a 7.6 percent pace last quarter there is scope for business investment to rebound. Corporate profits declined at a 1.9 percent rate in the second quarter.
""The return to positive growth in corporate profits at least satisfies what is probably a necessary, but not sufficient, condition for a rebound in business fixed investment,"" said Andrew Hollenhorst an economist at  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) in New York. Businesses increased spending to restock after running downinventories in the second quarter, but just not as much as previously reported. Businesses accumulated inventories at a $7.6 billion rate in the last quarter, almost half of the $12.6 billion pace reported last month. 
That means inventory accumulation contributed 0.49 percentage point to GDP growth and not the 0.61 percentage point reported last month.
The third-quarter revision showed a much more favorable growth profile for the economy, analysts said. The boost from inventories was not as big as previously estimated, which suggests that businesses are not sitting on piles of unwanted goods. 
This means businesses will have more scope to place new orders, which augurs well for economic growth in the coming quarters. The sharp acceleration in GDP in the last quarter should quash any lingering fears that the economy was at risk of stalling after growth averaged just 1.1 percent in the first half. That together with a labor market that is near full employment and slowly rising inflation could leave the Fed comfortable with raising hike interest rates at its Dec. 13-14 policy meeting. The U.S. central bank raised its overnight benchmark interest rate last December for the first time in nearly a decade.

1443,By Investing.com,"<span>Nov 29, 2016 04:00PM ET</span>",Reserve Bank of New Zealand warns on housing makret risks,"Investing.com - The Reserve Bank of New Zealand on Wednesday warned of increased vulnerabilities in the housing market in the past six months as among the top risks to future financial stability.
In the latest biannual Financial Stability Report, the RBNZ noted that credit to the household sector is growing rapidly and the household debt-to-disposable income ratio now stands at a record high 165%. This is up from 160% in the previous FSR report published in May.
The rise in the ratio is largely due to continued increase in the share of mortgage lending. The increase could undermine the resilience gained as a result of the RBNZ's loan-to-value restrictions on mortgages that have reduced the share of risky loans on bank balance sheets and improved bank resilience to house price falls.
Other concern related to the housing market is Auckland's house price-to-income ratio that at 9.6 is among the highest in the world. The RBNZ said that despite softening in Auckland prices in recent months, it is uncertain whether this will be sustained.
""There is a significant risk of further upward pressure on house prices so long as the imbalance between housing demand and supply remains,"" the RBNZ said.

The Present Situation Index increased from 123.1 to 130.3, whilst the Expectations Index improved from 86.0 last month to 91.7.
""Consumer confidence improved in November after a moderate decline in October, and is once again at pre-recession levels,"" said Lynn Franco, director of economic indicators at The Conference Board. The Index stood at 111.9 in July 2007.
There are a number of factors behind the revised outlook. ""A more favorable assessment of current conditions coupled with a more optimistic short-term outlook helped boost confidence. And while the majority of consumers were surveyed before the presidential election, it appears from the small sample of post-election responses that consumers' optimism was not impacted by the outcome. With the holiday season upon us, a more confident consumer should be welcome news for retailers,"" said Franco.
The monthly survey is based on a probability-design random sample, and is conducted for The Conference Board by Nielsen. The cutoff date for the preliminary results was November 15.
Consumers' assessment of current conditions improved in November. The percentage saying business conditions are ""good"" improved from 26.5% to 29.2%, while those saying business conditions are ""bad"" fell from 17.3% to 14.8%."
1445,By Business Insider,"<span>Nov 29, 2016 10:24AM ET</span>","GDP crushes estimates, thanks to consumer spending","The US economy grew by 3.2% in the third quarter, better than expected and initially reported, according to the second estimate of gross domestic product released Tuesday.
Economists had forecast that the value of every thing produced and every service rendered during the quarter rose at a 3% annualized rate. Last month, GDP was reported at 2.9% based on incomplete data.
Consumer spending was stronger than previously estimated, and was the main reason why overall economic growth was revised higher. Personal consumption grew by 2.8%, up from 2.1% in the Commerce Department's initial estimate.
These upward revisions to growth support the case for the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates at its meeting in December, and make that decision more likely.
Tuesday's report also showed more positive contributions from exports. The  preliminary report showed that much of the growth recorded in Q3 came from stronger  soybean exports, which surged as poor harvests in the largest South American exporting countries gave US producers a gap to fill.
This report included the first snapshot of corporate profits in the third quarter, and showed that companies earned $133.8 billion, a 6.6% increase that was up from a decrease by $12.5 billion (-0.6%) in Q2. Companies on the benchmark S&P 500 index reported six straight quarters of declining profits through Q2, but analysts expected a return to earnings growth in the third quarter.

Seattle recorded the highest year-on-year price increase, up 11%, followed by Portland and Denver.
House prices have been rising as a healthy jobs market and historically low mortgage rates have made homeownership more appealing. Also, constrained supply helped to bid up the prices of existing homes, especially in desirable East and West Coast cities.

""Home prices reaching their nominal pre-recession peaks brings mixed news for the housing market,"" said Ralph McLaughlin, Trulia's chief economist. ""It’s good news for homeowners who are no longer underwater, but not so great news for homebuyers who have seen prices outpace incomes for most of the housing market recovery.""

1448,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 29, 2016 09:02AM ET</span>",German inflation rate unchanged before crucial ECB meeting,"By Michael Nienaber
BERLIN (Reuters) - German inflation unexpectedly remained unchanged in November, data showed on Tuesday, in a sign price pressures are still weak in Europe's biggest economy, despite an economic upturn spurred by the European Central Bank's ultra-loose monetary policy.
The ECB has provided unprecedented monetary stimulus in recent years to boost the economy and fight off deflation. Interest rates have been cut to zero or less and more than a trillion euros has been pumped into the economy through asset purchases.
With economic recovery still fragile and political uncertainties growing, the ECB is widely expected to announce after its meeting next week that its asset-purchase program will be extended beyond March 2017.
German consumer prices, harmonized to compare with other European countries (HICP), rose by 0.7 percent on the year, preliminary data from the Federal Statistics Office showed.
That was unchanged from October's inflation rate, which marked a two-year high, and it came in slightly weaker than a Reuters consensus forecast for a rise to 0.8 percent.
""The main reason for this is that energy prices rose less than expected, but this will change soon,"" DZ Bank economist Michael Holstein said, adding that negative base effects of falling oil prices would fade out in the comings months.
""We expect German annual inflation to reach 1.0 percent in December and possibly 1.5 percent at the beginning of next year,"" Holstein said, pointing to rising rents as one of the strongest inflation drivers in Germany.
On a non-harmonized basis, inflation was also unchanged, at 0.8 percent year-on-year in November, the office said.
Energy prices remained the main drag on the headline figure, falling more strongly than in the previous month, the data showed. Rising costs for food and rents were the most important drivers of inflation. 
For the euro zone overall, economists polled by Reuters so far have expected the inflation rate, due on Wednesday, to edge up to 0.6 percent in November after 0.5 percent in October.
But Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) analyst Marco Wagner said that Germany's unexpectedly weak inflation data, together with Spain's stable inflation reading, now pointed to the euro zone inflation figure also remaining unchanged in November.
Spanish EU-harmonized consumer prices rose by 0.5 percent year-on-year in November, flash data from the National Statistics Institute showed earlier on Tuesday, in line with a Reuters forecast and unchanged from October.
""Therefore, ECB is likely to extend its bond-buying program by six months,"" Wagner said.

The ECB predicts the bloc-wide inflation figure will stay below its target of just under 2 percent for some time despite its stimulus.

ATHENS (Reuters) - Greece's economy expanded for the second quarter in a row and by more than analysts expected in July-September, statistics service data showed on Tuesday, boding well for a stronger recovery next year after a protracted recession.
Revised estimates showed a 0.8 percent expansion rate in the third quarter compared to April-July, when gross domestic product grew 0.4 percent. It was a higher print than a 0.5 percent flash estimate released earlier this month.
Faced with a second bailout review entailing unpopular labour reforms, Athens is keen to show that higher taxes and pension cuts that came with last year's 86 billion euro aid deal will bear fruit and lead to economic recovery.
Recovery will be key to bring down an unemployment rate of nearly 24 percent, the highest in the euro zone, and attain a projected primary budget surplus of 2 percent - excluding debt servicing outlays - demanded by Greece's official creditors.
The seasonally adjusted data showed the 175 billion euro economy expanded at an annual 1.8 percent pace in the third quarter, faster than a previous 1.5 percent estimate.
The revised readings beat market expectations. Analysts polled by Reuters had forecast 0.5 percent quarter-on-quarter growth and a 1.4 percent annual expansion rate in the third quarter.
""The data confirm the economy bottomed out in the second quarter. Domestic demand is strengthening in the second half and a positive reading of 0.1 percent for the full year now appears a plausible scenario,"" said Eurobank chief economist Platon Monokroussos.
The European Commission and Greece's central bank had been projecting a 0.3 percent economic contraction for this year as a whole.
The EU sees the economy rebounding by 2.7 percent next year, while the Bank of Greece projects it will expand by 2.5 percent. The OECD in its latest forecasts sees 1.3 percent growth next year.
Looking at the components of gross domestic product, the increase in economic output was due to stronger private consumption and a positive contribution from net exports.

Consumption grew 2 percent compared to the second quarter, with imports declining by 10.2 percent and exports increasing by 3.7 percent. Gross capital formation fell 30 percent from the previous quarter.

Consumer credit increased last month by 1.62 billion pounds, up from 1.48 billion pounds in September and taking the annual growth rate to 10.5 percent - the strongest since October 2005, Bank of England data showed on Tuesday.
Mortgage approvals for house purchases increased to 67,518 in October from 63,594 in September. Analysts in a Reuters poll had forecast 65,000 mortgage approvals were made in October.
Britain's economy has performed much better than most economists had expected in the immediate aftermath of June's vote to leave the European Union, with households showing few signs of being fazed by the referendum result.
Less comprehensive figures from the British Bankers' Association also showed consumer lending grew in October at the fastest pace in nearly 10 years.
But a much bigger test awaits in 2017.
Rising inflation caused by the pound's post-referendum plunge looks set to squeeze household spending and economists said they still expected business investment to slow.
Recent sentiment surveys suggest households are becoming increasingly concerned about inflation following the pound's post-Brexit vote plunge.
The Bank of England expects consumer price inflation to peak at around 2.75 percent next year - some way above its 2 percent target.
The BoE said business lending increased for a second month in a row, rising 3.15 billion pounds from 1.0 billion in September and marking the largest upturn since February.
Mortgage lending in cash terms increased 3.28 billion pounds, up slightly from September's 3.26 billion pound rise.
Earlier this month the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors said house prices rose in October at the fastest pace since April, adding to tentative signs a recent slowdown in the market is now easing.

The official manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) is expected to come in at 51.0 in November, which would be the fourth straight month of expansion, according to the median forecast of 36 analysts polled by Reuters.
The index hit a two-year high of 51.2 in October as a housing and infrastructure spree has fueled stronger demand and higher prices for building materials, boosting sales for related companies from engineering firms to property agents.
Data on Sunday showed profits at industrial companies rose 9.8 percent in October from a year ago, higher than the rate in September, primarily on the back of strength in high-polluting heavy industry. 
Factory activity in China started to pick up in August, buoyed by a government infrastructure building spree and a housing boom, as well as a loose monetary policy.
Most analysts say the economy will face fresh challenges next year as stimulus wears off and a housing boom slows, though they say the government will likely rely on fiscal measures and refrain from further broad loosening measures. 
October's survey of manufacturers had shown a slightly improved performance by small and medium-sized companies, but large companies fared better as they benefit more from government-directed stimulus measures such as increased infrastructure spending. 
The official manufacturing PMI data will be released on Nov. 1, along with the official non-manufacturing PMI.
Activity in China's services sector in October expanded at the fastest pace since December 2015. Beijing has been counting on a strong services sector to pick up the slack as it tries to shift the economy away from a dependence on heavy industry and manufacturing exports.
The Markit/Caixin PMI, a private gauge of manufacturing activity which focuses more on small- and mid-sized firms, is also due on Nov. 1. 
Analysts expect it to fall to 50.8, compared with the previous month's reading of 51.2.

Exports are expected to rise 1.2 percent this month from a year ago, bouncing from a 3.2 percent decline in October, a Reuters poll found on Monday. Imports are expected to gain 2.9 percent over the same period versus a 4.8 percent drop in October, the same poll showed. 
Shipments have fallen every month of the past two years with the exception of August when they rose.
""It's positive global trade conditions have improved compared to the first half of the year,"" said Na Jung-hyuk, an economist at Hyundai Securities in Seoul.
""Whether this will be sustained is yet to be seen as we're facing a number of global factors that will spark uncertainty, like Donald Trump taking office in the U.S., which will aggravate concerns over protectionism.""

South Korea's inflation rate is expected to pick up for a third straight month to 1.5 percent in November from 1.3 percent in October, the Reuters poll showed, with prices of several global commodities on the rise. 
Fresh produce prices are expected to continue adding inflationary pressure, in addition to the city gas price hike that took effect Nov. 1.
Meanwhile, the same poll saw industrial output likely to slip 0.1 percent on-month in October, down from a 0.3 percent gain seen in September.

1472,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 25, 2016 03:34PM ET</span>",Argentina unemployment drops in breath of fresh air for government,"By Luc Cohen
BUENOS AIRES (Reuters) - Argentina's unemployment rate dropped to 8.5 percent in the third quarter of the year, the government's Indec statistics agency said in a report on Friday, a bright spot in a slew of poor economic data for the recession-stricken country.
That was down from 9.3 percent unemployment in the second quarter, as the total number of unemployed Argentines fell by nearly 100,000 to 1.1 million.
The drop in unemployment came a day after government figures showed economic activity shrank 3.7 percent in September compared with a year earlier. Industrial output fell in September for the eighth straight month.
The decline in joblessness will provide some relief for President Mauricio Macri, whose center-right policies have come under fire from the country's powerful labor unions and Peronist opposition as a promised return to growth in the second half of the year has failed to materialize.
Last week, tens of thousands of protesters marched in Buenos Aires to pressure the government into increasing subsidies for the poor. More than 32 percent of Argentines live in poverty, the government said in September, up from private estimates of 29 percent last December, when Macri took office.
""It's a good figure for the government, which has been politically bruised recently,"" said Hernan Hirsch, chief economist at Argentine consultancy FyE Consult. ""The recession has lasted longer than the government promised, putting their strategy in doubt. A favorable employment figure gives them some political oxygen.""
Hirsch noted that while there was a seasonal component to the drop and many of the gains were concentrated in the less-productive informal sector, the fact that the total unemployment rate fell despite an overall increase in the labor force was encouraging.
Macri won office on promises of attracting foreign investment and reducing poverty, but the anticipated influx of investments has been slower than hoped, and some of the administration's austerity-minded policies, like reducing subsidies for home-heating natural gas, have contributed to inflation, limiting Argentines' purchasing power.
Friday's data marked the second time the government published official unemployment figures since Macri revamped the country's statistics agency, which was widely viewed as manipulating economic data under the populist administration of previous President Cristina Fernandez.

Argentina's gross domestic product is expected to shrink 2 percent in full-year 2016, before rebounding to grow 3.2 percent next year, according to private estimates.

Business investment expanded at a quarterly rate of 0.9 percent in the three months to September, the Office for National Statistics said, beating expectations for a 0.6 percent rise in a Reuters poll of economists.
The ONS confirmed that Britain's economy grew 0.5 percent in the third quarter, helped by a rebound in exports and robust household spending. 
While this resembles a much better performance than most economists had expected in the immediate aftermath of June's Brexit vote, a much bigger test awaits next year.
Rising inflation caused by the pound's post-Brexit vote plunge looks set to squeeze household spending, while there have been concerns that business investment looks set to slow.
""Investment by businesses held up well in the immediate aftermath of the EU referendum, though it's likely most of those investment decisions were taken before polling day,"" Darren Morgan, an ONS statistician, said.
""That, coupled with growing consumer spending fueled by rising household income, and a strong performance in the dominant service industries, kept the economy expanding broadly in line with its historic average.""
Britain's households increased their spending by 0.7 percent in the third quarter, slowing slightly but still helping to drive the economy in the face of uncertainty around Brexit.
Net trade added 0.7 percentage points to economic growth, the biggest positive contribution since early 2014 and helped by strong growth in exports after the pound's post-referendum plunge. 
The economy overall expanded 2.3 percent versus the same period a year earlier, unchanged from a preliminary estimate.
Britain's independent budget forecaster said on Wednesday that the economy looks set to slow sharply next year, expanding by around 1.4 percent, down from about 2.1 percent this year.
Services output increased 0.8 percent in the July-September period, compared with a 0.9 percent slide in manufacturing and a 1.1 percent drop in construction output.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's industrial output was expected to show little change in October, a Reuters poll found, suggesting uninspiring domestic and external demand hampered a steady recovery in production.
Industrial production was seen likely to slip 0.1 percent in October from the previous month, the Reuters poll of 20 analysts showed, after a 0.6 percent rise in September and a 1.3 percent growth in August. 
""Compared with last year and around early this year, the trend of factory output has recovered,"" said Toru Suehiro, senior market economist at Mizuho Securities.
""But it has not returned to a steady recovery path due to sluggish domestic and external demand.""
Analysts say production in sectors such as transport equipment and electronic parts and devices likely stayed solid, but weak exports probably undermined sectors like business- oriented machinery.
The trade ministry will release factory output at 8:50 a.m. on Wednesday, Nov. 30 (2350 GMT, Nov. 29).
The poll found the pace of decline in retail sales and household spending was likely to slow in October but both indicators were nonetheless expected to fall for an eight straight month.
Retail sales were seen falling 1.2 percent in October from a year earlier and household spending likely slipped an annual 0.6 percent, according to the poll.
""Private consumption stayed sluggish but it seems to have hit the bottom and it is in the phase of whether it will return to a moderate recovery,"" said Takeshi Minami, chief economist at Norinchukin Research Institute.
The poll found the unemployment rate would be steady at 3.0 percent in October and the jobs-to-applicants ratio was likely to improve to 1.39, which would be the highest since August 1991 when the ratio was at 1.40. 
The internal affairs ministry will issue household spending and jobs-related data at 8:30 a.m. on Tuesday and the trade ministry will announce retail sales at 8:50 a.m. on the same day.
Japan's economy, the world's third-largest, expanded for a third straight quarter in July-September, but weak domestic activity cast doubt on hopes for a sustainable economic recovery.
The BOJ switched its policy target to controlling interest rates from the pace of money printing in September, but any effect of that change is not expected to show up in next week's data.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's core consumer prices marked their eighth straight month of annual declines in October, illustrating the sheer scale of the central bank's struggle to beat deflation and stagnant growth with diminishing policy options.
The data will keep policymakers under pressure to do more to stimulate the economy, with fiscal spending likely the more preferred option as three years of aggressive easing by the Bank of Japan failed to accelerate inflation to its 2 percent target.
With downward pressure from energy price declines easing and the yen's recent falls seen pushing up import costs, however, some analysts expect consumer prices to rebound early next year.
The nationwide core consumer price index, which includes oil products but excludes volatile fresh food costs, fell 0.4 percent in October from a year earlier after a 0.5 percent drop in September, matching a median market forecast, government data showed on Friday.
While falling gasoline and electricity prices continued to drag down inflation, nearly 60 percent of items making up the index saw prices rise, the data showed.
""We still think that underlying inflation will fall a touch further in coming months in response to the sharp falls in import prices in previous months,"" said Marcel Thieliant, senior Japan economist at Capital Economics.
""However, the output gap (the difference between the economy's potential GDP and actual GDP) has narrowed and we expect it to rise further in coming months, so price pressures should strengthen again before long. What's more, the yen has weakened sharply against the dollar recently. We think that underlying inflation will reach a bottom in the first quarter of next year.""
The so-called core-core inflation index, which excludes food and energy prices and is similar to the core index used in the United States, rose 0.2 percent in October from a year earlier after posting flat growth in the previous month.
Japan's economy expanded for a third straight quarter in the July-September quarter as exports recovered, but weak domestic activity cast doubt on hopes for a sustainable recovery.
The BOJ has acknowledged that it will take time for inflation to accelerate to its target, modifying its policy framework in September to one better suited to a protracted battle against deflation.
It kept policy steady at a subsequent meeting in October despite pushing back the timeframe for hitting its price target.
""There are signs inflation is picking up, so the BOJ is seen maintaining its current policy for the time being,"" said Takeshi Minami, chief economist at Norinchukin Research Institute.
Japanese policymakers are starting to see fiscal stimulus as the most likely next step to spark growth, given uncertainty over incoming U.S. president Donald Trump's trade and currency policies.
While premier Shinzo Abe is unlikely to deploy a huge fiscal stimulus package anytime soon, his administration may consider compiling another small-scale extra budget for the current fiscal year, government officials said.
The yen's recent declines also offer some relief for Japan's export-reliant economy, as big automakers and manufacturers have seen profits hit by the currency's rise earlier this year.

The dollar rose to an eight-month high against the yen on Friday, extending its rally since Trump's election to U.S. President stoked expectations of higher U.S. economic growth and inflation.

ISTANBUL (Reuters) - Turkey raised interest rates for the first time in nearly three years on Thursday, hiking its benchmark rate by a more-than-expected 50 basis points as concerns about a tumbling lira eclipsed President Tayyip Erdogan's calls for cheap credit.
The lira has lost some 14 percent of its value this year and hit a series of record lows, battered by a resurgent dollar following the Donald Trump victory in the U.S. election and by domestic security worries after a failed July coup.
Erdogan, who has described himself as an ""enemy"" of interest rates and chastised banks for what he says is the high cost of credit, wants the central bank to lower rates to spur growth. Investors have long argued the Turkish central bank needs to tighten, citing the inflation risk posed by the weaker currency.
""Today's rate hikes show the extent to which domestic and external conditions have deteriorated, forcing the central bank's hand,"" Nicholas Spiro, a partner at consultancy Lauressa Advisory in London.
""While the surge in the dollar since the U.S. election has put further strain on the lira, it's the escalation in the post-coup crackdown on dissent over the past few months which has unnerved investors the most.""
Investors have been particularly worried about rule of law in Turkey. More than 125,000 people in the military, judiciary and elsewhere have been sacked or suspended while about 36,000 have been jailed pending trial.
The bank raised the benchmark one-week repo rate to 8 percent from 7.5 percent, bigger than the 25 basis point hike forecast by 12 out of 19 economists polled by Reuters.
In another unexpected move, it increased the overnight lending rate - the highest of the multiple rates it uses to set policy - to 8.5 percent from 8.25 percent.
But the increases failed to give the lira a sustained boost. After firming immediately after the decision, it later touched a record low of 3.4430 to the dollar.
14-YEAR EFFORT
""Exchange rate movements due to recently heightened global uncertainty and volatility pose upside risks on the inflation outlook,"" the central bank's monetary policy committee said in its statement.
""The committee decided to implement monetary tightening to contain adverse impact of these developments on expectations and the pricing behavior.""
On the eve of Thursday's meeting, Erdogan said he had a right to criticize the central bank despite its independence.
""Since I took on the job of leading Turkey 14 years ago, I have only fallen short of making headway in a few areas that I desired. One of those is the cutting of interest rates,"" he said in a speech at the stock exchange. 
""I have nothing against the independence of the central bank, but I cannot allow my people's will and rights to be taken away with high interest rates,"" he said.
Analysts said the central bank's moves could go some way to reassure investors.
""Rather than the magnitude of the hike, the important thing was to see that the (central bank) was willing and able to hike rates,"" Yarkin Cebeci, an analyst at JP Morgan said in a note to clients.
""Today's decision also shows that the bank can do more of the same if needed in the coming months.""
Whether that happens may well depend on Erdogan. In his speech on Wednesday night, he reached back to Turkey's Ottoman past for evidence of the perfidy of bankers.

""We are heirs of the Ottoman Empire, a nation that has had its core exploited by banks, bankers and brokers for years,"" he said. ""We are fighting against them over and over again, and it is becoming clear that we were right.""

Inflation in the 12 months through mid-November was 3.29 percent, the national statistics institute said on Thursday, its highest half-month reading since the second half of March 2015.
A Reuters poll projected the rate would accelerate to 3.15 percent from 3.09 percent in early October. Mexico's central bank targets inflation of 3 percent.
The price data are the first inflation figures to be released since the surprise victory of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump on Nov. 8.
Trump's win pushed the peso to record lows and prompted the Mexican central bank to raise rates to their highest in over seven years to stop the peso depreciation fanning inflation.
The annual reading of the core price index <MXCPIC=ECI>, which strips out some volatile food and energy prices, rose to 3.33 percent in early November, its highest since the second half of November 2014.
The core index reflects higher goods costs as the weak peso drives up import prices.

On a monthly basis, Mexican consumer prices <MXCPIF=ECI> rose 0.77 percent during the first half of November, while the core price index <MXCPIH=ECI> climbed 0.23 percent.

BERLIN (Reuters) - Growth in leading euro zone economies slowed over the summer months and an expected German-led rebound at the end of the year may prove too short-lived for the European Central Bank to unwind its monetary stimulus.
Germany's quarterly growth rate halved to 0.2 percent in the three months to September even though private consumption and state spending rose, as weak foreign trade slowed overall activity in Europe's biggest economy.
Confirming a preliminary reading, the Federal Statistics Office said on Thursday that net foreign trade subtracted 0.3 percentage points from GDP growth as exports fell 0.4 percent on the quarter and imports rose 0.2 percent.
State spending increased by 1.0 percent in July-September, contributing 0.2 percentage points to growth. German authorities are spending billions of euros on accommodating and integrating more than one million migrants who have arrived since the start of 2015, many from war zones in Syria and Iraq.
Household spending rose by 0.4 percent, also adding 0.2 percentage points to growth, as consumers benefited from high employment, rising real wages and low borrowing costs.
""Many in Germany like to complain about Mario Draghi's policy of low interest rates, but actually Germany in particular is benefiting from it,"" VP Bank economist Thomas Gitzel said, adding that cheap loans were giving construction a push.
""Also thanks to Draghi, Finance Minister (Wolfgang) Schaeuble is managing the balancing act of increasing investment in public infrastructure without net new debt.""
Investment in construction edged up 0.3 percent in the third quarter while investment in plant and equipment fell by 0.6 percent, a sign that German firms are holding off investment.
In an unusually downbeat report, the ECB said on Thursday that political upheaval on both sides of the Atlantic is raising financial stability risk in the euro zone, which could increase concern about some countries' ability to finance their debt.
Elections and referendums could fundamentally shift the political landscape, triggering sudden capital flows and market volatility, it warned.
STRONG SPAIN
Data for other euro zone countries pointed to a modest and fragile recovery in the 19-member currency bloc, driven mainly by domestic demand.
In Spain, the euro zone's fourth biggest economy, growth slowed slightly to 0.7 percent in the third quarter from 0.8 percent in the April-June.
In France, the bloc's No.2 economy, the central bank predicts growth to double to 0.4 percent in the final quarter from just 0.2 percent in the third. Industrial morale there held steady in November for the third consecutive month.
German business confidence also held steady at a high level in November, suggesting executives remain upbeat following Donald Trump's victory in the U.S. presidential election.
The United States is Germany's most important trading partner and Trump's protectionist rhetoric has unnerved many euro zone exporters - in addition to the uncertainty created by Britain's June vote to leave the European Union.
The Munich-based Ifo economic institute's business climate index was unchanged from 110.4 last month.
""The German economy seems to be unfazed by the election of Donald Trump as U.S. president,"" Ifo chief Clemens Fuest said. ""Confidence in the German economy continues to be good.""
German companies were again more satisfied with their current business situation, but somewhat less optimistic regarding the coming months, the monthly survey showed.
""If there is a 'Trump effect', it could show up later though - that's what we saw after the Brexit vote,"" Ifo economist Klaus Wohlrabe told Reuters.
Q4 REBOUND
Wohlrabe said Ifo's business climate index suggested the German economy would expand by 0.5 percent in the fourth quarter, bringing full-year growth to 1.9 percent.
Another survey suggested German consumers are ready to splash out over the Christmas season and support growth in the final quarter.
Most economists see the third-quarter cooling as temporary, pointing to other sentiment surveys such as Markit's purchasing manager index (PMI) that suggest a rebound in the final quarter.
Germany's central bank said on Monday it expected manufacturing to drive a pick-up in growth in October-December.
""Since the first Brexit shock, the Ifo index has staged an impressive comeback, suggesting that the summer slowdown of the entire economy was only a blip and not a new trend,"" ING-Diba economist Carsten Brzeski said.
But Brzeski warned that growth was ""artificially"" inflated by the ECB's record-low interest rates and Berlin's migration-related hike in state spending.
Capital Economics analyst Jack Allen said the Ifo index suggested the German economy was performing well in the fourth quarter, although ""we expect growth to slow next year, putting pressure on the ECB to loosen policy further"".
The German government expects growth to slow to 1.4 percent in 2017, an election year, mainly due to sluggish foreign trade.

For the euro zone as a whole, economists polled by Reuters expect growth to hum along at a modest pace, helped by the ECB which is expected to announce that its asset purchase stimulus program will be extended beyond March 2017.

BERLIN (Reuters) - German business morale held steady at a high level in November, suggesting company executives in Europe's largest economy remain upbeat in the face of increased uncertainties following Donald Trump's victory in the U.S. presidential election.
The United States is Germany's most important trading partner and Trump's protectionist rhetoric has unnerved many exporters in the euro zone - an added uncertainty on top of Britain's vote in June to leave the European Union.
The Munich-based Ifo economic institute said on Thursday its business climate index, based on a monthly survey of some 7,000 firms, was unchanged after a slight downward revision to 110.4 from 110.5 previously reported in October.
The November reading compared with a Reuters consensus forecast for a value of 110.5. The October figure was still the highest reading in 2-1/2 years.
""The German economy seems to be unfazed by the election of Donald Trump as U.S. president,"" Ifo chief Clemens Fuest said. ""Confidence in the German economy continues to be good.""
German companies were once again more satisfied with their current business situation, but somewhat less optimistic regarding the coming months, the survey showed.
Sentiment in wholesaling and retailing improved sharply while the reading for construction reached a record high. ""The construction boom continues,"" Ifo said in a statement.
Business morale among managers in the manufacturing sector deteriorated, with the institute attributing the decline mainly to less dynamic export prospects.
""If there is a 'Trump effect', it could show up later though - that's what we saw after the Brexit vote,"" Ifo economist Klaus Wohlrabe told Reuters in an interview.
Q4 REBOUND
Wohlrabe added that Ifo's business climate index suggested the German economy would expand by 0.5 percent in the fourth quarter, bringing full-year growth to 1.9 percent.
The German economy halved its growth rate to 0.2 percent in the third quarter despite rising private consumption and higher state spending as weak foreign trade slowed overall activity, data released earlier on Thursday showed.
Many economists view this cooling as a blip, however, pointing to other sentiment surveys such as Markit's purchasing manager index (PMI) that suggested an economic rebound in the final quarter. 
On Monday, Germany's central bank said it expected manufacturing to drive a rebound in growth in October-December. It also said the foundations of growth, namely a vibrant domestic economy, remained intact.
""Since the first Brexit shock, the Ifo index has staged an impressive comeback, suggesting that the summer slowdown of the entire economy was only a blip and not a new trend,"" ING-Diba economist Carsten Brzeski said.
After the June Brexit vote, the Ifo sentiment reading slipped in July and fell further in August, to 106.3, before rebounding from September.
Brzeski warned, however, that growth was ""artificially"" inflated by the European Central Bank's record-low interest rates and Berlin's migration-related hike in state spending.
The Ifo index suggested the economy has performed fairly well so far in the fourth quarter, Capital Economics analyst Jack Allen said.
""However, we expect growth to slow next year, putting pressure on the ECB to loosen policy further,"" Allen added.
The government expects growth to slow to 1.4 percent in 2017, an election year, mainly due to sluggish foreign trade and fewer workdays.

The Flash Markit/Nikkei Japan Manufacturing Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) for November, released on Thursday, fell to a seasonally adjusted 51.1 from a final 51.4 in October.
The index remained above the 50 threshold that separates expansion from contraction for the third consecutive month.

Japan's economy grew more than expected in the July-September period, expanding for a third straight quarter as exports recovered.
Some economists are cautious about the outlook because consumer spending is still lacking in momentum and there are concerns that uncertainty about the global economy could hurt exports.

""Most participants"" said a rate hike would be appropriate ""relatively soon,"" as long as ""incoming data provided some further evidence of continued progress toward the Committee's objectives,"" the minutes of the Nov. 1-2 meeting said.
And some FOMC members argued the increase ""should occur at the next meeting"" if the Fed were to ""preserve credibility"" as policymakers had thoroughly prepared markets for such a move through its public comments in recent weeks.
The committee earlier this month held steady the policy fed funds rate at 0.25% to 0.50% but the chance of a December hike has become a near certainty after Fed Chair Janet Yellen in a congressional hearing last week reiterated an increase in short-term interest rates could ""become appropriate relatively soon.""

1503,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 23, 2016 02:49PM ET</span>",Data shows U.S. economy strengthening on eve of Trump presidency,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - New orders for U.S. manufactured capital goods rebounded in October, driven by rising demand for machinery and a range of other equipment, the latest indication of an acceleration in economic growth early in the fourth quarter. 
The brightening economic outlook received a further boost from other data on Wednesday showing a jump in consumer sentiment this month following the election of Donald Trump as the next president. Consumers embraced the business mogul's victory, which they viewed as positive for their personal finances and the economy's prospects. 
While the number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits rose from a 43-year low last week, the trend in jobless claims remained consistent with a tightening labor market.
The data reinforced expectations the Federal Reserve would hike interest rates at its December meeting and minutes of the bank's November policy meeting showed rate setters appeared confident that a rise would come ""relatively soon"".
""Everything seems to be moving in the right direction in the economy,"" said Joel Naroff, chief economist at Naroff Economic Advisers in Holland, Pennsylvania. ""The weak links are recovering and the strengths are staying strong. The Fed is not going to continue doing nothing.""
The Commerce Department said non-defense capital goods orders excluding aircraft, a closely watched proxy for business spending plans, rose 0.4 percent after declining 1.4 percent in September. These so-called core capital goods orders have now increased in four of the last five months.
Shipments of core capital goods rose 0.2 percent last month after a 0.4 percent gain in September. Core capital goods shipments are used to calculate equipment spending in the government's gross domestic product measurement.
A 12 percent surge in demand for transportation equipment buoyed overall orders for durable goods, items ranging from toasters to aircraft that are meant to last three years or more, which jumped 4.8 percent last month. That was the biggest rise in a year and followed a 0.4 percent increase in September.
Even as the economy has regained momentum after stumbling in late 2015 and early 2016, business spending remained weak as companies struggled with the impact of a strong dollar and lower oil prices on profits. Business spending on equipment has declined for four straight quarters, weighing heavily on manufacturing, which accounts for 12 percent of the U.S. economy. 
With core capital goods orders steadily increasing in tandem with rising gas and oil well drilling activity, there is cautious optimism that business investment on equipment will rebound in the fourth quarter. 
But gains are likely to be modest amid renewed strength in the dollar. The greenback's rally had appeared to run out of steam for much of the year. Still, the rise in both core capital goods orders and shipments mirrored data on industrial production and surveys in showing a nascent recovery in manufacturing.
""Activity in the manufacturing sector is getting a little better, but is still far from robust. The recent strengthening in the dollar does pose a renewed risk to growth in the industrial sector,"" said Michael Feroli, an economist at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) in New York. 
In a separate report, the University of Michigan said its consumer sentiment index rose 8.2 points from the pre-election reading to 93.8. That put the index 6.6 points above the October reading. UMich said the post-election surge in optimism was widespread, with gains recorded among all income and age subgroups and across all regions of the country.
BULLISH ECONOMIC SIGNALS
The reports joined bullish data on housing starts, home and retail sales, as well as firming inflation in painting an upbeat picture of the economy at the start of the fourth quarter.
The Atlanta Federal Reserve is forecasting GDP rising at a 3.6 percent annual rate in the fourth quarter. The economy grew at a 2.9 percent pace in the July-September period. The data suggest Trump will inherit a strong economy from the Obama administration.
""Trump is the first president looking back to the early 90s to inherit an economy that is at full employment,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG Union Bank in New York. ""The irony is he became president by playing on many voters fears that the economy was rigged against them."" 
Against the backdrop of the improving economy, the Fed is likely to hike interest rates at its Dec. 13-14 policy meeting. The U.S. central bank raised its benchmark overnight interest rate last December for the first time in nearly a decade. 
The dollar rose against a basket of currencies to a more than 13-year peak, while U.S. stocks were little changed with the Dow near a record high. Prices for U.S. government debt fell, with two-year note yields hitting 6-1/2 year highs. 
In another report on Thursday, the Labor Department said initial claims for state unemployment benefits increased 18,000 to a seasonally adjusted 251,000 for the week ended Nov. 19.
Claims have now been below 300,000, a threshold associated with a healthy labor market, for 90 straight weeks. That is the longest run since 1970, when the labor market was much smaller.
The four-week moving average of claims, considered a better measure of labor market trends as it irons out week-to-week volatility, fell 2,000 to 251,000 last week.
Labor market strength is bolstering domestic demand, which in turn is feeding through to the manufacturing sector.

Solid domestic consumption and President-elect Donald Trump's plan for a massive infrastructure spending program could spur business investment on equipment. It would boost companies like heavy machinery maker  Caterpillar  (NYSE:CAT), which last month lowered its full-year revenue outlook for the second time this year. A fourth report from the Commerce Department showed new home sales declined 1.9 percent in October. Sales, however, rose 17.8 percent from a year ago.

Power and LMC Automotive said on Wednesday.
The consultants estimated industry sales in the United States this month at 1.39 million vehicles, up from 1.32 million, helped by two more selling days than a year earlier. The seasonally adjusted annualized rate will be 17.9 million vehicles, a slide from 18 million vehicles last year.
Autodata Corp, another industry consultant, says November 2015 annualized sales were at a rate of 18.25 million, which would suggest a steeper decline this month than J.D. Power and LMC forecast.
Automakers report November U.S. sales on Dec. 1. The monthly data is viewed as an early indicator of consumer spending.
The manufacturers began their holiday sales promotions this month, hoping to cut bulging inventories of unsold cars and trucks.
Jeff Schuster, lead forecaster for LMC Automotive, said the U.S. auto sales forecast in 2016 remains at 17.4 million vehicles, but with a bias toward the upside. That would allow a new record beyond last year's record of 17.39 million vehicles according to WardsAuto, and 17.47 million vehicles according to Autodata.
Schuster said LMC Automotive's forecast for U.S. sales in 2017 is also 17.4 million vehicles.
Next year is pivotal for the auto industry, Schuster said, due to the chance of a economic stimulus plan under a Donald Trump presidency and the likelihood that attractive consumer discounts, or incentives, are pulling some 2017 sales into the current year.
The U.S. economy and auto industry ""could be facing a boom or bust, depending on which policies are focused on and implemented,” Schuster said. 
J.D. Power lead automotive analyst Deirdre Borrego said the U.S. Thanksgiving Day holiday weekend is expected to account for one-fourth of November sales.
She also said consumer discounts on new vehicles so far in November were nearly $3,900 per vehicle, up about 15 percent from a year earlier and the second highest on record, behind only the September average.

Current strength in U.S. auto sales, Borrego said, ""are being driven in part by elevated incentive (discount) levels, which represent a meaningful risk to the long-term health of the auto industry.”

In most U.S. areas, the 2017 maximum ""conforming"" loan limit for one-unit properties will increase to $424,100 from $417,000, the regulator of the two mortgage finance agencies said in a statement.
Under the Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008, FHFA could not increase the baseline loan limit until the average home price returned to its third-quarter 2007 levels. 
Home values in the third quarter were about 1.7 percent higher than their levels nine years ago, according to the FHFA. 
In high-cost areas where median home prices exceed the baseline loan limit, the maximum loan limit will be higher. The new ceiling loan limit in these areas will be $636,150, or 150 percent of $424,100, for one-unit properties in the contiguous 48 U.S. states, FHFA said.

Earlier on Wednesday, the FHFA said U.S. home values appreciated by 1.5 percent in third quarter, while its seasonally adjusted monthly index on home prices rose 0.6 percent in September.

The final index of consumer sentiment for November jumped to 93.8 from a preliminary reading of 91.6, according to a report released on Wednesday.
This report took on added significance because it showed results of the first post-election survey.
""The initial reaction of consumers to Trump's victory was to express greater optimism about their personal finances as well as improved prospects for the national economy,"" said Richard Curtin, the survey's chief economist.
Curtin said the survey showed that the improved optimism was widespread across all income and age subgroups across the country. However, it may have been exaggerated by a sense of relief that the election was finally over, he said.
A  Gallup poll released last week also showed a spike in consumer confidence, although it was divided along political lines. Republicans suddenly became more bullish about the economy, while Democrats turned more bearish, according to last week's tracking poll.
""Presidential honeymoons represent a period in which the promise of gains holds sway over actual economic conditions,"" Curtin said. ""Presidential honeymoons, however, can quickly end if they are unaccompanied by prospects that economic conditions will actually improve in the future."""

Analysts polled by Reuters had expected a reading of 91.6.
The rise pushed the index to its highest level since May, and the index measuring consumer expectations rose to 85.2, its highest since June 2015, from 76.8 last month.
Results from November's preliminary survey, issued on Nov. 11, did not reflect consumers' mood shift following the election of Republican Donald Trump in the Nov. 8 U.S. presidential election. The final reading released Wednesday did capture the shift.

""The upsurge in favorable economic prospects is not surprising given Trump’s populist policy views, and it was perhaps exaggerated by what most considered a surprising victory as well as by a widespread sense of relief that the election had finally ended,"" the survey's Chief Economist Richard Curtin said in a statement.

The Commerce Department said on Wednesday new home salesdeclined 1.9 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of563,000 units last month. 
September's sales pace was revised down to 574,000 units from the previously reported 593,000 units. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast single-family homesales, which account for about 9.1 percent of overall homesales, holding steady last month. New home sales, which are derived from building permits, arevolatile on a month-to-month basis and subject to large revisions. Sales increased 17.8 percent from a year ago. 
A report on Tuesday showed sales of previously owned homes rose to a more than 9-1/2-year high in October. Demand for housing is being driven by rising wages as the labor market nears full employment. 
Home sales could get a boost in the near-term from a recent jump in mortgage rates, which could see buyers rushing into the market in anticipation of further increases in borrowing costs.
According to data from mortgage financing firm Freddie Mac, the 30-year mortgage rate has risen almost 40 basis points to nearly 4 percent in the wake of the election early this month of Republican candidate Donald Trump as the next president. 
Investor fears that the business mogul's proposed massive public spending program could spark inflation have led to a spike in U.S. governments bond yields, whose movements are closely aligned with mortgage rates.
New single-family homes sales fell in the Northeast, Midwest and South last month. They rose 8.8 percent in the West.

Last month, the inventory of new homes on the market rose 2.9 percent to 246,000 units, the highest since September 2009. At October's sales pace it would take 5.2 months to clear the supply of houses on the market, up from 5.0 months in September.

It was the fastest quarterly expansion since the second quarter of 2014.

The Washington-based MBA's seasonally adjusted mortgage market index rose 5.5 percent to 460.3 in the week ended Nov. 18. In the previous week, it stood at 436.3, the lowest since the week of Jan. 15.
Mortgage rates have risen in step with rising U.S. Treasury yields as traders reduced their bond holdings on inflation worries due to stronger-than-forecast economic data and bets on a surge in federal borrowing under a Trump presidency.
Some analysts said they expected a rush among potential homeowners to lock in mortgages rates in anticipation of borrowing costs possibly heading even higher.
""The increase in purchase activity was driven by borrowers seeking larger loans and that drove up the average loan amount on home purchase applications to $310,000, the highest in the survey, which dates back to 1990,” Michael Fratantoni, MBA's chief economist, said in a statement.
The group's seasonally adjusted index on mortgage applications to buy a home rose to 234.1, up 18.8 percent, its biggest weekly increase since Oct. 2, 2015. In the previous week, the purchase mortgage index hit its lowest since January.
The MBA's seasonally adjusted gauge on refinancing requests fell 3.1 percent to 1,754.2, the lowest since the Jan. 15 week.
The refinance share of overall mortgage activity declined to 58.2 percent from 61.9 percent in the previous week.
Interest rates on 30-year fixed-rate mortgages with conforming loan balances of $417,000 or less averaged 4.16 percent, their highest since January. In the previous week, they averaged 3.95 percent, the MBA said.

The average interest rate on 30-year ""jumbo"" mortgages, whose loan balances are greater than $417,000, was 4.04 percent, the highest since January and up from 3.95 percent in the prior week.

In a report, market research group Markit said that its flash manufacturing purchasing managers’ index (PMI) rose to 53.9 in November from the prior month’s final reading of 53.4. That was the strongest reading since March 2015.
Analysts had expected no change to October’s reading.
On the index, a reading above 50.0 indicates expansion, below indicates contraction.
Markit further indicated that the data showed the strongest upturn in new orders since October 2015 and that inventory building continued in November.
“November data highlighted a sustained acceleration in production growth across the U.S. manufacturing sector and the latest upturn was the fastest since early-2015,” the market research group said.
“US manufacturers enjoyed a strong post-election bounce in November, further tilting the scales toward the Fed hiking rates in Decembe,"" Markit chief business economist Chris Williamson said in the report.
“The buoyant post-election picture of the manufacturing economy and signs of increased optimism about the future will further fuel the conviction that the Fed will raise interest rates at its December 13-14 meeting, and may also raise the possibility that policymakers might be inclined to tighten somewhat more aggressively in 2017 than previously thought, although much of course also depends on the new government’s policy framework,” he concluded.
Immediately following the report, EUR/USD was trading at 1.0553 from around 1.0543 ahead of the release of the data, GBP/USD was at 1.2401 from 1.2373 earlier, while USD/JPY was at 112.31, compared to the prior 112.35.

tightening labor market.
Initial claims for state unemployment benefits increased 18,000 to a seasonally adjusted 251,000 for the week ended Nov. 19, the Labor Department said on Wednesday.
Claims for the prior week were revised to show 2,000 fewer applications filed than previously reported.
Claims have now been below 300,000, a threshold associated with a healthy labor market, for 90 straight weeks. That is the longest run since 1970, when the labor market was much smaller.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast first-time applications for jobless benefits rising to 250,000 in the latest week. The claims report was released a day early because of the Thanksgiving holiday on Thursday.
A Labor Department analyst said there were no special factors influencing last week's data and that no states had been estimated. The four-week moving average of claims, considered a better measure of labor market trends as it irons out week-to-week volatility, fell 2,000 to 251,000 last week.
The strong labor market, viewed as being at or near full employment, and steadily rising inflation are expected to encourage the Federal Reserve to hike interest rates at its Dec. 13-14 policy meeting.
The U.S. central bank raised its benchmark overnight interest rate last December for the first time in nearly a decade.
Thursday's claims report also showed the number of people still receiving benefits after an initial week of aid rose 60,000 to 2.04 million in the week ended Nov. 12.
The four-week average of the so-called continuing claims edged up 750 to 2.02 million. The continuing claims data covered the period during which the government surveyed households for November's unemployment rate.

The four-week average of continuing claims fell 26,750 between the October and November survey periods, suggesting some improvement in the unemployment rate. The jobless rate was at 4.9 percent in October.

In a report, the U.S. Department of Labor said the number of individuals filing for initial jobless benefits in the week ending November 19 increased by 18,000 to a seasonally adjusted 251,000 from the previous week’s total of 233,000 (initially 235,000).
Analysts had expected jobless claims to rise by 15,000 to 250,000 last week.
First-time jobless claims below the 300,000-level are usually associated with a firming labor market.
This was its 90th consecutive week below that threshold, its longest stretch since 1970.
Continuing jobless claims in the week ended November 5 rose to 2.043 million from a revised 1.983 million (initially 1.977 million) in the preceding week.
Analysts had expected continuing claims to increase to 2.030 million.
The four-week moving average was 251,000, a decrease of 2,000 from the previous week's 253,000 (which was revised from the original 253,500).
The monthly average is seen as a more accurate gauge of labor trends because it reduces volatility in the week-to-week data.

1523,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 23, 2016 06:58AM ET</span>",Business growth in euro zone rises to highest rate this year,"By Sumanta Dey
(Reuters) - Euro zone business activity expanded the most in nearly a year in November on strong manufacturing and buoyant services growth in Germany, stirring some optimism that economic momentum is picking up again. 
A strong run of data is offers some hope a mid-year lull after a flurry of activity at the start of the year may be over, It is unlikely, however, to dent expectations the European Central Bank will announce an extension to its stimulus program next month.
The IHS Markit Euro Zone Flash Composite Purchasing Managers' Index jumped to 54.1, its highest so far this year, from 53.3 in October, just shy of 54.3 last December.
It is now well above the 50 that divides growth from contraction, suggesting 0.4 percent growth in the fourth quarter according to IHS Markit, slightly higher than the median forecast in a Reuters poll of 0.3 percent. [ECILT/EU]
Services firms in Germany and France, the bloc's top two economies, fared better than manufacturers. In the broader euro zone survey, however, manufacturers had a stronger run.
Taken together, the data suggest the pickup in activity is not confined to Germany and France.
""It looks like smaller economies are picking up pace after a very long time and downward price pressures are somewhat abating with companies managing to push through price increases,"" said Peter Vanden Houte, chief euro zone economist at ING Financial Markets.
""But I'm not sure the ECB will shift gear very rapidly for the simple reason that it has made mistakes in the past by tightening policy too soon. We still expect the ECB to lengthen its quantitative easing program in December.""
The ECB next meets on Dec. 8 and economists polled by Reuters last week expect it to announce an extension to its 80 billion euros a month bond purchase program that is currently scheduled to end in March 2017.
FREE CASH
Despite years of ultra-loose monetary policy, including printing money, cutting interest rates below zero and giving banks virtually free cash, inflation has only risen in baby steps in the euro zone.
At 0.5 percent in October, it is still far below the ECB's 2 percent target ceiling. But if the trend of tightening price pressures, as indicated by the PMIs, continues it could dampen expectations of further policy easing from the ECB.
Output prices for services firms in the euro zone remained unchanged in November, only the second time in the past 14 months when companies did not resort to discounting to drum up new business.
""This most likely reflects the year-over-year increase in energy prices that fell significantly one year ago,"" said Holger Sandte at Nordea. ""(But) the underlying cost and price pressure is still very low and a reason for the ECB the maintain the current degree on monetary accommodation for a long time.""
The bloc's dominant services industry also performed much better than expected, smashing even the highest forecast in a Reuters poll. Similar to the composite number, its PMI came in at a 11-month high of 54.1, up sharply from October's 52.8.
The factory PMI climbed to 53.7, its highest since January 2014, above the poll median and October's 53.5.
The PMI surveys were conducted after the U.S. election but IHS Markit said panelists had yet to factor into responses Donald Trump's shock victory, whose campaign hinged on trade protectionism and migration curbs.
So far there has been very little discernible reaction in both in the euro zone and UK economies from Britain's shock vote to leave the European Union in June. Most economists agree, however, that the impact will be felt more clearly next year.
The business expectations index in the euro zone services PMI dipped slightly this month compared with the six-month high it hit in October.

There are also three key national elections in the euro zone next year, which may interfere with the eventual negotiations between Britain and the EU on a divorce, provided UK Prime Minister Theresa May follows through on her intention to trigger the proceedings by March next year.

In a report, market research group Markit said that its flash Euro Zone Composite Output Index, which measures the combined output of both the manufacturing and service sectors increased to 54.1 November, from the prior month’s reading of 53.3 and above forecasts for no change.
The flash services purchasing managers’ index rose to 54.1 this month, from October’s final reading of 52.8, beating expectations for a reading of 53.0.
The preliminary euro zone manufacturing purchasing managers’ index unexpectedly rose to a seasonally adjusted 53.7 this month from a final reading of 53.5 in October. That was a 34-month high.
Analysts had expected the index to dip to 53.3 in November.
On the index, a reading above 50.0 indicates industry expansion, below indicates contraction.
The report indicated that new order inflows showed the largest monthly improvement since last December, with the rate of growth accelerating for the third month running.
The influx of new work helped cause backlogs of uncompleted orders to rise at the fastest rate since May 2011, Markit said.
“With firms’ outstanding order book volumes Markit Eurozone PMI and GDP accumulating to the greatest extent in five-and-a-half years, companies took on more staff to help raise operating capacity,” the research firm noted.
Employment growth strengthened for the second month running to reach the joint-highest pace since February 2008, according to the release.
Meanwhile, average prices charged by companies for their goods and services rose for the first time since August of last year, led by price rises in the manufacturing sector.
“Furthermore, although only marginal, the price increase was all the more notable for being the largest since August 2011,” Markit added.
Markit chief economist Chris Williamson noted that the report provided “plenty of signs that growth will continue to accelerate” and said the data suggested fourth quarter GDP growth for the region of 0.4%, led by a 0.5% expansion in Germany.
“ECB policymakers will also be pleased to see inflationary pressures are intensifying steadily,” Williamson said.
“However, with indicators such as rising backlogs of work and longer supplier delivery times suggesting demand is exceeding supply, price pressures look set to intensify further in coming months,” he added.
Following the report, EUR/USD was at 1.0603 from around 1.0608 ahead of the release of the data, while EUR/GBP was at 0.8566 from 0.8563 earlier.
Meanwhile, European stock markets were trading mixed. The Euro Stoxx 50 edged forward 0.07%, Germany's DAX dropped 0.03%, France’s CAC 40 inched up 0.08%, while London’s FTSE 100 gained 0.68%."

Markit's flash composite Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI), which tracks the manufacturing and services sectors that account for more than two-thirds of the economy, edged down to 54.9 from
October's 10-month high of 55.1.
This was a tick lower than the consensus forecast in a Reuters poll of 55.0 but still comfortably above the 50 mark that separates growth from contraction.
The data suggested that the economy will expand 0.5 percent in the final three months of 2016, lifting overall growth in the euro zone and more than doubling from the relatively weak 0.2
percent expansion in the third quarter, IHS Markit economist Rob Dobson said.
The survey indexes showed business activity in the service sector accelerated more strongly than expected in November, hitting a six-month high of 55.0, while growth in manufacturing slowed to 54.4 from a 33-month high of 55.0 in October.
Purchasing managers attributed the overall expansion mainly to higher order intakes, improved capacity and solid demand from clients abroad.
Increased costs for staff and some raw materials pushed up overall input costs, with the rate of input price inflation reaching its highest level in more than four-and-a-half years.
IHS Markit economist Oliver Kolodseike said the survey results showed that the economy was in good shape and that the robust labor market continued to be one of the main growth
drivers in Europe's largest economy.
""There are clear signs that price pressures are intensifying further... which should be welcome news for ECB policymakers who are desperately trying to boost inflation in the region,""
Kolodseike said.
The government expects private consumption and state spending to drive an overall economic expansion of 1.8 percent this year, which would be the strongest rate in five years.
For 2017, Berlin predicts a slowdown in growth to 1.4 percent due to weaker foreign trade and fewer working days.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. home resales rose in October to their highest level in more than 9-1/2 years as homebuyers, buoyed by an improving labor market, took advantage of still-low mortgage rates to snatch up properties after many were shut out during the busy summer selling season.
The jump in sales was further evidence of a pickup in economic growth early in the fourth quarter.
""You have to be pretty confident to buy a house,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG Union Bank in New York. ""Consumers certainly were in October, showing no hesitation whatsoever ahead of the presidential elections with its often harsh rhetoric and focus on all the things wrong with the economy.""
While a recent surge in mortgage rates could hurt the housing market next year, the impact is likely to be modest given a labor market that is at or close to full employment.
The National Association of Realtors said on Tuesday existing home sales rose 2.0 percent to an annual rate of 5.6 million units last month, the highest level since February 2007.
The Realtors group attributed the rise in sales to ""unrealized pent-up demand."" Tight supply over summer unleashed bidding wars, which pushed out some would-be buyers. Opportunities for buyers during the autumn and winter months, usually quiet periods for home sales, are likely improving.
New listings last month typically stayed on the market for 41 days, up from 39 days in September, but down from 57 days a year ago. Economists had forecast sales slipping 0.5 percent to a 5.43 million-unit pace in October. Sales were up 5.9 percent from a year ago. They rose in all four regions last month.
The report came on the heels of data last week showing a surge in housing starts. It also added to strong reports on retail sales and the labor market as well as improving manufacturing surveys in suggesting that the economy continued to gain speed early in the fourth quarter.
Rising homes sales suggest an increase in brokers' commission, which should boost the residential construction component in the government's gross domestic product report.
The Atlanta Federal Reserve is forecasting GDP rising at a 3.6 percent annual rate in the fourth quarter. The economy grew at a 2.9 percent pace in the July-September period. The strong economic growth outlook together with a tightening labor market are likely to encourage the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates next month.
The dollar was little changed against a basket of currencies, while prices for U.S. government bonds rose marginally. U.S. stocks were almost flat after touching record highs. The PHLX housing index fell 0.30 percent.
Shares in the nation's largest homebuilder, D.R. Horton Inc, declined 0.98 percent and  Lennar  Corp (NYSE:LEN) dropped 1.3 percent.
SUPPLY REMAINS TIGHT
The NAR said it expected home resales to average 5.36 million units this year. Despite last month's rise, existing home sales remain constrained by a persistent shortage of properties available for sale.
Sales could slow marginally next year following a run-up in mortgage rates in the wake of this month's election of Republican candidate Donald Trump as the next president.
Trump's surprise victory has led to a surge in U.S. government bond yields amid investor concerns that the business mogul's proposed expansionary fiscal policy agenda could fan inflation.
Mortgage rates closely track movements in U.S. Treasury yields. Since the Nov. 8 presidential election, the fixed 30-year mortgage rate has increased nearly 40 basis points to average 3.94 percent, according to data from mortgage finance firm Freddie Mac.
But the higher borrowing costs could encourage potential buyers to rush into the market in anticipation of further increases in interest rates. The NAR is forecasting existing home sales increasing to about 5.46 million units next year.
""Rising rates tend to get the attention of fence sitters, who actually have to now start making decisions,"" said Joel Naroff, chief economist at Naroff Economic Advisors in Holland, Pennsylvania.
""Yes, some may not be able to get a mortgage, but prices will adjust, so I don't expect a significant dislocation in the housing market even if rates rise another one percentage point.""
Housing is being supported by improving household formation as the tightening labor market boosts employment prospects for young adults. The dearth of homes for sale is keeping upward pressure on house prices. The median house price rose 6.0 percent from a year ago to $232,200 last month.
The number of unsold homes on the market slipped 0.5 percent from September to 2.02 million units. Supply was down 4.3 percent from a year ago and had declined for 17 straight months on a year-on-year basis.
At October's sales pace, it would take 4.3 months to clear the stock of houses on the market, down from 4.4 months in September. A six-month supply is viewed as a healthy balance between supply and demand.
While house price increases could make home purchasing expensive for first-time buyers, it is raising equity for homeowners and enticing some to put their homes on the market.

The IBGE said the so-called labor underutilization rate rose in the third quarter to 22.9 million people, or 21.2 percent of the workforce, from 18 percent a year earlier.
Brazil's two-year-long recession worsened in the third quarter, according to central bank data, despite expectations of a surge in business confidence following the recent ouster of President Dilma Rousseff, who was unpopular with investors.
Brazil's standard unemployment rate, which takes into account only the jobless looking for full-time work, rose to a record high of 11.8 percent in the third quarter, doubling from 2013, according to data issued by the IBGE last month.
The additional data released on Tuesday included the 12 million unemployed, 4.8 million part-time workers searching for work and 6.1 million jobless who gave up looking. No percentage figures were given for either of the last two categories.
The labor underutilization rate is highest in Brazil's poorest regions, topping 30 percent in the northeastern states of Bahia, Piauí, Maranhão and Sergipe. The lowest came in the southern state of Santa Catarina, at 9.7 percent.
By age, young workers have been hit hardest, with a 37.1 percent labor underutilization rate for those between 18 and 24 years old.

Brazil's unemployment rate was at record lows near 6 percent three years ago, after approximately a decade of fast economic growth that helped lift 26 million people out of poverty.

1539,By Investing.com,"<span>Nov 22, 2016 10:01AM ET</span>", U.S. existing home sales unexpectedly jump in October ,"Investing.com – U.S. existing home sales unexpectedly rose in October, bolstering optimism over the health of the housing market, according to a report released on Tuesday by the National Association of Realtors (NAR).
The industry data showed that home resales rose 2.0% in October to a seasonally adjusted 5.60 million units from the 5.49 million units in the previous month. August’s data was revised from an initial reading of 5.47 million units.
The consensus forecast was for a 0.5% drop to 5.43 million units.
The data helps to gauge the strength of the U.S. housing market and is considered to be a key indicator of overall economic strength.
NAR indicated that existing home sales ascended in October for the second straight month and eclipsed June's cyclical sales peak to become the highest annualized pace in nearly a decade.
Additionally, all major regions saw monthly and annual sales increases in October.
NAR chief economist Lawrence Yun noted that the wave of sales activity the last two months represents a convincing autumn revival for the housing market.
""October's strong sales gain was widespread throughout the country and can be attributed to the release of the unrealized pent-up demand that held back many would-be buyers over the summer because of tight supply,"" he said.
""Buyers are having more success lately despite low inventory and prices that continue to swiftly rise above incomes,"" Yun added.
The NAR report also showed that the median existing-home price for all housing types in October was $232,200, up 6.0% from October 2015 ($219,100).
October's price increase marks the 56th consecutive month of year-over-year gains.
After the report, EUR/USD was trading at 1.0618 from around 1.0623 ahead of the release of the data, GBP/USD was at 1.2426 from 1.2425 earlier, while USD/JPY traded at 111.04 compared to 111.01 before the release.
The US dollar index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six major rivals, was at 101.08, compared to 101.05 ahead of the report.
Meanwhile, U.S. stock markets were higher after the open. The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 48 points, or 0.25%, the S&P 500 rose 4 points, or 0.18%, while the Nasdaq Composite traded up 21 points, or 0.38%.
Elsewhere, in the commodities market, gold futures traded at $1,211.00 a troy ounce, compared to $1,211.95 ahead of the data, while U.S. crude oil traded at $48.44 a barrel from $48.28 earlier."

The median forecast in a Reuters survey of 17 economists was for the all-items CPI to be steady in October from a year earlier, after declining 0.2 percent in September.
Such a result would end a record 23 straight months of year-on-year declines in all-items CPI that began in November 2014. Headline CPI has been dragged down over the past two years by lower global oil prices as well as falls in housing rents and private transport costs.
Downward pressure on CPI has become less acute in recent months, as global oil prices (LCOc1) have risen nearly 28 percent this year. 
While headline CPI will probably turn positive soon and core inflation is expected to edge higher in 2017, Singapore's central bank is unlikely to be in any hurry to tighten monetary policy, said Brian Tan, an economist for Nomura.
If full-year core inflation comes in near 1.5 percent next year, there won't be much reason for the central bank to consider tightening its exchange-rate based policy, given how weak the economy is, Tan said.
""The question really is whether we will go much higher than that, because I think historically core inflation has been closer to about 2 percent,"" he added. 
In the Reuters survey, core CPI was forecast to have risen 1.2 percent in October from a year earlier, in what would be the fastest increase since February 2015, when it gained 1.3 percent.
The central bank's core inflation measure excludes changes in the prices of cars and accommodation, which are influenced more by government policies.

Singapore's central bank kept its exchange-rate based monetary policy unchanged at the semiannual policy decision in October. But some analysts say the weak growth outlook will likely force policymakers to ease further at the next meeting due in April.

Although the weekly sight deposits data are for the week ending Nov. 18, the figures give the first indication of most of the SNB's intervention after Republican Donald Trump surprisingly won the Nov. 8 presidential election against Democrat Hillary Clinton.
This is due to a holiday in the United States and the way in which the data are calculated.
The SNB had said it was ready to intervene in the currency market if the outcome of the U.S. election triggered a rush into the safe-haven franc.
Domestic sight deposits, an indication of how inclined banks are to find a safe home for their money, stood at 458.403 billion Swiss francs ($454.54 billion), up from 449.849 billion francs the previous week, SNB data showed.
Total sight deposits, which include other deposits on sight in Swiss francs, rose to 524.657 billion francs from 519.853 billion francs in the previous week, the biggest weekly rise since the Brexit vote in June.
A rise in sight deposits can indicate intervention in foreign exchange markets by the SNB.
The SNB declined to comment on the increase. 
The central bank is using negative interest rates and an unspecified amount of foreign currency interventions in an effort to weaken the franc and protect Swiss exports.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's exports fell in October for a 13th consecutive month and by more than expected as the strength of the yen and sluggish foreign demand weighed on trade, although current yen weakness could change the outlook.
Ministry of Finance (MOF) data showed on Monday that exports fell 10.3 percent in the year to October, pulled down by a strong rise in the value of the yen and lower export volumes, much weaker than the expected 8.6 percent drop and September's 6.9 percent decline.
The trade results came on the heels of recent data showing Japan's economy expanded for a third quarter in July-September as exports recovered and imports fell.
Exports dipped 1.4 percent in volume terms in the year to October, falling for the first time in three months and following a 4.7 percent gain in the previous month.
""Overall exports are starting to stall and this month's results are disappointing,"" said Yuichi Kodama, chief economist at Meiji Yasuda Life Insurance.
""The data once again shows that global economic recovery isn't necessarily smooth sailing,"" said Kodama, adding that overall economic growth in October-December may stall.
But Marcel Thieliant, senior Japan economist at Capital Economics, took a different view saying that the dramatic fall in the value of the yen since Donald Trump's election to U.S. president could help turn around Japan's export performance.
""Looking ahead...we expect it (the yen) to decline further next year, which should lift trade values. ""We also expect growth among Japan's main trading partners to pick up marginally, and have pencilled in a 1.5 percent rebound in export volumes next year,"" Thieliant said in a commentary after the trade figures were posted.
Imports in October fell 16.5 percent versus the median estimate of a 16.3 percent fall. The trade balance came to a surplus of 496.2 billion yen ($4.47 billion), versus the median estimate for a 615.4 billion yen surplus.
The value of exports to China fell 9.2 percent in October from a year earlier, for the eighth straight month, as shipments of communication devices fell.
Shipments to Asia, which account for more than half of Japanese exports, fell 9.9 percent, marking a 14th month of declines. U.S.-bound exports decreased 11.2 percent, posting an eighth falling month.

However, a private business survey showed that Japanese manufacturing activity expanded at the fastest pace in nine months in October as output and new export orders picked up.

Exports to Britain, Germany's third-largest export market, were down 4.7 percent in the July-Sept period compared with last year, when they rose by some 11 percent in the third quarter.
Exports to the United States, Germany's biggest trading partner, fell by 10.5 percent year-on-year in the third quarter, the data showed. They also fell by 6.3 percent in the first nine months of this year.
Germany has been relying on private consumption and increased state spending for growth, which have replaced exports as the main economic engines.

""This is a real damper on our most important export market,"" DIHK economist Volker Treier told Reuters, blaming the subdued exports on the uncertainty created by the fierce presidential race between Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton and Republican Donald Trump, who won the election on Nov. 8.

""The uncertainty is very big, above all after the victory of Trump,"" Treier added. ""His foreign economic program is not encouraging, as he has repeatedly spoken about imposing tariffs. This worries German exporters.""

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's exports likely fell for a 13 straight month in October, while core consumer prices probably slipped for a eight month in a row due to a strong yen, a Reuters poll showed on Friday, casting doubt on hopes for a sustainable economic recovery. 
Exports were expected to have declined 8.6 percent in the year to October while imports may have fallen 16.3 percent, according to the poll of 21 economists. 
That would result in a trade surplus of 615.4 billion yen ($5.56 billion) in October, the poll showed, up from a revised 497.6 billion yen surplus the previous month.
""Looking at the recent volume of exports, they are not so bad but a strong yen is weighing on the value of exports and exporters' profits,"" said Yoshiki Shinke, chief economist at Dai-ichi Life Research Institute.
""An inventory adjustment overseas has progressed which is helping business confidence. So if export data shows a solid tone, it will likely support a view that confidence will pick up,"" he said, adding that recent falls in yen would help corporate profits.
The yen was trading around 110.60 yen  per dollar on Friday on growing hopes for a U.S. interest rate hike by year-end. That compared with around 101-105 yen per dollar in October.
The finance ministry will release the trade data at 8:50 a.m. Nov. 21 (2350 GMT Nov. 20.) 
The poll also found the core consumer price index (CPI), which includes oil products but excludes fresh food prices, likely fell 0.4 percent in October from a year earlier. 
Core CPI slipped 0.5 percent in September.
""A strong yen and budget-minded households pushed down consumer prices but the pace of falls slowed down a little due to some recovery in prices such as gasoline following a pickup in oil prices,"" said Kentaro Arita, senior economist at Mizuho Research Institute. 
The internal affairs ministry will announce the CPI data at 8:30 a.m. on Friday.
The economy grew faster than expected in the third quarter as exports recovered but weak domestic activity cast doubt on the outlook.

1568,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 18, 2016 01:00AM ET</span>",Hot China house prices cool in October as curbs on speculation bite,"BEIJING (Reuters) - China's booming property market showed early signs of a softening in October after a fast and furious price rally that propped up economic growth this year.
A National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) survey out on Friday showed October's monthly price growth virtually halved to 1.1 percent from September's 2.1 percent, as most of China's first- and second-tier cities posted slowing price growth. 
Analysts welcomed the softening as it showed that local and national measures intended to curb speculation were working without seeming to trigger a sharp price correction. 
""October data showed the momentum is softening, and that is within market expectations,"" said Julia Wang, Greater China economist at HSBC global research said in Hong Kong.
""I think that's actually good news since it showed the effectiveness of the new curbs introduced earlier in October without depressing the market too much."" 
Despite the monthly slowdown, new house prices in China's 70 major cities still rose 12.3 percent in October from a year earlier, accelerating from an 11.2 percent increase in September. 
Prices in Shenzhen, one of China's long-time high-growth markets, dropped 0.5 percent in October, the first fall since October 2014, suggesting restrictions to curb speculative buying in the hottest markets are starting to bite.
China has depended on a surging real estate market and government stimulus to drive growth this year, but fears of a property market crash have led more than 20 cities to introduce tightening measures to cool overheating markets.
HSBC's Wang said the impact of tightening measures on growth would be ""limited"" as the policies were still more relaxed than seen in previous tightening cycles, especially without a credit squeeze from monetary tightening.
""We expect monetary policy to remain loose next year,"" she said. 
Wang estimated the property market currently contributed 17 percent of China's total investment, with infrastructure spending still the major driver.
Property investment rose in October on an annual basis to its highest since April 2014, according to Reuters calculations from data issued by NBS on Monday.
Analysts say the impact on real-estate investment from tightening measures is usually delayed, but a property market dampened by sluggish domestic demand could weigh on the economy from early next year, adding uncertainty to the growth outlook.
STRICT RULES TO CONTINUE
Sixty-five of the 70 cities tracked by NBS showed a year-on-year price gain, up from 64 in September. In the second-tier city of Hefei, once again the top price gainer, new home prices rose 48.4 percent in October, quickening from a 46.8 percent surge in September. 
Analysts say a record headline figure in October suggests policymakers will maintain measures to bear down on price growth. 
""The current strict policy tone will persist, which could add pressure to growth in the coming quarters,"" said Singapore-based Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) economist Zhou Hao. 
Some overheated cities are already beefing up existing measures with stricter multiple curbs, suggesting more cities may follow suit in bolstering controls.

On Tuesday, major cities such as Shenzhen and Wuhan stepped up restrictive measures with fresh curbs on borrowing and purchasing of multiple homes.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. consumer prices recorded their biggest increase in six months in October on rising gasoline costs and rents, suggesting a pickup in inflation that potentially clears the way for the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates in December.
Prospects for a rate hike next month also got a boost from other data on Thursday showing first-time applications for unemployment benefits tumbling to a 43-year low last week and housing starts surging to a nine-year high in October.
The reports painted an upbeat picture of the economy early in the fourth quarter and came as Fed Chair Janet Yellen told lawmakers that the U.S. central bank could lift borrowing costs ""relatively soon."" 
""Today's data give the Fed more evidence to support a rate hike next month,"" said Alan MacEachin, corporate economist with Navy Federal Credit Union in Vienna, Virginia. ""The only thing standing in the way at this point would be a disastrous jobs report in early December, a remote possibility at best."" 
The Labor Department said its Consumer Price Index increased 0.4 percent last month after rising 0.3 percent in September. In the 12 months through October, the CPI advanced 1.6 percent, the biggest year-on-year increase since October 2014. The CPI increased 1.5 percent in the year to September.
Underlying inflation continued to slow last month as healthcare costs moderated after recent hefty gains. But with rents pushing higher, that trend is unlikely to be sustained.
The so-called core CPI, which strips out food and energy costs, climbed 0.1 percent last month after a similar gain in September. That slowed the year-on-year increase in the core CPI to 2.1 percent from a 2.2 percent rise in September. 
The Fed has a 2 percent inflation target and tracks an inflation measure which is currently at 1.7 percent.
The dollar was trading higher against a basket of currencies, while prices for U.S. government bonds fell. The broader PHLX housing index (HGX), which includes builders, building products and mortgage companies, rose 0.83 percent, outpacing gains on the U.S. stock market. 
In another report, the Labor Department said initial claims for state unemployment benefits dropped 19,000 to a seasonally adjusted 235,000 for the week ended Nov. 12, the lowest level since November 1973.
Claims have now been below 300,000, a threshold associated with a healthy labor market, for 89 straight weeks. That is the longest run since 1970, when the labor market was much smaller.
Firming inflation, strong retail sales, an improving housing and manufacturing sector as well as a labor market that is approaching full employment likely satisfy the criteria for the Fed to raise its overnight benchmark interest rate at its Dec. 13-14 policy meeting. 
Yellen told lawmakers on Thursday that a rate hike ""could well become appropriate relatively soon.""
The Fed this month left interest rates unchanged. The central bank lifted its benchmark overnight interest rate last December for the first time in nearly a decade.
INHERITING A STRONG ECONOMY 
Data so far suggests an acceleration in economic growth at the start of the fourth quarter. 
The Atlanta Fed on Thursday raised its fourth-quarter gross domestic product growth estimate by three-tenths of a percentage point to a 3.6 percent annual rate. The economy grew at a 2.9 percent pace in the third quarter. 
The stream of upbeat data suggest that president-elect Donald Trump is inheriting a strong economy, which has been credited to economic policies under the Obama administration.
""Trump seems to have hit the jackpot on dumb luck in inheriting an economy that is the strongest and the closest to full employment in years,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at 
MUFG Union Bank in New York.
Last month, a 7.0 percent jump in gasoline prices accounted for more than half of the increase in the CPI. Rents increased 0.4 percent last month after rising 0.3 percent. 
Households also paid more for a range of other goods and services last month, including new motor vehicles, apparel, education, auto insurance and tobacco.
But they got a respite from food prices, which were unchanged for a fourth straight month and food consumed at home declined for a sixth consecutive month. Medical care costs were unchanged for a second month and prescription medicine price increases also moderated from September's strong gain. 
Falling food prices are, however, hurting retailers like Wal-Mart Stores (N:WMT). The world's largest retailer on Thursday reported lower-than-expected quarterly sales at established U.S. stores.
    With the labor market firming and rents rising, housing is getting a lift. In a third report, the Commerce Department said housing starts jumped 25.5 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual pace of 1.32 million units last month, the highest level since August 2007. 
The percent increase was the biggest since July 1982. Starts increased in all four regions last month. Single-family homebuilding, which accounts for the largest share of the residential housing market, jumped 10.7 percent to a nine-year high. Housing starts for the volatile multi-family segment soared 68.8 percent.

Housing market strength is spurring demand for televisions and home theaters, fattening profits for retailers such as  Best Buy  (N:BBY). The largest U.S. electronics retailer reported a bigger-than-expected rise in quarterly profit and same-store sales on Thursday.

September's starts were unrevised at a 1.05 million-unit rate. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast housing starts rising to a 1.16 million-unit pace in October. Residential construction has been a drag on gross domestic product for two straight quarters.
Single-family home building, which accounts for the largest share of the residential housing market, jumped 10.7 percent to an 869,000-unit pace in October, the highest since October 2007.
The housing market is being driven by a tightening labor market, which is starting to drive up wages.
Housing starts for the volatile multi-family segment soared 68.8 percent to a 454,000-unit pace. Starts for buildings with five units or more hit their highest level since June 2015.

Permits for future construction edged up 0.3 percent in October. Single-family permits rose 2.7 percent last month, while building permits for multi-family units fell 3.3 percent.

Nonresident investors snapped up C$11.48 billion worth of bonds, primarily in new issues placed abroad by Canadian private corporations. They also bought C$5.69 billion worth of stocks while selling C$5.40 billion in money market paper.
Foreign purchases of Canadian securities from January to September hit an all-time high of C$119.92 billion, much greater than the C$82.37 billion amassed in the first nine months of 2015.
""Most of this increase reflected higher foreign investment in Canadian equities, mainly resulting from cross-border mergers and acquisitions activity,"" Statscan said in its daily bulletin.

At the same time, Canadians invested a net C$1.81 billion in foreign securities. Purchases of non-U.S. foreign shares hit C8.64 billion, the highest monthly total since December 2000, but were largely offset by sales of bonds and U.S. equities.

1578,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 17, 2016 08:41AM ET</span>",U.S. consumer prices post largest gain in six months,"WASHINGTON, (Reuters) - U.S. consumer prices recorded their biggest increase in six months in October on rising gasoline costs and rents, suggesting a pickup in inflation that
potentially clears the way for the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates in December.
The Labor Department said on Thursday its Consumer Price Index increased 0.4 percent last month after rising 0.3 percent in September. In the 12 months through October, the CPI advanced 1.6 percent, the biggest year-on-year increase since October 2014. The CPI increased 1.5 percent in the year to September.
Last month's increase in both the monthly and year-on-year CPI was in line with economists' expectations.
Underlying inflation, however, remained moderate. The so-called core CPI, which strips out food and energy costs, climbed 0.1 percent last month after a similar gain in September. That slowed the year-on-year increase in the core CPI to 2.1 percent from a 2.2 percent rise in September.
The Fed has a 2 percent inflation target and tracks an inflation measure which is currently at 1.7 percent.
The firming inflation backdrop and labor market that is approaching full employment are likely to encourage the U.S. central bank to raise borrowing costs at its Dec. 13-14 policy meeting.
The Fed this month left interest rates unchanged but said its monetary policy-setting committee ""judges that the case for an increase in the federal funds rate has continued to strengthen."" It bank lifted its benchmark overnight interest rate last December for the first time in nearly a decade.
Inflation could push higher in the coming years if president-elect Donald Trump's proposal to boost infrastructure and defense spending is implemented. The fiscal stimulus, against the backdrop of full employment, would entail a much faster pace of interest rate hikes than currently anticipated.
Last month, gasoline prices jumped 7.0 percent after rising 5.8 percent in September. Gasoline accounted for more than half of the increase in the CPI last month.
Food prices were unchanged for a fourth straight month. Food consumed at home declined for a sixth straight month.
Within the core CPI basket, housing continued its upward march in October. Rents increased 0.4 percent last month and owners' equivalent rent of primary residence rose 0.3 percent after gaining 0.4 percent in September.
Medical care costs were unchanged for a second month as a rise in hospital services was offset by a decline in the cost of doctor visits. Prices for prescription medicine rose 0.2 percent, slowing from September's 0.8 percent gain. There were increases in the prices of a range of other goods last month,

including new motor vehicles and apparel.

Analysts expected jobless claims to rise by 3,000 to 257,000 last week.
The four-week moving average was 253,500, down 6,500 from the previous week. The monthly average is seen as a more accurate gauge of labor trends because it reduces volatility in the week-to-week data.
Continuing jobless claims in the week ended November 5 fell to 1.977 million from 2.043 million in the preceding week. Analysts had expected continuing claims to inch down to 2.038 million.

Core CPI increased at annualized rate of 2.1% in October, also below the forecast for a gain of 2.2% which had been the prior month’s increase.
Core prices are viewed by the Federal Reserve (Fed) as a better gauge of longer-term inflationary pressure because they exclude the volatile food and energy categories. The central bank usually tries to aim for 2% core inflation or less.
Market participants may have a chance to hear Fed chair Janet Yellen’s comments on the inflation data when she responds to questions from Congress in her testimony to the Joint Economic Committee at 10:00AM ET (15:00GMT) on Thursday.

1583,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 17, 2016 08:00AM ET</span>",Colder weather helps UK retail sales growth to 14-year high: ONS,"By David Milliken and Andy Bruce
LONDON (Reuters) - British retail sales rose at their fastest annual rate in more than 14 years in October as cold weather and Halloween boosted sales, but economists said Brexit effects were likely to weigh on spending next year.
Thursday's data reinforced the robust message so far from consumers since June's vote to leave the European Union, even if the one-off factors lifting demand were unlikely to last.
Retail sales volumes in October jumped by 7.4 percent, the biggest annual rise since April 2002, the Office for National Statistics said, outstripping all forecasts in a Reuters poll .
""Cooler temperatures boosted clothing sales as shoppers took their cue to purchase winter clothing, while the supermarkets benefited from Halloween,"" ONS statistician Kate Davies said. 
Sterling gained modestly on the data. But the Bank of England and many economists fear higher prices caused by the Brexit hit to the value of the pound and slower jobs growth will eat into households' spare income. 
""This rate of spending growth looks unsustainable, and there are a number of headwinds on the horizon,"" Capital Economics' Paul Hollingsworth said. 
Thursday's figures showed store prices falling by the smallest amount since July 2014, and on Wednesday the ONS announced a slowdown in the rate of job creation.
It is unclear how quickly British consumers will feel the pinch. Finance minister Philip Hammond may cut taxes or boost public spending in his first budget statement on Nov. 23 to offset an expected fall in household incomes.
Sterling has fallen by more than 15 percent against the dollar since June's Brexit vote, pushing up import prices. But apart from a few high-profile exceptions, retailers have been reluctant to raise the price of everyday goods so far.
""Shops are waiting for each other to make the first move, unwilling to put off consumers ... This means the adjustment may be sudden when it happens,"" said Alasdair Cavalla, economist at consultancy CEBR.
Retail sales volumes jumped 1.9 percent on the month in October after edging up 0.1 percent in September, almost double the highest forecast in a Reuters poll of economists.
Retail sales are often volatile on a monthly basis. Clothing - which is particularly sensitive to the weather - gained 5.1 percent on the month, its biggest rise since March 2014, after mild weather dented demand in September. 
But even looking at the three months to October as a whole, sales were 5.9 percent higher than a year earlier, the biggest rise since June 2002.
 Tesco  (L:TSCO), Britain's biggest supermarket chain, reported on Tuesday its fastest annual sales growth for three years in the 12 weeks to Nov. 6.
However, Bank of England Governor Mark Carney warned this week that prices for British consumers will soon rise as stores start to pass on the effects of the fall in sterling since the referendum, eating into spending growth.

The central bank forecasts consumer price inflation will rise to 2.7 percent within a year from just 0.9 percent now, while real household consumption growth is predicted to slow to 1.25 percent in 2017 from 2.75 percent this year.

1584,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 17, 2016 05:30AM ET</span>","German economy creates more jobs, but employment growth slows","BERLIN (Reuters) - More people joined the German workforce over the summer months, but the rate of job creation slowed slightly compared with previous quarters, data showed on Thursday, suggesting domestic support for growth in Europe's biggest economy could weaken.
The economy is increasingly dependent on strong domestic demand to drive growth and offset weakness in foreign trade. A steady rise in employment levels, rising real wages and low interest rates are propelling household spending.
In the three months through September, 388,000 people joined the workforce, increasing it by 0.9 percent on the year to 43.7 million, data from the Federal Statistics Office showed. The increase was driven mainly by the services sector.
This marked a slowdown from job growth of 1.2 percent in the second quarter and 1.3 percent in the first, and mirrored a wider economic slowdown over the summer months.
The economy lost steam in the third quarter with overall gross domestic product growth halving to 0.2 percent from 0.4 percent in the three months through June due to a drop in exports, data showed on Tuesday.
Analysts expect the economy to end the year on a stronger note, though some are worried about the longer-term outlook for exports in the light of protectionist campaign promises by U.S. President-elect Donald Trump.

The government expects growth of 1.8 percent in 2016, slowing to 1.4 percent in 2017 on sluggish foreign trade.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. manufacturing output increased for a second straight month in October amid gains in the production of motor vehicles and a range of other goods, suggesting that the battered factory sector was slowly recovering.
Other data on Wednesday showed a moderation in producer inflation last month. Still, the disinflationary impulse is ebbing as oil prices rise and the dollar's rally fades, which could see an increase in price pressures in the coming months. 
The Federal Reserve said factory production rose 0.2 percent last month after a similar gain in September. Output was supported by a 0.9 percent rise in the production of motor vehicles and parts. There were also increases in the production of primary metals and computers and electronic products.
""With the global economic backdrop more stable and growth set to pick up in the United States, we expect to see activity in the manufacturing sector improve a bit in the coming months,"" said Tim Quinlan, a senior economist at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) in Charlotte, North Carolina.
The report added to a survey early this month showing a second straight month of expansion in factory activity in October. Manufacturing accounts for 12 percent of the U.S. economy. 
The sector has suffered a prolonged slump in the aftermath of the dollar's surge between June 2014 and January this year, which has constrained exports. Activity has also been hurt by the collapse in oil drilling after oil prices plunged.
Despite signs of improvement, gains in manufacturing output will likely remain modest against the backdrop of a still-strong dollar and sluggish global demand. 
Heavy machinery maker  Caterpillar  (NYSE:CAT) last month lowered its full-year revenue outlook for the second time this year. It said an ""abundance"" of used construction equipment, a ""substantial"" number of idle locomotives and a ""significant"" number of idle mining trucks had undercut demand.
Longer-dated U.S. government bonds were trading higher, while the dollar was little changed against a basket of currencies. U.S. stocks fell marginally.
MINING SHINES
There was good news on the mining front. Mining production jumped 2.1 percent last month, the largest increase since March 2014, after slipping 0.4 percent in September. 
Oil and gas well drilling surged 9.0 percent, building on September's 5.1 percent increase.
Despite the gains in manufacturing and mining output, overall industrial production was unchanged last month as utilities tumbled 2.6 percent. Unseasonably warm temperatures last month reduced demand for heating. 
Economists also blamed the decline in utility production on Hurricane Matthew, which lashed the southeast of the country during the month, causing flooding and knocking out power lines.
""The October numbers were likely biased downward by the Hurricane Matthew effect,"" said Andrew Hollenhorst, an economist at  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) in New York. ""We read today's report as supportive of the idea that the industrial sector is stabilizing.""
In a separate report on Wednesday, the Labor Department said its producer price index for final demand was unchanged last month as a rise in the cost of goods was offset by declining services costs. The PPI increased 0.3 percent in September. 
In the 12 months through October, the PPI increased 0.8 percent, the biggest gain since December 2014. That followed a 0.7 percent rise in September. 
A key gauge of underlying producer price pressures that excludes food, energy and trade services dipped 0.1 percent after rising 0.3 percent in September.
The so-called core PPI increased 1.6 percent in the 12 months through October, the largest rise since September 2014. That followed a 1.5 percent increase in September.

""Despite the moderation this month, we expect PPI gradually to pick up and to feed through to a firming in consumer prices,"" said Michael Gapen, chief economist at  Barclays  (LON:BARC) in New York.

Borrowing costs to buy a home and to refinance posted their steepest weekly increase since June 2013 during the ""taper tantrum"", with traders dumping bonds worldwide in reaction to Donald Trump's surprise U.S. presidential win on Nov. 8.
Traders are jittery about a surge in inflation, which erodes bond values, if Trump pushes for the types of tax cuts and federal spending he campaigned for, analysts said.
The Washington-based industry group's mortgage market index fell 9.2 percent to 436.3 in the week ended Nov. 11, which was the lowest level since the week of Jan. 15.
Interest rates on 30-year fixed-rate mortgages with conforming loan balances of $417,000 or less averaged 3.95 percent, which was up from 3.77 percent the previous week and the highest since January, MBA said.
Average interest rates on 15-year fixed-rate mortgages and five-year adjustable-rate mortgages rose to their highest levels since March at 3.15 percent and 3.11 percent, respectively, it said.
“Investor expectations of faster growth and higher inflation are driving the jump up in rates, and rates have now increased for five of the past six weeks, spurring a commensurate drop in refinance activity,"" MBA president and CEO David Stevens said in a statement.
MBA's weekly measure on application activity for refinancing fell last week 10.9 percent to 1,810.1, its lowest level since March.
The refinance share of overall mortgage activity fell to 61.9 percent, down from 62.3 percent the previous week.

In a report, the Commerce Department said that October producer prices were unchanged from the previous month, missing the forecast for a 0.3% advance that matched September’s gain.
Year-over-year, the producer price index (PPI) rose 0.8%, compared to expectations for a gain of 1.2% and following a 0.7% increase in the preceding month.
The core producer price index, that excludes food and energy, fell by 0.2% in October, missing forecasts for a gain of 0.2% which was the reading a month earlier.
Core producer prices increased at an annualized rate of 1.2% last month, compared to expectations for an advance of 1.5% and after rising 1.2% in the preceding month.
Core prices are viewed by the Federal Reserve as a better gauge of longer-term inflationary pressure because they exclude the volatile food and energy categories. Furthermore, when producers pay more for goods, they are more likely to pass price increases on to the consumer, so PPI could be considered a leading indicator of inflation.

The Office for National Statistics said that the rate of unemployment unexpectedly fell to 4.8% in the three months to September, beating expectations for it to remain stable for a fifth consecutive month at 4.9%. That level marked a new 11-year low.
The claimant count rose by a seasonally adjusted 9,800 in October, compared to expectations for a increase of 2,000 people, and following an increase of 5,600 a month earlier, whose figure was revised up from a previously reported gain of 700.
Meanwhile, the average earnings index, including bonuses, rose by a seasonally adjusted 2.3% in the three months to September, compared to forecasts for a 2.3% advance and after increasing by 2.3% in the three months to August.
Excluding bonuses, wages rose by 2.4%, which was in line with forecasts and followed a 2.3% increase in the three months to August.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australian wages grew at their slowest pace on record last quarter, a depressant for consumer spending and a challenge to policymakers' hopes that inflation had finally bottomed out.
The Australian Bureau of Statistics said on Wednesday that its wage price index rose just 0.4 percent in July-September, the smallest increase since the data series began in 1997.
Annual wage growth braked to 1.9 percent, again the lowest on record, and under already meager forecasts of 2.0 percent. That was less than half the wage growth rate workers enjoyed a decade ago when a mining boom boosted pay awards across the nation.
It also belies an economy that is growing at over 3 percent - much faster than its rich-world peers - and a downside threat to inflation that is already running at all-time lows.
The wage growth slowdown was a setback for the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA), which left interest rates at 1.5 percent this month in part because it was more confident inflation had turned a corner.
""The fact that we've had another weaker number is important information for the RBA,"" said JP Morgan Economist Ben Jarman.
""The RBA needs the economy to run red hot from here for a couple of years to drag inflation back up. The narrative about inflation recovering is very vulnerable to any faltering on the activity side.""
The Australian dollar fell 0.2 percent to $0.7540 after the data, but futures markets <0#YIB:> still imply a mere 16 percent chance of a rate cut by mid-2017.
Underlying inflation is stuck at an anaemic 1.50 percent but RBA Governor Philip Lowe said on Tuesday there were ""reasonable prospects"" that inflation will return to the RBA's target band of 2-3 percent.
The RBA's optimism partly emanates from a leap in the price of iron ore and coal - Australia's two biggest exports.
It argued wages would increase gradually in line with an improvement in the jobs market and the end of the drag on growth from a slump in mining investment.
Yet there was scant sign of a pick-up in Wednesday's report. Not a single industry from manufacturing to healthcare raised wages more than 2.5 percent annually. Even mining has lost its Midas touch, with workers getting an annual rise of only 1.0 percent.
""Businesses are more likely to take advantage of the adequate supply of labor and use the commodity price windfall to raise profits and boost investment rather than wages,"" said Paul Dales, Sydney-based chief economist at Capital Economics.

""So while the outlook for domestic activity has improved, the era of unusually low underlying inflation isn't over.""

1609,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 15, 2016 02:42PM ET</span>",Strong U.S. retail sales reinforce December interest rate hike,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. retail sales rose more than expected in October as households bought motor vehicles and a range of other goods, pointing to sustained economic strength that could allow the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates next month.
The Commerce Department said on Tuesday retail sales increased 0.8 percent last month, also boosted by demand for building materials, likely as households cleaned up and made repairs in the wake of Hurricane Matthew. 
""This is just the kind of data the Fed doves need to see to convince them to hike rates in December. The economy is doing pretty well, this data is bullish for the economic outlook in the months ahead,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG Union Bank in New York. 
Adding to the report's strong tone, September retail sales were revised up to show a 1.0 percent increase instead of the previously reported 0.6 percent rise. The combined September and October sales gain was the largest two-month rise since early 2014. Sales were up 4.3 percent from a year ago. 
Excluding automobiles, gasoline, building materials and food services, retail sales jumped 0.8 percent last month after an upwardly revised 0.3 percent gain in September.
These so-called core retail sales, which correspond most closely with the consumer spending component of gross domestic product, were previously reported to have risen 0.1 percent in September. 
Economists had forecast overall retail sales increasing 0.6 percent and core sales advancing 0.3 percent last month. 
The strong sales report is a good omen heading into the holiday shopping season. Last week, Macy's and Kohl's Corp expressed optimism about the holiday shopping season, despite reporting a decline in sales in the third quarter.
U.S. stocks were trading mostly higher, while the dollar was little changed against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasuries rose after declining for five straight trading sessions.
SUSTAINED STRENGTH 
September's upward revision to core retail sales suggests that the economy's 2.9 percent annualized growth rate in the third quarter could be raised when the government publishes its second GDP estimate later this month. 
Coming on the heels of data this month showing a rapidly tightening labor market and signs of a turnaround in the manufacturing sector, the upbeat retail sales report implied a pickup in economic activity early in the fourth quarter. 
The Atlanta Fed lifted its fourth-quarter GDP growth estimate by two-tenths of a percentage point to a 3.3 percent rate after Tuesday's data. 
The report also reinforced views that the Fed will raise interest rates at its Dec. 13-14 policy meeting. 
Rate hike prospects have also been boosted by a rally in U.S. stocks in the wake of the last week's election of Republican candidate Donald Trump as the next president, despite a lot of hand-wringing over his proposed policies.
The Fed this month left interest rates unchanged but said its monetary policy-setting committee ""judges that the case for an increase in the federal funds rate has continued to strengthen."" The U.S. central bank raised its benchmark overnight interest rate last December and has held it steady since, largely because of concerns over low inflation.
But inflation is creeping higher. A separate report on Tuesday from the Labor Department showed import prices increased 0.5 percent in October after gaining 0.2 percent in September. In the 12 months through October, import prices fell 0.2 percent, the smallest decrease since July 2014, after declining 1.0 percent in September. 
Retail sales last month were driven by a 1.1 percent increase in auto sales and a 1.5 percent surge in receipts at online retailers. Online retailers like Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) have been grabbing market share from traditional department chains like Macy's and Kohl's. 
Sales at building material stores increased 1.1 percent following a 1.8 percent rise in September. The strength in this category was reflected in Home Depot's robust third-quarter profit and sales reported on Tuesday.
Receipts at sporting goods and hobby stores rose 1.3 percent. Sales at restaurants and bars, however, fell 0.7 percent, likely as the stormy weather kept people at home.
Households also spent more on clothing, groceries and grooming last month, but cut back on furniture. Receipts at service stations advanced 2.2 percent on rising gasoline prices. 

""As uncertainty over the election outcome remains elevated, October's retail sales performance provides some comfort that the primary driver of U.S. GDP growth remains on solid footing,"" said Sam Bullard, a senior economist at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) Securities in Charlotte, North Carolina.

BERLIN (Reuters) - The euro zone economy grew steadily in the three months after Britain's shock vote in June to leave the European Union but U.S. President-elect Donald Trump's protectionist rhetoric is clouding the outlook for 2017.
Uncertainty about the trade policy Trump will pursue once he takes office is weighing on euro zone sentiment, increasing the likelihood that the European Central Bank will retain its loose monetary policy to support growth in the 19-country bloc.
Gross domestic product (GDP) in the euro zone expanded by 0.3 percent in the third quarter, on a par with April-June, the EU's statistics office said on Tuesday, confirming an earlier flash estimate.
The data showed ""the pace of growth in Spring could be maintained despite the Brexit vote in June,"" NordLB analyst Christian Lips said. ""That was far from self-evident."" 
But ""we now have the election of Donald Trump as the new U.S. President, whose policy is less predictable and whose political inexperience and impulsiveness are likely to be a consistent source of irritation,"" Lips added.
Uncertainty about the length and outcome of Brexit negotiations between London and Brussels is also expected to limit the euro zone's medium-term growth prospects while Trump's talk of protectionism has unnerved big exporters like Germany.
Europe's largest economy eked out weaker-than-expected growth of 0.2 percent in the third quarter as foreign trade slowed.
""Positive impulses on the quarter came mainly from domestic demand,"" the German Federal Statistics Office said. ""Both household and state spending managed to increase further.""
Higher investment in construction also contributed to overall growth, suggesting the ECB's record-low interest rates are supporting the economic recovery.
""In our view, the latest less dynamic growth figure is not a reason to be concerned,"" UniCredit economist Andreas Rees said, adding that most forward-looking data suggested the Q3 slowdown was a bump in the road, not a signal of longer-lasting weakness.
DekaBank analyst Andreas Scheuerle agreed, saying the signs for the final quarter were positive as global demand for German goods was picking up again.
Supporting this view, a survey by the Mannheim-based ZEW institute showed that the mood among German investors improved more than expected in November.
ZEW President Achim Wambach attributed the fourth consecutive monthly rise in the economic sentiment indicator to positive data in the United States and China.
""The election of Donald Trump as U.S. president and the resulting political and economic uncertainties have, however, had an impact,"" Wambach said, adding that responses received after Trump's victory were less upbeat than those before.
PROTECTIONISM
In Berlin, Chancellor Angela Merkel told a business conference the German economy was doing fine and had shown it could adapt to a changing global environment. In a thinly veiled warning to Trump, she cautioned against protectionism.
Anton Boerner, head of the BGA trade association, said a trend towards isolation and protectionism would pose a threat to euro zone exporters. ""Growth is declining, uncertainties are rising,"" he added, referring to Germany.
National readouts from across the euro zone showed a mixed picture, with Italy's economy growing by 0.3 percent in July-September and Portugal's by 0.8 percent.
The Dutch economy grew 0.7 percent on the quarter and unemployment fell sharply - welcome news for Prime Minister Mark Rutte's government, which trails the far-right Freedom Party four months before a parliamentary election.
Finland's economy expanded 0.5 percent in the third quarter after stagnating in the previous three months.
ING Bank economist Carsten Brzeski said Germany's domestic economy should be strong enough to ensure solid though perhaps waning GDP growth in the coming quarters.
""However, if Germany's single most important trading partner, the United States, really moves towards more protectionism, this would definitely leave its mark on German growth,"" he said.
The German government forecasts 2016 growth of 1.8 percent, the highest in five years, slowing to 1.4 percent next year. 
Lips at NordLB said next year would be marked by political and economic risks, curbing growth prospects in the euro zone.

""The ECB therefore surely does not have a departure from its expansive monetary policy on the agenda for its December meeting,"" he added.

LONDON (Reuters) - British inflation slipped unexpectedly last month, but Bank of England Governor Mark Carney warned higher prices are on the way, with cost pressures in factories already ballooning thanks to sterling's Brexit slump.
Annual consumer price inflation weakened to 0.9 percent in October from 1.0 percent in September. Economists taking part in a Reuters poll had expected inflation to rise to 1.1 percent.
But Carney pointed to strong factory-price inflation that probably marks the ""first stage"" of the impact of the decline in sterling, which is down around 20 percent against the dollar since Britain's June 23 vote to leave the European Union. 
The cost of materials and oil for factories showed the biggest monthly jump since records started in 1996, leaping by 4.6 percent in October alone. And prices for goods leaving factories rose by 2.1 percent on the year, the biggest increase since April 2012. 
While the Office for National Statistics said it had no clear evidence that sterling's plunge had raised prices on the high street, Carney said that was on it way. 
""The pass-through from a 20 percent fall in the trade-weighted level of sterling is going to come,"" he told lawmakers.
Carney said a pick-up in inflation expectations in Britain was also being driven by a better outlook for the economy.
The BoE forecasts that inflation will rise to about 2.7 percent around this time next year. 
Inflation expectations around the world have also surged in the last week, driven by U.S. President-elect Donald Trump's plans to increase government spending in the world's biggest economy.
Sterling and British government bond yields fell after Tuesday's data. 
Wages are expected to grow more slowly than inflation next year, meaning many households are likely to face a squeeze in their living standards.
Carney has said the central bank could tolerate some overshoot against its inflation target, to help accommodate economic growth and employment.

But earlier this month the BoE kept interest rates on hold, despite having signaled a cut only months earlier.
An ONS measure of core consumer price inflation - which strips out changes in the price of energy, food, alcohol and tobacco - slipped to 1.2 percent in October from 1.5 percent. Economists had expected a smaller decline, to 1.4 percent.
Clothing prices and university tuition fees pushed down on consumer price inflation last month, but prices paid by consumers for fuels and lubricants rose at the fastest pace since April 2012.

1615,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 15, 2016 09:02AM ET</span>",India's cooling retail inflation bolsters rate cut hopes,"NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India's retail inflation eased for a third straight month in October, helped by smaller rises in food prices, boosting the chances of an interest rate cut by the central bank next month.
Consumer prices  rose by an annual 4.20 percent last month, their slowest pace in 14 months, government data showed on Tuesday.
The figure matched the median consensus in a Reuters' poll of economists. Retail prices were up 4.39 percent in September on the year.
Food inflation was 3.32 percent, lower than 3.96 percent recorded in September.
The data comes days after Prime Minister Narendra Modi ordered the withdrawal of large denomination banknotes from circulation, in a shock ""demonetization"" drive to fight tax evasion, corruption and forgery.
The sudden move to cancel old 500-rupee and 1,000-rupee banknotes, which accounted for 86 percent of the cash circulating in Asia's third-largest economy, has caused huge disruption to daily life, depressing consumer demand. 
People struggling to get new bills are holding back on spending, except for immediate and urgent needs. The price of fresh produce has collapsed in food markets, leaving farmers and traders sitting on rotting stocks.
Once the initial shock wears off, the formal economy is likely to expand at the expense of fly-by-night traders who deal in cash. That in turn may improve the efficiency of markets and make it easier for the Reserve Bank of India's (RBI) to hit its medium-term inflation target of 4 percent.
""The 'black money' drive will increase the pace of deceleration, specifically in the service sector, which has a lot of cash transactions,"" said Soumya Kanti Ghosh, chief economist at State Bank of India. 
""I expect a rate cut in December and that won't be the end.""
The RBI's recently formed monetary policy committee (MPC) is due to review rates on Dec. 6 and 7.
The monetary panel cut the repo policy rate by 25 basis points last month to a near six-year low of 6.25 percent.
While the odds have increased for another rate cut, some analysts reckon an impending interest rate increase in the United States could force a status quo until February.
The Federal Reserve is widely expected to raise interest rates at its meeting on Dec. 13-14, the first hike in a year.
There is also a worry that the demonetization drive could hit winter crops as farmers are facing problems in buying seeds and fertilizers. 
""The situation is fairly fluid in the early days (of) post-demonetization,"" said Aditi Nayar, senior economist at ICRA. 

""The MPC may choose to observe the evolving growth-inflation dynamics and defer a rate cut till the February 2017 policy review.""

Economists polled by Reuters had forecast import prices rising 0.4 percent last month after a previously reported 0.1 percent increase.
In the 12 months through October, import prices fell 0.2 percent, the smallest decrease since July 2014, after declining 1.0 percent in September.
The strong dollar has resulted in the country importing deflation, helping to hold inflation persistently below the Federal Reserve's 2 percent target.
But with the dollar's rally gradually fading and oil prices continuing to stabilize, some of the deflationary pressures from overseas are easing, which should allow inflation to steadily rise toward its target.
Last month, imported petroleum prices surged 7.5 percent after rising 1.6 percent in September. Import prices excluding petroleum dipped 0.1 after being unchanged the prior month. The cost of imported food fell 0.6 percent.
Prices for imported capital goods slipped 0.2 percent, while the cost of imported automobiles increased 0.3 percent. Imported consumer goods prices excluding automobiles edged up 0.1 percent last month.

""Positive impulses on the quarter came mainly from domestic demand. Both household and state spending managed to increase further,"" the office said.
Unadjusted data showed the economy expanded by 1.5 percent on the year in the third quarter, also missing the Reuters consensus forecast for 1.8 percent growth.
On a working day adjusted basis, the annual GDP growth rate was 1.7 percent.

Domestic Economic Conditions
Members commenced their discussion of the domestic economy by considering how outcomes over recent years had differed from earlier forecasts, noting that the differences for key variables, including inflation, the unemployment rate and GDP growth, had been modest by historical standards. Commodity prices and the terms of trade, though, had fallen by more than expected over this period, partly because global commodity production had been more resilient and demand, particularly from China, had been lower than expected. The staff's analysis also indicated that the spillovers from falling commodity prices and the associated declines in mining investment had been larger than expected over this period. At the same time, wage growth had generally been lower than implied by its historical relationship with the unemployment rate. The decline in wage growth had been a helpful part of the adjustment of the economy to the end of the resources boom. The depreciation of the Australian dollar was also helpful, although that had occurred later and was somewhat less than inferred by its historical relationship with the terms of trade.
Turning to the latest forecasts, which were little changed from those presented three months earlier, members observed that bulk commodity prices had increased significantly since the beginning of 2016. Consequently, the terms of trade had risen for the first time in two and a half years and had been revised higher over the forecast period. Members noted, however, that there was significant uncertainty about the outlook for the terms of trade, partly because of uncertainty about the outlook for the Chinese economy.
As expected, Australia's GDP growth appeared to have moderated around the middle of the year following strong growth in the March quarter. GDP growth was expected to decline in year-ended terms before increasing to be above potential growth later in the forecast period. Growth in resource exports was forecast to continue to make a significant contribution to output growth, while the drag on growth from falling mining investment was projected to diminish. Growth in non-mining activity was expected to continue at around an average pace.
Consumption growth had been below average in the June quarter, consistent with slower growth in retail sales. Since then, retail sales growth appeared to have remained modest, although measures of consumer sentiment regarding personal finances had risen and were clearly above average. Despite this, consumption was expected to continue making a large contribution to growth in overall expenditure over the forecast period and to grow faster than household disposable income, which implied a further gradual decline in the saving ratio. Members noted that there was significant uncertainty about the outlook for consumption growth given uncertainty about households' expectations of their income growth and the influence of these expectations on their spending and saving decisions. This was particularly pronounced for households with significant debt.
The value of building approvals had reached record levels as a share of GDP and the amount of work in the pipeline had edged higher, suggesting that dwelling investment would support growth for some time yet. Conditions in established housing markets had continued to diverge across the country. Housing price growth in Sydney and Melbourne had increased noticeably since earlier in the year. Members noted that high and rising population growth in Victoria, which reflected population inflows from both overseas and other parts of Australia, had supported conditions in Melbourne's housing market. In contrast, housing market conditions had been particularly weak in Perth, where population growth had declined from earlier high rates, rental vacancy rates had risen and rents had fallen. Nationally, housing credit growth had remained lower than a year earlier at around 6 per cent per annum, although loan approvals to investors had picked up over recent months.
Members observed that revisions to the annual national accounts data for the preceding few years had been minimal for most key aggregates, including consumption and business investment. However, some business investment had been ‘reclassified’ from the non-mining sector to the mining sector. The new data suggested that mining investment had peaked at a higher level than previously recorded and that non-mining business investment had declined a little in the lead-up to the peak in mining investment. Subsequently, non-mining business investment had recorded modest growth, in contrast to the earlier vintage of data, which had implied no growth in non-mining business investment over the preceding few years. The revisions to non-mining investment were more consistent with survey measures of business conditions and capacity utilisation, which had been on an upward trend for some time and above their long-run averages over the preceding two years.
Recent data confirmed that employment growth had been concentrated in part-time employment and had continued to decline over recent months. In addition, the participation rate had fallen to levels last seen in late 2014. Members noted that the current experience of relatively strong growth in part-time employment (compared with full-time employment) was unusual insofar as such a pattern was typically associated with rising unemployment rates. While the unemployment rate had declined in previous months and over the previous year, the underemployment rate had remained elevated. Members noted that the degree of spare capacity in the labour market depended on how many additional hours workers were seeking and that relevant data were not readily available.
The unemployment rate was expected to edge lower, which was little changed from the outlook presented three months earlier. The forecasts incorporated a small downward revision to the outlook for both employment growth and the level of the participation rate, largely to reflect recent data and information from forward-looking indicators, which pointed to modest employment growth in the months ahead. Members observed that there was uncertainty about the degree of spare capacity in the labour market and how this might ultimately affect inflationary pressures.
Members noted that the earlier forecasts had over-predicted wage growth since 2011. This in part reflected the fact that there had been more spare capacity in the labour market than forecast in the years immediately following the end of the resources boom and that commodity prices had fallen by more than expected. Members also noted, however, that many advanced economies had experienced lower-than-expected wage growth, even those considered to be close to full employment. More recently, there had been evidence that wage growth in Australia had stabilised and that the effect on aggregate measures of labour costs of workers moving from mining-related activities to lower-paying jobs in the non-mining sector might almost have run its course. Members discussed the joint analytical work conducted by the Bank and the Australian Bureau of Statistics on micro-level wage price index data, which showed that a significant fall in the proportion of jobs receiving wage increases of more than 4 per cent had been part of the explanation of lower aggregate wage growth.Underlying inflation had remained around 1½ per cent in year-ended terms in the September quarter, much as had been expected. Headline inflation was 1.3 per cent, with a notable contribution from fruit and vegetable prices in the September quarter. Petrol prices had subtracted from CPI inflation over the year, but were expected to add a little to headline inflation in the December quarter. The recent CPI data had confirmed that domestic cost pressures remained subdued, which was particularly evident in prices of market services. Also, rental inflation had remained very low and there had been a broad-based decline in growth in dwelling construction costs, which was somewhat at odds with the strength of housing construction in many parts of the country. The prices of tradable items (excluding volatile items and tobacco) had fallen slightly in the September quarter but were unchanged over the year.
Members observed that there had been little change to the underlying inflation forecast. Underlying inflation was expected to remain at around 1½ per cent over 2016, before rising to 1½–2½ per cent by the end of the forecast period. Growth in labour costs was expected to increase gradually over the forecast period, consistent with further gradual improvements in the labour market and the end of the drag on growth from falling mining investment and the earlier decline in the terms of trade. Moreover, the disinflationary effect from heightened retail competition was expected to dissipate over time. On the other hand, low rental inflation was expected to persist – reflecting the strength of additions to the housing stock – while the boost to the prices of tradable items from the earlier depreciation of the exchange rate was likely to have run its course.
International Economic Conditions
Growth in Australia's major trading partners had been a little below average over the prior year. Growth was expected to decline a little over the following two years, much as had been expected three months earlier. In large part this reflected the expectation that growth in China would gradually ease further. In contrast, output in the major advanced economies was expected to grow at a little above estimates of potential growth. Inflationary pressures in the advanced economies were expected to rise gradually as spare capacity in labour and product markets declined and the drag from earlier declines in oil prices, and commodity prices more generally, dissipated. Members noted that, following a long period of low global inflationary pressures, the risks to inflation appeared to be more balanced.
The downside risks to growth in China in the near term had diminished somewhat because conditions in the property market had improved, supported by rapid growth of housing prices and credit, and there had been strong growth in government-funded infrastructure projects. Although the growth in construction activity had supported an increase in production in industries that supply construction materials, including steel, there was still overcapacity in some parts of the industrial sector and growth in private sector fixed asset investment had remained subdued. At the same time, the authorities had restricted the domestic production of bulk commodities, which had contributed to a rise in coal prices. Higher commodity prices had been associated with a more broadly based increase in producer prices in China over recent months, following a few years of noticeable deflation. Members observed that the longer-term risks to China's economy associated with high and rising debt remained.
In the major advanced economies, growth had continued to be supported by accommodative monetary policy and labour market conditions had improved further. Consumption growth had continued to support the recoveries in the United States and the euro area. Inflation had remained below most central banks' targets to varying degrees, although the rise in commodity prices in previous months, particularly for oil, implied some upward pressure on headline inflation. Members noted that core inflation was only a little below the target of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC). More positive economic data in previous months had led to markets pricing in a higher probability of an increase in the US policy rate before the end of the year. Inflation in the euro area had remained below the target of the European Central Bank (ECB), although economists' long-run inflation expectations appeared to have remained relatively well anchored. In contrast, core inflation and inflation expectations had declined in Japan, despite the historically low unemployment rate.
Financial Markets
Members observed that financial markets had been fairly quiet over the prior month.
Market expectations for a rise in the US federal funds rate had increased over the previous month and the minutes from the September meeting of the FOMC had revealed that most members saw the case for a rate increase as having strengthened in the preceding months. Market pricing indicated strong expectations of a rate rise in December. The ECB had left policy rates unchanged at its October meeting and indicated that it would discuss the outcome of the review of its asset purchase program at its December meeting. Market observers expected the program to be extended beyond the scheduled end-date of ‘at least March 2017’. Members noted that the Bank of Japan meeting was being held at the same time as the Reserve Bank Board meeting, with its policy announcement scheduled for later in the day. Market expectations of a further easing in policy by the Bank of England had been wound back, partly reflecting more encouraging economic data.
After falling throughout the first half of 2016, government bond yields in the major economies had been rising during the second half of the year, although they remained at low levels. A scaling back of expectations for central bank asset purchases, together with stronger data and higher inflation expectations, had contributed to the pick-up in yields. Credit market conditions remained favourable for most corporations, with corporate bond spreads in most of the major economies having narrowed recently, partly reflecting more encouraging economic data. Members noted that the cost of borrowing US dollars in money markets had fallen a little in October following the implementation of new regulations for US money market funds.
Share prices for banks in the major share markets of the United States and Europe had outperformed the broader indices over prior months, following some improvement in profit results.
The US dollar exchange rate had appreciated a little in October, with the movement having been broadly based against the major currencies. The Japanese yen and UK pound had depreciated on a trade-weighted basis, while the euro and Chinese renminbi had been little changed in trade-weighted terms. Members noted that the sharp depreciation of the UK pound on 7 October had been short lived and had not been accompanied by any other volatility in currency markets. The Australian dollar exchange rate had been little changed since the October meeting.
Australian government bond yields had increased by around 40 basis points in October, in line with developments in bond markets overseas. Yields remained low and the issuance of a 30-year bond for the first time had been well received both domestically and abroad.
Australian banks' bond issuance had been around average in October but had been strong in 2016 overall. In contrast, issuance of Australian non-financial corporate bonds had been relatively low in 2016, reflecting little issuance by resource firms. Yields for both banks' and non-financial corporates' bonds had remained very low.
Australian share prices declined in October to be little changed from the beginning of 2016. However, prices of resource stocks had increased, reflecting a strengthening earnings outlook in line with the rise in commodity prices. Financials' share prices had also risen a little. Overall, dividends had declined, driven by the resources sector, while banks' dividends had increased.
There had been little change to bank deposit rates in October, with the exception of some reversals of previous increases in term deposit rates by the major banks. The cost of banks' funding sourced from wholesale debt markets had declined by almost 20 basis points since the August cash rate reduction and was expected to decline further as the cost of new issuance remained below the cost of outstanding debt. There had been little change to housing or business lending rates in October.
Members noted that financial market pricing indicated that market participants expected virtually no chance of a reduction in the cash rate at the November meeting.
Considerations for Monetary Policy
In considering the stance of monetary policy, members noted that the run of international and domestic data over the past few months had been consistent with earlier expectations and there had been little change to the forecasts since they were presented in the August Statement on Monetary Policy.
The global economy was continuing to grow at a lower-than-average pace. The steadying of economic conditions in China had reduced some of the downside risks to the global growth outlook in the near term and had been accompanied by an increase in commodity prices. The turn-around in commodity prices since the beginning of 2016 had underpinned an increase in Australia's terms of trade and the outlook for the terms of trade had been revised a little higher. Members noted that this was a marked change from the pattern of downward revisions to the forecast for the terms of trade over the previous few years and implied a more positive outlook for nominal growth in the Australian economy.
Higher commodity prices and expectations that growth in the major advanced economies would exceed potential growth suggested that the risks to the global inflation outlook were more balanced than they had been for some time. However, inflation remained below most central banks' targets and monetary policy settings were expected to remain accommodative. Government bond yields had risen, but were still low by historical standards. Globally, financial markets had continued to function effectively and funding costs had remained low.
The domestic economy appeared to have continued growing at a moderate pace in the September quarter and the transition of activity from the mining sector to non-mining sector of the economy had continued. Low interest rates had been supporting domestic demand and the lower exchange rate since 2013 had been helping the traded sector. These factors were continuing to assist the economy to make the necessary adjustments, although it was noted that an appreciating exchange rate could complicate this adjustment. GDP growth in year-ended terms was expected to be close to estimates of potential growth over the next few quarters and then to rise to be a little above potential growth thereafter. The unemployment rate had declined over the previous year and was expected to continue to edge lower over the forecast period. Considerable uncertainty remained about the strength of labour market conditions and the implications for labour cost growth. Underlying inflation had remained low in the September quarter, much as had been expected, and was expected to pick up gradually over the forecast period. Members observed that some indicators of domestic inflation cost pressures, such as growth in the wage price index, had stabilised, albeit at low levels, and that underlying inflation was expected to return to more normal levels over time. The overall assessment was that the risks around the inflation forecast were broadly balanced.
Members noted that assessing conditions in the housing market had become more complicated. While overall conditions had eased relative to 2015, some indicators had strengthened over the previous few months. In particular, housing price growth had picked up noticeably in Sydney and Melbourne. However, housing turnover and growth in housing credit both remained lower than a year earlier, consistent with the supervisory measures that had been taken to tighten lending standards and the more cautious attitude to lending in certain segments. In addition, a considerable supply of apartments is scheduled to come on stream over the next few years, particularly in the eastern capital cities, and growth in rents in the September quarter was the slowest for some decades.
Taking account of the available information, and having eased monetary policy at its May and August meetings, the Board judged that holding the stance of policy unchanged at this meeting would be consistent with sustainable growth in the economy and achieving the inflation target over time.
The Decision
The Board decided to leave the cash rate unchanged at 1.50 per cent.

The survey of consumer expectations, an increasingly influential gauge of prices for the U.S. central bank, found that inflation is expected to be identical one and three years into the future, according to the median.
It found that year-ahead inflation expectations edged up to 2.6 percent last month. That is up from 2.5 percent in September, which was the survey's lowest recorded level. 
Three-year ahead expectations were flat at 2.6 percent, near a record low for the online survey that has shown a gradual decline in both price measures since it began in mid-2013.
Since Republican Donald Trump was elected U.S. president last week, market-based inflation expectations have risen sharply. The Fed is looking for evidence of inflation as it contemplates another interest rate hike, as soon as December.

1636,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 14, 2016 05:16AM ET</span>","China data point to steadier economy for now, but Trump victory adds to risks","By Elias Glenn and Kevin Yao
BEIJING (Reuters) - China's economy largely showed further signs of steadying in October as expected, but disappointing retail sales growth and fears of U.S. trade frictions under incoming President Donald Trump are increasingly clouding the outlook.
Fixed-asset investment quickened slightly and beat expectations in January-October as the government stepped up infrastructure spending to support growth, official data showed on Monday.
But a number of other indicators released over the past week from exports to bank lending, as well as expectations of a slowdown in the heated property market, suggest economic momentum may falter in the months ahead.
""On balance, today's data suggest that the recent recovery in economic activity continued into the fourth quarter,"" Capital Economics said in a note.
""We expect growth to hold up well for another quarter or two. However, with credit growth now slowing and the property market beginning to cool the drivers of the recent recovery look set to fizzle out early next year.""
China's leaders have depended on a surging real estate market and government infrastructure spending to drive activity this year and look set to meet their growth target of 6.5 to 7 percent. The construction boom in turn has helped perk up the ailing industrial sector, spurring demand for cement to steel.
But top policymakers and investors are also clearly growing more concerned about the risks of prolonged debt-fueled stimulus.
China's overall debt has jumped to more than 250 percent of GDP from 150 percent at the end of 2006, the kind of surge that in other countries has resulted in a financial bust or sharp economic slowdown, analysts say.
""I believe the overall policy tone has turned to risk management as the authorities are concerned about asset bubbles,"" said Singapore-based economist Zhou Hao at Commerzbank (DE:CBKG), predicting that the government will throttle back its aggressive stimulus before the end of the year.
INVESTMENT STILL HEAVILY RELIANT ON GOVERNMENT
Fixed-asset investment expanded 8.3 percent in the first 10 months from a year earlier, slightly ahead of market expectations and supported largely by government spending.
Investment by state firms surged 20.5 percent, though the pace cooled slightly from the first nine months.
In an encouraging sign, growth of private investment picked up to 2.9 percent from 2.5 percent in January-September, though it remained sluggish after hitting a record low of 2.1 percent in the first eight months of the year.
Private investment accounts for about 60 percent of overall investment in China.
Chinese policymakers have been trying to lure private investors into big infrastructure projects through public-private partnerships, but many lucrative sectors are still dominated by less efficient state firms. 
UNCERTAINTIES
The most surprising miss for October was found in retail sales, though analysts were quick to note it was too early to tell if slowing consumption would turn into a trend.
Retail sales growth cooled to a five-month low of 10.0 percent from 10.7 percent in September. Analysts had forecast they would hold steady.
On Friday,  Alibaba  Group Holding Ltd's (N:BABA) Singles' Day festival posted a record 120.7 billion yuan ($17.73 billion) worth of sales, though the gala shopping day saw growth slow as Chinese shoppers searched for deeper discounts and lower price tags.
Statistics bureau spokesman Mao Shengyong blamed the sales slowdown on a high level of comparison with last year.
""Consumption can maintain stable growth. There should not be a problem achieving this year’s GDP growth targets,"" he told a news briefing.
October industrial output also missed expectations but to a much smaller degree, rising 6.1 percent, the same pace as in September but marginally less than forecast.
Stronger factory prices have helped boost industrial profits, relieving some pressure on companies squeezed by higher costs and weak demand, though there are concerns some of the gains are due to speculation and are not sustainable.
Data last week showed a sharp slowdown in bank lending last month, suggesting demand for mortgages is cooling after a spate of steps by local governments last month to restrict home purchases to cool soaring prices.
While property investment growth quickened in October to its highest since April 2014, some analysts suggested it could be due to a last-minute push by developers to complete construction projects as home sales and surging prices start to slow.
October exports and imports also fell more than expected, adding to doubts that the pick-up in economic activity in the world's largest trading nation can be sustained even if a trade war with the U.S. does not materialize.
Trump had lambasted China throughout the campaign, drumming up headlines with his pledges to slap 45 percent tariffs on imported Chinese goods and label the country a currency manipulator his first day in office.
China's top leaders are due to map out economic and reform plans for 2017 at the annual Central Economic Work Conference expected in December. 

Analysts believe it's too early for the government to start withdrawing policy support now due to rising domestic and global uncertainties, despite the risk of added debt.

1637,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 14, 2016 05:10AM ET</span>",Euro zone September industry output falls less than expected,"BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Euro zone industrial production fell by less than expected in September, driven down mostly by a steep drop in the output of durable goods, such as cars or fridges, the European Union statistics office said on Monday.
Eurostat said industrial production in the 19-member single currency bloc in September decreased by 0.8 percent during the month, although was 1.2 percent higher year-on-year.
A Reuters poll of economists had forecast a steeper monthly fall of 1.0 percent, and a more moderate 1.0 percent increase from a year earlier.
The monthly drop in September follows an upwardly revised surge in industrial production in August of 1.8 percent. Eurostat also revised up its earlier estimates for the year-on-year output change in August to 2.2 percent.
Those compared with the originally reported figures of 1.6 and 1.8 percent respectively.
Euro zone output continued a seven-month pattern in which increases in one month are followed by declines the following month.
The monthly fall of production in September was mostly due to a 5.6 percent drop in the output of durable consumer goods, such as cars or fridges, which more than erased the 4.8 percent rise recorded in August.
In a sign of lower appetite for investment, production of capital goods, such as industrial machinery, went down by 2.2 percent on the month, after a steep increase of 4.2 percent in August.

Output decreased also for energy (-0.2 percent) and intermediate goods (-0.7 percent), while it increased by 0.3 percent for non-durable consumer goods, such as clothes.

TOKYO/NAGOYA, Japan (Reuters) - Japan's economic growth handily beat expectations in the July-September period, expanding for a third straight quarter as exports recovered, but weak domestic activity cast doubt on hopes for a sustainable economic recovery.
Government data issued on Monday underscored a potentially fragile export-reliant economic recovery just as Republican Donald Trump's shock victory in the U.S. presidential election added to uncertainty over the global economic outlook.
The world's third-largest economy expanded by an annualized 2.2 percent in the third quarter, faster than the 0.9 percent increase markets had expected, following a 0.7 percent increase in April-June, Cabinet Office data showed.
Bank of Japan Governor Haruhiko Kuroda maintained his optimistic view of the economy, saying it was on track for a moderate expansion as exports and output rebounded thanks to an expected improvement in the global economy.
But he acknowledged that private consumption was ""somewhat lacking momentum"" and making some companies hesitant to raise the prices of their goods and services - potentially delaying achievement of the central bank's 2 percent inflation target.
""Risks to both economic activity and prices are skewed to the downside,"" Kuroda told business leaders on Monday in the central Japan city of Nagoya, stressing his resolve to ease again if the economy loses the momentum to hit his price goal.
PATCHY RECOVERY
Monday's data highlighted the uneven nature of Japan's recovery.
External demand - or exports minus imports - added 0.5 percentage point to gross domestic product (GDP). It was the biggest contribution since April-June 2014, but was due in part to falling imports caused by yen gains and oil price falls.
Exports grew 2.0 percent, the fastest gain in a year, but the increase was driven by potentially one-off factors such as a boost in shipments of smartphone parts.
Private consumption, which accounts for roughly 60 percent of GDP, rose just 0.1 percent, as bad weather kept consumers from shopping. That added to concerns the benefits of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's ""Abenomics"" stimulus drive are yet to spread to households, as seen in tepid annual wage rises.
Capital expenditure, a key component of GDP, was flat following a 0.1 percent decline in the second quarter, likely reflecting worries about the global outlook.
""Exports recovered, but private consumption and capital expenditure are weak. The economy isn't as strong as the 2.2 percent (headline figure) makes it seem,"" said Hidenobu Tokuda, senior economist at Mizuho Research Institute.
""There are risks from China and Trump's trade policies. We need to continue to pay attention to downside risks.""
Kuroda said next year's wage negotiations between companies and labor unions were crucial to whether Japan would hit 2 percent inflation, calling on firms in Nagoya - home to auto giant Toyota Motor Corp (T:7203) - to help boost wages.
The BOJ governor said the bank was watching yen moves carefully as they have a ""big impact"" on the economy and prices.
""It's desirable for currencies to move stably reflecting economic and financial fundamentals,"" he said, noting this view was shared in other major economies.
The dollar sank as low as 101.19 yen last Wednesday as Trump's victory boosted investor appetite for the safe-haven yen, but the prospect of Trump's spending being inflationary has seen the dollar rebound to around four-month highs since then.

This recovery offered some respite to Japanese policymakers worried about the hit a stronger yen could inflict on the export-reliant economy.

LONDON (Reuters) - Fewer British employers expect to hire staff in late 2016 and will raise pay by less than inflation next year as the effects of the decision to leave the European Union set in, an industry body said on Monday.
The Chartered Institute of Personnel Development said more employers expected to hire staff than cut them in the fourth quarter of this year, but the net employment balance slowed to +22 in its latest survey from +27 in the previous quarter.
The CIPD also said wages in real terms were likely to fall next year because, for the second quarter running, employers expected to make basic pay settlements of just 1.1 percent while inflation is rising. 
""The report points to the UK economy beginning to face some likely headwinds following the UK's decision to leave the European Union,"" Gerwyn Davies, a labor market analyst at the CIPD, said. 
""Pay expectations are already weak, and as inflation moves up we can expect a period of low or negative real wage growth for the squeezed middle.""
Annual inflation rose to 1.0 percent in September and is expected to climb toward 3.0 percent by the end of next year, reflecting the fall in the value of the pound since the decision by voters in June to leave the European Union.
So far, Britain's labor market and the broader economy have largely weathered the initial shock of the referendum result.
In a latest sign of confidence among households, credit card Visa UK said its consumer spending index rose by 2.5 percent in October compared with the same month a year ago, the strongest rate of increase in six months.
But economists expect a slowdown next year when Britain is due to launch its formal divorce talks with the EU. Prime Minister Theresa May has suggested she will take a tough approach with the bloc, raising concerns about how much access the country's exporters will retain to the EU's single market.
A separate survey published on Monday by financial data firm Markit showed business sentiment edged down in October to its lowest level in over four years. 
The CIPD report showed employers were also concerned about their ability to recruit workers from the EU, with just 6 percent favoring a so-called hard Brexit resulting in a clamp-down on the free movement of labor from the bloc.
""For years, the UK has been one of the most attractive countries for EU workers, benefiting from easy access to a large, European talent pool,"" said John L. Marshall, chief executive of  Adecco  (SIX:ADEN) Group which co-produced the survey.
He said the Brexit decision was ""a wake-up call"" for employers to invest more in training.

Separately on Monday, property website Rightmove said the price of homes on sale in England and Wales fell by 1.1 percent in November, a smaller drop than usual for the time of year, adding to signs that the Brexit vote has not had a big impact on the housing market.

The preliminary publication of the data for November from the University of Michigan's Consumer Survey Center showed that consumer sentiment rose to 91.6 from 87.2 in the previous month. That was its highest reading since June 2016 and was slightly above this year's average of 91.1.
Analysts had forecast an increase to 87.5.
The current conditions indicator increased to 105.9 in November from the prior month’s reading of 103.2.
Analysts had expected it to advance to 103.4.
Meanwhile consumer expectations rose to 82.5 in November, from the prior reading of 76.8.
Economists had expected it to increase to 77.3.
Meanwhile, inflation expectations for the next 12 months and the five-year gauge both rose to 2.7%, from the prior 2.4%.
The increase in inflation expectations may add justification for next month's expected interest rate hike, although the University of Michigan noted that the survey had been taken before the result of the recent U.S. presidential elections.

BEIJING (Reuters) - Chinese banks extended 651.3 billion yuan ($95.56 billion) in net new yuan loans in October, below expectations and falling sharply from September, as policymakers pledged to prevent asset bubbles in the increasingly debt-fueled economy.
The People's Bank of China has been keeping policy accommodative to spur growth - as evident by record bank lending so far this year - but it faces an uphill battle to divert money from the red-hot property market into the weak real economy. 
""Credit growth slowed down as mortgage lending weakened, after the introduction of a series of real estate controlling polices,"" analysts at Haitong Securities said in a note.
""Corporate financing needs remain weak. There are risks that credit may continue to shrink in the future.""
Analysts polled by Reuters had expected new lending to have fallen back to 700 billion yuan from September's three-month high of 1.22 trillion yuan.
New bank loans totaled 10.8 trillion yuan in the first 10 months of the year - an all-time high, according to Reuters calculations based on central bank data.
Lending has been driven heavily by robust mortgage growth as the housing market booms, with banks increasing their exposure to the sector to offset a surge in non-performing loans in more sluggish parts of the economy.
New household loans, mostly mortgages, fell to 433.1 billion yuan in October from 637 billion yuan in September, central bank data showed, suggesting demand for mortgages is cooling after a spate of steps by local governments to restrict home purchases to cool soaring prices. 
The ratio of new household loans to total new loans rose to 66.5 percent from 52 percent in September, the data showed.
Highlighting underlying weakness in the broader economy, new medium- to long-term corporate loans fell sharply to 72.8 billion yuan from 446.6 billion yuan in September.
The central bank said this week that it will maintain ample liquidity in the economy while taking steps to prevent asset bubbles, adding that the balance between stabilizing growth and preventing bubbles has become more challenging. 
NO BASIS FOR TIGHTENING
China's total social financing (TSF), a broad measure of credit and liquidity in the economy, fell sharply to 896.3 billion yuan in October from 1.72 trillion yuan in September.
TSF includes off-balance sheet forms of financing that exist outside the conventional bank lending system, such as initial public offers, loans from trust companies and bond sales.
But broad M2 money supply (M2) grew 11.6 percent from a year earlier, the strongest in four months and slightly above forecasts of 11.4 percent.
""Liquidity in the interbank market has tightened some, but looking at M2 growth it is not that low, so I think overall policy is neutral. We can't say there's been tightening,"" said Ma Xiaoping, HSBC economist in Beijing.
""There is still not a basis for tightening, as the real economy is still weak. It is too early for tightening.""
China's economy expanded at a steady 6.7 percent in the third quarter and looks set to hit Beijing's full-year target, spurred by stronger government spending and the property frenzy that are adding to its growing pile of debt. 
China's overall debt has jumped to more than 250 percent of GDP from 150 percent at the end of 2006, the kind of surge that in other countries has resulted in a financial bust or sharp economic slowdown, analysts say.
M1 money supply, which includes cash and short-term deposits, rose 23.9 percent in October on-year versus September's 24.7 percent rise.
A widening gap between M1 and M2 growth has fueled concerns about a ""liquidity trap"" in the economy where companies remain wary of investing regardless of how much stimulus policymakers pump into the system.

The gap narrowed to 12.3 percentage points in October from 13.2 percentage points in September.

This gap in October 2015 was $137 billion, according to Treasury's monthly budget statement.
Analysts polled by Reuters had expected an $80 billion budget deficit for last month. When accounting for calendar adjustments, October would have shown an $84 billion deficit compared to an adjusted $88 billion deficit in the same month of 2015.
Since 2009, when President Barack Obama assumed the presidency in the aftermath of the financial crisis, the deficit has fallen by two thirds. 
President-elect Donald Trump has promised to cut taxes and increase spending on infrastructure and the military, which would raise the deficit, economists say.

Receipts last month totaled $222 billion, a 5 percent increase from October 2015, while outlays stood at $266 billion, down 24 percent from the same month a year ago.

1659,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 10, 2016 11:30PM ET</span>",Cuban trade surplus fell more than 40 percent in 2015,"By Marc Frank
HAVANA (Reuters) - Cash-short Cuba on Thursday said imports and exports fell a total of $4.2 billion in 2015 and the trade surplus fell $1.6 billion as low commodity prices and the crisis in Venezuela took their toll, shedding some light on recent austerity measures.
Cuba has restructured most of its foreign debt in recent years and has been meeting its payments, but suppliers and joint venture partners said it was having problems paying them on time.
The report by the National Statistics Office said exports of goods and services were $14.9 billion and imports $12.6 billion last year, compared with $17.8 billion and $13.9 billion respectively in 2014. (http://www.one.cu/aec2015/05%20Cuentas%20Nacionales.pdf)
Goods exports were down $1.5 billion and service exports $1.3 billion, despite an increase in tourism and telecommunications revenues included in the category along with receipts from the services of healthcare and other professional workers sent overseas.
President Raul Castro said in June that lower commodities prices were battering Cuban exports of nickel, refined oil products and sugar, while revenue from the sale of professional services to countries such as Venezuela and Angola had suffered.
Castro, speaking to the National Assembly, said oil shipments from Venezuela were also down. The government then announced imports would be slashed by $2.5 billion for the remainder of the year and that state-run companies’ allocations of fuel and electricity would be cut.
The Cuban economy was now expected to grow just 1 percent in 2016, compared with 4 percent the previous year, the government said.
Some Cuban economists believe there will be no growth.
""The situation grows worse by the day,"" one economist said, requesting anonymity due to a ban on speaking with journalists without authorization.
""The Venezuelan crisis is deepening and production of nickel, refined oil products and sugar are all down this year,"" he said.
The collapse of oil prices punishes Cuba under the terms of its oil deal with Venezuela. Cuba receives oil as part of an exchange that sends Cuban professionals to Venezuela. Some 30,000 doctors and nurses, plus another 10,000 professionals, are posted in Venezuela.
Economists and oil market experts believe the price of Cuban services is tied to oil prices, meaning Venezuela would pay less when prices are down.
Thursday’s report said trade of goods with the South American oil producer was $4.2 billion in 2015, down from $7.3 billion the previous year.
Cuba does not publish details of the export of professional services.

Initial claims for state unemployment benefits dropped 11,000 to a seasonally adjusted 254,000 for the week ended Nov. 5, the Labor Department said on Thursday. Claims for the prior week were unrevised.
It was the 88th consecutive week that claims remained below 300,000, a threshold associated with a healthy labor market. That is the longest stretch since 1970, the department said.
U.S. stocks pared gains slightly following the data, while the dollar rose modestly against the euro.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast first-time applications for jobless benefits falling to 260,000 in the latest week.
The Labor Department said there were no special factors impacting the week's data and that claims for only one state, Virginia, were estimated.
The four-week moving average of claims, which irons out volatility, rose 1,750 to 259,750 last week. The number of people still receiving benefits after an initial week of aid increased 18,000 to 2.04 million in the week ended Oct. 29.
The claims data follows last Friday's monthly employment report for October, which showed a healthy gain of 161,000 jobs.
With a strong jobs market, the Federal Reserve is still currently seen raising interest rates at its next meeting in December despite a shock victory for Republican Donald Trump in the U.S. presidential election on Tuesday.

Analysts had expected jobless claims to drop by 5,000 to 260,000 last week.

ROME (Reuters) - World food prices edged up in October to continue an upward trend since January, the United Nations food agency said on Thursday, adding that prospects for global cereal output had improved. 
Barring a slight dip in July, the Food and Agriculture Organization's (FAO) food price index has steadily increased from a seven-year low hit in the first month of this year. 
The index, which measures monthly changes for a basket of cereals, oilseeds, dairy products, meat and sugar, averaged 172.6 points in October, 0.7 percent above the month before and 9.1 percent above October last year. 
Sustained demand for cheese and butter in the European Union pushed up dairy prices 3.9 percent on the month, while sugar rose on reports of production shortfalls in Brazil and India. 
Conversely, sluggish import demand globally for palm oil pushed oil and fats prices down, and weaker appetite for European pigmeat from importers in China weighed on meat prices.
FAO senior economist Abdolreza Abbassian said high production prospects for basic foods such as cereals meant any future price rises would probably be muted.
But he added that currency volatility and uncertainty unleashed by the U.S. presidential election this week hampered predictions about changes in dollar terms.
""It's not an election in just any country, it's the very country whose currency is the common denominator for all international trade,"" Abbassian said.
""This is an additional uncertainty, but ... if you had assumed that business as usual were to continue I would have argued that, given the good prospects at hand, the potential for further price increases was probably limited."" 

Cereal prices rose 1.0 percent month-on-month in October as high-quality wheat supplies tightened, but the FAO forecast global wheat output this year would be 1.5 percent higher than in 2015.

1672,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 09, 2016 09:20PM ET</span>",Weak Japan machinery orders signals fragile capex may dent GDP,"By Minami Funakoshi
TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's core machinery orders fell more than expected in September and the outlook pointed to more weakness, suggesting the economy may underperform as businesses show reluctance to invest amid sluggish demand at home and abroad.
Core machinery orders, a highly volatile data series regarded as an indicator of capital spending six to nine months ahead, fell 3.3 percent in September from the previous month, Cabinet Office data showed on Thursday.
That was bigger than a 0.8 percent decline expected by a Reuters poll of economists, following a 2.2 percent drop in August. However, orders rose 7.3 percent in July-September.
The outlook was even more gloomier with companies surveyed by the Cabinet Office forecasting that core orders will fall 5.9 percent in October-December from the previous quarter.
That suggested capital expenditure may have a net negative impact on near-term gross domestic product growth in the world's third biggest economy.
""Those who look at this round's machinery orders results negatively might lower their outlook (for GDP growth) in the second half of the year,"" said Hidenobu Tokuda, senior economist at Mizuho Research Institute.
However, the machinery orders in the past quarters more or less even out and probably would not dampen GDP growth in the third quarter, Tokuda added.
Japan's economy likely expanded for a third straight quarter in July-September, though growth is set to remain fragile.
The Cabinet Office will announce the GDP data on Nov. 14 at 8:50 a.m.
The Japanese economy has failed to make much headway this year as weak demand at home and abroad has hobbled its recovery, forcing the Bank of Japan to once again push back the timing for hitting its 2 percent inflation target.
Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's government has been counting on capital expenditure to drive private sector-led growth, seen as crucial for putting the economy on a sustainable footing, but businesses have been slow to invest because of sluggish demand, yen's gains and external headwinds.
The government also cut its assessment, saying a slowdown in the pick up of machinery orders can be seen.
Still, some, like Takeshi Minami, chief economist at Norinchukin Research Institute, don't see a significant disruption to the recent upward trend in orders.
""The negative 5.9 percent outlook (for Oct-Dec) isn't as big a decline as the number makes it seem,"" said Minami, adding that a slowdown in machinery orders would be temporary.
Capital expenditure has recently shown some signs of picking up, though analysts have cautioned that stubbornly sluggish global demand could make business managers wary about approving heavy investments.
Indeed, despite reaping record profits thanks to a weak yen under Abe's aggressive stimulus policy, Japanese companies have been hesitant to boost investment in recent years.

BOJ policymakers disagreed on how much importance they should put on the central bank's commitment to maintain the pace of its government bond purchases, a summary of debate at their Oct. 31-Nov. 1 meeting showed, underscoring the difficulty of making a smooth shift to a new policy framework.

Monetary policy will continue to be accommodative and its current projections and assumptions will see growth strong enough to have inflation settle near the middle of the target range, the RBNZ said in a statement.
But it also said numerous uncertainties remain, particularly in respect to the international outlook, and policy may need to be adjusted if they weaken the outlook for the domestic economy.
An important risk was heightened political uncertainty - likely in reference to uncertainty related to the surprise victory by Donald Trump in the U.S. presidential elections - as was elevated market volatility.
The RBNZ appeared more confident in its inflation outlook - slightly raising inflation projections for December 2016 to 1.1% form 1.0% in the August policy statement. But it pushed back the projection for 2.0% inflation to December 2018 from September 2018 in the August statement.
""Annual inflation is expected to rise from the December quarter reflecting the policy stimulus to date, the strength of the domestic economy and reduced drag from tradables inflation,"" the RBNZ said.

Consumer prices also beat expectations, accelerating to a six-month high, though analysts say the room for further rises is limited.
""We think producer price inflation will recover further in coming quarters but will top out at a little over 4 percent y/y before dropping back again,"" Capital Economics economist Julian Evans-Pritchard said in a note.
""The scope for further rises in consumer price inflation is likely be more limited given that credit growth has begun to slow, house prices are starting to cool and farmers have responded to high pork prices by boosting pig supply.""
With producer prices pulling out of nearly five years of deflation and the economy showing broad signs of stabilization, pressure on Beijing to support growth has eased, with the policy focus now on controlling asset bubbles and other risks.
Factory prices rose 1.2 percent on-year, the fastest pace since December 2011, after turning marginally positive in September for the first time in nearly five years, the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) said on Wednesday.
The reading handily beat forecasts for a 0.8 percent rise, with the increase led by higher prices for companies involved in the production and processing of raw materials.
On a month-on-month basis, producer prices rose 0.7 percent.
Coal prices in China are in the midst of a months long rally, with prices hitting fresh records on an almost daily basis in recent weeks after government-enforced closures tightened supplies for utilities, triggering a scramble for raw materials ahead of the winter.
Stronger factory prices have helped boost industrial profits, relieving some pressure on companies squeezed by higher costs and weak demand, though there are concerns some of the gains are due to speculation and are not sustainable.
Improved cash flows should also give companies more room to service heavy debt loads, a key concern for the government.
Corporate China sits on $18 trillion in debt, equivalent to about 169 percent of gross domestic product (GDP), according to the most recent figures from the Bank for International Settlements. Most of it is held by state-owned companies.
CONSUMER PRICES PICK UP
China's consumer prices also rose in October, increasing at the fastest pace since April as food prices picked up.
The consumer price index (CPI) rose 2.1 percent in October from a year earlier, compared with a 1.9 percent increase in September.
Analysts had expected a 2.1 percent gain.
A jump in food prices fueled faster consumer inflation. Food prices rose 3.7 percent, compared with a 3.2 percent gain in the previous month.
Non-food prices inched up 1.7 percent versus September's 1.6 percent gain.
On a monthly basis, consumer prices fell 0.1 percent. Prices for health care rose 4.8 percent, the fastest-rising CPI sub-category.
China's producer price index is expected to continue to increase year-on-year in the coming months, statistics bureau spokesman Sheng Laiyun said in late October.
""I believe PPI in the coming months will continue to show positive growth year-on-year, but it could be volatile month-on-month,"" Sheng told a group of foreign reporters.
Factory activity increased at the fastest pace in over two years in October, China's official purchasing manager survey showed last week.
The rebound in pricing power may be reaching its limits, however, as prices of some materials surge to multi-year highs and a property boom shows signs of peaking.
China's main commodity exchanges have even launched a series of fee hikes and margin increases for some of their most volatile, niche contracts from coke to glass as authorities cracked down on speculation that is fuelling a surge in prices.
Data from industry consultancy Custeel.com suggested steel mills have been cutting output and even starting maintenance work earlier than usual as soaring costs for raw materials such as iron ore and coking coal squeeze profits.
Data on Tuesday showed China's imports of iron ore, crude oil, coal and copper all fell in October.
China's economy expanded at a steady 6.7 percent in the third quarter and looks set to hit Beijing's full-year target, fueled by stronger government spending, record bank lending and a red-hot property market that are adding to its growing pile of debt.

In a report, the U.S. Labor Department said that the number of job openings, excluding the farming industry, increased to 5.486 million in September from 5.453 million a month earlier, which was revised from the original reading of 5.443 million.
Analysts had expected the number of job openings to rise to 5.508 million.
The report has garnered more attention, as Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen often cites the survey when assessing the state of the labor market.

1688,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 08, 2016 07:30AM ET</span>",UK industrial output falls but consumers keep spending,"By Andy Bruce and William Schomberg
LONDON (Reuters) - British industrial output unexpectedly fell in September but there were fresh signs that consumers have kept up their spending despite rising inflation pressures and uncertainty around the country's exit from the European Union.
British industry dragged on otherwise robust economic growth in the third quarter, official data showed on Tuesday,
By contrast, two separate private sector surveys pointed to a surge in consumer spending in October.
Taken together, the surveys painted a familiar picture of the British economy, with growth led by household spending while industry and investment lag.
Industrial output fell 0.4 percent month-on-month in September, repeating its weak performance of August, the Office for National Statistics said. Economists polled by Reuters had expected it to stagnate.
The fall was due to warm weather, which hit power output, and maintenance shutdowns in North Sea oil and gas fields.
Factory output grew 0.6 percent, the biggest rise since a surge in April, but shrank by 0.9 percent in the third quarter as a whole.
""While the September number is good news, we hesitate to get too excited by one good month, particularly as costs start to rise and uncertainty remains in place,"" HSBC economist Elizabeth Martins said.
Prices paid by factories for materials and energy have rocketed in recent months and there were some signs in Tuesday's surveys that this was starting to feed through to consumers.
Barclaycard, the credit card division of  Barclays  (L:BARC), said spending on its cards rose 5.5 percent year-on-year last month, the biggest jump since the survey started in 2011. 
Some of the rise reflected higher motor fuel prices since the pound's drop after the Brexit vote. Barclaycard said 81 percent of Britons were worried about inflation, citing a YouGov poll it commissioned.
""Rising prices were .. a contributing factor – notably on petrol forecourts and for consumers traveling abroad,"" said Paul Lockstone, Barclaycard's managing director.
SHRINKING CHOCOLATE BARS
Britons with a sweet tooth have been hit by rising inflation too. Manufacturer Mondelez International has upset some of them by reducing the size of its popular Toblerone chocolate bars in the UK because of the rising cost of ingredients.
The British Retail Consortium, representing the retail industry, said spending in shops jumped 2.4 percent compared with a year ago, the strongest annual growth since January and up from growth of 1.3 percent in September.
Britain's economy has coped well so far with the shock of the Brexit vote, underlined by a survey of recruitment companies on Tuesday that showed hiring of permanent staff grew at the fastest pace in eight months during October.
But most of the growth has been driven by the dominant services sector. Industrial output declined 0.5 percent in the third quarter - a slightly bigger fall than the ONS predicted in its preliminary estimate of economic growth.

Manufacturing has yet to show a big boost from the fall in sterling since the Brexit vote. The ONS said there were no obvious signs so far that the weak pound or uncertainty had affected UK factory output.

1689,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 08, 2016 07:27AM ET</span>",German industrial output drops but economy primed for fourth quarter rebound,"By Michael Nienaber
BERLIN (Reuters) - German industrial production fell at its fastest rate in more than two years in September as growth shifted into a lower gear during an uncertain summer for manufacturers, though the economy looked primed for a fourth-quarter rebound.
Monthly output dropped a bigger-than-expected 1.8 percent and, as factories flatlined, rose just 0.3 percent in the third quarter overall, Economy Ministry figures showed on Tuesday.
Traditionally the main growth driver of Europe's biggest economy, manufacturing has taken more of a back seat in the past two years as domestic demand has picked up and German firms have faced increased competition from emerging economies.
A fraught political backdrop was added to the mix in the third quarter, when domestic and foreign demand fell for the equipment and other capital goods businesses buy when they make new investments, the data showed.
""The uncertain outcome of the U.S. elections, the unclear Brexit process and artificial growth drivers such as low interest rates are reasons enough for insecurity in the private sector,"" Anton Boerner, the head of Germany's BGA trade association, said of Tuesday's numbers.
Helped by a consumer boom and higher state spending - driven by a rising tax take from steadily falling unemployment and partly in response to a huge influx of migrants in the past 18 months - Germany's economy grew 0.7 percent in the first quarter and 0.4 percent in the second.
Unicredit (MI:CRDI) economist Andreas Rees said the industrial output figures, along with other data, pointed to a slowdown in quarterly GDP growth to 0.3 percent in the third, for which preliminary data is due next Tuesday.
JUST A BLIP?
The September industrial output drop, the biggest since August 2014, was in part a reflection of the previous month's strong rebound of 3.0 percent.
It also masked a strong performance in certain sectors, notably construction, in which the economy ministry said high order levels pointed to ""a certain revival"" in manufacturing in coming months.
Supporting that prediction, the ZDB construction association on Tuesday raised its sales forecast for 2016, citing a real estate building boom and higher state infrastructure spending.
More growth in consumer spending also looked likely as the HDE retail association said it expected sales over the Christmas period to rise 3.9 percent to top 90 billion euros ($99.5 billion) for the first time.
Suggesting initial concerns about the impact of June's Brexit vote may have been overdone, morale among German company executives hit its highest level in 2-1/2 years in October, according to the Ifo business climate index published two weeks ago.
Also supporting expectations of a solid fourth quarter for the economy, Friday's purchasing managers survey from Markit showed the private sector expanded at its second-fastest monthly rate this year in October.
""The (economic) outlook is better than today's figures,"" concluded Nordea economist Holger Sandte.
A rebound in the final quarter would keep the economy on course to meet the government's forecast of 1.8 percent growth in 2016, which would be the strongest in five years.
But Bankhaus Lampe's Krueger added a note of caution.
""Compared to the high levels seen in some sentiment indicators, the support for overall economic growth is still limited,"" he said.
Trade data on Tuesday from the Federal Statistics Office was also relatively downbeat, showing adjusted exports fell by 0.7 percent and imports by 0.5 percent in September.
That narrowed the trade surplus to 21.3 billion euros ($23.6 billion), below the Reuters consensus forecast of 23.0 billion euros and also less than August's revised 21.6 billion.
""There now is a question mark behind our forecast for export growth of 2.0 percent this year,"" DIHK trade analyst Volker Treier said.

1690,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 08, 2016 06:46AM ET</span>","China October exports, imports fall more than expected","By Elias Glenn and Kevin Yao
BEIJING (Reuters) - China's exports and imports fell more than expected in October, with weak domestic and global demand adding to doubts that a pick-up in economic activity in the world's largest trading nation can be sustained.
October exports fell 7.3 percent from a year earlier, while imports shrank 1.4 percent, official data showed on Tuesday, raising fears that a broader recovery seen in recent months could falter.
While recent data had suggested the world's second-largest economy was steadying, analysts have warned that a property boom which has generated a significant share of the growth may be peaking, dampening demand for building materials from cement to steel.
Indeed, China's imports of iron ore, crude oil, coal and copper all fell in October, after its robust demand drove global prices of many major commodities higher this year. 
Though some analysts argued the decline may be seasonal, data from industry consultancy Custeel.com suggested steel mills have been cutting output and even starting maintenance work earlier than usual as soaring costs for raw materials such as iron ore and coal squeeze profits. 
Analysts polled by Reuters had expected October exports to have fallen 6 percent from a year earlier, compared to a 10 percent contraction in September. Imports had been expected to drop 1 percent, after falling 1.9 percent in September.
""Our conclusion is that external demand remains sluggish but it has not worsened significantly. Although both exports and imports have fallen short of expectations, they have improved on a year-on-year basis,"" economists at ANZ said in a note, noting the rate of decline in October had moderated from September.
Still, China's exports in the first 10 months of the year fell 7.7 percent from the same period a year earlier, while imports dropped 7.5 percent. 
Exports have dragged on economic growth this year as global demand remains stubbornly sluggish, forcing policymakers to rely on higher government spending and record bank lending to boost activity. Weak exports knocked 7.8 percent off the country's GDP growth in the first three quarters of this year.
Imports fell for the second month in a row in October after rising for the first time in nearly two years in August.
That left the country with a trade surplus of $49.06 billion for the month, versus forecasts of $51.70 billion, and September's $41.99 billion. 
In yuan-denominated terms, the trade numbers weren't as bad, indicating that the currency's slide to six-year lows has provided some support for exporters. Yuan-denominated shipments have only fallen 2.0 percent this year, with imports down 1.8 percent. 
""Yuan depreciation should be positive for exports, but it only provides some support for exporters when they convert dollar income into yuan, but cannot reverse the trend,"" said Merchants Securities economist Liu Yaxin in Shenzhen.
COMMODITY IMPORTS SLOWING
China's October iron ore imports were the lowest since February, while imports of copper, a key material used in building construction, fell to a 21-month low.
Coal imports fell nearly 12 percent from September despite worries that power companies have low inventories heading into winter. 
""The ongoing cyclical rebound in China's economy should support imports for another quarter or two but is unlikely to last much longer given that the boost to growth from earlier policy easing is set to fade before long,"" Capital Economics' China economist Julian Evans-Pritchard said in a note. 
Exports to the United States fell 5.6 percent in October, compared to an 8.1 percent decline in September, while shipments to the EU fell 8.7 percent, a slight improvement from the previous month. 
China's imports from Southeast Asia rose 18.4 percent in October, while those from Australia increased 16.3 percent, both significant improvements from recent months. 
The commerce ministry said last week that China will face relatively large downward pressure on foreign trade in the fourth quarter, with uncertainties continuing into 2017.
To be sure, China factory surveys for October showed activity at two-year highs, and trends for other major Asian exporters point to positive trends in the region. 
China's economy expanded at a steady 6.7 percent in the third quarter and looks set to hit Beijing's full-year target, fueled by stronger government spending and a red-hot property market that are adding to its growing pile of debt.

The British Retail Consortium, representing the retail industry, said spending in shops jumped 2.4 percent compared with a year ago, the strongest annual growth since January and up from growth of 1.3 percent in September.
A separate survey from Barclaycard, the credit card division of  Barclays  (L:BARC), showed spending on its cards increased 5.5 percent year-on-year - marking the biggest jump since the survey started in 2011.
While adding to evidence that British consumers have so far not been put off from shopping by June's vote to leave the European Union, the sharp increase in spending also served as a warning of higher inflation to come.
""Rising prices were .. a contributing factor – notably on petrol forecourts and for consumers traveling abroad,"" said Paul Lockstone, Barclaycard's managing director.
Retail spending was further boosted by sales of jewelry and watches, driven by tourists taking advantage of the weak pound, the BRC survey showed.
Rising fuel prices pushed spending on petrol up 6.6 percent, the biggest increase in more than two years, while Britons were also forced to pay more for their hotel stays abroad because of the pound's plunge since the Brexit vote, Barclaycard said.
Its gauge of consumer sentiment, compiled by pollster YouGov, showed 81 percent of Britons were worried by the prospect of rising prices.
A Reuters poll of economists last month suggested inflation will peak around 2.5 percent next year, but some forecasters such as the National Institute of Economic and Social Research reckon it could hit around 4 percent.
Just a third of consumers said they were confident in the economy, down from nearly half in September, Barclaycard said.
""As we approach Christmas, an expensive time in many households, many consumers are telling us they plan to rein in their spending to ensure they are able to make ends meet,"" Lockstone said.
Last week the Bank of England said it expected household consumption to slow markedly next year, forecasting a rise of 1.25 percent compared with 2.75 percent this year.
