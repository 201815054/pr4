Of that, private overseas investors bought $91.9 billion in Treasuries and foreign official institutions sold $16.2 billion.
Foreigners have bought Treasuries in 10 of the last 12 months, including a record net monthly purchase of $118 billion in March 2021.
Overall, Treasury International Capital (TIC) data showed a net inflow of $162.6 billion, versus a $287.4 billion inflow in January. Of this, net foreign private inflows were $198.4 billion, and net foreign official flows were negative $35.8 billion.
The overall foreign buying came as U.S. yields rose. U.S. benchmark 10-year Treasury yields peaked at 2.0650% in February, reaching the highest level since July 2019, and ended the month at 1.8216%, up about 4 basis points from the end of January.
The yield on the two-year note rose to 1.4363% in February from 1.1846% at the end of January, reaching a peak of 1.6430% that was last seen in December 2019, as markets anticipated that the Federal Reserve would imminently start hiking interest rates to slow price rises and stave off hotter inflation. 
The Fed did raise its policy rate in March by 0.25 basis points, the first hike since 2018, and announced how it would reduce its $8.5 trillion balance sheet, ballooned by pandemic-era bond purchases. Several more rate hikes are expected this year and next.
Foreign holdings of Treasury securities rose to $7.714 trillion from $7.661 trillion in January. 

Japan's holdings of Treasury securities rose by more than $3 billion to $1.306 trillion. Japan remained the largest non-U.S. holder of Treasuries.
China, the second-largest holder of Treasuries, saw its holdings decline to $1.054 trillion from $1.060 trillion in January.

1,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 15, 2022 04:30PM ET</span>",Autos rebound fuels U.S. manufacturing output gain in March,"(Reuters) - A sharp rebound in automotive output in March spurred a third straight monthly gain in U.S. factory activity, perhaps signaling the worst of the production woes that have dogged the motor vehicle industry over the last year may have passed. 
Overall industrial production increased 0.9% last month, keeping pace with February's upwardly revised pace, the Federal Reserve said on Friday. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast factory production accelerating 0.4%. Output jumped 5.5% from a year earlier.
Manufacturing, which accounts for 11.9% of the American economy, has benefited from a shift in spending to goods from services during the COVID-19 pandemic. But manufacturers have struggled to cope with the strong demand while labor markets have become extraordinarily tight and supply bottlenecks have persisted due to COVID lockdowns in China and the war in Ukraine.
Especially hard hit by supply issues has been the automotive sector, where production has been hampered for more than a year by a global shortage of electronic components, especially the computer chips needed for today's increasingly complex vehicle operating systems. 
Graphic: U.S. auto production rebounded in March - https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-ECONOMY/akpezjdyjvr/chart.png 
But U.S. motor vehicle and parts production shot up by 7.8% last month, the largest increase since October, after a downwardly revised drop of 4.6% in February. Total assemblies of cars and light trucks rose to nearly 9.5 million vehicles at a seasonally adjusted annual rate, the highest since January 2021, up from 8.3 million the month before.
""The auto industry is making a comeback,"" Bill Adams, chief economist for Comerica (NYSE:CMA) Bank, said in a note. ""Production plunged in 2021 as the chip shortage idled factories. Now that is reversing as carmakers work through the challenge and find ways to stretch their chip supplies.""
The production recovery should further fuel a pickup in auto sales that have been held back by the supply shortages, Adams said. Even as consumer spending shifts back toward services in the months ahead as COVID caseloads ease, ""vehicle sales have brighter prospects this year than other categories of durable consumer goods.""
""Since sales last year were held back so much by the chip shortage, vehicle sales are constrained much more by supply than demand, and so will grow solidly in 2022 and 2023 despite higher (interest) rates on car loans and less support from fiscal stimulus,"" he said.
Overall industrial sector capacity utilization, a measure of how fully companies are using their resources, rose to 78.3% last month, the highest in more than three years, from 77.7% the month before. It is 1.2 percentage points below its 1972-2021 average.
Capacity use for the manufacturing sector increased to 78.7% in March, the highest level since 2007, from 78.1% in February. 
Officials at the Fed tend to look at capacity use measures for signals of how much ""slack"" remains in the economy — how far growth has room to run before it becomes inflationary.
A separate report from the New York Federal Reserve on Friday showed manufacturing activity in New York state has accelerated in April, even as inflationary pressures kept building.

Its Empire State Manufacturing Index rose to a four-month high of 24.6 after a reading of negative 11.8 in March. The survey's prices paid index shot to a record high of 86.4 from 73.8 last month.
Optimism in the outlook waned, however, with the six-month outlook index dropping to 15.2, the lowest in about two years, from 36.6 in March.

2,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 15, 2022 12:35AM ET</span>",China March new home prices stall again as COVID damps sentiment,"BEIJING (Reuters) -Growth in new home prices in China was flat again in March versus the previous month, government data showed on Friday, pointing to fragile demand as growing COVID-19 lockdown measures dampened consumer confidence.
Average new home prices in 70 major cities were unchanged on a month-on-month basis for the second time in a row, according to Reuters calculations based on March data from the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS).
On a year-on-year basis, new home prices rose 1.5%, the slowest pace since November 2015, and easing from a 2.0% gain in February.
Over 60 cities have eased curbs on home purchases to support the ailing property market, after a government campaign to reduce developers' high debt levels pushed the sector into a deep chill in the second half of 2021.
Banks in over 100 Chinese cities have lowered mortgage rates by around 20 to 60 basis points since March，central bank official Zou Lan said on Thursday.
But after signs of improvement in January, a surge in cases of the highly transmissible Omicron variant and strict virus lockdown measures have again cooled demand in many cities.
In tier-one cities, prices gained 0.4% on month, narrowing from a 0.5% rise in February, while growth in tier-two cities was zero.
""The growth slowdown in first-tier cities in March was mainly due to the impact of the COVID pandemic, indicating weaker market expectations,"" said analyst Xu Xiaole at Beike Research Institute.
More cities are likely to relax property curbs in the near future, and demand will be gradually released, said Xu.
The property market in the commercial hub of Shanghai slowed with home prices rising at the slowest pace in four months, at 0.3% month-on-month.
Shanghai is in the midst of China's worst outbreak since the virus emerged in Wuhan in late 2019, reporting more than 20,000 cases daily amid an unprecedented citywide lockdown. Dozens more cities are in partial or full lockdown.
Price growth in Shanghai does not reflect the overall market situation, said analyst Lu Wenxi at property agency Centaline.
""The growth in new home prices in Shanghai will further ease in April,"" Lu added.
In March, transactions by value of newly built homes in Shanghai slumped 27% from a month earlier to 36.2 billion yuan ($5.68 billion)，financial magazine Yicai said.
China's State Council, or cabinet, on Wednesday said more policy measures are needed to support the economy, but analysts are unsure if interest rate cuts would quickly reverse the slump as long as the government maintains its zero tolerance COVID-19 policy.

In the first 12 days of April, new home sales by volume in 30 cities surveyed by Wind were down 55.6% year-on-year, analysts at Nomura said in a client note on Wednesday.

3,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 14, 2022 02:00PM ET</span>",Higher gasoline prices flatter U.S. retail sales; consumers remain resilient,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. retail sales increased solidly in March, boosted by record- high gasoline prices, but consumers are starting to feel the pinch of high inflation, with online spending posting back-to-back declines for the first time in more than a year.
The report from the Commerce Department on Thursday, which also showed stronger retail sales growth in February than initially thought, suggested consumer spending picked up in the first quarter, helping to underpin the overall economy. 
A tightening labor market, which is driving up wages, and massive savings accumulated during the pandemic are providing some cushion against inflation. Annual inflation surged by the most in more than 40 years in March, though there are signs price pressures have peaked and should start to gradually abate.
""The report still reveals the resilience of consumer spending,"" said Tim Quinlan, a senior economist at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) in Charlotte, North Carolina. ""There is no doubt households are feeling the pinch from skyrocketing prices across an array of products. But there are signs that pandemic-related inflation is beginning to ease."" 
Retail sales rose 0.5% last month. Data for February was revised higher to show sales increasing 0.8% instead of 0.3% as previously reported. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast retail sales climbing 0.6%, with estimates ranging from as low as a 0.3% decline to as high as 2.2% jump. 
Retail sales, which are mostly goods, advanced 6.9% on a year-on-year basis. They are not adjusted for inflation. 
GRAPHIC: Retail sales https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-STOCKS/xmvjoqzlkpr/retailsales.png 
Sales at service stations shot up 8.9%, accounting for the bulk of the increase in sales in March. Monthly consumer prices increased by the most in 16-1/2 years in March as Russia's war against Ukraine boosted the cost of U.S. gasoline to record highs. Prices at the pump on average soared to an all-time high of $4.33 per gallon in March, according to AAA.
Excluding gasoline, retail sales fell 0.3%. 
Though gasoline prices have since retreated to an average of $4.074 per gallon, high inflation is likely to prevail. A separate report from the Labor Department on Thursday showed import prices jumped 2.6% last month, the largest rise since April 2011, after increasing 1.6% in February.
Stocks on Wall Street were lower. The dollar rose against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices fell. 
GRAPHIC: Inflation https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-STOCKS/dwpkrqoagvm/inflation.png 
STRONG LABOR MARKET 
Soaring prices are reducing consumers' purchasing power, but rising wages are helping to blunt some of the hit. The unemployment rate is at a two-year low of 3.6% and there were a near-record 11.3 million job openings at the end of February, making it easier for some cash-strapped Americans to take a second job or pick up extra shifts.
Consumers also accumulated more than $2 trillion in excess savings during the COVID-19 pandemic. 
A separate report from the Labor Department on Thursday showed initial claims for state unemployment benefits increased 18,000 to a still-low seasonally adjusted 185,000 for the week ended April 9. Economists had forecast 171,000 applications for the latest week. 
Declining gasoline prices and the firming labor market led to consumer sentiment rebounding from a decade low in early April. 
GRAPHIC: Consumer sentiment https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-STOCKS/egvbkbzyrpq/UMich.png 
Better job security is also allowing some consumers to take on more debt. Last month, clothing store sales rose 2.6%. There were also increases in receipts at building material, garden equipment and supplies stores as well as at furniture, food and electronics and appliance retailers. 
Sales at sporting goods, hobby, musical instrument and book stores rose 3.3%. Receipts at bars and restaurants, the only services category in the retail sales report, rose 1.0%. Demand for services like air travel and hotel accommodation is surging, providing further support for consumer spending. This follows the rolling back of pandemic restrictions. 
But sales at auto dealerships fell 1.9% amid ongoing motor vehicle shortages. Online store sales tumbled 6.4% after falling 3.5% in February, the first back-to-back decline since the last two months of 2020, which some economists attributed to strained household budgets because of the gasoline price shock. Others blamed shifting seasonal patterns.
Online retail sales have declined from a peak of $100.0 billion in January to $90.350 billion in March. There are worries that rising interest rates as the Federal Reserve tries to stamp out inflation could cool demand in the months ahead.
""If previous environments are any indication, the latter half of 2022 could see a slowdown in consumer demand as the Fed tries to contain elevated price levels,"" said Peter Essele, head of portfolio management at Commonwealth Financial Network.
Excluding automobiles, gasoline, building materials and food services, retail sales dipped 0.1% in March. Data for February was revised higher to show these so-called core retail sales declining 0.9% instead of 1.2% as previously reported.

Core retail sales correspond most closely with the consumer spending component of gross domestic product. February's upward revision and March's modest fall prompted some economists to lift their first-quarter consumer spending and GDP growth estimates. Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) hiked its GDP growth estimate to a 1.5% rate from a 1.0% pace. The economy grew at a robust 6.9% rate in the fourth quarter.
""Today's report continues to reflect strong consumer demand in the first quarter, but we see headwinds from the oil price shock combined with tighter monetary policy lowering real consumer spending growth later this year and next,"" said Ellen Zentner, chief U.S. economist at  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) in New York.

4,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 14, 2022 11:41AM ET</span>",U.S. companies load up on costly inventories as new supply snarls loom in China,"By Timothy Aeppel
(Reuters) - Through most of the pandemic, Kent International, Inc couldn’t import enough Chinese-made bicycles to supply Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc and its other big U.S. retail customers.
But in recent months, the New Jersey-based wholesaler and manufacturer built a nice buffer -- about a 10-week supply at its three warehouses in California, South Carolina and New Jersey, compared to the pre-COVID normal of four to six weeks of stock. And the company is glad to have it, now that a new wave of shutdowns in China to combat rising COVID cases is roiling global supply chains.
""The supply chain for bicycles has caught up,"" said Arnold Kamler, the CEO.
Many U.S. companies are in the same position. Inventory levels have gone up in recent months as U.S. port congestion eased and supply chains have begun to untangle.
Wholesale inventories surged 19.9% in February on a year-on-year basis, according to figures released by the Commerce Department on Thursday. They were up 2.5% from January.
Most economists predict inventories could continue the upswing, since inflation-adjusted inventories remain below their pre-pandemic level. Inventory-to-sales ratios are also low.
The challenge now is the latest shutdown in China, which is clogging highways and ports and stranding workers inside factories or shutting down production. These disruptions are sending a new ripple through global supply chains for goods ranging from electric cars to iPhones.
Don DiCostanzo, chief executive of Pedego Electric Bikes, said he started adding to inventories a year ago and opened a second warehouse in February near his office in California to hold the overflow.
""We've stocked it to the gills,"" he said. ""But we have challenges with incoming inventory because Shanghai has been shut down for a month."" That might mean shortages as the company moves into its busy summer season. It also means Pedego will have to delay the launch of a new product planned for June, because those bikes won’t make it on time.
'A MORE NORMAL CYCLE'
Some companies have built up inventories with an eye on grabbing market share from competitors who didn’t move as fast to refill shelves.
Automatic Pool (NASDAQ:POOL) Covers, Inc in Indiana, for instance, is now sitting on three times as much inventory as it held just before the pandemic. 
Michael Shebek, the company's CEO, said he was able to do that by sharply expanding the number of suppliers he used to get materials and parts. He said the demand for new pools appears to be easing, though it remains elevated. During the pandemic, businesses that sold items needed to make life more comfortable for those homebound by quarantines surged.
For now, Shebek said having extra inventory has given him ""a competitive advantage over those who don’t have it.""
Kamler, the CEO of Kent, said last year he was ""scrambling for bicycles like they were gold - but now, we’re in a more normal cycle.""
The Chinese factory that supplies most of his bicycles in Kunshan, near Shanghai, has now shut down. Whether that eventually causes another round of shortages for him depends on how long the halt lasts, he said, noting that with the fatter inventories he now holds, it shouldn’t be a problem unless it goes on longer than a month.
To be sure, there’s a dark side to holding all those goods. ""The cash issue is the one nobody talks about,"" said Kamler.
He estimates that he’s now paying U.S. Customs $4 million to $5 million a month in duties on his imported bikes. He also has a factory in South Carolina that makes bikes, but it relies heavily on Chinese parts that also carry tariffs. When he ships goods to retailers, he recovers this cost. But carrying inventories for longer periods means carrying that added cost longer.

The higher cost of ocean freight -- which shot up during the pandemic and remains elevated -- also remains a burden.
Before the pandemic, Kamler said he paid $2,000 to ship a container from China to one of his U.S. warehouses. His shipper just notified him that on May 1, that rate will go from $5,000 a container to $9,000.

5,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 14, 2022 11:05AM ET</span>","U.S. consumer mood brightens in early April, survey shows","(Reuters) - U.S. consumer sentiment rebounded unexpectedly in early April from a decade low with the strong job market lifting the outlook for wage growth and a fall in gasoline prices from the previous month's record high helping to cap expectations for a further acceleration in inflation, a survey showed on Thursday.
The University of Michigan's Consumer Sentiment Index rose to 65.7 on a preliminary basis this month from a final reading of 59.4 in March, which had been the lowest since 2011. That topped expectations for a reading of 59, according to a Reuters poll of economists, and helped snap a skid of three consecutive monthly declines.
The increase came almost entirely from a jump in the expectations index to 64.1 on a preliminary basis from a March final level of 54.3. Assessments of current conditions were little changed.
Consumers' estimates for the rate of inflation over the next year were unchanged at 5.4%, which is the highest since 1981 and signals that consumers have some faith that measured inflation will recede from a four-decade high of 8.5% hit in March. And, for a third straight month, they estimated inflation over the next five years at 3.0%.
The U.S. Federal Reserve last month lifted interest rates for the first time since 2018 and officials there have signaled an aggressive campaign of rate hikes in the months ahead to rein in inflation. 
The improvement in expectations was powered by a 29.4% jump in the economic outlook for the year ahead and a 17.2% increase in personal financial expectations, survey Director Richard Curtin said in a statement. 
""A strong labor market bolstered wage expectations among consumers under age 45 to 5.3% - the largest expected gain in more than three decades, since April 1990,"" Curtin said.

He also said consumers estimated a negligible change in gas prices in the year ahead after the previous month's prediction that they would rise by nearly 50 cents a gallon a year out.
Gas prices have dropped by more than 25 cents a gallon after hitting a record $4.33 in early March, according to AAA.

Business inventories rose 1.5% after climbing 1.3% in January, the Commerce Department said. Inventories are a key component of gross domestic product. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast inventories rising 1.3%. 
Inventories jumped 12.4% on a year-on-year basis in February. Retail inventories increased 1.2% in February, instead of 1.1% as estimated in an advance report published last month. That followed a 2.0% rise in January.
Motor vehicle inventories rose 0.9% as estimated last month. They increased 2.7% in January. Retail inventories excluding autos, which go into the calculation of GDP, climbed 1.4%, rather than 1.2% as estimated last month.
Inventory investment surged at a robust seasonally adjusted annualized rate of $193.2 billion in the fourth quarter, contributing 5.32 percentage points to the quarter's 6.9% growth pace. Most economists see further scope for inventories to rise, noting that inflation-adjusted inventories remain below their pre-pandemic level. Sales-to-inventory ratios are also low.
Businesses are restocking after drawing down inventories from the first quarter of 2021 through the third quarter. Growth estimates for the first quarter are around a 1.0% rate.

Wholesale inventories increased 2.5% in February. Stocks at manufacturers gained 0.6%.
Business sales rose 1.0% in February after rebounding 4.1% in January. At February's sales pace, it would take 1.26 months for businesses to clear shelves, down from 1.25 months in January.

In the 12 months through March, prices raced 12.5%, the largest gain since September 2011, after advancing 11.3% in February. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast import prices, which exclude tariffs, increasing 2.3%.
The Russia-Ukraine war has driven up prices of oil and other commodities, like wheat and sunflower oil.

8,By Investing.com,"<span>Apr 14, 2022 08:53AM ET</span>",U.S. Retail Sales Moderated in March Amid Squeeze from High Gas Prices,"By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing.com -- U.S. retail sales growth slowed in March, as record-high gasoline prices and rising prices for food and shelter forced consumers to cut back on other spending. 
Retail sales grew only 0.5%, from an upwardly revised 0.8% gain in February. That was marginally below analysts' forecasts for a 0.6% increase. Core sales, which exclude automobile purchases, held up somewhat better, at 1.1%. As a result, retail sales were up 6.9% on the year. 
The government's data aren't adjusted for inflation. Consumer prices have risen 8.5% in the last 12 months, so the retail sales number reflects a drop in spending in real terms, consistent with other figures that show many U.S. consumers have now run down the excess savings that they accumulated during the pandemic.
Widespread lockdowns and generous subsidies to households this time last year had created a boom in retail sales that has been slowly subsiding since the economy began to reopen and government stimulus checks came to an end. 
However, the U.S. economy still appears to be in broadly good shape, according to comments from the CEOs of JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) and  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) over the last 36 hours. 
That continues to be reflected in data from the labor market, where initial jobless claims ticked up only marginally to 185,000 from last week's 60-year low of 167,000.
New York Federal Reserve President John Williams said to Bloomberg on Thursday that the Fed needs to ""remove the froth"" from the labor market by using monetary policy to bring the level of vacancies - currently near all-time highs at over 11 million - down to a level ""commensurate with maximum employment"".

""We sell it at the same price as before. Also with the impact of the pandemic, everybody is hanging in there. It is the same all over Beijing, we are not the only restaurant suffering,"" Ma said.
Asian restaurants and street food hawkers like Ma's face the tough choice of taking the hit from higher costs or passing them on and risk losing loyal customers.
Spiralling prices for ingredients and material that started with supply chain snags during the COVID-19 pandemic and are now being propped up by the war in Ukraine are squeezing businesses and consumers.
Households in Asia, where tasty and affordable street food is an integral part of society and the economy, are feeling the pressure the most. 
Mohammad Ilyas, a cook at a biryani store in Karachi, Pakistan, said the price of a kilogram of the seasoned rice dish, enough to feed three to four people, has doubled to 400 Pakistani rupees ($2.20). 
""I have been working at this kitchen for the last 15 years,"" he said. ""These days prices of rice and spices have gone up so much that poor people can't afford to eat it.""
Some businesses are dealing with the cost pressures by cutting portion sizes. 
At one of Jakarta’s street food corners, nasi goreng vendor Syahrul Zainullah has reduced his servings of the signature Indonesian fried rice dish rather than raise prices or use lower grade ingredients.
In South Korea, where consumer inflation is at a decade-high, Choi Sun-hwa, a 67-year-old kimchi shop owner, only gets seven heads of cabbage for the price she used to pay for 10.
The spicy fermented cabbage is traditionally served as a free side dish with other meals at Korean eateries, but even that has become an extravagance.
Seo Jae-eun, a customer at Choi's store, quips kimchi should now be called ""keum-chi"", keum being Korean for gold.
""I can't ask restaurants to give more kimchi these days and it's too expensive to make my own at home due to high-priced vegetables...so I came here to buy it,"" she said.
Choi says she won't be able to continue if she can't raise prices.
The price pressures are changing the eating habits of some Asian consumers.
Steven Chang, a 24-year-old service sector worker, is a regular at Just Noodles, a popular ramen store in Taipei but is reconsidering his spending.

""I live away from my parents, so I rely on restaurant food a bit more,"" Chang said. ""So, I will try to limit eating out and cook at home more.""

10,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 13, 2022 11:05PM ET</span>","U.S. consumers, low-income households included, still spending, BofA research says","(Reuters) - U.S. consumer credit and debit card spending so far in 2022 is up 15% on a year earlier, Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) research showed on Wednesday, a sign that Americans' gloom about the economy owing to high inflation has yet to translate into lower demand.
In fact, lower-income households - often described as the most vulnerable to an inflation-induced shock - are spending the most relative to their prepandemic outlays, the bank's researchers found.
To be sure, Bank of America Institute researchers said some of that group's spending will reflect high inflation, with March's consumer price index registering an 8.5% year-over-year increase, the highest in over 40 years. Also, such households typically spend a higher share of their budgets on food, gas and utilities, which contributed most heavily to the CPI increase.
""But the level of card spending in this group is still way above pre-pandemic levels: the very latest Bank of America debit and credit card spending per household data shows card spending up 33.3% among the below $50K group in three years to the week of 9th April,"" they wrote.
Card spending this year through April 8 was 15% higher than in the same period last year.
Surveys such as the University of Michigan's widely followed Consumer Sentiment Index have painted a picture of U.S. consumers who are the most distressed about the economy in more than a decade, often a signal that they may rein in spending.
""But people don't always actually do what they say they are doing – sentiment is not the same as action,"" the bank wrote.
""The actual hard data does not support the gloom.""
Data from the Census Bureau due out on Thursday in fact is expected to show U.S. retail sales rose 0.6% in March from the month before, a Reuters poll of economists shows, which would mark an acceleration from February's increase of 0.3%.
Monthly growth in retail sales averaged 1.4% over the 12 months through February, more than three times the rate that prevailed in the year before the pandemic.
Bank of America researchers attributed the ongoing strength in large part to the U.S. job market. The unemployment rate is 3.6% - roughly where it was before the pandemic - there are nearly two open jobs for every unemployed person and hourly wages are rising at their fastest in years, at an annual rate of 5.6%. 
""(B)eneath this already rosy picture, the story is even better at the lower end of the wage distribution,"" they said. Wages in the lowest-paying industries such as leisure and hospitality are up 11.8% year over year.
Another factor continuing to prop up spending, especially among low-income households, is the cash remaining at their disposal. Bank accounts are still well stocked from higher wages and residual funds from repeated rounds of federal stimulus during the pandemic.

Households with incomes below $50,000 a year have at least $1,500 more in the bank than they did at the start of 2019, a figure that represents 5% of that income group's household spending that year.
""It is hard to reconcile high bank balances and high card spending with the idea that lower income households are being overwhelmed by higher prices,"" the researchers wrote.

SYDNEY (Reuters) -Australia's unemployment rate held at a 13-year low in March as jobs growth slowed after months of strong gains, though record-high vacancies suggest it is only a matter of time before unemployment falls further.
Figures from the Australian Bureau of Statistics on Thursday showed a jobless rate of 4.0%, when analysts had looked for a drop to 3.9% and the lowest reading since 1974.
That will be a disappointment to Prime Minister Scott Morrison who was hoping a sub-4 number would bolster his economic credentials amid a close election campaign.
It might also ease pressure on the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) to lift interest rates next month, though markets are still wagering the first hike in a decade will come in June.
There is no doubt the labour market remains very tight with employment rising by another 17,900 in March, and a stellar 338,000 in the past 12 months.
Underemployment hit the lowest since 2008 and participation rates held near record highs at 66.4%. Demand for labour is also red hot with vacancies at an all-time peak of 423,500, 86% higher than their pre-pandemic levels.
The RBA has already dropped a pledge to be patient on policy amid signs the tightening labour market was finally pushing wages higher, and adding to inflationary pressure.
More businesses are planning to pass on rising input and labour costs to customers, a major change from recent years when fierce competition kept prices restrained.
The consumer price index - due out on April 27 - is expected to surge well above 4%, while core inflation should top the RBA's 2-3% target band for the first time in a decade.
All of which has led financial markets to fully price in a rate hike to 0.25% in June, and some risk the RBA could go all the way to 0.50% in one go.
Central banks in New Zealand and Canada both hiked by half a point this week and the U.S. Federal Reserve is considered almost certain to do the same in May.
""The increasing ability of firms to pass on higher costs is something the RBA has been looking out for,"" said Nomura economist Andrew Ticehurst.

""So the task of withdrawing accommodation appears more urgent than ever,"" he added. ""The risk appears to be for more rate hikes, rather than less."" 
He is tipping rises in June, July, August, November and December.

12,By Bloomberg,"<span>Apr 13, 2022 10:00PM ET</span>",Australia Adds Fewer Jobs Than Expected as Unemployment Steady,"(Bloomberg) -- Australia’s economy added fewer jobs than forecast in March, while unemployment held at a 13-1/2 year low, as the labor market’s powerful recovery in recent months hit an air pocket.
Employment rose by 17,900 from a month earlier, led by full-time roles, while coming in below economists’ expectation of a 30,000 gain, Australian Bureau of Statistics data showed on Thursday. Unemployment held at 4%, versus a forecast fall to 3.9%, while labor market participation remained steady.
“We have continued to see strong increases in youth employment over the past year,” said Bjorn Jarvis, head of labor statistics at the ABS. “The youth employment-to-population ratio in March was the highest it had been since August 2008.”
The Australian dollar fell and was trading at 74.53 U.S. cents at 11:39 a.m. in Sydney. Three-year government bond yields edged down.
The result may disappoint Prime Minister Scott Morrison, who has sought to burnish his government’s economic credentials as he bids for a come-from-behind win at Australia’s May 21 ballot. Yet beyond the monthly results, the labor market has been on a steady path to improvement and the economy is growing strongly.

The Bank of New Zealand-Business NZ's seasonally adjusted Performance of Manufacturing Index (PMI) rose to 53.8 from 53.6 the previous month.
A reading above 50 indicates an expansion in activity, while anything below that threshold indicates a contraction.
However, the survey notes that negative comments outweighed positive comments in March by a factor of two to one with businesses frustrated with supply side troubles and worried about cost inflation.

15,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 13, 2022 12:25PM ET</span>",Inflation in Russia hits highest in more than 20 years,"(Reuters) - Annual inflation in Russia accelerated to 17.49% as of April 8, its highest since February 2002 and up from 16.70% a week earlier, the economy ministry said on Wednesday, as the volatile rouble sent prices soaring amid unprecedented Western sanctions.
Prices on nearly everything from vegetables and sugar to clothes and smartphones have risen sharply in recent weeks after Russia on Feb. 24 began what it calls ""a special military operation"" in Ukraine.
The central bank warned on Wednesday that consumer inflation in Russia will keep on accelerating in annual terms due to base effects, saying that rouble volatility will lead to upside inflationary pressure.
Weekly inflation in Russia slowed to 0.66% in the week to April 8 from 0.99% a week earlier, taking the year-to-date increase in consumer prices to 10.83%, data from statistics service Rosstat showed on Wednesday.
In the same period a year ago, consumer prices rose 2.72%.
In March, consumer prices in Russia jumped 7.61%, their biggest month-on-month increase since January 1999, as the economy took a hit from sanctions and a record fall in the rouble, which has pared its losses since then.

The central bank, which aims for annual inflation of 4%, cut its key rate to 17% from 20% on Friday and said future cuts were possible.
Inflation in Russia could reach between 17% and 20% this year, Alexei Kudrin, the head of Russia's audit chamber, said on Wednesday. Analysts polled by Reuters in late March had on average forecast 2022 inflation to accelerate to 23.7%, its highest since 1999.

16,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 13, 2022 11:51AM ET</span>",Broad increase in U.S. producer prices underscores tough inflation battle for Fed,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. monthly producer prices increased by the most in more than 12 years in March amid strong demand for goods and services, the latest sign of persistently high inflation that could compel the Federal Reserve to aggressively tighten monetary policy. 
The report from the Labor Department on Wednesday also showed strong underlying inflation pressures at the factory gate, raising doubts that a decline in the cost of goods, excluding food and energy, in March reported in Tuesday's consumer prices data would be sustainable. Economists expect the U.S. central bank will hike rates by 50 basis points next month, and soon start trimming its asset portfolio. 
""The broad-based increases reinforce yesterday's CPI report that will keep the Fed on its aggressive tightening path in the coming months,"" said Will Compernolle, a senior economist at FHN Financial in New York. ""Supply chain easing, especially on the goods side of production, will be an important source of disinflation for the Fed to successfully achieve its goal of price stability.""
The producer price index for final demand increased 1.4%, the largest gain since the government revamped the series in December 2009, after rising 0.9% in February. 
Goods prices increased 2.3%, matching February's advance. A 5.7% rise in energy prices accounted for more than half of the increase in the PPI last month. There were increases in gasoline and electricity, but natural gas prices fell. Energy prices jumped 7.5% in February.
Food prices climbed 2.4%, though the cost of beef and veal fell 7.3%. Wholesale prices of iron and steel scrap also rose, but the cost of cold rolled steel sheet and strip declined.
Inflation was initially fanned by a massive cash infusion from the government to cushion against the devastating impact of the coronavirus pandemic, which unleashed strong demand for goods and strained supply chains. Supply bottlenecks had started to ease, but progress was stalled by the Russia-Ukraine war. Renewed lockdowns in China to contain rising COVID-19 cases are also seen disrupting supply chains.
Services inflation is also building up amid the rolling back of pandemic restrictions on businesses. Wholesale services prices jumped 0.9% in March after climbing 0.3% in February. A 1.2% rise in margins for final demand trade services, which measure changes in margins received by wholesalers and retailers, accounted for more than 40% of the rise in services.
Stocks on Wall Street were higher. The dollar was steady against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury yields fell.
PEAK OR PLATEAU?
The Fed in March raised its policy interest rate by 25 basis points, the first hike in more than three years. Minutes of the policy meeting published last Wednesday appeared to set the stage for big rate increases down the road. 
The cost of transportation and warehousing services also increased strongly last month. There were also gains in prices of hotel and motel accommodation, airline fares, inpatient care as well as hardware, building materials and supplies retailing.
But the cost of securities brokerage, dealing and investment advice fell 5.4%. Portfolio management fees also decreased. 
In the 12 months through March, the PPI jumped 11.2%, the largest year-on-year increase since the current series was introduced in November 2010, after advancing 10.3% in February.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the PPI rising 1.1% and accelerating 10.6% year-on-year. Excluding the volatile food, energy and trade services components, producer prices accelerated 0.9% in March. The so-called core PPI increased 0.2% in February. In the 12 months through March, the core PPI soared 7.0% after rising 6.7% in February. 
The government reported on Tuesday that monthly consumer prices increased by the most in 16-1/2 years in March. But core goods prices dropped by the most in two years, restraining monthly underlying consumer inflation in March. That offered cautious hope that inflation, which by all measures has far exceeded the Fed 2% target, has peaked.
Following last month's strong core PPI readings, some economists said it was too soon talk about a sustained moderation in the monthly pace of core inflation. Based on the CPI and PPI data, economists are estimating that the core personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index rose by about 0.3% in March after climbing 0.4% in February.

The core PCE price index is one of the inflation measures watched by Fed officials. It is forecast increasing by 5.3% year-on-year in March after accelerating 5.4% in February, which was the biggest rise since 1983.
""We would caution however that the 'peak' in core inflation could appear to be more of a 'plateau' over the coming months,"" said Veronica Clark, an economist at  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) in New York. ""While core PCE might not climb any higher on a year-on-year basis, we would not expect the Fed would be particularly comfortable with stable 5% inflation.""

17,By Investing.com,"<span>Apr 13, 2022 08:41AM ET</span>","U.S. Producer Prices Leaped Again in March, Well Above Expectations","By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing.com -- U.S. producer prices surged again in March racing past expectations with their biggest monthly gain in 10 years. 
The producer price index rose by 1.4%, compared to expectations for 1.1%. That took the annual rate of inflation for goods leaving U.S. factories to a record high of 11.2%. February's data were also revised up to show an increase of 0.9%, from an initially reported 0.8%.
The data suggests that U.S. producers are still finding it relatively easy to pass on increases in costs for labor and raw materials, rather than accept any compression to their profit margins. Moreover, price increases weren't confined to volatile elements such as food and energy. Even stripped of these, the 'core PPI' index rose 1.0% on the month for the second time in three months, while the annual rate rose to 9.2% from 8.7%.
As such, they raise the pressure on the Federal Reserve to accelerate its planned tightening of monetary policy.
""With a new wave of lockdowns in China and the war in Ukraine raging on...risks to the inflation outlook remain firmly to the upside, reaffirming our view that the Fed must proceed with a faster pace of policy normalization in the months ahead,"" said Oxford Economics' Mahir Rasheed in a note to clients, adding that he expected the ""severe imbalance between robust demand and handicapped supply"" to persist throughout the second quarter. Price pressures will only start to abate ""in the latter part of 2022,"" he added. 
The numbers came on the same day as JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) CEO Jamie Dimon warned of ""significant geopolitical and economic challenges ahead due to high inflation, supply chain issues and the war in Ukraine,” although he added that he remained optimistic for the U.S. economy in the short term. JPMorgan's quarterly results showed its lending to corporates rose only 2% on the year in the three months through March, but Dimon noted that the bank is seeing a pick-up in both new loan demand and in the use of revolving credit facilities.

18,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 13, 2022 05:55AM ET</span>",China's imports unexpectedly fall as COVID curbs convulse trade outlook,"BEIJING (Reuters) -China's imports unexpectedly fell in March as COVID-19 curbs across large parts of the country hampered freight arrivals and weakened domestic demand, while export growth slowed, prompting analysts to expect a worsening in trade in the second quarter.
The softer trade figures are likely to reinforce expectations of more policy support from the government, with an adviser on Wednesday calling for cuts in banks' reserve requirements and interest rates to boost a flagging economy.
Inbound shipments fell 0.1% in March from a year earlier, marking the first decline since August 2020, customs data showed on Wednesday. That compared with a 15.5% gain in the first two months of the year and an 8% increase forecast by analysts in a Reuters poll.
The decline was broad-based. China's imports of crude oil tumbled 14% in March and gas import volumes were the lowest since October 2020. Purchases of copper fell 8.8%, as COVID outbreaks hurt manufacturing and industrial demand for some raw materials remained soft.
Exports - a major driver of the economy - rose 14.7% in March, beating analyst expectations for a 13% rise, although slowing from a 16.3% gain in January-February. 
""Due to the severe disruptions in factory operations, road transport and port congestion as a result of the worst COVID-19 wave and the most severe lockdowns since spring 2020, we expect export growth in dollar terms to slump to 0.0% year-on-year in April, while import growth is likely to drop further to minus 3.0%,"" Nomura said in a note.
Many analysts expect trade conditions to worsen in April, on slower customs clearance and as the impact from a lockdown in Shanghai is felt.
China's efforts to curb its largest COVID-19 outbreaks in two years have restricted activity in several cities including Shanghai and forced companies from Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) supplier Foxconn to automakers Toyota and Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) to suspend some operations.
That likely reduced demand for imported raw materials for Chinese factories, according to Zheng Houcheng, director of the Yingda Securities Research Institute.
""The pressure on the global economy is likely to drive down commodity prices over the medium-term, which would hit China's exports, in both volume and value, in the second half,"" said Zheng.
China's strong trade performance seen over the past two years is set to slow this year as other countries emerge from COVID lockdowns and higher energy prices and global logistics disruptions caused by Russia's war in Ukraine squeeze exporters.
Factory activity in March fell as the declines in export orders accelerated, recent manufacturing surveys showed, with firms reporting clients cancelled or suspended orders due to the uncertainty over the Ukraine war.
Qi Yong, general manager at a consumer electronics distributor Shenzhen Muchen Technology Co, told Reuters that orders from European clients fell 20% in March from a year ago, although outbound shipments for North America remained brisk. 

Qi said this was due to ""the war-induced weak purchasing power and risks of economic slowdowns in European economies"", adding that ""exporters with exposure to the bloc may continue to feel the pinch"".
China posted a trade surplus of $47.38 billion in March, more than double the forecast $22.4 billion, thanks to the unexpected decline in imports. It reported a $115.95 billion surplus in January-February.

19,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 13, 2022 05:11AM ET</span>",German economic institutes see sharp recession if Russian gas cut off,"BERLIN (Reuters) -Germany would face a sharp recession if gas supplies from Russia are suddenly cut off, the country's leading economic institutes said on Wednesday, and the government said the war in Ukraine poses ""substantial risks"" for Europe's largest economy.
A sudden stop in Russian energy supplies - an adverse scenario and not the institutes' baseline expectation - would slow economic growth to 1.9% this year and result in a contraction of 2.2% in 2023, they said.
The chairmen of three German parliamentarian committees called on Tuesday for the European Union to impose an embargo on Russian oil as soon as possible. But a survey published on Wednesday showed most Germans baulk at that idea.
""If gas supplies were to be cut off, the German economy would undergo a sharp recession,"" said Stefan Kooths, vice president and research director business cycles and growth at the Kiel Institute for the World Economy.
The cumulative loss of gross domestic product (GDP) in 2022 and 2023 in the event of a such supply freeze would likely be around 220 billion euros ($238 billion), or more than 6.5% of annual economic output, the five institutes said.
In its monthly report, Germany's Economy Ministry said the war in Ukraine ""poses substantial risks"" for the economy, but it was hard to quantify effects: ""They depend heavily on the duration and intensity of the war,"" it said.
The economic institutes - the RWI in Essen, the DIW in Berlin, the Ifo in Munich, the IfW in Kiel and Halle's IWH - confirmed revised forecasts reported by Reuters on Tuesday, cutting their baseline 2022 growth projection for the economy to 2.7% from 4.8% and forecasting 2023 growth of 3.1%.
The Economy Ministry said that in coming months the inflation rate driven by energy prices and the uncertainty caused by the Russian intervention in Ukraine are likely to weigh on private consumption.

Trade flows and supply chainss have been affected by the war, it said, adding: ""Uncertainty about future economic developments remains correspondingly high.""

20,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 13, 2022 03:55AM ET</span>","UK inflation hits 30-year high of 7%, adding to pressure on government","By David Milliken and William Schomberg
LONDON (Reuters) -British consumer price inflation leapt to its highest level in three decades last month, intensifying the pressure on embattled Prime Minister Boris Johnson and his finance minister Rishi Sunak to ease the cost-of-living squeeze.
The annual inflation rate climbed to 7.0% in March from 6.2% in February, its highest since March 1992 and by more than expected by most economists in a Reuters poll, official data showed on Wednesday. 
The month-on-month rise was the highest for the time of year since the Office for National Statistics' records began in 1988.
Broad-based price rises, ranging from vehicle fuel to food and furniture, were behind the increase.
Households are facing the biggest cost-of-living squeeze since records began in the 1950s, according to Britain's budget forecasters, and the inflation overshoot is further bad news for the government too.
Johnson and Sunak were fined by police on Tuesday for attending a June 2020 birthday party for Johnson at his Downing Street office at a time of COVID-19 restrictions, leading to calls from political opponents for them to resign.
Sunak - previously seen as a leading candidate to succeed Johnson as prime minister - has seen his popularity slide after a budget statement in March, which the public judged did too little to ease cost-of-living pressures, and recent revelations of his wife's tax avoidance.
""I know this is a worrying time for many families which is why we are taking action to ease the burdens by providing support worth around 22 billion pounds ($29 billion) in this financial year,"" Sunak said after the data.
Jack Leslie, senior economist at the Resolution Foundation think tank, said Sunak would come under pressure to do more.
""The sheer scale of this inflation-led squeeze on living standards makes it all the more remarkable how little support the Chancellor provided in his Spring Statement - a decision that will surely have to be revisited before the Autumn Budget,"" Leslie said.
British inflation has seen an unprecedented rise over the past year, following a similar pattern to most other advanced economies as energy prices surged and pandemic supply-chain difficulties persisted.
Russia's invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24 has pushed energy prices even higher, and last month Britain's Office for Budget Responsibility forecast inflation would peak at a 40-year high of 8.7% in the final quarter of 2022.
RISING RATES
Financial markets are all but certain the Bank of England will raise interest rates to 1% from 0.75% on May 5 before taking them to 2%-2.25% by the end of 2022, though many economists expect it to be less aggressive.
The BoE forecasts economic growth will slow sharply over the course of this year as cost of living pressures mount.
Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist with Pantheon Macroeconomics, forecast inflation will hit 8.8% in April after household utility bills rocketed but then fall below the BoE's 2% target in the second half of next year. 
""The MPC (Monetary Policy Committee), therefore, still has good grounds for arguing that a further substantial tightening of monetary policy would do little to restrain inflation in the near term but would run the unnecessary risk of pushing it substantially below the 2% target next year,"" Tombs said.
Wednesday's data showed that core CPI, which excludes food, energy, alcohol and tobacco prices, rose to 5.7% in March from 5.2% in February.
Retail price inflation -- an older measure which the ONS says is inaccurate, but which is widely used in commercial contracts and to set interest payments on inflation-linked government bonds -- rose to 9.0%, its highest since 1991.
There were signs of further inflation pressure ahead as manufacturers increased their prices by 11.9% over the 12 months to March, the biggest jump since September 2008.

Manufacturers' raw material costs leapt by 19.2%, the biggest increase in records began in 1997.

Investing.com -- The worldwide surge in energy and food prices struck again on Wednesday, driving U.K. inflation to its highest in over 30 years in March and adding to a growing cost-of-living crisis in the country.
Prices at both the consumer and producer level both surged by more than expected for the sixth month in a row, pushing the annual rate of consumer inflation to 7.0% and leaving factory gate inflation at 11.9%. In month-on-month terms, consumer prices rose 1.1% and producer prices rose 2.0%.  
As in many countries, prices are rising considerably faster than wages. Data released on Tuesday showed that average earnings including bonuses rose 5.4% in the year through February.
The numbers are likely to get even worse in April, as a big jump in regulated household energy prices comes into effect.  The timing of that is particularly awkward for the U.K. government, which also implemented an increase in national insurance contributions from April 1. A subsequent cut in income tax the Chancellor of the Exchequer Rishi Sunak may cushion that blow a little, however. 
The figures come a day after inflation in the U.S. hit a 40-year high of 8.5%, due largely to gasoline, food and housing prices, and on the same day that the Reserve Bank of New Zealand became the first major advanced economy central bank since the start of the pandemic to raise its key rate by 50 basis points. 
As such, the Bank of England is likely to come under fresh pressure to act more aggressively to bring inflation down. After its latest interest rate hike, the Bank had signaled that it expected the economy to cool by itself later in the year, making the prospect of continued increases in rates less likely. The pound was nonetheless little changed at $1.2995 by 2:45 AM ET (0645 GMT), however.  There was more movement in U.K. government bonds, where the yields on the 2-Year and 10-Year Gilts rose by 4 and 7 basis points respectively to 1.57% and 1.87%.
Simon French, chief economist with Panmure Gordon, said via Twitter that he saw ""nothing in today's UK CPI release for March to change our view that CPI will peak this year at around 10%.""
He highlighted ""signs of a broadening of inflationary pressures amongst core items and a big leap in input costs.""
French said he thought the most likely path for the BoE at its May meeting is still a 25 basis point hike and the announcement of a path for unwinding its purchases of U.K. government bonds. However, he said that global developments make a 50 basis point hike ""no longer a long shot."""

Investing.com – Chinese exports continued their growth trajectory in the first quarter of 2022, but the war in Ukraine and the latest COVID-19 outbreak in the country could mean that this growth will slow down soon.
Meanwhile, imports fell as the recent record numbers of COVID-19 cases and the ensuing lockdowns in the country weakened domestic consumption.
Exports grew 14.7% year-on-year in March 2022, beating forecasts by Investing.com that predicted a 13% growth. A growth of 16.3% was reported during the previous month. Imports contracted 0.1% year-on-year, in contrast to Investing.com forecasts that predicted growth of 8% and well below the previous month’s 15.5% figure.
China’s strong trade performance over the past two years is set for a slowdown in 2022, as other countries loosen COVID-19 restrictive measures. Soaring energy prices and global supply snarls caused by the war in Ukraine continue to impact exporters.
Qi Yong, general manager at a consumer electronics distributor Shenzhen Muchen Technology Co., told Reuters that although export orders from the company’s European clients dropped 20% in March from a year ago, exports to North America remained brisk.
This was due to ""the war-induced weak purchasing power and risks of economic slowdowns in European economies,"" and ""exporters with exposure to the EU may continue to feel the pinch,” said Qi.
Meanwhile, the trade balance stood at $47.38 billion, which exceeded Investing.com's predictions of $22.4 billion but was smaller than the combined $115.95 billion figure for January and February.
“Generally speaking, China’s foreign trade got off to a smooth start in the first quarter of this year, laying a good foundation for achieving the target for the whole year,” according to General Administration of Customs spokesman Li Kuiwen.
“But at the same time, we should also see that there are some unexpected, sudden factors in the current international and domestic environments, the external environment of foreign trade is becoming more severe, development faces many risks and challenges, and coupled with the high base last year, greater efforts should be made to achieve the goal of foreign trade for 2022.”"

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's core machinery orders posted their biggest monthly fall in nearly two years in February, official data showed on Wednesday, dragged down by a steep drop in demand from IT and other service firms to extend their decline into a second month.
The data added to concerns that Japanese firms are holding off on investments due to rising energy and raw materials costs, fuelling fears about the pace of economic growth as the world's third-largest economy tries to recover to pre-pandemic levels.
""Companies are worried about surging costs due to raw material price inflation that could damage profits. The risk of capital expenditure slowdown ahead is huge,"" said Kota Suzuki, economist at Daiwa Securities.
Core machinery orders, a highly volatile leading indicator of capital spending in the coming six to nine months, fell 9.8% in February from the previous month, the Cabinet Office data showed on Wednesday, the biggest drop since April 2020.
It was far larger than a fall of 1.5% forecast by economists in a Reuters poll and January's 2.0% decrease, and prompted the government to downgrade its assessment of machinery orders, saying a recovery was stalling.
Core orders from non-manufacturers excluding ships and electrical utilities fell 14.4% in February, led by a 36.9% fall in orders from information technology service firms, the biggest drop since January 2006. 
""The information service sector has been aggressive in buying computers for IT systems and data centre facilities since last October, and the movement appears to have stalled,"" a government official told a media briefing.
""It was a surprising, mixed result that highlighted weakness across non-manufacturers,"" said Yasunari Ueno, chief market economist at Mizuho Securities, who also noted weak demand from the transport and financial sectors.
Orders from manufacturers fell 1.8%, hurt by soft demand from chemicals and other material industries. Orders from electric machinery firms grew 13.8% as they ramped up investments in semiconductor-making equipment.
On a year-on-year basis, core orders rose 4.3% in February, the data showed, much weaker than a 14.5% rise expected by economists.
""In March and beyond, companies could turn more cautious and reduce machinery orders on the Ukraine crisis-caused slowdown in the global economy and commodity rally,"" said Koya Miyamae, senior economist at SMBC Nikko Securities.
Rattled by supply disruptions and soaring production costs, Japanese business confidence worsened in the first quarter for the first time in nearly two years, a Bank of Japan survey showed this month.
Managers of major Japanese firms expected the near-term recovery outlook to stay modest at best, on uncertainties such as the Ukraine crisis and its impact on commodity inflation, a Reuters poll showed on Wednesday. 

Economists have cut projections for Japan's growth, in view of the heightening inflationary pressures on households and businesses.
""The rebound in April-June consumption may not be as strong as expected on rising energy and food prices,"" said Takeshi Minami, chief economist at Norinchukin Research Institute. ""Companies, too, could limit spending.""

The Westpac-Melbourne Institute index of consumer sentiment released on Wednesday dipped 0.9% in April from March, when it slid 4.2%. The index was down 19.6% from April last year at 95.8, and almost back to where it was pre-pandemic.
The survey suggested the government's Budget in March had a limited impact on the national mood, even though it contained pre-election tax breaks and cuts to fuel excise.
Widespread flooding across the east coast also had some effect on sentiment.
""There is further evidence that interest rates, inflation and weather continued to unnerve consumers in the current survey,"" said Westpac chief economist Bill Evans.
He noted sentiment among people with a home loan fell a steep 9.2% in April amid speculation the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) could raise interest rates as early as June.
Some 70.0% of respondents expected a rise in rates in the next 12 months, the highest level since August 2016 when the question was first included in the survey.
That, coupled with high prices for petrol, housing and food, saw the survey's measure of family finances compared with a year ago drop 4.8%, while the outlook for finances over the next 12 months fell 0.9%.

Likewise, the survey's measure of whether it was a good time to buy a major household item sank 5.3%, and is down 20% on a year ago.
There was some improvement in the survey's measure of the economic outlook for the next 12 months which bounced 5.8% after a sharp fall in March, while the outlook for the next five years edged up 1.0%.

25,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 12, 2022 02:50PM ET</span>",U.S. consumer prices surge on gasoline; inflation likely peaked,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. monthly consumer prices increased by the most in 16-1/2 years in March as Russia's war against Ukraine boosted the cost of gasoline to record highs, cementing the case for a 50 basis points interest rate hike from the Federal Reserve next month.
The acceleration in prices reported by the Labor Department on Tuesday culminated in annual inflation rising at its fastest pace since the end of 1981. But there is cautious hope that the worst of the post-pandemic inflation surge is behind.
Monthly underlying inflation pressures moderated as goods prices, excluding food and energy, dropped by the most in two years. Further declines in the so-called core goods prices are likely as demand shifts back to services amid the rolling back of COVID-19 restrictions on businesses.
""The Fed will take a tiny bit of comfort from today's report, but it still has much work to do to restore price stability,"" said Sal Guatieri, a senior economist at BMO Capital Markets in Toronto. 
The consumer price index jumped 1.2% last month, the biggest monthly gain since September 2005. The CPI advanced 0.8% in February. An 18.3% surge in gasoline prices, the largest since June 2009, accounted for more than half the increase in the CPI. 
Gasoline prices at the pump on average soared to an all-time high of $4.33 per gallon in March, according to AAA. Inflation was already a headache before Moscow's invasion of Ukraine, which unleashed a barrage of sanctions, including the banning of Russian oil imports by the United States.
Americans are not the only ones reeling from high inflation, which was initially fueled by huge amounts of money doled out by governments across the globe to cushion against the devastating impact of the coronavirus pandemic. 
The Russia-Ukraine war, now in its second month, has led to a global surge in food prices as the two nations also are major exporters of commodities like wheat and sunflower oil.
""If not for (Russian President Vladimir) Putin's imperialist ambitions, inflation would still have accelerated this month, though not nearly as much,"" said Chris Low, chief economist at FHN Financial in New York. 
Inflation increased broadly last month, with food prices rising 1.0%. The cost of food consumed at home climbed 1.5% as all grocery categories posted big gains. Groceries increased 10% on a year-on-year basis, the most in 41 years. But the cost of dining out grew less, with prices of food consumed away from home rising 0.3%, the smallest gain in a year.
In the 12 months through March, the CPI accelerated 8.5%, the largest year-on-year gain since December 1981, after a 7.9% jump in February. It was the sixth straight month of annual CPI readings north of 6%. Last month's increase in inflation was in line with economists' expectations.
Stocks on Wall Street were higher. The dollar was steady against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury yields fell. 
MONTHLY CORE CPI SLOWS 
The strong CPI readings followed on the heels of news last month that the unemployment rate fell to a new two-year low of 3.6% in March.
The U.S. central bank in March raised its policy interest rate by 25 basis points, the first hike in more than three years. Minutes of the policy meeting published last Wednesday appeared to set the stage for big rate increases down the road. The Fed is expected to soon begin trimming its asset portfolio. 
High inflation and the Fed's hawkish posture have left the bond market fearing a U.S. recession, though most economists expect the expansion will continue.
Many believe March could mark the peak in the annual CPI rate, but caution that inflation would remain well above the Fed's 2% target at least through 2023. Gasoline prices have retreated from record highs and last year's high inflation readings will also start falling from the CPI calculation.
There is also a sense that consumers, confronted with declining purchasing power, are becoming more price conscious, which could make it harder for businesses to pass on higher price. Inflation-adjusted weekly earnings fell 1.1% in March.
A second straight monthly decline in prices of used cars and trucks restrained the core CPI to a 0.3% rise after increasing 0.5% in February. Core goods fell 0.4%, the biggest drop since April 2020. That blunted part of a 0.5% gain in shelter costs, which accounted for nearly two-thirds of the rise in core CPI.
While a key measure of rents, owners' equivalent rent of primary residence, advanced, the pace slowed a bit to 0.43% from 0.45% in February. The core CPI rose 6.5% in the 12 months through March, the largest gain since August 1982, after advancing 6.4% in February.
Though demand for goods is cooling, increased appetite for services will keep inflation simmering. Further disruptions to supply chains from the Russia-Ukraine war and lockdowns in China to contain a resurgence in COVID-19 infections are also seen keeping prices for some goods elevated. Workers, squeezed by inflation, are demanding large wage increases.

Prices for hotel and motel accommodation increased strongly last month. Airline fares soared 10.7%. Household furnishings also cost more and did motor vehicle insurance, apparel, recreation and personal care. The cost of healthcare rose 0.5%, with both doctor visits and hospital services increasing solidly. But prescription medication prices fell 0.2%.
""We expect demand for goods to waver as spending pivots back toward services, and this transition should temper goods inflation,"" said Michael Pugliese, an economist at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) in New York. ""Pent-up demand for travel should lead to a few more months of solid gains for airfare and lodging prices, but there will likely be less scope for catch-up come autumn.""

The Treasury said March outlays were $508 billion, down 45% from March 2021, while receipts jumped 18% to $315 billion, a new March record, reflecting a strong U.S. economic recovery.
The March 2021 deficit of $660 billion had been a record for the month, driven by direct payments of $1,400 to millions of Americans under last year's $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan Act.
For the first six months of the 2022 fiscal year that started on Oct. 1, the Treasury reported a deficit of $668 billion, a 61% drop from the year-ago period.

Year-to-date outlays fell 18% from the first half of fiscal 2021 to $2.79 trillion, while receipts grew 25% to $2.122 trillion, a new first-half record.
The March receipts were driven largely by increases in individual withheld and non-withheld income taxes, reflecting lower unemployment levels compared to a year ago, Treasury official said.

COMMENTS:
MAZEN ISSA, SENIOR FX STRATEGIST, TD SECURITIES, NEW YORK 
“There was a lot of focus on this print and it was being chalked up to be a very spicy print and that did not disappoint, especially the headline measure. I think the focus here will be that expectations for the core measure, albeit very high expectations, were underwhelmed.”
“Ultimately, I don’t really think that this inflation print really changes the price action in the FX space, because at the end of the day, we’re still sitting at 6.5% year-over-year core inflation and despite the slight moderation, it’s likely to remain elevated for the next several prints. And so, ultimately the forces that are justifying robust tightening by the Fed remain very much in place.”
THOMAS HAYES, CHAIRMAN, GREAT HILL CAPITAL, NEW YORK
“You're seeing futures are up because everyone came into this report expecting that inflation would be a lot higher than anticipated. And what we're actually seeing is that the core CPI, they came in slightly lower than expected, particularly month-on-month core CPI. And that's a very good thing because you really saw yields blowing out ahead of this event.”
“This is a very positive report for stocks and particularly for tech stocks, the long duration equities which have been left for dead as the 10-year yield spiked. This may be a short-term peak in yields and it may be an opportunity to get meaningful exposure into tech as it starts to finally get bid once again along with bonds.”
MICHAEL O’ROURKE, CHIEF MARKET STRATEGIST AT JONESTRADING, STAMFORD, CONNECTICUT 
    ""The numbers were basically in line with expectations. This is expected to be the high print for year-over-year CPI for the cycle. When we get this month's reading and you know subsequent readings they should be lower levels than 8.5%.""
    ""Considering the stock and bond sell-off coming into the number and the numbers are basically in line with expectations, we're getting a nice buy-the-news relief rally ... it should not change any expectations for monetary policy.""
PETER CARDILLO, CHIEF MARKET ECONOMIST, SPARTAN CAPITAL SECURITIES, NEW YORK
“Top line was ugly but the core rate was lower than we expected. This is not good news, but yields are coming off their high indicative of another bloodbath in the debt market.”
“The bottom line is inflation is going to stick around for a while, but we could see it begin to reverse in the summer months, provided we get some cooling off in agricultural and energy prices.”

“(Stock) futures are gaining strength, the market anticipated these numbers yesterday. Stocks are likely to have a positive trading session in anticipation of the banking earnings.”
“It’s nearly written in the stone that we’ll see a 50-basis-point rate hike in May and another in June. The Fed is behind the curve.”

28,By Investing.com,"<span>Apr 12, 2022 08:44AM ET</span>",Gas Price Surge Drives U.S. Inflation to a Fresh 40-Year High of 8.5%,"By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing.com -- U.S. inflation hit a new 40-year high of 8.5% in March, as sharp rises in prices for gasoline, housing and food all heaped pressure on the Federal Reserve to tighten monetary policy.
The consumer price index rose 1.2% on the month, in line with analysts' expectations, over half of which was accounted for by an 18.3% increase in gasoline prices. Pump prices hit all-time highs last month, according to the American Automobile Association and have only partly receded in the last month as the Biden administration released millions of barrels from the U.S. Strategic Petroleum Reserve to bring prices down. The AAA's average gas price stood at $4.09 a gallon on Monday, down from a peak of $4.33 a month ago.
Gas prices weren't the only thing pushing inflation higher, however. Food costs rose another 1.0% for the second month in a row, and transportation services (which include airfares) rose a seasonally-adjusted 2.0% on the month. 
There was a glimmer of light on the horizon, in as much as core prices - which strip out volatile food and energy costs - rose only 0.3%, a little less than the expected 0.5%. The annual core rate of inflation consequently rose only to 6.5%, rather than the 6.6% expected. 
In addition, there was fresh evidence that some of the outlandish movements in prices caused by the pandemic and ensuing supply chain constraints are now reversing. Used car prices, which had spiked last year as manufacturers were left unable to produce new ones due to component shortages, fell 3.8%, their second straight monthly drop. They're still up over 35% year-on-year however.
Analysts have estimated that headline inflation may have peaked in March as the base effects from 12 months ago become more favorable. However, the specter of supply chain disruption hasn't disappeared. Ford (NYSE:F) and General Motors (NYSE:GM) have both had to idle plants in Michigan in the last month due to ongoing shortages, and Covid-19 lockdowns in China are affecting an ever-wider circle of businesses. Analysts at Nomura estimate that over 370 million Chinese in 45 cities are currently subjected to some form of restrictions. That includes a near-total lockdown of Shanghai, home to China's biggest port.
Despite that, financial markets were eager to jump on anything offering hope of relief from what is likely to be the most rapid tightening of U.S. monetary policy since 1994. By 8:55 AM ET (1255 GMT), S&P 500 Futures were up 27 points, or 0.6% from immediately before the release, adding to overnight gains. The yield on the two-year U.S. Treasury note, meanwhile, fell 8 basis points to 2.43%, its sharpest drop in nearly seven weeks."
29,By Bloomberg,"<span>Apr 12, 2022 08:36AM ET</span>","U.S. Inflation Quickens to 8.5%, Ratcheting Up Pressure on Fed","(Bloomberg) -- U.S. consumer prices rose in March by the most since late 1981, bolstering expectations that the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates by half a point next month.
The consumer price index increased 8.5% from a year earlier following a 7.9% annual gain in February, Labor Department data showed Tuesday. The widely followed inflation gauge rose 1.2% from a month earlier, the biggest gain since 2005. Gasoline costs drove half of the monthly increase.
Economists in a Bloomberg survey called for the overall CPI to increase 8.4% from a year ago and 1.2% from February.
The March CPI reading represents what many economists expect to be the peak of the current inflationary period, capturing the impact of soaring food and energy prices after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. While the Fed is shifting as such to more hawkish policy, inflation isn’t likely to recede to the central bank’s 2% goal anytime soon -- especially given the war, Covid-19 lockdowns in China and greater demand for services like travel.
At the same time, risks that inflation will tip the economy into recession are building. A growing chorus of economists predict that activity will contract either because consumer spending declines in response to higher prices, or the Fed will over-correct in its effort to catch up. However, the majority still expects the economy to grow.

The National Federation of Independent Business said its Small Business Optimism Index dropped 2.4 points to 93.2 last month, the third straight month of readings below the 48-year average of 98. The index has declined every month this year.
Thirty-one percent of owners identified inflation as their single most important problem, up 5 points from February. This was the biggest share since the first quarter of 1981 and replaced worries about ""labor quality"" as the No. 1 problem confronting small businesses.
The economy is experiencing high inflation caused by shortages, massive fiscal stimulus and low interest rates.
Annual inflation is rising at the fastest pace in 40 years. The Federal Reserve last month raised its policy interest rate by 25 basis points, the first hike in more than three years. Minutes of the policy meeting published last Wednesday appeared to set the stage for big rate increases down the road.
According to the NFIB survey, the share of owners raising average selling prices increased 4 points to a record high of 72% last month. It noted that ""price-raising activity over the past 12 months has continued to escalate, reaching levels not seen since the early 1980s when prices were rising at double digit rates."" Price increases were across all industries.
Half of business owners planned to raise prices, up 4 points from February. Wage inflation could also pick up.

Forty-seven percent of owners reported job openings they could not fill, down 1 point from February but far above the 48-year historical average of 23%. The share of businesses reporting raising compensation dipped one point to 49%. About 28% planned to raise compensation in the next three months, up 2 points from February. 
Twenty-two percent of owners said that labor quality was their top business problem, unchanged from February.

The ZEW economic research institute said its economic sentiment index fell to -41.0 points from -39.3 in March. A Reuters poll had pointed to a reading of -48.0 for April.
""The ZEW Indicator of Economic Sentiment remains at a low level. The experts are pessimistic about the current economic situation and assume that it will continue to deteriorate,"" ZEW President Achim Wambach said in a statement.
""The decline in inflation expectations, which cuts the previous month's considerable increase by about half, gives some cause for hope. However, the prospect of stagflation over the next six months remains,"" he added.
An index for current conditions fell to -30.8 from -21.4. The consensus forecast was for a reading of -35.0.
The ZEW data echo other weak economic reports from Germany following Russia's invasion of Ukraine, which began on Feb. 24.
Late last month, the German government's council of economic advisers more than halved its 2022 growth forecast for Europe's largest economy to 1.8% and flagged a ""substantial"" recession risk as a result of the invasion.
German business morale also plummeted in March as companies worried about rising energy prices, driver shortages and the stability of supply chains in the wake of the war in Ukraine.
Separate data on Tuesday showed Germany's annual harmonised consumer price inflation (HICP) rate ran at 7.6% in March. Wholesale prices rose by 22.6% on the year, the highest annual rate since the calculation of the data began in 1962.
""Germany is threatened with recession,"" said Thomas Gitzel, chief economist at VP Bank. ""Germany, with its export-heavy industry and dependence on intermediate goods from Asia, is without weather protection in a raging logistics hurricane.""

LONDON (Reuters) -Britons' earnings shrank by the most since 2013 in February when adjusted for surging inflation, despite unemployment falling to its joint lowest in almost 50 years, highlighting the challenges facing the Bank of England.
The jobless rate sank to 3.8% in the three months to February from 3.9% before, official figures showed, matching a rate last seen in late 2019 and one that has not been lower since 1974.
Annual growth in average earnings excluding bonuses picked up to 4.0% from 3.8% but fell short of rising inflation - which hit 6.2% in February - and led to a 1.3% drop in its real value, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said.
""Soaring inflation is casting a big shadow over an otherwise buoyant labour market,"" Nye Cominetti, an economist at the Resolution Foundation think tank, said. 
Compared with before the pandemic, British employers are struggling to hire and job vacancies rose to a record high of 1.288 million in the first quarter of 2022. 
The tight labour market is making many Bank of England (BoE) policymakers fear that Britain's currently high inflation - pushed up by energy prices and post-pandemic supply-chain difficulties - could become entrenched.
The BoE has raised interest rates three times since December, more than any other big central bank, and markets expect it do so again at its next meeting in May.
But the BoE also fears growth will slow sharply this year as the squeeze on living standards intensifies.
Government budget forecasters predict inflation will peak at nearly 9% at the end of the year, and that living standards are set to see their biggest fall since records began in the late 1950s once the effect of April's payroll tax rises are included.
Figures due on Wednesday are expected to show consumer prices rose by 6.7% in the 12 months to March.
SLOWER EMPLOYMENT GROWTH
Tuesday's data showed employment growth was slowing, possibly as a result of firms' concerns about the outlook for demand as well as the difficulty in securing staff.
Employment in the three months to February rose by 10,000, far less than the 50,000 forecast in a Reuters poll of economists. 
The number of job vacancies rose by the smallest amount in nearly a year, while a separate tax office measure of the number of employees on company payrolls rose by 35,000 in March - a lot fewer than February's downwardly revised reading of 174,000.
Also on Tuesday, British retailers reported weaker annual sales growth for March, reflecting growing pressure on consumer spending as well as the timing of Easter.
Reduced immigration from the European Union since post-Brexit restrictions came into force in January 2021 has also increased hiring difficulties for some employers. 

Overall, the number of people in Britain's workforce has fallen by 655,000 since the start of the pandemic - due to a rise in long-term sickness to its joint-highest rate in 20 years, as well as early retirement.
""The jury's out on exactly why this is - or indeed how long it might last - but in the meantime it's adding to labour shortages,"" James Smith, an economist at Dutch bank ING, said.

Investing.com -- Experts' expectations for the German economy darkened again in April, as a closely-watched sentiment index fell to its lowest level since March 2020. 
The ZEW Economic Sentiment index fell to -41.0 from -39.3 the previous month. It had plummeted in March in response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine. The sanctions imposed by the West on Russia in response to that have caused sharp downward revisions to this year's growth forecasts for Europe's largest economy. 
However, the decline in the index was not as bad as expected. The consensus forecast had been for a drop to -48, which would have been only a whisker above its lowest ever reading at the start of the pandemic. The positive surprise was due largely to the assessment of current conditions staying more robust than expected. That subindex fell from -21.4 to only -30.8, instead of the -35 expected.
""There is a little shimmer of light in the decline of inflation expectations,"" said Achim Wambach, head of the ZEW think tank. ""However, the prospect of stagflation in the next six months is still real."" 
The release comes on the same day that the German Federal Statistical Office, Destatis, confirmed that consumer price inflation rose to 7.3% in March (or 7.6% according to the harmonized EU measure), from 5.5% in February. That's the highest in over 30 years. Other measures of inflation suggest that there are still substantial price pressures in the pipeline, as producers and retailers pass on higher costs for energy and other inputs. Wholesale price inflation rose 6.9% on the month and 22.6% on the year in March, Destatis said. Producer prices meanwhile, rose 25.9% in the year through March.

Swiss exports to the United States hit a record 46.95 billion Swiss francs ($50.42 billion) last year after growing by an average of 6.3% per year since 2001, three times faster than the No.2 and No.3 export markets, Germany and Italy.
Germany had been the Alpine country's biggest export market since 1954.
Growth of Swiss exports to the United States was mostly driven by chemical and pharmaceutical products whose shipments rose to 30.1 billion francs last year from 4.3 billion francs in 2001, equivalent to almost two-thirds of exports to the U.S. market, the customs office said.
Machines and electronics were the second-biggest category, representing 8.3% of total exports to the United States, followed by precision instruments and watches.

Exports likely rose 13% in March versus a year earlier, compared with 16.3% year-on-year growth for the January-February period, according to a median forecast in a Reuters poll of 19 economists.
Imports in March were estimated as 8% higher than a year before, the poll showed, easing from 15.5% growth seen in the first two months of the year. The slowdown in growth was partly driven by sluggish domestic demand and by production disruptions, both caused by ongoing COVID-19 outbreaks, analysts say.
Chinese economic data for January and February is often combined to remove distortions caused by the shifting timing of the Lunar New Year holiday.
Economists in the poll expect a March trade surplus of $22.4 billion, compared with $13.8 billion a year earlier.
The trade data will be released on Wednesday.
While COVID outbreaks and resulting restrictions in such major manufacturing locations as Jiangsu, Guangdong and Shanghai have probably slowed export growth, the Ukraine war is denting global economic recovery and disrupting logistics, analysts say. 
The Caixin manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index, which focuses on small manufacturing firms in coastal regions, indicated contraction in March, with a sub-index of new export orders dropping to a 22-month low.
Container throughput at eight major Chinese ports grew 1.8% year-on-year in March, slower than February's 2.8% growth, data by the domestic port association showed.
China's efforts to curb its largest COVID-19 outbreaks in the two years have restricted activity in several cities and in March forced companies from Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) supplier Foxconn to automakers Toyota and Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) to suspend some operations.
Nomura said in a note that China, the world's largest manufacturer, had been facing a rising risk of recession since mid-March. It added that, as of Monday, 45 cities had implemented either full or partial lockdowns covering 26.4% of China's population and 40.3% of its GDP.

Amid constrained supply, factory-gate inflation rose faster than expected in March, raising questions among some analysts about just how much the central bank will be able to ease monetary policy.
Some analysts, noting economic headwinds from the pandemic, still expect further policy easing. But ANZ Research analysts said in a note on Tuesday that the only viable way to boost the economy was to relax measures that hold down the real estate sector.

TOKYO (Reuters) -Japan's wholesale inflation remained near record-high levels in March as the Ukraine crisis and a weak yen pushed up fuel and raw material costs, data showed on Tuesday, adding strains to the resource-poor economy heavily reliant on imports.
While rising wholesale prices will help accelerate consumer inflation toward the central bank's elusive 2% target, it could hurt an economy still reeling from the coronavirus pandemic, analysts say.
The corporate goods price index (CGPI), which measures the price companies charge each other for their goods and services, rose 9.5% in March from a year earlier, data showed.
That followed a revised 9.7% spike in February, which was the fastest pace on record, and exceeded a median market forecast for a 9.3% gain. The March index, at 112.0, was the highest level since December 1982, the Bank of Japan (BOJ) said.
""With raw material costs rising so much, companies won't be able to make money unless they raise prices. The days of discount war are over,"" said Takeshi Minami, chief economist at Norinchukin Research Institute.
""Core consumer inflation may accelerate to around 2.5% later this year and stay above 2% for longer than initially expected, weighing on consumption and the economy,"" he said.
The yen-based import price index jumped 33.4% in March from a year earlier, the data showed, a sign the yen's recent declines are inflating the cost of imports for Japanese firms.
Japanese companies have been slow in passing on rising costs to households as soft wage growth weighed on consumption, keeping consumer inflation well below the BOJ's 2% target.

But analysts expect core consumer inflation to accelerate around 2% from April due to surging fuel costs and the dissipating effect of past cellphone fee cuts.
The rising inflationary pressure heightens the chance the BOJ will revise up its inflation forecast at its next quarterly review due April 28, analysts say. The bank's current forecast is for core consumer inflation to hit 1.1% in the year that began in April.

The survey's measure of sales jumped 13 points to +24, while profitability rose 8 points to +13. The employment index added 4 points to +12, suggesting the jobless rate will soon drop under 4% for the first time since the early 1970s.
""The improvement was largely driven by the retail sector, which saw conditions rise 23 points, as well as recreation & personal services and finance, business & property,"" said NAB chief economist Alan Oster.
""Confidence jumped in the transport, construction, and recreation & personal services sectors.""
Measures of forward orders and business investment also picked up, suggesting the recovery would continue.
Inflation remained a headache with purchase costs and labour costs rising at the fastest pace in the history of the survey, which in turn pushed up retail prices.
""The continued escalation in price growth over recent months suggests a strong Q1 CPI reading is likely when released later in the month,"" said Oster.
Analysts have been warning the March quarter consumer price index would likely surprise on the high side and put pressure on the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) to start raising interest rates as early as June.
A separate survey of consumers from ANZ out Tuesday showed its sentiment index picked up 1.3% last week as petrol prices cooled just a little, though it remains below average.
Inflation expectations stayed high at 5.8%, reflecting cost of living pressures from petrol, food and housing.

All that price froth has yet to deter shoppers with CBA's measure of household spending intentions jumping 9.2% in March to a record high, led by travel, transport and retail.
The strength in spending, combined with a 13-year low for unemployment, suggests the economy overall put in a solid performance in the first quarter.

WELLINGTON (Reuters) -New Zealand business confidence and demand worsened in the first quarter of this year due to the ongoing damage the COVID-19 outbreak is having on the economy, a private think tank said on Tuesday.
A net 40% of firms surveyed expected general business conditions to deteriorate compared with 28% pessimism in the previous quarter, the New Zealand Institute of Economic Research's (NZIER) quarterly survey of business opinion (QSBO) showed.
On a seasonally adjusted basis, 33% expected business conditions to worsen, versus 35% pessimism recorded in the previous period. The survey's measure of capacity utilisation rose to 97.1%, from the previous quarter's 92.7%. 

The manufacturing sector is the least pessimistic of the sectors survey but still face many challenges as Omicron's spread impacts deliveries, NZIER said in its report. 
A net 56% reported increased costs in the March quarter, it said. Overall, businesses are feeling more cautious in an environment of acute labour shortages and intense cost pressures, the report said.

The central bank was due to release a foreign trade balance for January-February on Monday, as initially planned, according to its data release schedule. 
The central bank did not explain its decision to suspend publication of the foreign trade data, monthly figures for which can be tracked back as far as 1997 on the bank's website. 
In January, the latest data available, Russian foreign trade surplus fell to $21.17 billion from $26.72 billion in the previous month. 
Russia is under tough Western sanctions as the United States, the European Union and their allies respond to Moscow's Ukraine invasion launched on Feb. 24, which the Kremlin calls ""a special military operation."" 
The sanctions have cut Russia off from the global financial system and Western countries are stepping up the pressure by reducing Russian energy imports.
The central bank had earlier suspended weekly publication of its gold and foreign exchange reserves and also stopped disclosing banking sector statistics. 
The bank has resumed publication of this weekly data, which showed that Russian gold and forex reserves had fallen to $606.5 billion as of April 1, down from $643.2 billion days before the invasion. 

The Russian energy ministry had earlier suspended a monthly release of oil and gas output data citing technical issues. 
Russian oil and gas condensate production declined by 4% in early April from March to 10.58 barrels per day (bpd), Interfax newsagency has said, and analysts have warned of a further up to 1.5 mln bpd fall as buyers cancel cargoes.

40,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 11, 2022 11:15AM ET</span>","U.S. consumers up view of inflation, spending in coming year, NY Fed survey finds","(Reuters) - U.S. consumers boosted their expectations for inflation and household spending in the year ahead as the price of gas and food steepens, but tempered their view of inflation over the medium-term, according to a survey released on Monday by the New York Federal Reserve. 
Expectations for where inflation will be in one year rose to 6.6% in March, the highest since the survey was launched in 2013 and up from 6.0% in February. Household spending was seen growing 7.7% in the year ahead, also a series high. Just 23% saw their household finances improving in the year ahead, the smallest share since the survey began. 
Americans are experiencing the worst bout of inflation in decades, and it is getting worse: economists polled by Reuters expect a report out on Tuesday will show consumer prices rose 8.4% in March, up from 7.9% in February, as Russia's invasion of Ukraine drives up food and energy prices. 
To combat 40-year-high inflation, the Federal Reserve last month raised interest rates for the first time in three years and is expected to accelerate the pace of rate hikes in coming months. The New York Fed survey suggests consumer see little short-term relief, as they anticipate the price of food, gas and medical care to rise 9.6%, and expect rent to jump 10.2%. Home prices were expected to rise 6% in the coming year, faster than the 5.7% expected last month.
But Fed policymakers are also closely tracking farther-ahead inflation expectations for signs that consumers see current price increases continuing. Monday's survey offered some comfort there: while near-term inflation expectations have soared, consumers' longer-term expectations have been less affected. 
The New York Fed's monthly survey of consumer expectations is based on a rotating panel of 1,300 households.

Consumers expressed less optimism about the labor market than in February. The average perceived odds of losing one's job over the next year rose to 11.1% from 10.8%, though it was still well below its pre-pandemic reading of 13.8%. 
Unemployment in March was 3.6%, a pandemic low and only a hair above the pre-pandemic rate of 3.5%.

BEIJING (Reuters) -New bank lending in China rose more than expected in March, while broad credit growth accelerated from the previous month as the central bank kept policy accommodative to support the slowing economy.
Chinese banks extended 3.13 trillion yuan ($492 billion) in new yuan loans in March, up sharply from February and exceeding analyst expectations, data released by the People's Bank of China on Monday showed.
Analysts polled by Reuters had predicted new yuan loans would rise to 2.68 trillion yuan in March. The new loans were higher than 2.73 trillion yuan a year earlier.
That pushed bank lending in the first quarter to a record 8.34 trillion yuan, up 8.7% from 7.67 trillion yuan in the first quarter of 2021 - the previous record. 
""Bank loans and total social financing rose more than expected in March. This confirms that the government did loosen monetary policy,"" said Zhiwei Zhang, chief economist at Pinpoint Asset Management.
""Strong credit supply is helpful, but the economy will likely stay weak with many cities under lockdown. The outlook of the COVID outbreaks and the zero (COVID) tolerance policy are the most important uncertainty the economy faces.""
Household loans, mostly mortgages, rose to 753.9 billion yuan in March, after contracting by 336.9 billion yuan in February, while corporate loans jumped to 2.48 trillion yuan last month from 1.24 trillion yuan in February.
China's cabinet last week held out the prospect of more measures to support the economy under pressure from renewed COVID-19 outbreaks and a slowing global recovery.
MODEST EASING EXPECTED
To spur growth, the central bank has cut interest rates and banks' reserve requirement ratio (RRR), with more easing steps expected.
""Credit growth will probably continue to accelerate in the coming months amid declines in borrowing costs and support to the housing market,"" Sheana Yue at Capital Economics said in a note. 
""We think policy easing will continue in the near term,"" Yue said, expecting the central bank to cut the rate on its medium-term lending facility (MLF) by 10 basis points as early as on Friday.
Broad M2 money supply grew 9.7% in March from a year earlier, central bank data showed, above estimates of 9.2% forecast in the Reuters poll. M2 grew 9.2% in February from a year ago.
Outstanding yuan loans grew by 11.4% in March from a year earlier, compared with 11.4% growth in February. Analysts had expected 11.4% growth.
Growth of outstanding total social financing (TSF), a broad measure of credit and liquidity in the economy, quickened to 10.6% in March from a year earlier and from 10.2% in February.

TSF includes off-balance sheet forms of financing that exist outside the conventional bank lending system, such as initial public offerings, loans from trust companies and bond sales.
In March, TSF rose sharply to 4.65 trillion yuan from 1.19 trillion yuan in February. Analysts polled by Reuters had expected March TSF of 3.7 trillion yuan.

42,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 11, 2022 03:36AM ET</span>",UK growth stutters in February as cost-of-living squeeze looms,"By David Milliken
LONDON (Reuters) -Britain's economy slowed more sharply than expected in February, reflecting a hit to car production from component shortages, storm disruption and reduced health spending as households braced for a tighter cost-of-living squeeze.
Monthly gross domestic product growth was just 0.1% in February compared with 0.8% in January, the Office for National Statistics said on Monday, below the 0.3% forecast by economists in a Reuters poll.
""The news that the economy was hardly growing at all in February ... increases the risk of a contraction in GDP in the coming months as the squeeze on household real incomes intensifies,"" Ruth Gregory, senior UK economist at Capital Economics, said. 
Britain's economy in February was 1.5% larger than it was two years earlier, just before the country was hit by the COVID-19 pandemic, the ONS said.
GDP collapsed by more than 9% in 2020, its biggest annual fall since just after World War One, but rebounded sharply in 2021 and suffered only a modest hit from the Omicron variant of coronavirus in December.
However, economists have downgraded their growth forecasts for 2022 due to a surge in inflation caused by rising energy and commodity prices -- partly linked to the war in Ukraine -- as well as ongoing supply-chain difficulties since the pandemic.
Last month the government's Office for Budget Responsibility cut its forecast for growth in 2022 to 3.8% from 6.0% in its previous forecast in October, predicting that inflation would hit a 40-year high of 8.7% later this year.
The squeeze on households' disposable income from higher inflation and a payroll tax rise that took effect in April will be the biggest since records began in 1956/57, the OBR said.
Finance minister Rishi Sunak -- whose popularity has slumped after offering only limited support to help households in a fiscal statement last month -- said he welcomed the continued growth.
However, some analysts think the economy will shrink over the three months to June, reflecting reduced COVID-related health spending and an extra public holiday to mark Queen Elizabeth's Golden Jubilee, as well as reduced household disposable income.
""Given this weak near-term outlook for GDP growth, we continue to think that the (Bank of England) will stop increasing Bank Rate after raising it to 1.0% next month,"" Pantheon Macroeconomics's Samuel Tombs said.
Britain's dominant services sector drove monthly growth in February as the Omicron wave of coronavirus cases ebbed. 
Services output, up 0.2%, was boosted by a surge in travel bookings as COVID-19 restrictions eased, although this was largely offset by a sharp fall in health spending after COVID-19 testing and vaccination halved from January's high level.

Factory output dropped by 0.4% reflecting continued falls in car production due to component shortages and declines in other areas, while milder-than-usual winter weather depressed demand for electricity, causing power generation to fall by 1.0%.
Storms and rising materials costs hurt construction, where output fell by 0.1% on the month.

43,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 11, 2022 12:01AM ET</span>",China's inflation tops forecasts as supply pressures worsen,"BEIJING (Reuters) -China's factory-gate and consumer prices rose faster than expected in March as Russia's invasion of Ukraine, persistent supply chain bottlenecks and production snags caused by local COVID flare-ups added to commodity cost pressures.
The surge in raw materials costs is hobbling economies worldwide and in China has raised questions among some analysts about just how much its central bank will be able to ease monetary policy.
China's producer price index (PPI) increased 8.3% year-on-year, data from the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) showed on Monday. While that was slower than the 8.8% seen in February, it beat a forecast for a 7.9% rise in a Reuters poll.
Upstream pressures pushed up consumer prices, which rose 1.5% year-on-year, the fastest in three months, speeding up from 0.9% in February and beating expectations of 1.2%.
Nomura analysts said possible delays in crop planting caused by new COVID-19 outbreaks in the country and the Ukraine conflict could create new food price pressures in the second half of the year.
""Rising food and energy price inflation limits the space for the (People's Bank of China) to cut interest rates, despite the rapidly worsening economy,"" Nomura said in a note.
While the year-on-year PPI rise was the slowest since April 2021, this was mostly due to the lower comparisons from late 2020 and early 2021 seen in the previous months.
The monthly increase of 1.1%, meanwhile, was the fastest in five months, driven by surging prices of domestic oil and non-ferrous metals due to geopolitical factors, an NBS statement said.
Oil and gas extraction prices grew 14.1% on month, and petroleum，coal and other fuel processing prices rose 7.9%.
The uncertainty in the Ukraine war will affect global goods supply, ""adding greater imported inflation pressure on China"", said Wang Jun, chief economist at Zhongyuan Bank.
NEW RISKS
The world's second-largest economy came under downward pressure in March with renewed COVID-19 outbreaks and the manufacturing and service sectors reporting declines in activity.
Authorities have unveiled policies to support the economy, including greater fiscal spending and reductions in income tax for small firms.
While consumer prices have risen, inflation remains modest by global comparisons, pointing to weak consumption caused by Beijing's strict COVID control measures.
Against a year ago, food prices fell 1.5%, compared with a 3.9% decline in February, resulting in a drop of 0.28 percentage points in headline CPI.
China reported 26,411 new asymptomatic cases for Sunday, more than 25,000 in the financial hub of Shanghai, which is currently under a city-wide lockdown.
Iris Pang, chief economist for Greater China at ING, expects Shanghai's economy will shrink 6% this month alone if the current lockdown persists, resulting in a 2% gross domestic product decline for the whole of China.

""Although the price of some goods will remain high in the near-term, we think wider inflation will remain contained, giving the PBOC room to ease policy further,"" said Sheana Yue, China Economist at Capital Economics.
For now, most analysts expect the PBOC to lower borrowing costs, and cut reserve requirements for banks or lower interest rate to pump more cash into the economy.

44,By Bloomberg,"<span>Apr 10, 2022 09:54PM ET</span>",China Factory Prices Rise Faster Than Expected as Oil Surges,"(Bloomberg) -- China’s factory gate prices rose more than expected in March as oil prices climbed, putting pressure on manufacturers that are already struggling to operate amid repeated Covid outbreaks. 
The producer price index gained 8.3% from a year earlier, official data showed Monday, down from 8.8% in February and above the median estimate of an 8.1% increase in a Bloomberg survey of economists. 
Consumer-price growth accelerated to 1.5% after staying unchanged at 0.9% for two months. The reading beat economists projection of a 1.4% increase. 
China’s economic outlook worsened in March as cities and provinces locked down to control a ballooning Covid outbreak. Manufacturers in pandemic-stricken areas were forced to shutter their doors, or else keep workers on factory floors in so-called closed-loop systems so they could stay operational.
Businesses have said they faced difficulties buying raw materials, or faced extended delivery times due to supply chain disruptions. Restrictions also forced consumers to stay in their homes, as many struggled to secure daily necessities or paid high prices for goods. 
The war in Ukraine also pushed global commodities including oil higher, clouding the outlook.
Price pressures are unlikely to constrain policy makers from stepping up support for economic growth, though. Unlike major developed economies, China’s central bank is in easing mode, having cut interest rates in recent months to boost liquidity and dialed up fiscal spending. 
Authorities in recent weeks have made repeated vows to stabilize the economy as the Covid outbreak worsens, fanning speculation that a policy rate cut or other easing measure could happen soon.

(Reuters) -Egypt's annual urban consumer price inflation accelerated in March to 10.5%, its highest in nearly three years and faster than analysts had expected, data from the state statistics agency CAPMAS showed on Sunday.
The inflation figure, up from 8.8% in February, was greater than a median forecast of 10% in a Reuters poll of 14 analysts.
The price increases were caused in part by commodity shortages after the Russian invasion of Ukraine, sending inflation above the central bank's 5-9% target and its 9.25% overnight lending rate.
Some analysts expect inflation to increase by even more in the months ahead.
Core inflation, which strips out volatile items such as food, jumped to 10.1% year-on-year in March from 7.2% in February, the central bank said on Sunday, its highest since June 2018.
""The rise in inflation trends is widely expected and will peak by August 2022, after which it will start to normalise,"" said Radwa El Swaify of Pharos Securities Brokerage.
CI Capital's Sara Saada, meanwhile, said the government was expected to increase fuel prices this month.
""Accordingly, we expect monthly inflation to peak in April to record annual inflation between 12.5-13%, which reflects higher petroleum products prices,"" she said.

Naeem Research said the increase was largely attributable to higher commodity prices and the devaluation of the currency on March 21.
""With the full impacts of the Egyptian pound depreciation (of 15% versus the dollar) expected to filter down into the economy, we expect inflation to rise further in April,"" it said in a note.

46,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 08, 2022 10:36AM ET</span>",U.S. wholesale inventories revised higher in February,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. wholesale inventories increased more than initially thought in February, but inventory investment probably offered little or no boost to economic growth in the first quarter.
The Commerce Department said on Friday wholesale inventories rose 2.5% in February, instead of 2.1% as reported last month. Stocks at wholesalers advanced 1.2% in January. Economists polled by Reuters had expected inventories would be unrevised.
Wholesale inventories surged 19.9% in February on a year-on-year basis. Inventories are a key part of gross domestic product. Wholesale motor vehicle inventories rebounded 1.4% after declining 2.3% in January. 
Wholesale inventories, excluding autos, increased 2.6% in February. This component goes into the calculation of GDP.
Inventory investment surged at a robust seasonally adjusted annualized rate of $193.2 billion in the fourth quarter, contributing 5.32 percentage points to the quarter's 6.9% growth pace. Most economists see further scope for inventories to rise, noting that inflation-adjusted inventories remain below their pre-pandemic level. Sales-to-inventory ratios are also low.
But inventories were probably not much of a boost to GDP growth in the January-March quarter as they would have needed to increase by more than the fourth quarter's pace. 

Businesses are restocking after drawing down inventories from the first quarter of 2021 through the third quarter. Growth estimates for the first quarter are mostly below a 1.0% rate. 
Sales at wholesalers increased 1.7% in February after jumping 5.0% in January. At February's sales pace it would take wholesalers 1.21 months to clear shelves, up from 1.20 months in January.

OTTAWA (Reuters) -Canada's unemployment rate fell to 5.3% in March, the lowest level on record, highlighting the tightening of the country's labor market, Statistics Canada data showed on Friday, with the economy adding a net 72,500 jobs.
The job gain was slightly below analyst predictions of 80,000, while the unemployment rate met expectations. The average hourly wage of permanent employees rose 3.7%, up from a 3.3% gain in February.
""We're beyond full employment. We're seeing the market heating up, and that shows with the wage growth,"" said Jimmy Jean, chief economist at Desjardins Group. 
Employment growth continues to outpace population growth, leading to tighter labor markets, Statscan said. Since September 2021, Canada has added 463,000 jobs, but just 236,000 new working age people.
Job gains were entirely in full-time work, partially offset with a slight decline in part-time work. Employment rose in both the services sector and the goods sector, led by accommodation and food services and construction.
Canada's employment rate, a ratio that accounts for population growth and not just net job gains, hit its pre-pandemic level for the first time in March. 
By comparison, the employment rate in the United States is still 1.1 percentage points below its February 2020 level, Statscan said.
Economists said the jobs data continues to support the Bank of Canada raising its policy rate by a half point to 1% when it meets next week.
""Today's figures may not be as dramatically strong as the prior month, but they are still solid enough to support calls for a 50 basis point hike,"" said Andrew Grantham, senior economist at CIBC Capital Markets.

A record number of Canadian businesses say intense labor shortages and ongoing supply chain issues are hurting their ability to expand capacity to meet booming demand, according to a central bank survey this week.
The Canadian dollar steadied at 1.2588 to the greenback, or 79.44 U.S. cents after the jobs data, nearly unchanged on the day.

PARIS (Reuters) -World food prices jumped nearly 13% in March to a new record high as the war in Ukraine caused turmoil in markets for staple grains and edible oils, the U.N. food agency said on Friday.
The Food and Agriculture Organization's (FAO) food price index, which tracks the most globally traded food commodities, averaged 159.3 points last month versus an upwardly revised 141.4 for February.
The February figure was previously put at 140.7, which was a record at the time.
Russia and Ukraine are major exporters of wheat, corn, barley and sunflower oil via the Black Sea, and Moscow's six-week-old invasion of its neighbour has stalled Ukrainian exports.
The FAO last month said food and feed prices could rise by up to 20% as a result of the conflict in Ukraine, raising the risk of increased malnutrition.
The agency's cereal price index climbed 17% in March to a record level while its vegetable oil index surged 23%, also registering its highest reading yet, FAO said.
Disruption to supplies of crops from the Black Sea region has exacerbated price rises in food commodities, which were already running at 10-year highs in the FAO's index before the war in Ukraine due to global harvest issues.
Sugar and dairy prices also rose sharply last month, the FAO said.
In separate cereal supply and demand estimates on Friday, the FAO cut its projection of world wheat production in 2022 to 784 million tonnes, from 790 million last month, as it factored in the possibility that at least 20% of Ukraine's winter crop area would not be harvested.
The revised global wheat output estimate was nonetheless 1% above the previous year's level, it said.
The agency lowered its projection of global cereals trade in the 2021/22 marketing year as increased exports from Argentina, India, the European Union and the United States were expected to only offset some of the disruption to Black Sea exports.

Total cereal trade in 2021/22 was revised down by 14.6 million tonnes from the previous monthly outlook to 469 million tonnes, now 2% below the 2020/21 level.
Projected world cereal stocks at the end of 2021/22 were revised up by 15 million tonnes to nearly 851 million tonnes, mainly because of expectations that export disruption will lead to bigger stockpiles in Ukraine and Russia, the FAO added.

SANTIAGO (Reuters) - Chile's consumer prices rocketed 1.9% in March, the highest monthly rise in almost thirty years, underscoring the challenge for authorities as they battle spiraling inflation exacerbated by rising global commodities costs. 
The Andean country's official statistics agency said on Friday that the rise had been driven by food prices, non-alcoholic beverages and education.
The monthly figure was far higher than the 1.05% rise expected in a Reuters poll of economists and is the highest monthly inflation rate since 1993. The rolling 12-month rate rose further to around 9.4%, the highest since 2008.
That remains far above the central bank's target rate of 2% to 4%, which has been driving a recent spate of interest rate hikes and may prompt more tightening ahead.
Governments around Latin America have been looking to combat inflation, which has been pushed higher by supply bottlenecks linked to the war in Ukraine. Brazil posted its highest monthly inflation in 28 years on Friday.
In Peru, facing its fastest inflation in a quarter of a century, rising prices are spurring angry protests that have rattled the government of leftist Pedro Castillo.
Chilean president Gabriel Boric announced a $3.7 billion economic recovery plan on Thursday that included a minimum wage hike to help people deal with rising prices.
The world's no. 1 copper producing country has seen a rapid economic recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic aided by state spending and withdrawals from private retirement funds, which has in turn caused strong inflationary pressure.
To combat inflation, the central bank raised the interest rate by 150 basis points to 7% in March.

ANDREW GRANTHAM, SENIOR ECONOMIST, CIBC CAPITAL MARKETS
""We think there may be a little room for the unemployment rate to fall further, given that some areas of the country - oil-producing provinces for example - were clearly not at full employment before the pandemic struck.""
""Today's figures may not be as dramatically strong as the prior month, but they are still solid enough to support calls for a 50 basis point hike from the Bank of Canada next week.""
ROYCE MENDES, DIRECTOR & HEAD OF MACRO STRATEGY AT DESJARDINS 
""The solid pace of hiring reinforces our view that the Bank of Canada will act forcefully next week to quell inflationary pressures by both hiking rates 50 basis points and initiating its quantitative tightening program. Bond yields are pushing higher in the wake of the release as traders firm up bets on aggressive action from the central bank.""
JIMMY JEAN, CHIEF ECONOMIST AT DESJARDINS GROUP
""We have 93,000 jobs created in the full time. So that's more than double what was expected. And remember, we are coming off a very strong month of February, we had 122,000 jobs created. So to follow up with another 93,000 jobs full time, that shows how just robust this market is. You have a two-tick decline in the unemployment rate 5.3%... We're beyond full employment. We're seeing the marking heating up, and that shows with the wage growth of 3.7%. That's a four-tick acceleration there. So those details coming in are very robust. From our perspective, it fully supports the view we have for next week for the Bank of Canada to go ahead with a 50-basis-point rate hike, and to announce the beginning of the asset purchase unwind, the cutting of the balance sheet.""
DEREK HOLT, VICE PRESIDENT OF CAPITAL MARKETS ECONOMICS, SCOTIABANK

""To keep the job creation machine going is a strong plus -tighter labour markets, lower unemployment. The one fly in the ointment is wages. Month-over-month, seasonally adjusted annualized they dipped. So we've had a couple months of slightly softening wage growth but not a huge deal yet.""
""On balance I don't think it is going to change anything for the Bank of Canada. I still expect (a hike of) 50 basis points next week.""

BRASILIA (Reuters) - Brazil's inflation came above expectations with the sharpest rise for March in 28 years, official figures showed on Friday, as higher fuel prices weighed on the economy, affected by an oil shock in the wake of the Ukraine conflict.
The IPCA consumer price index rose 1.62% from February, government statistics agency IBGE said, above a 1.3% gain seen in a Reuters poll of economists and accelerating from the February 1.01% figure.
This was the steepest rise for the month since 1994, before the creation of the real currency, underscoring strong inflationary pressures in Latin America's largest economy.
In the 12 months through March, inflation grew 11.30%, up from 10.54% in the prior month and well above the central bank's year-end target of 3.5%.
According to the IBGE, eight of the nine groups of products and services surveyed rose in March, with emphasis on transport, up 3.02% over the previous month, and food and beverages, which grew 2.42%.
The two groups alone contributed with almost three quarters of the month's inflation, IBGE added.
It also pointed out that the result in transport was affected by the 6.7% rise in fuel prices. Gasoline, in particular, was up 6.95%.
In mid-March, the state-run oil firm Petrobras announced a big increase in fuels to track global markets after Russia's invasion of Ukraine prompted oil prices to skyrocket.

Brazil's central bank chief Roberto Campos Neto said inflation would peak in April.
To tame the persistent rise in consumer prices, policymakers have put the country's benchmark interest at 11.75% from a record-low of 2% last March, signaling another 100 basis-point hike in May. That could wrap up the aggressive tightening cycle, which may be a big hurdle for economic growth this year.

52,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 08, 2022 05:01AM ET</span>","Taiwan March exports hit new record, Ukraine war clouds outlook","TAIPEI (Reuters) - Taiwan's exports rose for a 21st straight month in March to a new record in line with forecasts, boosted by continued strong tech demand, though the government warned of continued supply chain uncertainty and the effect of the war in Ukraine.
Exports last month jumped 21.3% from a year earlier to $43.5 billion, the Ministry of Finance said on Friday, the highest monthly figure on record.
A Reuters poll of analysts had forecast a 21% rise for the month, compared with a 34.8% leap in February.
The ministry attributed the March growth to strong demand for electronic components as well as semiconductors, and companies increasing orders to ensure supplies to customers.
Exports of electronics components rose 35.6% in March to $18.24 billion, also a monthly record, with semiconductor exports surging 38.2% from a year earlier.
Many companies expect global chip shortages to last at least for the rest of the year, which will continue to fill Taiwanese semiconductor firms' order books.
Firms such as TSMC, the world's largest contract chip-maker, are major suppliers to Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) and other global tech giants, as well as providers of chips for auto companies and lower-end consumer electronics.
Earlier on Friday, TSMC reported March sales of T$171.97 billion ($5.95 billion), up 33.2% from the same period last year.
The finance ministry said ""enormous"" demand for chips would continue to drive exports, but warned of uncertainty over the COVID-19 pandemic, the ongoing war in Ukraine, supply chain bottlenecks and inflation. 
Ministry official Beatrice Tsai said the second quarter would likely continue to see double-digit growth, but that it was ""hard to see"" rapid growth continuing in the second half. 
March exports to China, Taiwan's largest trading partner, grew an annual 13.4% to $18.03 billion, compared with a 39.9% on-year rise in February, while exports to the United States jumped 36.6%, slightly slower than the 40.3% rise recorded the previous month.
Imports leapt 20.3%, in line with economists' expectations of a 20.5% rise, after an increase of 35.3% in February.

Taiwan could see April exports increase in the range of 13% to 17% from a year earlier, the finance ministry said.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's current account balance swung back into the black in February from its second-biggest deficit on record in the previous month, providing some respite for policymakers amid a deterioration in economic fundamentals.
Soaring fuel costs and a weak yen have expanded Japan's trade deficit in recent months, more than offsetting heavy returns on investment and pushing the country's current account balance into the red.
The world's third-largest economy ran a current account surplus of 1.6483 trillion yen ($13.28 billion) in February, finance ministry data showed on Friday, against a median market forecast for a 1.4368 trillion yen surplus.
That followed a 1.1887 trillion yen deficit in January, the second biggest shortfall under comparable data dating back to 1985.
The trade deficit narrowed to 176.8 billion yen in February from 1.6043 trillion yen in January.
The primary income surplus, meanwhile, widened to 2.2745 trillion yen from 1.2813 trillion yen, although that was smaller than in the same month last year due to shrinking foreign investment returns, the data showed.
The smaller trade gap and larger primary income surplus helped push the current account back into positive territory.

Japan is particularly vulnerable to soaring fuel and raw material costs, as it relies almost entirely on imports for energy, adding to uncertainties about its already fragile recovery from the pandemic.
Some analysts have warned that Japan's worsening terms of trade and current account balance, if they persist, could erode market trust in the country's ability to pay back debt and work to weaken the yen further.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits fell last week, indicating a further tightening of labor market conditions heading into the second quarter, which could contribute to keeping inflation elevated.
Part of the decline in claims back to a more than 53-year low touched in mid-March reflected a revision of the seasonal factors, the model that the government uses to strip out seasonal fluctuations from the data. 
During the COVID-19 pandemic, the Labor Department switched to additive factors to seasonally adjust the initial and continued claims data from multiplicative factors, which economists had complained were less reliable because of the economic shock caused by the coronavirus crisis.
""Now that most of the large effects of the pandemic on the unemployment insurance series have lessened, the seasonal adjustment models are once again specified as multiplicative models,"" the Labor Department said in a statement on Thursday. ""Statistical tests show that the unemployment insurance series should, in normal times, be estimated multiplicatively.""Initial claims for state unemployment benefits dropped 5,000 to a seasonally adjusted 166,000 for the week ended April 2. Claims were at this level during the week ending March 19, which was the lowest since November 1968. 
Seasonal factors back then were much different from now, making it difficult to make comparisons. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast 200,000 applications for the latest week.
The government also revised claims data from 2017 through 2021, which showed the level of filings much lower last year. The switch back to multiplicative factors pushed applications down by about 20,000-40,000 for the recent weeks. Claims hit a record high of 6.137 million in early April 2020.
The government said it would use a hybrid of multiplicative and additive seasonal factors while the pandemic remains within the five-year revision period. Multiplicative seasonal factors are assumed to be proportional to the level of filings while additive factors are not affected.
""The message from these volatile and revision-prone data continues to be that the labor market is very tight by most historical standards,"" said Conrad DeQuadros, senior economic advisor at Brean Capital in New York.
A severe shortage of workers is keeping layoffs low and boosting hiring. Worker demand is being driven by a sharp decline in COVID-19 infections, which has resulted in restrictions being lifted across the country. 
There were big declines in claims in Michigan and Texas, which offset increases in California, Ohio and Pennsylvania.
Stocks on Wall Street were trading lower. The dollar was steady against a basket of currencies. Prices for longer-dated U.S. Treasuries fell.
NEAR RECORD JOB OPENINGS
There is no sign yet that the Russia-Ukraine war, which has pushed gasoline prices above $4 per gallon, has impacted the labor market. Nonfarm payrolls increased by 431,000 jobs in March, the government reported last Friday. 
March marked the 11th straight month of job gains in excess of 400,000, which pushed the unemployment rate to a fresh two-year low of 3.6%. The jobless rate is just one tenth of a percentage point above its pre-pandemic level.
With a near record 11.3 million job openings on the last day of February, the scarcity of workers is forcing companies to boost wages, which is contributing to high inflation. 
While the claims report also showed the number of people receiving benefits after an initial week of aid increased 17,000 to 1.523 million during the week ended March 26, the trend in the so-called continuing claims remained low. 
""This was just a modest move up from the revised reading for the week ended March 19 that currently stands as the low since the start of the pandemic,"" said Daniel Silver, an economist at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) in New York.
Minutes of the Federal Reserve's March 15-16 meeting published on Wednesday showed policymakers observed that ""demand for labor continued to substantially exceed available supply across many parts of the economy,"" and ""that various indicators
pointed to a very tight labor market."" 
The U.S. central bank last month raised its policy interest rate by 25 basis points, the first hike in more than three years. Wednesday's minutes appeared to set the stage for hefty rate increases down the road.
Job openings far outpace the number of unemployed, illustrating the hiring challenges companies are facing. There were 6.0 million officially unemployed people in March. 

The resulting strong wage growth is providing some cushion for consumers battered by soaring prices, with annual inflation rising at its fastest pace in 40 years.
""The job market is strong, giving consumers a break from inflation and geopolitical concerns,"" said Scott Murray, an economist at Nationwide in Columbus, Ohio. ""Open positions and fewer layoffs point to solid economic growth.

Consumer price inflation rose 7.45% in the year through March, way more than the central bank's target of 3%, with a one-percentage-point tolerance range above and below that, the government's INEGI statistics agency said on Thursday.
It was also above the median forecast of analysts surveyed by Reuters, who projected inflation would rise to 7.36% in March, versus 7.28% in February.
For its part, core inflation, which strips out some volatile food and energy items, increased 6.78% in the year through March, a level not hit since April 2001.
Minutes from the Bank of Mexico's latest monetary policy meeting, which were published on Thursday, said all five of the bank's board members stated that forecasts for headline and core inflation were revised upwards, while most members underscored that convergence to target has been delayed.
Banxico, as the Mexican central bank is known, said ""most members stated that the balance of risks for the trajectory of inflation over the forecast horizon has deteriorated again and remains biased to the upside.""
Among upside risks to inflation, most board members mentioned the persistence of core inflation at high levels, external inflationary pressures associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, increases in agricultural and livestock product prices and in energy prices due to the recent geopolitical conflict, and cost-related pressures.
Headline and core inflation have ""further to run in the near term as food and energy inflation edges higher. Broader price pressures will also remain strong, suggesting that Banxico's tightening cycle will go further than most analysts expect,"" said Nikhil Sanghani, Latin America economist at Capital Economics.
Banxico raised its benchmark interest rate by 50 basis points last month, its seventh straight hike, citing tightening global monetary and financial conditions, and uncertainty and inflationary pressure linked to the war in Ukraine.
""Persistent inflation risks, alongside the more hawkish U.S. Fed, will put pressure on Banxico to continue tightening over the coming months,"" said Sanghani. 

He forecast another 50-basis-point rate hike at the bank's next monetary policy meeting scheduled for May 12 and at least a further 150 basis points of tightening in this cycle to 8.50%.
Consumer prices rose 0.99% in March, according to non-seasonally adjusted figures, while the core index rose 0.72% during the month, according to INEGI data.

House prices grew by 1.4% month-on-month in March, the biggest rise in six months, the ninth consecutive month of increases and following a 0.8% rise in February.
Compared with a year ago, house prices were 11.0% higher, Halifax said, slowing slightly from growth of 11.2% in February which had been the highest rate since 2007.
Halifax said the rise reflected too many buyers chasing too few homes coming to the market, but it warned a growing squeeze on household finances might dampen house price growth in the months ahead.

""Buyers are ... dealing with the prospect of higher interest rates and a higher cost of living. With affordability metrics already extremely stretched, these factors should lead to a slowdown in house price inflation over the next year,"" said Russell Galley, Halifax managing director.
Consumer price inflation hit a 30-year high of 6.2% in February and the government's budget watchdog two weeks ago forecast it would go close to 9% in late 2022, contributing to the biggest fall in living standards since at least the 1950s.

TOKYO (Reuters) - The proportion of Japanese households expecting prices to rise a year from now has hit a 14-year high, a central bank survey showed on Thursday, as inflationary pressures from rising raw material costs grew.
The quarterly survey also showed more households felt worse off than three months ago as prices of food and daily necessities rose, highlighting the pain global commodity inflation was inflicting on Japan's fragile economy.
Of households surveyed, 84.3% expect prices to rise a year from now, up from 78.8% three months ago and marking the highest percentage since June 2008, the Bank of Japan's survey showed.
The survey, conducted between Feb. 4 and March 2, also showed 82.1% of households expect prices to rise five years from now. That was up from 80.8% in the previous survey in January and the highest ratio since December 2019.
A diffusion index measuring households' livelihoods worsened to minus 36.9 in March from minus 34.2 in December, with many of those surveyed blaming the pinch from rising grocery prices.
Japan has not been immune from surging fuel and commodity prices with wholesale inflation hitting record highs. Analysts also expect consumer inflation to hit or even exceed the BOJ's 2% inflation target as early as this month.

Unlike central banks in other advanced economies that are hiking interest rates to dampen inflationary pressures, the BOJ has little room to manoeuvre as Japan's economy is still struggling to recover from a pandemic-induced slump.
The survey is among data the BOJ will likely analyse at this month's policy meeting to see whether rising raw materials and fuel costs have affected public perceptions of future price moves, and how that may impact consumer spending.

The South American country's price index, which rose 2.9% in February, is showing a slower increase since President Nicolas Maduro's government began easing foreign exchange controls to allow a wider circulation of hard currency, leading to more stable prices.
The accumulated increase of prices in the last 12 months reached 284.4% at the end of March, while inflation in the first quarter was 11.4%, according to Reuters calculations based on official data, showing rising prices are still among the main problems affecting many families in the country.
Venezuela experienced hyperinflation until last year. Minimum wage in the country is the equivalent of $30 per month.
Inflation was pushed up in March by higher prices of communication and education services, according to the data.

The inflation's deceleration trend could be reversed following the implementation this month of a tax to operations in hard currency, a move by Maduro to boost the government's income. 
Venezuela's Finance Observatory this week reported problems to implement the tax by stores and companies, adding that the measure is creating ground for higher prices.

BEIJING (Reuters) - Activity in China's services sector contracted at the sharpest pace in two years in March as a surge in coronavirus cases restricted mobility and weighed on demand, a private sector survey showed on Wednesday.
The Caixin services Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) dived to 42.0 in March from 50.2 in February, dropping below the 50-point mark that separates growth from contraction on a monthly basis. The reading indicates the sharpest activity decline since the initial onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in February 2020.
The survey, which focuses more on small firms in coastal regions, tallied with an official survey, which also showed deterioration in the services sector.
Analysts say contact-intensive services sectors such as transportation, hotel and catering were hurt the most, clouding the outlook for a much anticipated rebound in consumption this year.
A sub-index for new business fell for a second consecutive month, and at the fastest pace since March 2020.
Firms' input prices rose in March after easing to a six-month low in February.
The virus outbreaks and softer demand reduced firms' appetite for additional staff, with the employment sub-index showing continued contraction in activity albeit at a slower pace.
While firms remained generally upbeat about output over the next year, optimism slipped to a 19-month low amid concerns over the pandemic and the economic fallout from the Ukraine war. 
Caixin's March composite PMI, which includes both manufacturing and services activity, slumped to 43.9 from 50.1 in the previous month, signalling the quickest reduction since the height of the country's COVID-19 outbreak in 2020.
""Overall, both manufacturing and services activities weakened in March due to the epidemic. Similar to previous COVID outbreaks in China, the services sector was more significantly affected than manufacturing,"" said Wang Zhe, Senior Economist at Caixin Insight Group, in a statement accompanying the data release.
""Policymakers should look out for vulnerable groups and enhance support for key industries and small and micro businesses to stabilise market expectations.""

Investing.com – China’s services sector activity fell at the sharpest pace in two years in March 2022, a private sector survey showed on Wednesday, as the country’s latest COVID-19 outbreak led to restricted mobility and weighed on demand.
The Caixin services Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) was 42, compared with the 50.2 figure from the previous month. It fell below the 50-mark separating growth from contraction in what was the sharpest activity decline since February 2020, at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic.
The  Caixin manufacturing purchasing managers index (PMI) released earlier in the week was 48.1. The manufacturing PMI was 49.5 and the non-manufacturing PMI was 48.4.
Contact-intensive services sectors such as transportation, hotel, and catering were hurt the most, which clouded the outlook for a rebound in consumption in 2022, according to analysts. The latest COVID-19 outbreaks and decreasing demand reduced firms' appetite for additional staff, in turn leading to a fall in the employment sub-index.

The Caixin China Services Purchasing Managers Index fell to 42 in March from 50.2 in February, the lowest level since the depths of the 2020 lockdown after the initial outbreak in Wuhan. The reading was below the 50-mark that separates expansion from contraction and well below the 49.7 median estimate in a survey of economists. 
Spending over the just-ended Qingming festival break, a traditional Chinese holiday where people usually visit the tombs of their ancestors, point to weak data for April as well. Domestic tourism revenue over the three-day period plunged 31% from a year ago, while delivery of packages and cinema box office sales also declined. 
The Caixin index painted an even bleaker picture than China’s official non-manufacturing purchasing managers index, which fell to 48.4 from February’s 51.6. The official survey tracks larger companies and includes the construction sector, while the Caixin survey focuses more on smaller businesses.
“Both supply and demand in the services sector contracted sharply after the latest wave of Covid outbreaks started to take off in early March,” said Wang Zhe, a senior economist at Caixin Insight Group. “Businesses grew less optimistic,” he said, with the sub-index for planned future activity hitting a 19-month low in March. 
The gauge for new business dropped to the weakest level since March 2020 while the one for new export business fell to the lowest since October 2020, according to a statement from Caixin and S&P Global (NYSE:SPGI) on Wednesday.
Lockdowns and other restrictions to curb the spread of Covid-19 show spending is still well below pre-pandemic levels. Tourism revenue over the three-day national holiday that ended Tuesday was only about 39% of the level reached during the same period in 2019, data from the Ministry of Culture and Tourism showed. 
A total of 17.5 million visits to funeral and cemetery service organizations were logged during the break, down 74% from last year, according to data from the Ministry of Civil Affairs. Many people shifted to the internet to pay their respects to their ancestors, with the number of online worships nearly tripling to 21.6 million, the figures showed. 
As a result, the number of workers employed in related sectors during the period dropped 15% on year to 1.03 million, according to the ministry.
Separate data from the Ministry of Transport showed around 53.8 million trips were made by rail, road, waterways and air during the holiday, down 62.7% from a year ago and 9.8% from the same period in 2020.
The number of packages delivered by the postal industry likely fell 12.8% year-on-year to 690 million during the holiday, the State Post Bureau said in a statement. Box office sales totaled 122 million yuan ($19.2 million), about one-seventh of the 822 million yuan recorded in the comparable period last year, according to data provided by ticketing company Maoyan.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. services industry activity picked up in March, boosted by the rollback of pandemic restrictions, but higher prices for fuel and other commodities because of Russia's war against Ukraine are creating uncertainty for many businesses.
The Institute for Supply Management's survey on Tuesday showed capacity constraints and inflation remained major challenges, though the labor crunch had eased. According to Anthony Nieves, chair of the ISM Services Business Survey Committee, the Russia-Ukraine war ""has impacted material costs, most notably fuel and chemical prices.""
""The services sector is entering the second quarter on strong footing, but two risks continue to cloud the near-term outlook,"" said Bernard Yaros, an economist at Moody's (NYSE:MCO) Analytics in West Chester, Pennsylvania. ""The first is Russia's invasion of Ukraine and the second risk remains COVID-19."" 
The ISM said its non-manufacturing activity index rebounded to a reading of 58.3 last month from a one-year low of 56.5 in February, ending three straight monthly declines. It also signaled a shift in spending back to services from goods.
COVID-19 restrictions have been lifted across the country following a massive decline in infections, unleashing pent-up demand for services like airline travel and dining out. But COVID-19 cases are rising in Europe and China. 
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the non-manufacturing index would rise to 58.4. A reading above 50 indicates expansion in the services sector, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity.

Prices for commodities like oil, wheat and fertilizer have surged since Russia's Feb. 24 invasion of Ukraine.
Seventeen services industries reported growth, including educational services, arts, entertainment and recreation, as well as utilities, construction, wholesale trade and accommodation and food services. Only agriculture, forestry, fishing and hunting reported a decline.
Businesses in the industry said that ""grain and fertilizer prices are near all-time highs, resulting in decreased purchasing."" In the construction sector there were complaints that ""pricing pressures are stronger than ever due to the Russia-Ukraine war, and energy costs are skyrocketing."" 
Businesses in the utilities industry reported they were ""still seeing raw material subcomponent shortages, transportation delays and price increases."" Similar views were shared by their counterparts in the wholesale trade sector who said inflation was worsening, but noted that ""overall sales and profitability continue to be strong.""
The ISM's measure of new orders received by services businesses rebounded to a reading of 60.1 from a 12-month low of 56.1 in February. 
Its services industry employment gauge jumped to 54.0 after dropping to a 1-1/2-year low of 48.5 February, which also was the first contraction in the sub-index since January 2021. 
The improvement in labor supply was confirmed by March's employment report on Friday, which showed nonfarm payrolls increased by 431,000 jobs last month.
Despite the increase in hiring, services industries made little headway in reducing the backlog of unfinished work. 
That meant services inflation pushed higher. The survey's measure of prices paid by services industries increased to a near record 83.8 from 83.1 in February, indicating that inflation could remain uncomfortably high and elicit an aggressive response from the Federal Reserve. 
The U.S. central bank last month raised its policy interest rate by 25 basis points, the first hike in more than three years. On Tuesday, Fed Governor Lael Brainard told a conference at the Minneapolis Fed that ""I think we can all absolutely agree inflation is too high and bringing inflation down is of paramount importance.""
Stocks on Wall Street were trading lower. The dollar rose against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices fell.
RECORD TRADE DEFICIT
Surging commodity prices because of the Russia-Ukraine war were evident in a separate report from the Commerce Department, which showed the U.S. trade deficit held at a record high of $89.2 billion in February as both exports and imports increased.
The report added to recent data that showed a moderation in consumer and business spending in suggesting the economy slowed considerably last quarter amid the high inflation triggered by shortages. Economists had forecast a $88.5 billion deficit. 
Trade balance: https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-STOCKS/mopanbbeyva/tradebalance.png 
Exports of goods and services shot up 1.8% to a record $228.6 billion. They were boosted by a 1.8% jump in goods exports, which also hit an all-time high. Petroleum exports hit a record high of $20.3 billion amid soaring crude oil prices.
Exports of consumer goods rose $1.3 billion. But capital goods exports dropped amid a decline in civilian aircraft.
Exports to Ukraine hit a record high, likely reflecting shipments of military equipment. Exports of services increased $1.3 billion to $69.9 billion, lifted by a $1.2 billion rise in travel. 
Imports of goods and services jumped 1.3% to an all-time high of $317.8 billion. Imports of goods gained 0.6% to a record $266.2 billion. Imports of industrial supplies and materials were the highest since June 2011. They were fueled by a $1.9 billion surge in crude oil, which averaged $76.37 per barrel, the highest since November 2014.
Imports of both capital and consumer goods hit record highs. Imports of services rose $2.4 billion to $51.6 billion, reflecting increases in charges for the use of intellectual property, transport and travel.
The surge in imports is being fueled by businesses rebuilding inventories, the main driver of gross domestic product growth in the fourth quarter.

""While much of the strength of imports appears to reflect inventory rebuilding, which would normally provide an offsetting boost to growth, the record-setting pace of restocking at the end of last year means that inventories also look set to be an additional drag in the first quarter,"" said Andrew Hunter, a senior U.S. economist at Capital Economics.
Trade has subtracted from gross domestic product growth for six straight quarters. Growth estimates for the first quarter range from as low as a 0.4% annualized rate to as high as a 2.8% pace. The economy grew at a 6.9% pace in the fourth quarter.

OTTAWA (Reuters) -Canada's exports rose 2.8% in February to a record high, driven mostly by energy products, while imports climbed 3.9% from the previous month, data from Statistics Canada showed on Tuesday, with economists anticipating more gains for exports ahead. 
The country's trade surplus with the world narrowed to C$2.66 billion ($2.14 billion), below analyst forecasts of C$2.9 billion. But exports came in above expectations at C$58.75 billion, with imports at C$56.08 billion.
Statscan also said border blockades in February by anti-vaccine mandate protesters had little impact on overall trade activity, with most road shipments rerouted.
""Canada's trade balance narrowed slightly in February as imports recovered from the previous month's weakness. However, the bigger story is the recent string of surpluses supported by strength in energy prices,"" Shelly Kaushik, an economist at BMO Economics, said in a note.
""Looking ahead, a further surge in commodity prices will continue to buoy exports in March."" 
Energy exports rose 7.8% to a record high, making up more than two-thirds of the total increase, while exports of non-energy products were up 1.2%. In volume terms, exports were up 0.6%. 
""Exports of crude oil contributed the most to the growth in February 2022, largely due to higher prices,"" Statscan said. 
Oil prices were climbing even before Russia invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24 and have since surged. Canada is the world's fourth-largest producer of oil.
The crisis also has pushed up imports, with Canada's imports of fertilizers, pesticides and other chemicals hitting a record high. Statscan pointed to lower production in China and quotas on fertilizer exports from Russia as contributing factors.
""These events create uncertainty about the availability and the cost of these products, resulting in atypical movements for Canadian fertilizer imports,"" it said.
With imports expected to drop back in March and commodity exports to benefit from rising prices, the surplus is likely to widen in coming months, analysts said.
""By our estimates, the terms of trade is now the most favorable on record and points to an improvement in the goods trade surplus to as high as C$6.0 billion,"" Stephen Brown, senior Canada economist at Capital Economics, said in a note.

""It remains to be seen how much of that extra income will find its way into the rest of the economy,"" he added. 
The Canadian dollar was trading 0.6% higher at 1.2410 to the greenback, or 80.58 U.S. cents.

The Institute for Supply Management said on Tuesday its non-manufacturing activity index rebounded to a reading of 58.3 last month from a one-year low of 56.5 in February. That ended three straight months of declines in the index and also signaled a shift in spending back to services from goods.
COVID-19 restrictions have been lifted across the country following a massive decline in coronavirus infections, unleashing pent-up demand for services like airline travel and dining out. The government reported last week that consumer spending on services increased by the most in seven months in February, while goods outlays declined.

Its services industry employment gauge jumped to 54.0 after dropping to a 1-1/2-year low of 48.5 February, which also was the first contraction in the sub-index since January 2021. 
The strong demand for labor was confirmed by March's employment report on Friday, which showed nonfarm payrolls increased by 431,000 jobs last month.
Despite the increase in hiring, services industries made little headway in reducing the backlog of unfinished work, indicating that shortages remained binding. 
Russia's war against Ukraine is worsening global supply constraints. Prices for commodities like oil and wheat have surged since the Feb. 24 invasion of Ukraine.
The ISM survey's measure of order backlogs at services businesses edged up to 64.5 last month after surging to 64.2 in February. Its gauge of supplier deliveries slipped to a still-high reading of 63.4 from 66.2 in February. A reading above 50 indicates slower deliveries. 

That meant services inflation pushed higher. The survey's measure of prices paid by services industries increased to 83.8 from 83.1 in February, indicating that inflation could remain uncomfortably high and elicit an aggressive response from the Federal Reserve. 
The U.S. central bank last month raised its policy interest rate by 25 basis points, the first hike in more than three years. Policymakers have been ratcheting up their hawkish rhetoric, with Fed Chair Jerome Powell saying the U.S. central bank must move ""expeditiously"" to hike rates and possibly ""more aggressively"" to keep high inflation from becoming entrenched.

The February gap in goods and services trade was little changed at $89.2 billion after a record shortfall in January, Commerce Department data showed Tuesday. The median estimate in a Bloomberg survey of economists called for a $88.5 billion February shortfall. The figures aren’t adjusted for prices. 
The value of imports rose 1.3% in February to a record $317.8 billion and exports climbed 1.8% to $228.6 billion.
Services imports increased by $2.4 billion to a record $51.6 billion, with about half of the rise coming from the biggest monthly increase in charges for use of intellectual property since 2016. That probably reflects a temporary boost from rights fees to broadcast the winter Olympics, consistent with such spikes in previous years.
Meantime, goods imports also rose, reflecting an increase in industrial supplies such as crude oil and chemicals that more than offset a drop in automobiles.

LONDON (Reuters) - Euro zone business growth got a boost last month from the re-opening of economies following the Omicron coronavirus variant, according to a survey which however showed soaring energy costs and Russia's invasion of Ukraine threaten the recovery.
S&P Global (NYSE:SPGI)'s final composite Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI), seen as a good guide to economic health, dipped to 54.9 in March from February's 55.5 but was ahead of a preliminary 54.5 estimate.
""March's final euro zone PMI surveys confirmed that output expectations fell sharply, with Germany experiencing the biggest drop. Meanwhile, price pressures remain intense across the currency union,"" said Jack Allen-Reynolds at Capital Economics.
Germany's services sector grew at the fastest pace in six months in March after COVID-19 restrictions were lifted, but uncertainty after Russia's invasion and accelerating inflation clouded the outlook, earlier data showed.
France's services sector also grew at a faster rate last month, but the pace slowed in Italy and Spain as the war in Ukraine weighed on demand.
In Britain, outside the European Union, services companies enjoyed stronger growth last month than first estimated despite rampant inflation pressures. [GB/PMIS]
A PMI covering the euro zone's dominant services industry nudged up to 55.6 from 55.5, beating the 54.8 flash estimate.
But the rate of growth in overall demand fell and export orders, which include orders made between member nations, declined as firms jacked up their prices to compensate for a record increase in input costs.
Inflation in the currency union was a record high of 7.5% in March, official data showed last week, and with the services output prices PMI at 62.6 - the highest since the survey began in mid-1998 - it is likely to rise further.
That adds pressure on the European Central Bank to rein in runaway prices, even though growth is likely to slow sharply.

The intensifying cost of living crisis, alongside renewed supply chain bottlenecks following Russia's invasion, put a big dent in optimism. The composite future output index slumped to 59.1 from 68.9, its lowest since October 2020.
""The sharp declines in the future output PMIs tell us that firms think that the worst is yet to come,"" Allen-Reynolds said.

S&P Global (NYSE:SPGI)'s Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) of activity in the services sector, which accounts for around half of Spain's economic output, fell to 53.4 from 56.6 in February. The index was still well above the 50 mark that separates growth from contraction.
While businesses were buoyed by the fading effects of the coronavirus pandemic, a truckers strike and uncertainty related to Russia's invasion of Ukraine weighed on activity.
""Firms reported that clients were more cautious and a little hesitant in their decision-making,"" S&P Global's economist Paul Smith said in a report.
Still, activity encouraged companies to hire more. ""Despite this relatively gloomy backdrop - which hurt general confidence - firms still faced capacity constraints, seeking to recruit additional staff wherever possible,"" he said.

The slowdown in the third month of the quarter is a bad sign after quarterly economic growth in the fourth quarter had slowed to 2.2% from 2.6% in the previous three months.
The Spanish government is due to update its growth target for this year from the current 7% after last year's post-pandemic recovery undershot its goal at 5.1%.

The S&P Global (NYSE:SPGI) purchasing managers' index (PMI) slid to 38.1 in March from 52.1 the previous month, sliding well below the 50 mark that separates expansion from contraction.
Inflationary pressure intensified in March. Firms in the services sector registered a series-record rise in output charges, and the rate of cost inflation also reached its highest since the survey began in October 2001.
The companies that took part in the monthly survey also reported a drop in domestic and foreign customer demand, while employment levels fell at their sharpest pace since June 2020.
""Reduced staffing numbers also reflected subdued business confidence, as expectations regarding the year-ahead outlook slumped to their lowest in two years,"" S&P Global said in the PMI report.
Output expectations across the Russian service sector fell as firms expected to see a decline in activity in the coming year, the survey showed.
""Pessimism reportedly stemmed from greater economic and geopolitical uncertainty,"" the PMI report said.

The survey did not mention Russia sending tens of thousands of troops into Ukraine on Feb. 24 or the wide-reaching economic sanctions imposed on Moscow after that.
A sister survey showed last week that Russian manufacturing activity also shrank in March at its fastest pace since the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic in May 2020.

The headline seasonally adjusted S&P Global (NYSE:SPGI) Saudi Arabia Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) for the whole economy rose to 56.8 in March from 56.2 in February, exactly in line with the series average since August 2009.
""The Saudi Arabia PMI continued to signal strong growth in the non-oil economy in March, as new business and activity rose sharply in line with recovering client demand,"" wrote David Owen, economist at survey compiler S&P Global.
""Supply chains also displayed strength, with lead times shortening to the greatest extent for three years. In turn, companies raised their purchasing at the fastest rate since December 2017, supporting higher capacity levels.""
The output sub-index rose to 62.4 from 60.4 in February, above the series average of 61.4. New orders also rose and new export orders returned to growth after two months of contraction.
Sentiment regarding output over the next 12 months remained in growth territory, though less so than in February and below historical trends. About 14% of respondents expected higher output in the next year.
The employment sub-index dipped below the 50.0 mark into contraction territory for the first time in a year.
""Sector-level data indicated that reductions in staffing at construction and wholesale & retail firms contrasted with expansions in services and manufacturing,"" the PMI report said.

Cost pressures in the kingdom increased in March as already high commodity prices turned volatile following Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Staff wages also increased, though marginally.
""Rising petrol and raw material prices greatly added to firms' expenses sheets. However, with sales also improving, businesses were able to increase their output prices accordingly - both costs and charges rose at the strongest rates since August 2020,"" Owen said.

76,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 04, 2022 09:20PM ET</span>",Japan's household spending up but price rises weigh on outlook,"By Daniel Leussink
TOKYO (Reuters) -Japan's household spending rose for a second consecutive month year-on-year in February, helped by a flattering comparison with last year's sharp pandemic-induced slump but the consumer sector is now facing growing headwinds from soaring prices.
Households cut spending from the previous month as pandemic curbs, rapid food and fuel price rises and the coronavirus kept wallets shut, casting a shadow over the world's third-largest economy.
In a sign of trouble for consumer sentiment, real wage growth stagnated in February as global inflationary pressures weighed on household purchasing power.
""Prices will outpace wage gains from now on, so consumption will be on a sluggish trend,"" said Takeshi Minami, chief economist at Norinchukin Research Institute.
""While service spending is expected to pick up from April onwards, the likelihood is big that higher prices will weigh on other areas of consumption,"" Minami said, adding that spending was likely to pick up nonetheless.
Household spending increased 1.1% in February from a year earlier, government data showed, much weaker than the market forecast of a 2.7% gain in a Reuters poll.
The month-on-month figures showed a sharp 2.8% decline, also weaker than a forecast 1.5% drop.
The data raises some concerns for policymakers looking for ways to offset the hit households are taking from soaring global inflation and a weakening yen, which is pushing up import costs, as the economy shakes off the pandemic's drag.
Households increased spending on mobile phones as well as car insurance and parts such as batteries on pent-up demand due to price hikes, a government official said.
But slower spending on eating out, including on sushi, weighed on expenditures, as authorities prolonged pandemic curbs in response to a wave of Omicron infections during the month.
A separate survey showed that Japan's services sector activity continued to shrink in March, though the pace of contraction slowed as domestic demand got a lift from the subsequent easing of the pandemic curbs last month.

Other government data on Tuesday showed inflation-adjusted real wages hit a standstill in February, as growth of consumer prices offset gains in nominal wage growth.
The economy is projected to grow in the current quarter following an expected contraction in the first three months of the year, though it is facing an unpredictable outlook in part due to the Ukraine situation and the weak yen.

77,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 04, 2022 11:26AM ET</span>","Transportation equipment, machinery pull down U.S. factory orders in February","By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - New orders for U.S.-made goods fell in February, likely because of persistent shortages of materials and a shift in spending back to services, but manufacturing remains supported by low inventories at businesses.
The Commerce Department said on Monday that factory orders fell 0.5% in February. Data for January was revised slightly higher to show orders rising 1.5% instead of 1.4% as previously reported. February's decrease in factory orders was in line with economists' expectations.
Manufacturing accounts for 12% of the U.S. economy. An Institute for Supply Management (ISM) survey last Friday showed its index of national factory activity declined in March to the lowest level since September 2020, with factories reporting no let-up in supply chain challenges.
The global supply crunch has been worsened by Russia's war against Ukraine, which has sent prices for commodities like oil and wheat soaring. Though demand is reverting back to services, business inventories remain lean, which should keep factories humming. Government data last week showed that consumer spending on services increased by the most in seven months in February.
The decline in factory orders in February was led by a 5.3% tumble in transportation equipment. Orders for motor vehicles and parts fell 0.6%, likely reflecting an ongoing global semiconductor shortage, which has hampered production. 
There were also sharp decreases in orders for machinery as well as computers and electronic products. But orders for electrical equipment, appliances and components rose 0.6%. Orders for furniture and related products rebounded 2.7%. 
Shipments of manufactured goods rose 0.6% after advancing 1.4% in January. Inventories at factories climbed 0.6%. Unfilled orders gained 0.4% after increasing 0.9% in the prior month.

The Commerce Department also reported that orders for non-defense capital goods, excluding aircraft, which are seen as a measure of business spending plans on equipment, slipped 0.2% instead of 0.3% as previously reported last month.
Shipments of these so-called core capital goods, which are used to calculate business equipment spending in the gross domestic product report, rose 0.3% in February instead of the previously reported 0.5%.

ISTANBUL (Reuters) -Turkey's annual consumer inflation leapt to a 20-year high of 61.14% in March, data showed on Monday, fuelled by rising energy and commodity prices as the fallout of the Russia-Ukraine conflict compounds the impact of the lira's plunge last year.
Inflation has surged since last autumn, when the lira slumped after the central bank (CBRT) launched a 500 basis-point easing cycle sought by President Tayyip Erdogan.
Month-on-month consumer prices rose 5.46%, the Statistical Institute said, just below a Reuters poll forecast of 5.7%. The annual consumer price inflation forecast was 61.5%.
""CBRT policies are just not working in countering inflation,"" said Tim Ash at BlueBay Asset Management. ""Indeed, I think the overwhelming consensus is that the unorthodox policy settings of the CBRT are a major cause of inflation.
""The war in Ukraine is just making things that much worse,"" Ash added, nothing the bank had not hit its annual inflation target of 5% since 2011.
The data had little impact on the lira, which weakened 0.15% to 14.715 against the dollar. The local currency tumbled 44% in 2021 and another 10% this year.
TRADE DEFICIT BALLOONS
The government has said inflation will fall to single digits next year under its new economic programme - prioritising low interest rates to boost production and exports - aimed a achieving a current account surplus.
However, data on Monday showed the trade deficit widened 77% year-on-year in March to $8.24 billion, with a 156% increase in the value of energy imports, threatening to derail the current account goal.
Haluk Burumcekci, founder of Burumcekci Consulting, said inflation could peak at 70%-75% even if the lira does not weaken from its current level, only falling with the base effect in the last months of the year.
""It will not at all be easy for the CBRT to maintain its loose monetary policy stance,"" he said.
Consumer price inflation was driven by transportation, including petrol prices, and education prices, which rose 13.29% and 6.55% respectively. Rising energy prices have drawn public protests in recent months.
Annually, transportation prices rose 99.12% and food and non-alcoholic drink prices were up 70.33%.
Economists marked up inflation expectations globally following Russia's invasion of Ukraine, with energy prices hitting multi-year highs as the West sanctioned Moscow. Turkey imports almost all of its energy needs.

The Reuters poll forecast year-end inflation of 52.2%, up from 38% in last month's poll.
Producer prices climbed 9.19% in March, or 114.97% annually.

(Reuters) - Spain's labour market withstood soaring inflation and a crippling truckers' strike in March to see a drop in unemployment, data showed on Monday, helped in part by reforms aimed at cutting the use of temporary contracts.
The number of people registering as jobless in Spain slipped 0.09% in March from February, or by 2,921 people, leaving 3.11 million people out of work, Labour Ministry data showed.
Spain added 23,998 net jobs during the month, a 0.12% rise from February.
The number of people enrolled in social security programmes in seasonally adjusted terms hit 19.96 million, the highest in the historical series, after eleven months of consecutive growth, the Social Security Ministry said in a separate report.
Spain has long had high unemployment, largely due to the ease with which employers can fire staff in a market in which almost a quarter of jobs are held under temporary contracts. February's 12.6% unemployment rate was still the European Union's highest, according to Eurostat.
The government passed a labour reform in December as part of commitments to receive EU recovery funds that limits the legal use of temporary contracts and promotes employment protection schemes such as furloughs to avoid permanent layoffs.
In March, 1.7 million new job contracts were signed in Spain, of which a third were permanent, an increase of 148% over March 2021, according to Labour Ministry data.
""Despite the difficult times in which we find ourselves, unemployment in March has fallen by 2,921 people and we reached the highest number of permanent contracts in the historical series,"" tweeted Labour Minister Yolanda Diaz.

""Since December, the percentage of permanent contracts as a percentage of total contracts has tripled.""
Consumer prices spiked 9.8% in March in Spain, pushed up by energy and fresh food, after the country suffered two weeks of transport workers' strikes that brought factories to a halt and emptied supermarket shelves.

Sentix's index for the euro zone fell to -18.0 in April from -7.0 the previous month, hitting its lowest level since July 2020. A Reuters poll had pointed to a reading of -9.2. 
A current conditions index fell to -5.5 from 7.8, its lowest level since April last year, while an expectations index fell to -29.8 from -20.8, its lowest level since December 2011.
While the dip in March's morale had been expected due to the start of the war in Ukraine, the strong fall in sentiment in April once again puts investors on the back foot, said Sentix. 
The conflict and related sanctions and uncertainties are pushing the euro zone economy towards a recession, it added.
""Investors do not expect that the central bank can rush to the rescue with a more relaxed, more expansive monetary policy because of the still considerable pace of inflation growth.""
Sentix said morale was dropping globally although nowhere as sharply as in the euro zone.

""No region is able to resist the negative momentum at the moment, even the important Asian region is already fighting stagnation,"" it said.
Sentix surveyed 1,249 investors from March 31 to April 2.

BENGALURU (Reuters) - India's factory activity expanded at a slower pace in March as rising prices meant new orders and output grew at their weakest rate since September, according to a survey released on Monday that also showed optimism at a two-year low. 
The survey provides the latest evidence the recovery in Asia's third-largest economy is slowing. Hikes in oil prices, primarily driven by uncertainties around the Russia-Ukraine war, have already taken a toll on consumer spending - the biggest contributor to GDP growth. 
Compiled by S&P Global (NYSE:SPGI), the Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index declined to 54.0 in March from 54.9 in February. However, it has remained above the 50-level separating growth from contraction for nine straight months. 
Despite that decline, the sector had its best annual fiscal year performance since FY 2011/12. 
""Manufacturing sector growth in India weakened at the end of fiscal year 2021/22, with companies reporting softer expansions in new orders and production,"" noted Pollyanna De Lima, economics associate director at S&P Global. 
""The slowdown was accompanied by an intensification of inflationary pressures, although the rate of increase in input costs remained below those seen towards the end of 2021."" 
Sub-indexes tracking new orders and output were at six-month lows and foreign demand contracted for the first time since June 2021, highlighting a weakening global economic recovery and a slowdown in China. 
But factories increased headcount for the first time in four months. 
Still, rising cost pressures remained one of the main concerns as firms faced a faster increase in input prices last month, forcing them to transfer some of that burden to consumers. Output prices rose at the quickest rate in five months. 

""For now, demand has been sufficiently strong to withstand price hikes, but should inflation continue to gather pace we may see a more significant slowdown, if not an outright contraction in sales,"" added De Lima. ""Companies themselves appeared very concerned about price pressures, which was a key factor dragging down business confidence to a two-year low."" 
Like other major economies, India is experiencing a persistent surge in inflation due to elevated supply disruptions and a jump in oil prices - the biggest component of the country's imports.

BRASILIA (Reuters) - Brazil posted a record trade surplus for March, of $7.4 billion, official data showed on Friday, but the number was well below market forecasts amid expectations that exports would rise as commodity prices spike. 
Economists projected a $9.01 billion surplus for the month, according to a Reuters poll. 
Exports were up 25% over March last year to $29.1 billion, a record for any given month. But imports rose further, by 27.1%, to $21.7 billion, the Economy Ministry reported.
In both cases, rising prices guided the results.
While the volume of imported products dropped 7.1% compared with the same month last year, prices gained 29.5%. The volume of exported goods increased 1.8%, while prices grew 17.2% in March.
In the first quarter, Brazil's trade surplus was $11.3 billion, up from $8.1 billion in the same period last year.
For 2022, the Economy Ministry updated its forecast to a trade surplus of $111.6 billion, much higher than the $79.4 billion estimated before, on the back of a surge in goods sold abroad
The outlook for exports was revised up to $348.8 billion in 2022, compared with a January projection of $284.3 billion. 
""The conflict between Russia and Ukraine led to higher prices and generates expectations of higher exported value,"" said the under secretary for foreign trade intelligence and statistics, Herlon Brandao.

Brazil is a major exporter of soybeans, iron ore, pulp, sugar, beef and crude petroleum.
The ministry estimated that imports will total $237.2 billion this year, up from $204.9 billion seen previously.

84,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 01, 2022 03:31PM ET</span>",COVID weighing less and less on the U.S. job market,"By Howard Schneider and Dan Burns
(Reuters) - The coronavirus pandemic's grip on the U.S. job market notably loosened in March, two years after a state of emergency was declared, as the number of people homebound by COVID-19 concerns hit a new low and fewer people reported having to work remotely. 
In all, the government's benchmark monthly nonfarm payrolls report out Friday showed that by several metrics - including the total number of unemployed dropping below 6 million and a 3.6% unemployment rate - the U.S. job market had all but recovered from the devastating hit delivered in the first two months of the pandemic when 22 million people were thrown out of work.
The main report and a supplemental survey illustrated the pandemic's rapidly waning restraint and dovetailed with recent health data showing the fewest new infections since July and hospitalizations over the last week averaging the lowest since the initial surge in March and April 2020.
""There are still challenges,"" Labor Secretary Marty Walsh said in an interview. But ""you can almost feel the mood of the country changing.""

A litany of data points painted an employment picture redolent of February 2020, then heralded as one of the strongest job markets of the post-World War Two era. Among them:
* The workforce participation rate of women aged 25-54, which has experienced an uneven recovery, jumped by the most since June 2020, seven-tenths of a percentage point. Now at 76.5%, it is just four-tenths of a point from where it was before the pandemic.
* The broadest measure of unemployment also capturing those marginally attached to the workforce or working part time for economic reasons fell to 6.9%, below February 2020's level and a fraction from a record low.
* Overall employment climbed to just 1% below its pre-pandemic level, but minority groups have more than fully recovered: Total employment among Blacks, Hispanics and Asians now surpasses February 2020 levels. 
Graphic: Employment recovery by race https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-ECONOMY/UNEMPLOYMENT/znvnexbyepl/chart.png 
The report also showed the disease itself having its smallest impact on worker behavior since the pandemic began.
Just 874,000 people were reported to have not sought work in the previous four weeks because of COVID-19, down from 1.23 million in February and 1.81 million in January when the Omicron variant drove U.S. infections to a record. 
In May 2020 - the first month the Bureau of Labor Statistics launched its supplemental survey on the pandemic's effects on the job market - some 9.7 million people had not looked for work because of the coronavirus outbreak.
""People feel more comfortable going back to work,"" Walsh said. ""More people (are) shopping. Hospitality and leisure are really benefiting."" 
Graphic: COVID-19 kept fewer from seeking work https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-ECONOMY/COVID/klvykjbzovg/chart.png 
And just 10% of those people with a job said they either teleworked or worked from home because of COVID-19, a figure representing about 15.8 million workers. That is also a pandemic-era low and is roughly a third of the number reporting the need to work remotely in May 2020. 
""I don’t know what the new normal will be, but it is a good sign to get more people into the workforce,"" Walsh said. The challenge in coming months is that ""we are going to start running out of people,"" a fact he said should make efforts to increase immigration a priority.

In conversations with employers ""nobody has said to me that is a bad idea.""

85,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 01, 2022 02:56PM ET</span>",U.S. unemployment rate drops to 3.6% as labor market rapidly tightens,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. employers maintained a brisk pace of hiring in March, driving the unemployment rate to a new two-year low of 3.6% while also boosting wages, resulting in a further tightening of labor market conditions and opening the door to a hefty 50 basis points interest rate hike from the Federal Reserve in May.
The Labor Department's closely watched employment report on Friday also showed more people joining the workforce, likely attracted by the higher wages. Employment in professional and business services, financial activities and retail sectors is now above pre-pandemic levels. 
The 11th straight month of job gains in excess of 400,000 underscored the economy's resilience even as growth appears to have slowed considerably in the first quarter under the weight of high inflation amid snarled supply chains.
""Despite concerns about inflation and the Russia-Ukraine war, American businesses are still hiring at full throttle, while more people are returning to the labor force,"" said Sal Guatieri, a senior economist at BMO Capital Markets in Toronto.
""That's great news for the economy. However, the labor market is only getting tighter and wages are on a clear upward track, fanning the inflation flames. The Fed has every reason to go big or go home on May 4.""
The survey of establishments showed that nonfarm payrolls increased by 431,000 jobs last month. The economy created 95,000 more jobs in January and February than initially estimated. 
Nonfarm payrolls https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-STOCKS/movanbdwmpa/nfpr.png
Overall employment is now 1.6 million jobs below its pre-pandemic level, with many economists predicting all the jobs lost will be recouped by July. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast payrolls increasing 490,000 in March. Estimates ranged from as low as 200,000 to as high as 700,000.
Worker demand is being driven by a sharp decline in COVID-19 infections, which has resulted in restrictions being lifted across the country. There is no sign yet that the Russia-Ukraine war, which has pushed gasoline prices above $4 per gallon, has impacted the labor market.
President Joe Biden welcomed the upbeat report saying more people working could help to ease the pressure on supply chains.
""That's good news for fighting inflation,"" Biden said. ""It is good news for our economy, and it means that our economy has gone from being on the mend to being on the move."" 
The broad increase in payrolls was led by the leisure and hospitality industry, which added 112,000 jobs. Professional and business services payrolls increased by 102,000 jobs, hoisting employment in the sector 723,000 above its pre-pandemic level.
Retailers added 49,000, pushing the level of employment 278,000 higher than in February 2020.
Jobs by industry Jobs by industry https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-FED/INDUSTRY/qmypmdoolvr/chart.png
Financial activities employment grew by 16,000 and is now 41,000 above its pre-pandemic level. Manufacturing payrolls increased by 38,000 jobs and is yet to recoup all the jobs lost during the pandemic. Construction employment is now back at its pre-pandemic level, with 19,000 jobs added in March.
Stocks on Wall Street were lower. The dollar gained versus a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury yields rose, with the closely watched yield curve between two-year and 10-year notes inverting for the third time this week amid concerns that tight monetary policy could tip the economy into recession.
The Fed last month raised its policy interest rate by 25 basis points, the first hike in more than three years. Policymakers have been ratcheting up their hawkish rhetoric, with Fed Chair Jerome Powell saying the U.S. central bank must move ""expeditiously"" to hike rates and possibly ""more aggressively"" to keep high inflation from becoming entrenched.
RECORD JOB OPENINGS
With a near record 11.3 million job openings on the last day of February, payrolls growth could remain strong this year.
Job gains averaged 562,000 per month in the first quarter. But inflation is eating into growth, with gross domestic product estimates for the January-March quarter mostly below a 1.0% annualized rate, a sharp slowdown from the fourth quarter's brisk 6.9% pace.
Annual inflation rose in February by the most in 40 years. Despite the anxiety in the bond market, economists expect the expansion to continue. 
Many viewed the Fed's massive holdings of Treasuries and mortgage-backed securities as distorting the yield curve moves.
Some noted that real yields remained negative, while others argued that the two-year/five-year Treasury yield curve was a better indicator of a future recession. This segment has not inverted.
""The amazingly strong job gains this year point to a solid economy,"" said Joel Naroff, chief economist at Naroff Economics in Holland, Pennsylvania. ""What we are likely seeing is a deceleration back toward more normal levels of growth after having posted clearly unsustainable robust numbers.""  
The labor pool continued to steadily expand in March.
The household survey, from which the unemployment rate is derived, showed 418,000 entered the labor force last month. About 249,000 women, 20 years of age and older, joined the workforce. That was more than offset by a 736,000 surge in household employment. 
As result, the unemployment rate dropped two-tenths of a percentage point to 3.6%, the lowest since February 2020.
Unemployment declined for all race groups, with a large decline among Blacks. The labor force participation rate, or the proportion of working-age Americans who have a job or are looking for one, rose to a two-year high of 62.4% from 62.3% in February. The participation rate for the prime age group also rose to a two-year high of 82.5% from 82.2% in February.
Labor market participation https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-STOCKS/xmvjoqenmpr/participation.png
According to a report from global outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas on Thursday, the skyrocketing cost of living was ""causing workers who were depending on savings or investments to seek out paid employment.""

There was a significant reduction in those experiencing long spells of unemployment as well as those being unable to work because of the pandemic. 
With workers still scarce, average hourly earnings increased 0.4% after edging up 0.1% in February. That lifted the annual increase to 5.6% from 5.2% in February. But the workweek shortened to 34.6 hours from 34.7 hours in February.

86,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 01, 2022 11:41AM ET</span>","Mexico's factories contract for 25th straight month, inflation rises","MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexico's manufacturing sector contracted for the 25th month in a row in March, amid rising inflation, global shortages of materials, and economic uncertainty due to the pandemic and the war in Ukraine, a survey showed on Friday. 
The seasonally adjusted S&P Global (NYSE:SPGI) Mexico Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index rose to 49.2 in March, from 48.0 in February, below the 50 threshold that separates growth from contraction.
The upward movement in the PMI reflected slower reductions in new orders, stocks of purchases and employment, as well as a sharper deterioration in supplier performance, the survey said.
The index has remained below the 50-mark since March 2020, and plummeted to 35.0 in April 2020 during the initial lockdown phase of the coronavirus pandemic, in what was by far the lowest reading in the survey's 11 year history.
""With Mexico's manufacturing industry stuck in contraction and inflationary pressures mounting, the latest results ring alarm bells for policymakers,"" said Pollyanna De Lima, economics associate director at S&P Global.
Companies polled in the survey reported a fall in production volumes and input costs rose sharply.
""PMI data showed the second-sharpest increase in input costs in the 11-year survey history, which companies often linked to raw material scarcity, the pandemic and Russia's war against Ukraine,"" said De Lima.

Those surveyed remained optimistic about future output, even as overall confidence was dampened by inflation concerns, raw material scarcity and the war.
The combination of ongoing interest rate hikes and acute price pressures is likely to curtail business investment and consumption, making it more difficult for the economy to recover, De Lima said.

The Andean country's consumer prices rose 1.48% last month, the highest since the 1.53% seen in February 1996, according to historical data provided by the Peruvian central bank.
In the first quarter of 2022, consumer prices in the Lima metropolitan region - which are seen as the national benchmark - stood at 1.84%, the government's statistics agency said.

The National Institute of Statistics and Information also said that Peru's inflation in the past 12 months now stands at 6.82%, well above the central bank's annual target of 1% to 3%.
In 2021, the South American country - the world's No. 2 copper producer - posted an annual inflation of 6.43%, the highest rate in 13 years.

88,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 01, 2022 10:11AM ET</span>",U.S. manufacturing sector activity slows in March; input prices surge - ISM,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. manufacturing activity unexpectedly slowed in March as tight supply chains continued to drive input prices higher, but factories boosted hiring, allowing them to reduce the backlog of unfinished work.
The Institute for Supply Management (ISM) said on Friday that its index of national factory activity fell to a reading of 57.1 last month from 58.6 in February. 
A reading above 50 indicates expansion in manufacturing, which accounts for 11.9% of the U.S. economy. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the index rising to 59.0.
The slowdown in manufacturing also reflects a shift in spending back to services amid a significant decline in COVID-19 infections, which has resulted in the rolling back of restrictions across the country. Government data on Thursday showed consumer spending on services increasing by the most in seven months in February, while goods outlays declined.
The ISM survey's forward-looking new orders sub-index fell to 53.8 last month from 61.7 in February. Goods spending surged as the pandemic curbed demand for services like travel. Even as spending reverts back to services, manufacturing should remain underpinned by very low inventories. Customer inventories have remained extremely lean for more than 60 months. 
Russia's war against Ukraine, which has boosted prices of oil, wheat and other commodities, likely slowed the improvement in the global supply chains. 
The ISM survey's measure of supplier deliveries dipped to a still-high reading of 65.4 from 66.1 in February. A reading above 50% indicates slower deliveries to factories. 
That kept inflation at the factory gate very hot. The survey's measure of prices paid by manufacturers increased to a reading of 87.1 from 75.6 in February. 

The Federal Reserve last month raised its policy interest rate by 25 basis points, the first hike in more than three years, and adopted a hawkish posture as it fights inflation.
The survey's measure of factory employment increased to a reading of 56.3 in March from 52.9 in February. With more workers on the floor, a gauge of unfinished work at factories fell to 60.0 from a reading of 65.0 in February.

The S&P Global (NYSE:SPGI) Canada Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) rose to a seasonally adjusted 58.9 in March from 56.6 in February, posting its highest level in the 11-year history of the survey. A reading above 50 shows growth in the sector.
""Canada's manufacturing sector again enjoyed a bustling month of trading in March,"" Shreeya Patel, an economist at S&P Global said in a statement. ""Key to growth were robust uplifts in output, new orders and purchases.""
The output index rose to its highest level since March last year and the measure of new orders climbed as well.
Higher sales were attributed by manufacturers in part to the relaxation of pandemic restrictions, S&P Global said. Ontario, Canada's most populous province, dropped its mask mandate in most locations last week.
Still, concerns over input shortages and delivery delays led to record levels of stockpiling, while the input price index jumped to a survey-record high of 78.6 from 70.1.

""With demand showing no signs of letting up and the knock-on effects of the war in Ukraine, we can expect to see prices rising at elevated rates for at least the duration of the year,"" Patel said.
Western sanctions imposed on Russia over its invasion of Ukraine have disrupted oil supplies, driving prices higher. Moscow calls its Ukraine action a ""special military operation"".

90,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 01, 2022 09:43AM ET</span>","Euro zone inflation hits new peak, deepening ECB's dilemma","By Balazs Koranyi
FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Euro zone inflation surged to 7.5% in March, hitting another record high with months still left before it is set to peak, raising pressure on the European Central Bank to rein in runaway prices even as growth slows sharply. 
Consumer price growth in the 19 countries sharing the euro accelerated from 5.9% in February, Eurostat said on Friday, far beyond the 6.6% expected, as war in Ukraine and sanctions on Russia pushed fuel and natural gas prices to record highs. 
Although energy was the chief culprit, inflation in food prices, services and durable goods all came in above the ECB's 2% target, further proof that price growth is increasingly broad and not merely a reflection of expensive oil. 
With the ECB having persistently underestimated inflation over the past year, the figure will come as a shock to policymakers, some of whom are already calling for tighter policy to avoid high price growth becoming entrenched. 
""The inflation data speak for themselves,"" Joachim Nagel, president of the German Bundesbank, said on Friday. ""Monetary policy should not pass up the opportunity for timely countermeasures.""
The central bank governors of Austria and the Netherlands have already called for rate hikes this year, worried that rapid price growth is becoming broad-based, an argument supported by underlying data from Friday's release.
Inflation excluding volatile food and fuel prices, closely watched by the ECB, picked up to 3.2% from 2.9% while a narrower measure that also excludes alcohol and tobacco products jumped to 3.0% from 2.7%.
Any cut in Russian gas supplies would also quickly feed through to customers, boosting prices even as governments are putting in place subsidy measures to offset some of the cost. 
ECB Chief Economist Philip Lane acknowledged that inflation is very high but said there were opposing forces at work and the euro zone central bank should take its time analysing the data.
""We have the energy shock, the prospects of second-round effects, pushing up inflation,"" Lane told CNBC
""On the other hand, the weakening of sentiment, the fact that real incomes will suffer with the high energy prices, especially over a one- to two-year horizon, will have a negative pressure on the inflation outlook."" 
INFLATION SOARS, GROWTH STAGNATES 
All this leaves the ECB with a difficult policy dilemma.
Its main task is to get inflation to 2% but tightening policy now would risk crashing an economy that is already reeling from the fallout of the war in its neighbour and the lingering impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. 
The ECB estimates that growth in the first quarter was positive, but barely, while second-quarter growth will be near-zero, as high energy prices dent consumption and hurt corporate investment. 
High energy prices are traditionally a drag on growth and will thus actually weigh on inflation once the immediate spike passes, raising the risk that price growth will later fall back below target. 
But the ECB can hardly ignore high inflation, especially since it says the peak is still three to four months away.
The euro zone's labour market is the tightest it has been in decades so wage inflation, a precondition of durable consumer inflation, is already in the pipeline. And ECB inaction would also boost inflation expectations, likely making price growth more permanent. 
The likely compromise will be for the bank to tighten monetary policy this year, but by the smallest increments. 

Markets are now pricing in 60 basis points of rate hikes by the end of the year but policymakers have been more cautious, with not a single one calling for moves so large. 
The risk, however, is that big inflation surprises could force the ECB to tighten more quickly and play catch-up later on.

A global semiconductor shortage and other logistical struggles as economies emerge from the pandemic slump have dampened deliveries of cars globally, leading to record low sales in Europe.
But the situation is particularly severe in Spain where thousands of truckers staged a walkout of more than two weeks in protest at what they saw as the government's inaction over soaring fuel prices.
Anfac said registrations of new cars were down 30.2% from a year earlier and 51% from March 2019, before the pandemic struck. By contrast in neighbouring France, registrations fell 19.5% from March 2021 and 35% from March 2019.
Bucking the strong downward trend, electric car registrations rose 17.6% from a year ago, albeit from low figures. 
Anfac's Communication Director Noemi Navas said striking drivers of car-transporter trucks had severely affected deliveries to customers. 

""In addition to the raw-material supply crisis and rising energy prices, brands have thousands of vehicles sitting idle in production lots due to distribution difficulties,"" she said in a statement. 
While the organisation stressed supply-side issues were the main challenge, it voiced concerns that economic uncertainty in the wake of Russia's invasion of Ukraine could in the future weigh on demand too.

“Today’s report suggests that the labor market should continue to do well, and that’s a great fundamental support for the (stock) market, and in terms of the inversions, the market can look through some of these yield curve inversions, and I would only become more concerned if a greater number of points on that yield curve started to invert. That’s when the market would become more concerned, you’d see buy the dip behavior wane, we’d see investors become more conservative and maybe even more fearful of a recession. But right now, with just a couple of points moving into inversion and then back out, investors should discount that for now and look at the still strong fundamentals in the economy.”
RANDY FREDERICK, MANAGING DIRECTOR, TRADING AND DERIVATIVES, SCHWAB CENTER FOR FINANCIAL RESEARCH
“This was a pretty solid report that was pretty much expected. Inflation is still problem obviously. It certainly doesn't change the Fed's actions or what the Fed's likely actions are going to be. I think that we've already kind of been told not explicitly, but pretty close to that, that we're going to get a half point right rate hike on May 4.”
“We got PCE numbers yesterday, that show the inflation is still pretty high but we had wages go up about the same amount. So I don't think that this really changes a whole lot of anything.”
MARVIN LOH, GLOBAL MACRO STRATEGIST, STATE STREET, BOSTON, MASSACHUSETTS
“From the perspective of the Fed and inflation, maybe it was a little bit too good of a number. But based on the fact that the employment rate continued to go down, the number of people coming back into the workforce is keeping pace with the jobs out there, and a rebound in the earnings number shows that the pace of wage gains is continuing although a little bit slower as we get towards a more normalized number."" 
JUAN PEREZ, DIRECTOR OF TRADING, MONEX USA, WASHINGTON
""The good job figures mean that the U.S. economy has been resilient to the negative impact from the conflict as the post-pandemic recovery remains strong. The Fed will certainly feel pressure to stay the course on its hike path although now many doubt the global economy should be taking in higher borrowing costs. We believe the buck will continue to be volatile and be pulled in different directions as long as there remains a lack of clarity on how long the war will go on."" 
JIM PAULSEN, CHIEF INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, THE LEUTHOLD GROUP, MINNEAPOLIS 
    ""It's a decent wage increase but it's not frightening, like wage costs running out of control. You had a little bit of an uptick in the participation rate, which again, was good."" 
    ""What it does is quell fears the economy is falling off a cliff. This is a very good report and it didn't deliver an overheated blow either. It's kind of benign but a little on the positive sign. It might lift GDP estimates for the quarter which could affect earnings estimates.""
    ""It helps reduce fears the economy is really slowing or weakening. It's not. At the same time it doesn't add to inflation fears in a dramatic way.""
""I don't see where this is a market moving report. It's not an outlier. It wasn't super strong or super weak.""
KARL SCHAMOTTA, CHIEF MARKET STRATEGIST, CORPAY, TORONTO
""Another strong print is sustaining expectations for two or more jumbo-sized Fed hikes in the coming months, and has added to momentum driving the dollar higher. Global risk sentiment continues to deteriorate and lift the greenback as hopes for a ceasefire in Ukraine fade, while commodity-linked currencies are coming under pressure as policy changes cap the potential for further gains.""
PAUL NOLTE, PORTFOLIO MANAGER, KINGSVIEW INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT, CHICAGO
""The data suggests that the labor market is still very strong. The underlying indication is that the economy remains very strong.""
""With the wage growth of 5% plus y-o-y for probably the second or third month in a row - the risks now of wage price spiraling higher are increasing. It increases the chance that the Fed goes 50 basis points at their next meeting in May. The Fed is going to be focused a lot more on inflation at this point, and will be looking to raise rates.”
""I think the economy is still very strong and the Fed should feel comfortable in raising interest rates at this point, at least initially, without fearing that they're going to dump the economy into a recession.""
OLIVER PURSCHE, SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT, WEALTHSPIRE ADVISORS, WESTPORT, CONNECTICUT
    ""There doesn't seem to be anything overly surprising in the jobs report, other than it being relatively strong. Overall, this is a positive report for investors. The U.S. economy, despite COVID and related headwinds that persist and global events that are driving inflation, is very resilient, and that's a good thing. And that bodes wells for the upcoming earnings season, which is ultimately going to be the big driver of market returns.""
SHAWN CRUZ, DIRECTOR OF DERIVATIVES STRATEGY, TD AMERITRADE, CHICAGO 
“It was the wage increase, it wasn’t awful but if there was one thing I noticed yesterday was when we got the income and expenditures was that there was a little bit of a slowdown in spending and some people could view that as just not keeping up with inflation. And it doesn’t look like the wage growth here was quite enough to keep up with some of the inflation we are seeing either, so there is a little bit of concern around what does that mean for consumer spending, that is one area that might create some concern.”
“Generally speaking, there was a little bit of an expectation that maybe a lot of this inflation was going to start pulling people back into the labor market, getting more people back to work, and undershooting that a little bit is another area where there is going to be a little bit of concern as well. But there is still enough of a wage increase component in this – average hourly earnings were up 5.6% - which is still a decent jump where that keeps the Fed in the spot where that is still inflationary and that is still going to keep the expectation that everyone had before that they are going to have to tighten in place.” 
""Right now the catalyst is wages not keeping pace with inflation but inflation also forcing the Fed to continue to have to tighten policy aggressively.” 
PETER CARDILLO, CHIEF MARKET ECONOMIST, SPARTAN CAPITAL SECURITIES, NEW YORK
“It’s decent report, but it carries wage pressures and a half-percent (interest rate) rise at (the Fed’s) May meeting is a near certain. And if inflation accelerates even further then at the June meeting, we’re looking at another half-percent rise.” 

“Basically, the report is good, but it just means the Fed is going to get more hawkish.”
“In terms of the market, it’s coming off a little bit. Yields are moving higher the dollar is moving higher. It’s the beginning of a new quarter, we’ll probably have a mixed to positive trading session based on the news.”

Investing.com -- The U.S. labor market tightened again in March with the jobless rate falling to a new post-pandemic low, even though the economy created fewer jobs than expected.
Nonfarm payrolls rose by 431,000 in the month through mid-March, well below consensus forecasts for a rise of 490,000. However, the shortfall was completely offset by an upward revision of 72,000 to February's data, bringing the previous month's gain to 750,000. 
As a result, the unemployment rate fell to 3.6% from 3.8% in February, a little below forecasts for 3.7%.  The U6 unemployment rate, which captures a broader range of under-employed people, also fell sharply to 6.9% of the workforce from 7.2%. Both numbers are the lowest since the start of the pandemic, although Oxford Economics analyst Greg Daco pointed out that the U.S. is still some 1.6 million jobs short of pre-Covid emploment levels.
""Despite the slight headline 'miss', revisions and stronger than expected unemployment and underemployment data make this a reasonable release,"" said the World Gold Council's John Reade via Twitter (NYSE:TWTR). 
Average hourly earnings also grew by more than expected, reflecting a further shift of the balance of power in the labor market toward workers. The U.S. economy had over 11 million vacant jobs in March, according to a survey released earlier in the week by the Labor Department. Earnings grew 5.6% on the year through March, their fastest rate since March 2020. 
Markets were relatively untroubled by the report, which broadly reaffirmed existing perceptions of the state of the economy. The dollar index quickly reversed its initial gains on the numbers to trade at 98.537, up 0.2% on the day. Likewise, the upward drift in U.S. Treasury bond yields continued but didn't gain any fresh momentum. By 8:50 AM ET (1250 GMT), the 10-Year U.S. Treasury yield was at 2.42%, up 1 basis point on the day.
That small movement was, however, enough to take it below the 2-Year Treasury note  yield, sparking fresh chatter about the shape of the yield curve. When short rates rise above long ones, it is generally taken as a signal of a growth slowdown or even a recession ahead. However, the spread between 3-Month rates and 10-year rates - seen by many as more important because the money used to fund many positions in the bond market is borrowed at very short tenors - remains clearly positive. A number of Federal Reserve officials have also flagged the need for the Fed to sell off its longer-date bonds more quickly, in order to keep that spread positive. "

Imports from China to the EU jumped by more than a fifth last year to 472 billion euros ($522 billion) compared to 2020, Eurostat data showed, widening the bloc's trade deficit with the country to 249 billion euros. 
EU exports to China grew by a comparatively smaller 10%, a significantly faster rate than to other countries outside the bloc.
The report came as EU and Chinese leaders met for their first summit in two years, where Brussels pressed Beijing for assurances it would not supply Russia with arms nor help Moscow circumvent Western sanctions imposed over its invasion of Ukraine.
China was last year the EU's largest import partner and third-biggest export destination according to Eurostat, after the United States and Britain.
Telecoms equipment, data processors and electrical kit made up the bulk of EU imports from China, while it largely exported cars and car parts into the world's biggest automotive market.
Netherlands posted by far the largest deficit at nearly 95 billion euros, while Germany - China's top exporter and second-biggest importer within the bloc - recorded the largest surplus. 

Eurostat said the onset of the coronavirus crisis had slowed EU-China trade in the first months of 2020, though these quickly recovered throughout the pandemic and hit peaks in 2021.

Investing.com -- Inflation in the eurozone hit its highest level since the creation of the single currency in March, as a combination of loose fiscal and monetary policy, supply chain constraints and surging energy prices mixed a toxic cocktail for the economy.
The consumer price index rose 7.5% on the year, from 5.9%, after leaping 2.5% in the month of March alone. The rise in core prices, which excludes more volatile elements such as fuel and energy, was even more severe at 3.0%. 
Economists had expected the headline annual rate to rise only to 6.6%. 
The numbers were released only a couple of hours after a raft of closely-watched business surveys showed business activity slowing sharply in March, although they still continued to signal economic expansion. IHS Markit's Purchasing Managers Index for Eurozone manufacturers fell to 56.5, its lowest level in over a year and also worse than consensus forecasts. The data are among the first to incorporate the timeframe since Russia invaded Ukraine in late February, sparking the worst armed conflict on the continent for 30 years.
The data will pile pressure on the European Central Bank to tighten monetary policy faster than it currently intends to do. The ECB's deposit rate is still stuck at -0.5%, and it doesn't plan to raise it until it has wound down its bond-buying program, which will happen no earlier than the summer under its current guidance. 
""There may be an acceleration in the pace of the QE program taper, but any ECB movement on rates seems unlikely until the end of Q3,"" said Mark Dowding, chief investment officer of BlueBay Asset Management, in a note to clients.
However, he suggested that year-on-year rates are unlikely to rise much further, due largely to base effects. By summer, he noted ""inflation is likely to be heading lower. Therefore, we may currently be witnessing a moment of peak pressure on central banks.""
The euro was relatively little affected by the numbers, falling 0.1% to $1.1055, while the yield on the benchmark German 10-Year  government bond rose three basis points to 0.58%, having hit a four-year high of 0.72% earlier in the week in response to preliminary German data for the month, before falling sharply on Thursday.
Markets are currently betting that the ECB will succumb to the pressure and raise interest rates more quickly, following the example of a U.S. Federal Reserve which has drastically accelerated its timeframe for tightening monetary policy in recent months. Short-term interest rate futures suggest the ECB may raise its key deposit rate to 1.5% by the end of 2023. 
Earlier this week, ECB President Christine Lagarde stressed again that any rises in interest rates would be gradual, and that the spike in prices is still likely to be temporary, even though it will be higher and last longer than first expected. The ECB's staff forecasts - which will come under increasing scrutiny in light of the current overshoot - still assume that core inflation will be below 2% in 2023 and 2024."

The S&P Global/CIPS UK Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) fell to 55.2 - revised down from a preliminary ""flash"" reading of 55.5 - from 58.0 in February.
The survey's gauge of new orders sank to its lowest level since January 2021, hurt by slowing domestic demand and the sixth drop in seven months for export orders.
Survey compiler S&P Global (NYSE:SPGI) linked the weakness in export orders to geopolitical tensions, Brexit and ongoing difficulty with supply chains, though delays were their shortest since October 2020.
Overall, the survey pointed to tougher times ahead for Britain's economy, with growth set to slow amid a global surge in inflation pressure, fuelled by turmoil in commodity markets following Russia's invasion of Ukraine. 
""The end of the opening quarter saw a marked growth slowdown in the UK manufacturing sector,"" S&P Global said.

The survey's indicators of input costs and output prices rose in March after they had receded in previous months from record high levels, pointing to persistent inflation pressure.
Consumer price inflation hit a 30-year high of 6.2% in February and the government's budget watchdog last week forecast it would go close to 9% in late 2022, contributing to the biggest fall in living standards since at least the 1950s.

LONDON/TOKYO (Reuters) - Global factory activity slowed in March as Russia's invasion of Ukraine tightened supply chain bottlenecks, dampened demand and whacked confidence, while soaring energy costs drove a broader surge in prices, surveys showed on Friday.
Uncertainty caused by the invasion, combined with an intensifying cost-of-living crisis, suggests the euro zone's manufacturing industry could slide into a recession this quarter.
""Today's figures show the worsening supply chain situation is having a major impact on the industry, with rates of both input costs and selling price inflation currently far above anything previously seen,"" said Thomas Rinn, global industrial lead at Accenture (NYSE:ACN).
""The ever-surging cost of power, freight delays and diversions, topped by new COVID-19 lockdowns in China, have all contributed to increased costs and raw material shortages - leaving European manufacturers faced with unprecedented disruption.""

German manufacturers reported slower growth and far more pessimistic expectations for factory activity, and French manufacturing growth eased a bit more than forecast.
Confidence indicators in the region have plummeted and the euro zone future output PMI plunged to its lowest reading since May 2020.
In Britain, outside the common currency area, industry expanded at the weakest pace in 13 months and price pressures, which had previously shown some signs of moderating, worsened. [GB/PMIM]
ASIA STRAIN
Asian factories saw activity slow as slumping Chinese demand and rising raw material costs strained firms, and although Japan benefited from easing COVID-19 infections the spike in fuel and grain costs clouded the outlook for economies reliant on energy imports.
China's factory activity slumped at the fastest pace in two years in March, a private sector PMI showed, as the fallout from the Ukraine crisis and resurgence in domestic coronavirus cases hit external and domestic demand.
The outcome was in line with Thursday's official data showing activity in Chinese manufacturing and services simultaneously contracted for the first time since the height of the country's COVID-19 outbreak in 2020.
The slowdown in China bodes ill for Asia, which is host to big manufacturers dependent on consumption in the world's second-largest economy, analysts say.
South Korea's factory activity slowed with new export orders posting the sharpest reduction since July 2020, as companies took a hit from rising input prices for goods ranging from oil and metals to semiconductors.
Factory activity also slowed in Taiwan and Vietnam, and contracted in Malaysia, as the region felt the pain from rising raw material prices, other PMIs released on Friday showed.
""The main channel for transmission is going to be from commodity prices, so energy, oil, gas, as well as foodstuff,"" said Tai Hui, chief Asia market strategist at J.P. Morgan Asset Management.
""What's going to happen is that the manufacturers, especially some of the more downstream ones, they're going to face a bit more cost pressure,"" he said.
By contrast, Japan saw manufacturing activity grow at a faster pace than the prior month, as domestic demand got a lift from the waning impact of the pandemic.

But Japan's export orders slumped as external demand suffered from pandemic curbs in China and supply chain disruptions caused by Russia's war in Ukraine.
South Korea's PMI fell to 51.2 in March from 53.8, the lowest in four months, and Japan's final au Jibun Bank PMI rose to 54.1, up from 52.7.

An index measuring output, which feeds into a composite PMI due next week and is seen as a good barometer of economic health, sank to 53.1 from 55.5, its lowest since June 2020, when the bloc was enduring the first wave of the coronavirus pandemic.
""Just as the fading of the latest pandemic wave was creating a tailwind for the euro zone manufacturing recovery, with economies reopening and supply chain bottlenecks easing, the war in Ukraine has created an ominous new headwind,"" said Chris Williamson, chief business economist at S&P Global.
""Rates of growth have cooled markedly amid sanctions, soaring energy costs and new supply constraints linked to the war.""
Overall demand growth weakened as factories, facing soaring input costs, increased prices at the fastest rate since S&P Global began collecting the data in 2002. Export orders, which includes trade between member countries, declined for the first time since June 2020.
Inflation in the bloc probably jumped to 6.6% last month, data is expected to show later on Friday according to a Reuters poll, likely adding pressure on European Central Bank policymakers to raise interest rates.

New home prices in 100 cities grew 0.03% on month, matching the rise in February, according to data from China Index Academy, one of the country's largest independent real estate research firms.
China's rattled property sector has gained some momentum in larger cities since the beginning of the year as authorities take policy action to stoke buyers' interest and ease a liquidity crunch at some major developers. 
Premier Li Keqiang early in March called for city-specific property measures to meet home buyers' demand, paving the way for local authorities to relax some curbs based on their city's own conditions.
In March, around 20 small and medium-sized cities announced steps to boost demand, such as allowing smaller down payments, cuts in mortgage rates, subsidies and lower curbs on purchases. 
Fuzhou, the capital of the southeastern province of Fujian, this week relaxed curbs on home buying in five districts and allowed some buyers to pay down payments with housing provident funds.
But overall demand remains weak, with 53 of the 100 cities surveyed reporting declines in new home prices in March, compared with a decline in 52 cities in February, the China Index Academy said. 
Real estate market woes in small cities have not improved. Prices in tier-three and tier-four cities dropped 0.02% month on month, after a 0.01% fall in February.
New home prices in tier-one cities including Shanghai, which has been fighting a major COVID outbreak since March, rose 0.03%, slowing from February's 0.17% gain.
The pace of recovery in the real estate market was interrupted to some extent by the COVID outbreaks, with the markets in Shanghai and some other areas experiencing spikes in cases looking ""dim"", according to the China Index Academy.
""Although local governments continue to ease some local property curbs, the pace appears moderate, and we continue to believe Beijing will stick to most of its major property curbs,"" Nomura analysts said in a note on Friday.
Most property developers in their full-year financial results conferences said they expected to see recovery in the second quarter.
Chairman Yu Liang at China Vanke said the sector is returning to a ""normal, rational"" stage as the central government reassures on healthy development of the sector.
Regulators and governments at all levels will introduce more policies to stabilise the market, Yu said.

Visitor volume of first-home buyers at development projects in March has returned to end-December levels, said state-backed Greentown China, and added it expected to see recovery in the second quarter.

The S&P Global (NYSE:SPGI) purchasing managers' index (PMI) fell to 44.1 from 48.6 in the previous month, well below the 50.0 mark that separates expansion from contraction.
The survey did not mention that Russia sent tens of thousands of troops into Ukraine on Feb. 24, or the harsh economic sanctions against Moscow that that move triggered. 
Manufacturing firms registered another deterioration in vendor performance, S&P Global said. 
""Lead times lengthened substantially, and to the greatest extent on record amid severe material shortages,"" it said.
Companies also said material shortages were hampering efforts to replenish stocks. 

The survey recorded the most substantial increase in selling prices on record, and the sharpest uptick in input prices since the series began in September 1997. 
Employment declined for a second consecutive month, linked to the fall in client demand and new orders, with the rate of job-shedding quickening to its fastest since July 2020.

The Caixin/Markit Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) fell to 48.1 in March, indicating the steepest rate of contraction since February 2020, from 50.4 in the previous month.
The 50-point index mark separates growth from contraction on a monthly basis.
The deterioration in manufacturing conditions was broadly in line with the official PMI released on Thursday, which showed activity contracted at the quickest rate since October 2021. The private-sector Caixin survey focuses more on small firms in coastal regions compared with the official survey.
""The average of the two (PMIs) is now under 50, and apart from the initial pandemic hit in 2020, is now at its lowest since February 2016,"" said Sheana Yue, China economist at Capital Economics.
""Given the composition of the firms surveyed, the sharper reduction in the Caixin reading suggests the deterioration was more significant among smaller private firms and exporters.""
Demand also weakened markedly, both domestically and overseas. 
A sub-index for new orders declined at the sharpest rate since February 2020 when China grappled with the first wave of COVID-19 outbreaks, leading to a 6.8% contraction in gross domestic product in the first quarter of 2020.
In particular, the decline in new export orders in March accelerated, as surveyed companies said the latest virus outbreaks in China, disruptions in shipping sector and greater market uncertainties from the Ukraine crisis led customers to cancel or suspend orders.
Input cost inflation hit a five-month high, with a number of factories attributing higher prices to tight global supply chains, which was exacerbated by the war in Ukraine.
The world's second-largest economy, which picked up pace in the first two months of year, is now at risk of slowing sharply as authorities restrict production and mobility in COVID-hit cities, including major economic centres like Shanghai and Shenzhen.
That has slowed output growth with the sub-index for production at 46.4 in March, the lowest since February 2020. 
Government officials have vowed to roll out policies to stabilise the economy as downward economic pressure builds, a cabinet meeting said on Wednesday.
The possibility of the People's Bank of China cutting reserve requirement ratios in April has risen as economic headwinds intensified, according to a state-run China Daily report, citing experts. 
One bright spot in the otherwise sluggish Caixin survey was the employment index, which expanded for the first time in eight months, as factories ramped up hiring after the Lunar New Year holiday.

""The prospect of the war between Russia and Ukraine is uncertain, and the commodity market convulsed,"" said Wang Zhe, Senior Economist at Caixin Insight Group, in a statement accompanying the data release.
""A variety of factors resonate, aggravating the downward pressure on China's economy and underscoring the risk of stagflation.""

Investing.com – Chinese factory activity dropped at the fastest pace in two years in March 2022. Production and demand fell sharply thanks to the latest COVID-19 outbreaks and the economic impact of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24.
The Caixin manufacturing purchasing managers index (PMI) was 48.1, the steepest rate of contraction since February 2020. Forecasts prepared by Investing.com predicted a figure of 50, while the previous month’s reading was 50.4. The 50-point index mark separates growth from contraction.
National Bureau of Statistics data from the day before showed that the manufacturing PMI was 49.5 and the non-manufacturing PMI was 48.4.

""Given the composition of the firms surveyed, the sharper reduction in the Caixin reading suggests the deterioration was more significant among smaller private firms and exporters.""
Domestic and overseas demand has also weakened markedly, with a decline in new export orders accelerating in March. The latest COVID-19 outbreaks in China, disruptions in the shipping sector, and greater market uncertainties from the Ukraine crisis led customers to cancel or suspend orders, said the surveyed companies.
Several factories also blamed tight global supply chains for higher prices, and the war in Ukraine also contributed to input cost inflation hitting a five-month high.
The COVID-19 outbreaks in cities like Shanghai and Shenzhen, and the ensuing lockdowns, add to the risk of a sharp slowdown in the economy. The State Council has already pledged to roll out policies to stabilize the economy, it said at a meeting on Wednesday.

""A variety of factors resonate, aggravating the downward pressure on China's economy and underscoring the risk of stagflation.""
Wang also called for more help for vulnerable groups and small businesses, noting the government must strike a balance between maintaining normal production and public health and safety.

The final au Jibun Bank Japan Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) rose to a seasonally adjusted 54.1 in March, up from a 53.2 flash reading and the previous month's final of 52.7.
The reading meant manufacturing activity came in above the 50.0 threshold that separates contraction from expansion for the 14th straight month.
""The Japanese manufacturing sector saw an improvement in operating conditions at the end of the first quarter,"" said Usamah Bhatti, economist IHS Markit, which compiles the survey.
""New order inflows saw a quickening in growth, as firms recovered from the surge in COVID-19 cases at the start of the year.""
The PMI survey showed, however, that new export orders fell at the sharpest rate in 20 months, suggesting less stable conditions in overseas markets.
The drop in export orders followed the reintroduction of coronavirus restrictions in parts of China and the Russia-Ukraine war, Bhatti said. Russia calls its action in Ukraine a ""special operation"".
""Anecdotal evidence also linked the war to exacerbated price and supply pressures,"" Bhatti said.
Manufacturers recorded the steepest rise in input prices since August 2008, the survey showed, following a rapid increase in the price of oil and other raw materials.

Firms' optimism about output conditions for the 12 months ahead became slightly less positive on the downside overseas risks, while they also reported a deterioration in lead times amid material shortages.
""There was a survey-record increase in stocks of inputs as firms sought to grow safety stocks and unused inputs accumulated due to shortages of critical components,"" Bhatti said.

New export orders returned to contraction in three months and posted the sharpest reduction since July 2020, as respondents were reportedly pressured by higher raw material prices and the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Overall new orders barely grew with the sub-index standing at 50.4.
Output also shrank in the same month, the first contraction in three months.

Friday's survey pointed to a further rise in input prices, notably in oil, metals and semiconductors, extending the current sequence of inflation to 21 months.
Still, firms remained optimistic over the coming year about hopes that price pressures and supply imbalances would ease and drive up demand at home and from abroad.

TOKYO (Reuters) -Japanese business confidence hit a nine-month low in the first quarter, a central bank survey showed, as companies took a hit from supply disruptions and surging raw material costs caused by the Ukraine crisis.
Companies expect conditions to worsen further three months ahead as rising input costs squeeze margins, the Bank of Japan's closely-watched ""tankan"" survey showed on Friday.
The survey also showed companies expect inflation to hit 1.8% a year from now, up from 1.1% in the December poll and the highest forecast on record - highlighting Japan's rising upward price pressure.

Big non-manufacturers' sentiment index also worsened for the first time in seven quarters at plus 9, down slightly from plus 10 three months ago but exceeding market forecasts of plus 5.
Food, auto and electric machinery makers saw sentiment worsen, as well as construction and retail sectors, in a sign of the wide-ranging hit from surging import costs.
An index gauging big manufacturers' output prices rose to a 40-year high, the tankan showed, a sign more firms are putting higher price tags on their goods.
Big firms expect to increase capital spending plans by 2.2% for the current fiscal year that began in April, less than a market forecast for a 4.0% gain, the tankan showed.
The outcome will be among factors BOJ policymakers will scrutinise in producing fresh quarterly growth and inflation projections at their next meeting on April 27-28.

Soaring fuel and food prices blamed on the Ukraine war, coupled with rising import bills from a weak yen, have added to pain for households and Japan's economy still reeling from the coronavirus pandemic's hit.
Analysts expect Japan's core consumer inflation to approach the central bank's 2% target as early as in April, though the BOJ has said it will not respond to cost-push inflation with policy tightening.

The Recruitment and Employment Confederation (REC) said new job postings fell by 25% in the last week of March from a week earlier, returning to the kind of increase seen in mid-January.
""The jobs market has been super-heated in the first few months of this year, and was always likely to stabilise in the spring. We may be seeing the first signs of that now,"" REC chief executive Neil Carberry said.
""Over the next few weeks, we will see whether this is the cooling we expected, or a slower market developing as employers factor rising inflation into their plans.""
Staff shortages are a worry for the Bank of England which has raised interest rates at each of its last three meetings to try to stop the jump in inflation to a 30-year high of 6.2% from turning into a longer-term price growth problem.

REC said demand was for hairdressers and barbers as well as security and bar staff and there were also big increases in adverts for other skilled occupations such as veterinarians and crane drivers. 
The total of 1.83 million active jobs ads had been stable since early March, it said.

OTTAWA (Reuters) -The Canadian economy likely gathered momentum in February, growing for a ninth consecutive month after a January gain, data from Statistics Canada showed on Thursday, prompting economists to revise up first quarter projections.
Real gross domestic product probably grew 0.8% in February, led by increases in manufacturing and resources, Statscan said in a flash estimate. The economy expanded 0.2% in January - matching expectations - despite increased pandemic restrictions. 
The robust start to the year sets the stage for first quarter GDP to come in well ahead of the Bank of Canada's current forecast of 2.0%, said economists.
""Heading into the year, some slowdown in activity was expected due to the pandemic restrictions, but, unlike in past waves, that wasn't the case,"" said Benjamin Reitzes, Canadian rates and macro strategist at BMO Capital Market Economics, in a note.
""Accordingly, it looks like Q1 GDP growth will clock in at around a 4% annualized rate.""
With February's gain, Canada's economy is now 1.2% above pre-pandemic levels, Statscan said. That may add to pressure on the Bank of Canada to move aggressively on rate hikes when it meets in mid-April.
""The Bank may follow through with the recent pledge ... that it will be forceful in combating inflation, potentially by hiking interest rates by 50 bp,"" said Stephen Brown, senior Canada economist at Capital Economics, in a note.
Inflation has surged to 5.7% and money markets see a 50% chance of a 50-basis point hike, to 1.0%, on April 13.[BOCWATCH]
In January, activity among goods-producing industries jumped, led by a strong rebound in construction and a surge in demand for utilities. 
Services were flat as the spread of the Omicron coronavirus variant led to more restrictions, though the February flash estimate suggested a partial reversal for accommodation and food services.

Statistics Canada also revised upwards the December GDP growth rate to 0.1% from flat. 
The Canadian dollar was trading 0.3% lower at 1.2517 to the greenback, or 79.89 U.S. cents, as oil fell and the U.S. dollar jumped on waning hopes of progress at Russia-Ukraine peace talks.

Kantar measured the sales between March 6 and 20, compared to the same period a year ago, and their total increase far outpaced a 5% rise in Spanish mass consumer products prices in the same two weeks, meaning sales volumes were growing.
""Spain's shoppers are starting to change their habits and it is directly related to the concern they are showing about the current scenario,"" said Kantar, adding that 90% of consumers surveyed were worried about the impact of the conflict that began on Feb. 24.
Supermarket chains across the country have limited sales of sunflower oil, which is mostly imported from Ukraine, and the truck-drivers strike created sporadic shortages of staples like milk and flour.
Earlier this week, Spain temporarily authorised stores to limit the sale of some products to prevent sell-outs when markets are under stress.
Customers were buying more packaged foods and beverages, which accounted for 48.4% of an average grocery basket, compared to 44% a year ago. 
Spanish consumer prices rose 9.8% in March, the fastest increase since 1985, preliminary data showed on Wednesday.
Young people have been particularly hard hit, the Kantar report showed, with consumers under 35 spending 20% more on their purchases of basic goods than a year ago.
In response, consumers are increasingly looking to buy cheaper own-brand products and some 40% are trying to reduce their out-of-home consumption, Kantar said. 

""Consumers are becoming more selective, spending more time looking for cheaper alternatives,"" Juan Aznar, a professor at Barcelona business school Esade told Reuters. 
""Large shops with the capacity to maintain lower prices will be favoured in this circumstances.""

The rate showed no change from the three months through January, and was down four-tenths of a percentage point from the September 2021-November 2021 period.
A Reuters poll of economists had projected that the unemployment rate would be 11.4% in the three months through the end of February.
IBGE researcher Adriana Beringuy noted that the number of employed people was stable compared to the previous three-month period, which may indicate the resumption of a pattern seen before the COVID-19 pandemic.
According to IBGE, the number of officially unemployed Brazilians in this period reached 12 million people, 3.1% lower than the previous three-month period and down 19.5% from the same period last year. 
The average monthly pay of 2,511 reais ($529) for workers was unchanged from the previous three months, but fell 8.8% compared to the same period in 2021. It was also the lowest level for the three months through February since the series started in 2012, according to IBGE, indicating the labor market recovery has been centered in lower-income occupations.

The Economy Ministry has emphasized that job creation will underpin economic growth this year. But private economists continue to project that Brazil's economy, the largest in Latin America, will expand well below official government estimates.

This follows a drop of 7.5% year-over-year in January and a 1.9% decline in copper production in 2021. 
The agency also reported that the Andean country's manufacturing output dropped 2.2% in February, lagging the market forecast of a 0.5% rise. 
The agency said a 9% year-on-year dip in chemical products and substances manufacturing because of lower fertilizer production was largely responsible for the manufacturing drop.
Another contributor to the drop in output was ""less manufacturing of manufactured products of common metals (such as copper or steel) moulded, forged or stamped,"" the agency said.

One sector that did show growth, the agency said, was production of pharmaceutical products due to an increased demand by pharmacies.
On Wednesday Chile's central bank dropped its prediction for 2022 economic growth to 1.0%-2.0% from a previous estimate of 1.5%-2.5% in December.

112,By Investing.com,"<span>Mar 31, 2022 08:42AM ET</span>","U.S. Spending Slows in February as Stimulus Fades, Inflation Bites","By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing.com -- U.S. consumer spending slowed sharply in February as the effect of pandemic-driven stimulus programs faded and high inflation started to bite.
Personal spending rose only 0.2% on the month, down from an upwardly revised 2.7% in January, according to figures released by the Bureau of Economic Analysis. That was comfortably below expectations for a 0.5% rise. That was despite the fact that personal income rose a more respectable 0.5%, in a month when the effects of the winter wave of Covid-19 had already peaked. 
At the same time, the data series widely seen as the Federal Reserve's preferred measure of inflation posted another chunky increase, with the index for personal consumer expenditures rising 0.6% on the month, taking the annual rate to 6.4%. The core rate of PCE inflation rose to 5.2%, both figures representing 40-year highs. Greg Daco, an analyst with Oxford Economics, noted that, adjusted for inflation, spending had fallen 0.4%.
Analysts view the PCE price index as a better guide to inflationary trends because it is quicker to reflect changes in prices for goods and services that are bought more regularly.  
The numbers provided fresh evidence of consumer spending reverting to more normal patterns, after two years punctuated by lockdowns and dominated by working-from-home pushed spending in the direction of home improvements and electronic appliances. The strongest gains were seen in food services and accommodation, along with recreation. By contrast, spending declined most on motor vehicles and parts, and on furnishings. 
That trend may yet have further to run: Oxford's Daco noted that spending on goods is still 7.7% above its pre-Covid trend, while spending on services is nearly 4% below it.
Other data released at the same time showed that initial jobless claims ticked up unexpectedly last week to 202,000, but continuing claims continued their downward run to a new 60-year low of 1.307 million.
""The improvement is likely to continue but remain unsteady as there's not much more room for claims to fall,"" said Daniel Zhao, chief economist with Glassdoor, via Twitter.
The data come a day before the Labor Department's monthly employment report, which is set to show another robust gain in employment as the U.S. economy puts the pandemic behind it. The Department's monthly survey of job openings, released on Wednesday, showed that vacancies continue to trend near record levels, while rising prices and thinning financial cushions, along with the lure of higher wages, push inactive people back into the labor force. "

""At present, with all due caution, the government should be able to meet the deficit target"" of 5%, Budget Minister Maria Jesus Montero told a news conference on Thursday.
The government had initially targeted a budget gap of 8.4% in 2021, and Montero said the lower result ""allows us to better face the challenges from the war in Ukraine"". 
The war and sanctions on Russia following its invasion of Ukraine last month have pushed energy prices to record highs across Europe, stoking overall inflation and sapping confidence.
Tax collection soared 15.1% in 2021, allowing the government to meet its revenue forecast for the first time in 10 years, and revenue data were positive so far this year, Montero said, adding that higher social security payments driven by new jobs and hikes to the minimum wage had helped boost tax receipts.
The government attributed the deficit reduction to a stronger economy as it bounced back from a record slump in 2020 caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, and shrugged off the impact of higher prices on the improved revenue collection as pointed out by some experts.
Inflation last year reached 6.5%, while electricity prices soared by 72%. Year-on-year inflation in March hit 9.8%, highest since 1985.

Spain has to review its economic outlook to include the impact of the war in Ukraine war by April 30, and the government has already said growth would fall short of the current 7% target for this year.
Spanish think-tank Funcas has downgraded its growth forecast to 4.2%, which would significantly reduce the chances of Spain reaching pre-pandemic levels of economic activity this year, as the government had hoped, and its capacity to cut the deficit.

Retail sales in February fell 14.6% from a year earlier to HK$25.2 billion ($3.22 billion), official data released on Thursday showed. That compares with a revised 4% increase in January and a 13.7% fall in last decline in January 2021.
It is the steepest decline since July 2020, during the early months of the pandemic, when sales dropped 23.1%. 
""While the local epidemic has shown signs of easing of late, the retail sector will continue to face notable pressure in the near term,"" a government spokesman said, adding the new round of electronic consumption vouchers in April should provide support to the retail sector.
In volume terms, retail sales in February fell 17.6% from a year earlier, compared with a revised 1.5% growth in January, and was the biggest fall since July 2020, when it dropped 23.8%. 
At the start of this year, Hong Kong implemented its most draconian measures as the Omicron variant caused a dramatic spike in infections, and as a result businesses and the city's economy are reeling from widespread closures.
Hong Kong's border has effectively been shut since 2020 with few flights able to land and hardly any passengers allowed to transit, isolating a city that had built a reputation as a global financial and travel hub.
The economy is set to contract in the first quarter, breaking four quarters of recovery, Financial Secretary Paul Chan said on his blog last Sunday.
The seasonally adjusted unemployment rate rose to 4.5% in the December-February quarter, the government said, adding that the outlook is overshadowed by the battle to bring the epidemic under control. 
Sales of jewellery, watches, clocks and valuable gifts, which before the pandemic relied heavily on tourists from the mainland, dropped 33.6% in February after 7.1% surge in January, the data showed.
Clothing, footwear and related products plunged 39% in February against a revised 6.2% jump in January.
Tourist arrivals in February dropped more than 52% from a year earlier to 2,626. That compares with a 61.7% jump in January.

Overall business activity was steady in March, while the baht depreciated following an escalation of the Russia-Ukraine conflict, the Bank of Thailand (BOT) said.
Southeast Asia's second-largest economy should, however, remain on the recovery path, senior BOT director Chayawadee Chai-Anant told a news conference.

LONDON (Reuters) -Britain's economy grew more quickly than previously thought in late 2021 but the increase was largely due to COVID-related activity in the health sector, which masked the inflation hit to household incomes and a gloomy picture for the private sector.
Gross domestic product in the world's fifth-biggest economy increased by 1.3% in the fourth quarter, when the Omicron wave of coronavirus cases mounted, official data showed on Thursday.
That was stronger than a preliminary estimate of growth of 1.0% from the previous three-month period.
But the largest contributors to the increase came from health and social work including more visits to doctors, a large increase in coronavirus testing and tracing and an extension of the COVID-19 vaccination programme.
Paul Dales, an economist with consultancy Capital Economics, said the upward revision to GDP was not as encouraging as it looked at first glance.
""A lot of it appears to be due to inventories while consumer spending was revised down,"" he said. ""The latter suggests the squeeze on real incomes is starting to bite, although the fall in the saving rate is providing a cushion.""
Households dipped into their lockdown savings to finance their spending. The saving ratio fell to 6.8% of disposable income from 7.5% in third second quarter, heading back towards its level of 6.0% immediately before the pandemic.
Last week, finance minister Rishi Sunak announced tax cuts to help soften the hit to consumers from surging energy prices which have risen further after Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
While fourth-quarter growth pick-up represented an acceleration from the economy's 0.9% expansion in the third quarter, it was well below its 5.6% expansion in the April-June period when it was rebounding from COVID-19 lockdowns.
HOUSEHOLDS HIT
Investors expect the recovery to slow in 2022 as inflation heads for almost 9% and households face the biggest fall in living standards since at least the 1950s, according to forecasts by the government's fiscal watchdog. 
Thursday's data showed household disposable income, adjusted for inflation, fell by 0.2% in the July-September period, revised down from an originally reported 0.5% increase, and it fell again by 0.1% in the fourth quarter.
The dip in the third quarter reflected the increased impact of inflation on household budgets and a downward revision of pension contributions, the Office for National Statistics said.
Household incomes as a share of all income in Britain's economy, which includes business and government income, fell to 72.2%, its lowest since records began in 1987. 
Real household disposable spending in the fourth quarter rose by 0.5%, weaker than an original estimate of 1.2% growth.
Samuel Tombs, an economist with Pantheon Macroeconomics, said the data showed companies were also struggling.
White Britain's economic output at the end of 2021 was only 0.1% below where it was at the end of 2019, excluding government expenditure and investment it was 2.9% below its pre-pandemic level, he said.
Britain's balance of payments deficit in the fourth quarter narrowed to 7.3 billion pounds ($9.59 billion), helped by the first surplus since 2011 in the balance of British investment income abroad and foreign investment income in the country.
Economists polled by Reuters had expected a deficit of 17.6 billion pounds.
The ONS said the investment account surplus was driven by higher income from British assets in the oil sector abroad and a change in the schedule of dividend payments at home.

As a share of GDP, the overall current account deficit narrowed to 1.2% from 4.9% in the third quarter.

Investing.com – China’s manufacturing and services sectors simultaneously contracted in March 2022 for the first time in two years and highlighted the urgency for more policy intervention to stabilize the economy.
National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) data released earlier in the day showed that the manufacturing purchasing managers' index (PMI) was at 49.5. Forecasts prepared by Investing.com predicted a 49.9 figure, while February’s figure was 50.2. The non-manufacturing PMI was at 48.4, compared to the previous month’s 51.6 figure.
The last time both PMIs were both below the 50- mark separating contraction from growth was in February 2020, as COVID began to spread after being detected in the city of Wuhan. More recent outbreaks in cities such as Shanghai and Shenzhen are now pushing the indexes into contraction.
""Recently, clusters of epidemic outbreaks have occurred in many places in China and coupled with a significant increase in global geopolitical instability, production and operation of Chinese enterprises have been affected,"" NBS senior statistician Zhao Qinghe told Reuters.
Other investors agreed, with Pinpoint Asset Management chief economist Zhiwei Zhang telling Reuters, ""PMI weakened as the omicron outbreaks in many Chinese cities led to lockdowns and disruption of industrial production. As the Shanghai lockdown only happened in late March, economic activities will likely slow further in April.""
Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc. was one company that recently shut down its plant in Shanghai to comply with COVID-19 measures.
""Due to the epidemic outbreaks, some companies in some areas temporarily reduced production or stopped production, which also affected the normal production and operation of both upstream and downstream companies,"" said NBS’ Zhao.
Some companies also saw the cancellation or reduction of overseas orders due to geopolitical uncertainties, Zhao added.
Weaker production and demand also impacted factory jobs.
""The PMIs probably understated the hit to activity last month. The services index remained above the low of 45.2 that it hit last August during the Delta wave. That's probably because the survey was conducted prior to the worst disruptions,"" Capital Economics senior China economist Julian Evans-Pritchard told Reuters.
To cushion the impact of new COVID-19 lockdowns, authorities have unveiled steps to support business, including rent exemptions for some small services-sector firms.
The People's Bank of China is also expected to cut rates and lower reserve requirements for banks as downward economic pressures build, according to analysts."

The official manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) fell to 49.5 from 50.2 in February, the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) said on Thursday, while the non-manufacturing PMI eased to 48.4 from 51.6 in February.
The last time both PMI indexes simultaneously were below the 50-point mark that separates contraction from growth was in February 2020, when authorities were racing to arrest the spread of the coronavirus, first detected in the central Chinese city of Wuhan.
The world's second-largest economy revved up in January-February, with some key indicators blowing past expectations, but is now at risk of slowing sharply as authorities restrict production and mobility in COVID-hit cities, including Shanghai and Shenzhen.
""Recently, clusters of epidemic outbreaks have occurred in many places in China, and coupled with a significant increase in global geopolitical instability, production and operation of Chinese enterprises have been affected,"" said Zhao Qinghe, senior NBS statistician.
Shanghai's COVID-19 lockdown roiled auto production in recent days as two major suppliers joined Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) in shutting plants to comply with measures to control the spread of the coronavirus.
""PMI weakened as the Omicron outbreaks in many Chinese cities led to lockdowns and disruption of industrial production,"" said Zhiwei Zhang, chief economist at Pinpoint Asset Management. 
""As the Shanghai lockdown only happened in late March, economic activities will likely slow further in April.""
The sub-index for production fell below the 50-point mark for the first time since October, to 49.5, indicating a contraction. The gauge for new orders was also in negative territory. 
""Due to the epidemic outbreaks, some companies in some areas temporarily reduced production or stopped production, which also affected the normal production and operation of both upstream and downstream companies,"" Zhao said.
Some companies also saw the cancellation or reduction of overseas orders due to geopolitical uncertainties, Zhao said.
Weakening production and demand sped up the contraction in factory jobs, with the employment sub-index slipping to 48.6 in March, the lowest since February 2021.
WORST SINCE WUHAN
""The PMIs probably understate the hit to activity last month,"" said Julian Evans-Pritchard, senior China economist at Capital Economics. 
""The services index remained above the low of 45.2 that it hit last August during the Delta wave. That's probably because the survey was conducted prior to the worst disruptions.""
To cushion the impact of new COVID-19 lockdowns, authorities have unveiled steps to support business, including rent exemptions for some small services-sector firms.
On Wednesday, the government said it will roll out policies to stabilise the economy as soon as possible amid increased pressures.
The central bank, which kept its benchmark interest rate for corporate and household lending unchanged in March, is expected to cut rates and lower reserve requirements for banks as downward economic pressures build, analysts say. 
China's official composite PMI, which combined manufacturing and services, stood at 48.8 in March versus 51.2 in February.

The composite PMI was at its second-lowest reading on record since February 2020, when the initial COVID outbreak sent the index plummeting to 28.9.
""This suggests that the economy is contracting at its fastest pace since the height of the initial COVID-19 outbreak in February 2020,"" said Evans-Pritchard.

119,By Bloomberg,"<span>Mar 30, 2022 10:18PM ET</span>",China Factory Activity Contracts as Cities Go Into Lockdown,"(Bloomberg) -- China’s manufacturing activity contracted in March as authorities locked down major technology and factory hubs to curb a surge in Covid cases, damaging the outlook for economic growth. 
The official manufacturing purchasing managers’ index fell to 49.5, breaching the 50-mark that separates expansion from contraction for the first time in five months, data from the National Bureau of Statistics showed Thursday. That was lower than the median estimate of 49.8 in a Bloomberg survey of economists. 
The non-manufacturing gauge, which measures activity in the construction and services sectors slumped to 48.4, below the consensus forecast of 50.3. 
China is battling its worst outbreak since the initial flareup two years ago. Soaring case numbers prompted authorities to lock down major cities including the country’s tech and manufacturing hub Shenzhen, financial center Shanghai and automotive city Changchun this month. 
The drop in both PMIs showed overall economic momentum has declined, said Zhao Qinghe, a senior statistician at the NBS. The market is expected to pick up once the outbreaks are brought under control, he said.
The benchmark CSI 300 Index dropped as much as 0.8% after the release of the data, with industrials and technology shares leading the decline.
Areas covering roughly 30% of China’s gross domestic product are affected by the outbreaks,  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS). estimates, with the economic costs of the lockdowns likely amounting to at least $46 billion a month, or 3.1% of GDP, according to a researcher from Chinese University of Hong Kong. Several economists have already downgraded their growth forecasts for the first half of the year as lockdowns were expanded.

China’s Premier Li Keqiang reiterated Wednesday that China will stick to its full-year growth target despite new challenges and increased downward pressures on growth. He called on the nation to prioritize stable growth and to draft contingency plans to deal with possible greater uncertainties at a regular State Council meeting. Policies to stabilize growth should be rolled out as early as possible, while measures that would dampen market expectations should be avoided, he said. 
Shenzhen Lockdown
Companies like Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL). supplier Foxconn temporarily halted production in Shenzhen during a week-long lockdown of the city. In Changchun, an industrial hub that accounted for about 11% of China’s total annual car output in 2020, automakers like  Toyota  Motor (NYSE:TM) Corp. were forced to shut. Some businesses resumed production by adopting a so-called closed loop system in which workers were kept at factory locations and tested regularly. 
The disruptions affected “the stability of manufacturing supply chain,” Zhao said, noting the index measuring delivery time of suppliers fell to 46.5, the lowest since February 2020.
The index measuring new export orders dropped further into contraction, falling to 47.2 in March from 49 in the previous month. Orders were reduced or canceled at some companies due to the “recent escalation in geopolitical conflicts,” the NBS said.
Employment was also affected during the month, with the sub-index for manufacturing jobs dropping to 48.6 in March from 49.2 in February. 
“Some companies surveyed said due to the Covid impact, there was insufficient employees working in their posts, logistics were clogged, and delivery cycle was extended,” Zhao said.
In-person services sectors like restaurants and retail shops were hit hard by the renewed lockdowns and tightened social distancing measures, dragging the official non-manufacturing index lower. Economists say the damage to consumption could be deeper and more long-lasting than to production. 
The world’s second-largest economy was already struggling even before the current wave of outbreaks following a slump in the property market and weakness in consumer spending. The government has pledged more monetary and fiscal stimulus to help bolster the economy and meet a growth target of “around 5.5%” for the year.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japanese factories posted their first rise in output in three months in February as resilience in global demand led to a rebound in car production, a welcome sign for policymakers hoping to keep the country's fragile economic recovery on track.
The increase, however, was smaller than market expectations, underscoring the lingering impact of supply chain bottlenecks and other risks such as surging costs of raw materials.
Factory output rose 0.1% in February from the previous month, official data showed on Thursday, as growing production of cars and transport equipment offset a decline in chemicals.
That meant output returned to growth after slipping 0.8% in January and 1.0% in December. The increase was weaker than a 0.5% gain forecast in a Reuters poll of economists.
The outlook for the world's third-largest economy has weakened after energy and commodity prices soared following Russia's invasion of Ukraine last month. Prices for raw materials have surged, saddling exporters with higher input costs, while supply chain disruptions have increased.
""The situation in Ukraine is likely to worsen the parts shortage further,"" said Takumi Tsunoda, senior economist at Shinkin Central Bank Research.
""It feels like there's a risk the recovery in output will be delayed further.""
Japanese automakers and suppliers are also facing headwinds from coronavirus-related disruptions in China, the world's largest market.
Thursday's data showed output of cars and other motor vehicles gained 10.9% from the previous month in February, rebounding after a sharp contraction in January as pressure from parts shortages eased.
Manufacturers surveyed by the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) expected output to advance 3.6% in March and 9.6% in April.
But those forecasts, however, did not take into account any output disruptions caused by a powerful magnitude 7.4 earthquake that struck off Japan's northeastern coast on March 16, which led to plant shutdowns at  Toyota  Motor (NYSE:TM) Corp and other firms.

Japanese firms' production plans for the months ahead are increasingly far too optimistic, said Tom Learmouth, Japan economist at Capital Economics, highlighting possible risks going into next quarter. 
""Fresh headwinds of potential supply chain disruption in Russia and China may keep the handbrake on Japanese industrial production, pushing back any rebound until later in the year.""

Inflation in Russia has accelerated sharply in the past few weeks as the rouble's fall to an all-time low boosted demand for a wide range of goods, from food staples to cars, on expectations that their prices will rise even higher.
In February, annual inflation in Russia was at 9.15%.
Weekly inflation in Russia slowed to 1.16% in the week to March 25 from 1.93% a week earlier, taking the year-to-date increase in consumer prices to 8.91%, data from statistics service Rosstat showed on Wednesday.

In that week, prices on nearly everything from baby food to pharmaceuticals rose further but at a slower pace than in the previous weeks.
The central bank, which targets annual inflation at 4%, held its key rate at 20% in March and warned of an imminent spike in inflation and a looming economic contraction.

The total domestic debt stock climbed 2.3% in the period to 5.49 trillion reais, according to the Treasury. 
The average interest rate on the domestic federal debt increased to 9.5% in January from 8.9% in January, while the average rate on the new domestic debt issued in the 12 months to February rose to 9.25% from 8.92%.
The Treasury said in a statement that average issuance rates started the month at a lower level, but rose again from the second week onwards, in a period marked by inflationary pressures amid Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
Risk aversion continued through March, but the Treasury highlighted a recent easing in the yield curve, helped by the stronger currency performance and the central bank's signals that it should end its aggressive monetary tightening cycle to tame inflation. 
Brazil's benchmark interest rate has already risen to 11.75% from its record low of 2% last March and the central bank's chief Roberto Campos Neto indicated that a final 100-basis-point hike should wrap up the cycle in May.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -U.S. private employers maintained a brisk pace of hiring in March, in a boost to the labor market recovery, but growth in corporate profits slowed significantly in the fourth quarter amid increasing costs.
Private payrolls increased by 455,000 jobs last month, the ADP National Employment Report showed on Wednesday. Data for February was revised higher to show 486,000 jobs added instead of the initially reported 475,000. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast private payrolls would increase by 450,000 jobs.
Medium-sized and large companies accounted for 80% of the private jobs created last month. 
Manufacturers added 54,000 jobs, while the leisure and hospitality sector hired 161,000 more workers. There were also sizeable gains in professional and business services payrolls as well as healthcare and education. Trade, transportation and utilities companies also boosted hiring, but construction hiring slowed for a third straight month. 
Demand for workers is being boosted by the rolling back of COVID-19 restrictions across the country amid a massive decline in coronavirus cases. There is no sign that Russia's more than one-month long war against Ukraine has hurt the labor market.
First-time applications for unemployment benefits are at 52-1/2-year lows, while the number of Americans on jobless rolls is the smallest since 1970. 
The ADP report is jointly developed with Moody's (NYSE:MCO) Analytics and was published ahead of the Labor Department's more comprehensive and closely watched employment report for March on Friday. It has, however, a poor record predicting the private payrolls count in the department's Bureau of Labor Statistics employment report because of methodology differences.
""The ADP report hasn't proved a useful guide to the payrolls figures in recent months, but it does echo the fairly upbeat message from other indicators,"" said Andrew Hunter, a senior U.S. economist at Capital Economics.
U.S. stocks were mostly lower. The dollar fell against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury yields fell.
WORKER SHORTAGE 
Government data on Tuesday showed there were a near record 11.3 million job openings on the last day of February, which left the jobs-workers gap at 3.0% of the labor force and close to the post war high of 3.2% in December. According to a Reuters survey of economists, nonfarm payrolls likely increased by 490,000 jobs in March. The economy created 678,000 jobs in February.
But the upbeat news on the economy was dampened by a separate report from the Commerce Department on Wednesday showing that corporate profits growth slowed significantly in the fourth quarter as domestic financial corporations suffered a decrease. Profits of domestic nonfinancial corporations and from the rest of the world increased moderately. 
Corporate profits with inventory valuation and capital consumption adjustments increased at a 0.7% rate or $20.4 billion in the fourth quarter after rising at a 3.4% pace or $96.9 billion in the third quarter. Profits surged during the pandemic as demand shifted to goods from services.
Profit margins fell to 12.2% last quarter.
""While still elevated by historic comparison, the decline in margins suggests the higher-cost environment is eating into profitability,"" said Jay Bryson, chief economist at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) in Charlotte, North Carolina. ""With cost pressure remaining persistent and demand slowing, we expect margins to slow further this year as businesses find it increasingly difficult to pass costs onto consumers.""
The robust demand for goods has strained supply chains, with the COVID-19 pandemic sidelining millions of workers around the globe who are needed to produce goods at factories and move them to consumers. That has fueled inflation, which has worsened following the Feb. 24 invasion of Ukraine by Russia. 
The Federal Reserve this month raised its policy interest rate by 25 basis points, the first hike in more than three years and signaled an aggressive stance that has left the bond market fearing a recession down the road. The U.S. 2-year/10-year Treasury yield curve, widely tracked for signals on the economy, briefly inverted on Tuesday for the first time since September 2019.
But economists said the Fed's massive holdings of Treasuries and mortgage backed securities made it hard to get a clear read from the yield curve moves. 
""This is likely placing further downward pressure on longer- term rates, and it may only be once balance sheet reduction begins, likely in June, that we will get a better sense of how much this may be distorting long-term yields lower,"" said Andrew Hollenhorst, chief U.S. economist at  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) in New York.

Gross domestic product increased at a 6.9% annualized rate in the fourth quarter, the government said in its third estimate on Wednesday. The economy grew at a 2.3% rate in the third quarter. Growth is 3.1% above its pre-pandemic level. 
Economists expect the expansion to continue, with a tightening labor market and massive savings cushioning households against high inflation. Growth estimates for the first quarter are mostly below a 1.0% rate.

Gross domestic product increased at a 6.9% annualized rate, the Commerce Department said in its third estimate of fourth-quarter GDP growth. That was revised slightly down from the 7.0% pace estimated in February. 
The economy grew at a 2.3% rate in the third quarter. Growth is 3.1% above its pre-pandemic level. Economists polled by Reuters had expected GDP growth would be revised up to a 7.1% rate. The revision to the fourth-quarter GDP reading reflected downgrades to consumer spending and export growth.
For all of 2021, the economy grew 5.7%, the strongest since 1984, after the government provided nearly $6 trillion in pandemic relief. It contracted 3.4% in 2020, the biggest drop in 74 years.
But that's all in the rear-view mirror. An onslaught of coronavirus infections contributed to undercutting spending as well as disrupting activity at factories and services businesses early in the year. While infections have dramatically declined, leading to the rolling back of restrictions across the country, inflation is soaring as supply chains remain stretched.
The Federal Reserve this month raised its policy interest rate by 25 basis points, the first hike in more than three years and signaled an aggressive stance that has left the bond market fearing a recession down the road.

BERLIN (Reuters) -German annual inflation rose to its highest level in more than 40 years in March as prices of natural gas and oil products soared following Russia's invasion of Ukraine, preliminary data showed on Wednesday.
Consumer prices, harmonised to make them comparable with inflation data from other European Union countries (HICP), rose 7.6% on the year, a steep increase from 5.5% in February, the Federal Statistics Office said.
The national consumer price index (CPI) rose 7.3% year-on-year after recording an inflation rate of 5.1% in February, as companies and service providers passed on the massive rise in energy prices to customers.
Analysts polled by Reuters had expected the CPI rate to rise to 6.3% and the HICP figure to grow to 6.7%.
""Welcome back to the 1970s! At least as far as food, goods and energy prices are concerned,"" said Jens-Oliver Niklasch at Landesbank Baden-Wuerttemberg.
""The European Central Bank has no choice but to start tightening now,"" said KfW chief economist Fritzi Koehler-Geib in a view echoed by other experts, including Thomas Gitzel at VP Bank Group.
""If currency regulators stay relaxed, there is a risk that their later reaction will have to be all the more drastic. The U.S. Federal Reserve had this painful experience in the early 1980s,"" Gitzel said.
A similarly high inflation rate in Germany was last recorded in autumn 1981, when oil prices had jumped as a consequence of the first Iran–Iraq War, the statistics office said.
Economists said the inflation problem was not unique to Germany. Spain, for example, reported an inflation rate of just under 10% for March earlier on Wednesday.

""The ECB's mantra that inflation rates would be back to the ECB's target level of 2% from next year no longer works,"" Gitzel said. ""For the first time since it was founded, the ECB is in danger of losing its credibility.""
Preliminary inflation data from the German states of Saxony, North-Rhine Westphalia, Bavaria, Hesse, Brandenburg and Baden-Wuerttemberg had suggested annual consumer price inflation (CPI) in a range between 7% and 8%, coming to an average of 7.54%.

The broad-based 455,000 gain in payrolls followed a revised 486,000 increase in February, ADP Research Institute data showed Wednesday. The median forecast in a Bloomberg survey of economists called for a 450,000 advance.
The data are consistent with the Federal Reserve’s view that the labor market is robust and competition for workers remains intense, with many employers offering higher pay to woo job candidates. Fewer pandemic-related health concerns may also be encouraging more Americans to return to the job market as soaring inflation dents household finances.
The data precede the government’s monthly employment report on Friday, which is currently forecast to show that private payrolls increased by about a half million in March. The ADP figures don’t always follow the same pattern as the Labor Department’s data.
ADP’s payroll data represent firms employing nearly 26 million workers in the U.S.
Service Providers
“Businesses are hiring, specifically among the service providers which had the most ground to make up due to early pandemic losses,” Nela Richardson, chief economist at ADP, said in a statement. “However, a tight labor supply remains an obstacle for continued growth in consumer-facing industries.”
Service-provider employment rose by 377,000 in March, which included a 161,000 gain in leisure and hospitality. Other sectors like professional and business services and health care advanced.
Payrolls at goods producers increased by 79,000, reflecting a large jump in manufacturing.

The Mortgage Bankers Association (MBA) said the contract rate on a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage shot to 4.8% in the week ended March 25 from 4.5% a week earlier. That was the largest one-week increase since February 2011, and it brought mortgage rates to their highest level since December 2018.
Mortgage rates have now climbed by nearly 1.5 percentage points since the start of the year, the most rapid run-up in home borrowing costs since 1994.
With rates climbing so rapidly, mortgage application activity has fallen sharply in recent weeks. The MBA said its Market Composite Index, a measure of mortgage loan application volume, tumbled 6.8% on a seasonally adjusted basis to 425.1, the lowest level since December 2019.

The refinance index dropped 14.9% to the lowest since May 2019, while the purchase index was little changed, MBA said.
Yields on the U.S. Treasury securities that act as a benchmark for mortgage rates have surged in the last month after the Fed lifted its policy rate for the first time since 2018, and policymakers including Chair Jerome Powell have signaled since that they are prepared to raise rates faster and further in the year ahead to rein in inflation that is running at the highest pace in 40 years.

Russia's invasion of Ukraine and the ensuing economic fallout have fuelled inflation worldwide, especially through increasing prices of energy and grains.
Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez said more expensive electricity and fuel and non-processed food accounted for almost three-quarters of the overall CPI increase. Analysts polled by Reuters had expected 12-month CPI to rise to 8% in March. 
""It is bad data. Bad data that affects our economy, our society, particularly the more vulnerable groups,"" Sanchez told parliament.
Responding to concerns about the rising cost of living, his government passed a series of measures this week aimed at curbing energy prices. 
As inflation in the euro zone speeds up, top European Central Bank officials have insisted the rise is temporary, with ECB Chief Economist Philip Lane describing high inflation as an imported shock that will fade away over time.
""We would still diagnose that this essentially is an imported inflation shock, it's a supply shock,"" Lane said. ""Most of this inflation will fade away.""

Central banks are facing a complicated policy dilemma between keeping calm amid the market turmoil while also responding to mounting price pressures.

The European Commission's economic sentiment index for the 19 countries sharing the euro dropped to 108.5 in March from a downwardly revised 113.9 in February. Economists polled by Reuters had expected a decline to 109.0 points.
Consumer confidence was the hardest hit, plunging to -18.7 in March from -8.8 in February, while sentiment in industry fell to 10.4 from 14.1. Confidence in the retail sector also suffered, declining to 0.2 in March from 5.5 in February.

Only the services sector was more optimistic with the reading improving to 14.4 from 12.9, data showed.
Selling price expectations among manufacturers rose to a record high for the survey going back to 2000, of 58.1 in March from 49.8 in February. Consumer inflation expectations also rocketed to the highest ever value, reaching 59.8 points against 37.7 in February.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japanese retail sales fell in February for the first time in five months, as extended COVID-19 curbs hit service sector businesses, casting doubts over the prospects of a consumption-led recovery this quarter.
The government lifted coronavirus restrictions across the nation this week, but households remain guarded about rising prices, which have been driven by the Ukraine war and yen's sharp weakening.
Retail sales fell 0.8% in February from a year earlier, government data showed on Wednesday, much weaker than the median market forecast for a 0.3% decrease.
It followed a downwardly revised 1.1% rise in January and marked the first year-on-year contraction since September, when the Delta coronavirus variant overwhelmed hospitals across Japan.
Compared with the previous month, retail sales declined 0.8% on a seasonally adjusted basis in February, following an upwardly revised 0.9% fall in the previous month.
Throughout February, the government has kept curbs in place in most of urban areas across the nation, as coronavirus infections and death tallies hit the record-highs in the month due to the more infectious Omicron variant.

Russia's invasion of Ukraine and the subsequent global commodity rally since late February have posed more downside risks to the world's third-largest economy, which is heavily reliant on imported energy and raw materials.
To protect households and firms from surging costs, Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida on Tuesday instructed officials to draw up an economic relief package by the end of April.

The official manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) is expected to have eased to 49.9 in March, the lowest reading in five months, from 50.2 in February, according to the median forecast of 36 economists polled by Reuters on Wednesday. 
A reading below 50 indicates contraction from the previous month; anything above 50 indicates expansion.
""We lower our forecast for the official manufacturing PMI to 49.0 from 49.5 previously, in view of the worsening COVID-19 situation, especially in Shanghai. The contracting property sector and slowing export growth are also negative for the manufacturing PMIs in March,"" Nomura analysts said in a note on Friday. There is one official and one unofficial manufacturing PMI.
Following unexpectedly upbeat economic activity data from the National Bureau of Statistics for January and February, analysts warned March data may broadly worsen. 
""Almost all activity data point to a worsening slowdown in recent weeks, due mainly to the escalated anti-Omicron measures and the deteriorating property sector, and we believe the situation could worsen further in Q2,"" Nomura analysts said. 
The latest COVID-19 resurgence has brought about lockdowns in financial centre Shanghai and shutdowns in the tech hub of Shenzhen in March. Changchun, capital of the virus-hit northeastern province Jilin, has completed more than 10 rounds of citywide testing of its residents so far.
The rapidly deteriorating pandemic and escalating control measures added downward pressure on the world's second-largest economy. Premier Li Keqiang said on March the 2022 growth target for GDP was ""around 5.5%"".
China's stringent zero-COVID policy, anti-corruption scrutiny and stepped-up regulation of hidden local-government debt have changed the mindsets of local officials, analysts at Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) said in a note on Monday. Generating strong economic growth no longer seems to have its former priority.
With the economy suffering from virus outbreaks and facing such headwinds as uncertain future market effects of the Ukraine conflict, the government has pledged a slew of policies aimed at supporting small firms.
The finance ministry said on March 24 that some small firms would be exempted from paying the 3% value-added tax, because they are the country's main source of jobs.

The official PMI, which largely focuses on big and state-owned firms, and its sibling survey for the services sector, will be released on Thursday.
The private Caixin manufacturing PMI will be published on Friday. Analysts expect its headline reading will edge down to 50 from 50.4 the previous month.

133,By Bloomberg,"<span>Mar 29, 2022 09:18PM ET</span>",Japan’s Retail Sales Drop Adds to Fears of Stalled Recovery,"(Bloomberg) -- Japan’s retail sales fell for a third straight month in February amid the country’s biggest wave of virus infections adding to concern that the economy’s recovery may have slipped back into reverse.
Sales fell 0.8% in February from the month before, as shoppers cut back spending on clothes and accessories, the economy ministry reported Wednesday. Analysts had expected a 0.3% decline. Compared with the previous year, sales were down for the first time since September, also falling 0.8%.  
In a month when Japan saw new daily case numbers top 100,000 and restaurants and bars were asked to close early under quasi-emergency restrictions, consumers likely took on a more cautious stance. The last time sales fell in three straight months was at the height of the first wave of the pandemic in spring 2020.
The negative results supports the view that the world’s third largest economy stalled or contracted in the first quarter as consumption cratered. Most analysts said they expect Japan’s economy to shrink this quarter in a Bloomberg survey this month, as the omicron curbs and higher energy prices fueled partly by the war in Ukraine hit consumers. 
“Quasi-emergency restrictions cooled consumer sentiment. People are seeing their disposable incomes being cut with food and gasoline prices rising,” said Hiroaki Muto, economist at Sumitomo Life Insurance Co. He still sees the economy narrowly avoiding a contraction, though he warns that consumption will remain weak with wage growth still muted.
To aid consumers hit by rising energy costs fueled by the war and a weakening yen, Prime Minister Fumio Kishida ordered measures to cushion the blow to consumers and businesses on Tuesday. 
The response is also likely an attempt to keep public support buoyant ahead of a summer election and to ensure that a hoped-for rebound in consumer spending occurs after the lifting of restrictions earlier this month.
A subsidy program that attempts to cap gasoline prices at the pump was also extended through the end of April, according to trade minister Koichi Hagiuda.

“The new economic measures seem to focus on easing the pain for households rather than stimulating demand, which would accelerate inflation further,” Muto said. “So I see it is more for the elections than for the economy.”
If the weaker yen persists, driving already elevated import costs even higher, Kishida may be forced to take more steps to keep voters happy. 
Anecdotally, a broad range of companies is already raising prices on products, as businesses face input costs that are increasing at the fastest pace in four decades.
The need to take action rests largely with the government since the Bank of Japan remains committed to keeping its monetary stimulus in place, a factor that has helped drive the yen to its lowest level against the dollar since 2015. 
Following the BOJ’s monetary policy meeting earlier this month, Governor Haruhiko Kuroda stuck to his position that the weaker yen remains a positive overall.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. consumer confidence rebounded from a one-year low in March amid growing labor market optimism, but rising interest rates as the Federal Reserve battles raging inflation could hurt motor vehicle purchases and crimp consumer spending.
The labor market continues to favor workers, with other data on Tuesday showing job openings hovering near record highs in February. Tightening labor market conditions are boosting wages, providing some cushion against inflation. Consumers' one-year inflation expectations shot up to an all-time high of 7.9%.
""A strong job market is helping households shoulder the worsening burden of rising prices,"" said Tim Quinlan, a senior economist at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) in Charlotte. ""One of the few things still supportive of consumer confidence is the fact that the labor market remains exceptionally tight."" 
The Conference Board said its consumer confidence index rose to a reading of 107.2 this month from a downwardly revised 105.7 in February. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the index falling to 107.0 from February's initially reported 110.5.
The improvement in confidence followed the rolling back of COVID-19 restrictions across the country, and was despite gasoline prices remaining above $4.00 per gallon as Russia's war against Ukraine rages on.
Unlike the University of Michigan's consumer sentiment index, which fell to an 11-year low in March, the Conference Board survey puts more emphasis on the labor market.
The Conference Board's so-called labor market differential, derived from data on respondents' views on whether jobs are plentiful or hard to get, increased to a record high 47.4 this month from a reading of 41.5 in February. 
This measure correlates to the unemployment rate from the Labor Department. The jobless rate was at a two-year low of 3.8% in February.

Consumers' upbeat views of the labor market were underscored by the Labor Department's Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey, or JOLTS report showing job openings, a measure of labor demand, fell 17,000 to 11.266 million on the last day of February. Despite the second straight monthly decline, job openings were not too far from a record high of 11.448 million set in December. Economists had forecast 11 million vacancies.
Job openings in the finance and insurance sector fell by 63,000 and decreased 39,000 in the nondurable goods manufacturing industry. But vacancies rose by 32,000 in the arts, entertainment and recreation sector, while education services reported 26,000 additional openings.
The job openings rate was unchanged at 7.0%. Hiring increased 263,000 to 6.689 million, led by construction, but fell in the information sector. The hires rate climbed to 4.4% from 4.3% in January.

The jobs-workers gap is now at 3.0% of the labor force, which economists at Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) said ""suggests strong wage growth will persist until improvements in labor supply and normalization of job openings bring the labor market back into balance."" There were a record 1.8 open jobs per unemployed person in February.
More people voluntarily quit their jobs, pushing the total to 4.352 million from 4.258 million in January, another sign of labor market confidence. About 74,000 retail workers quit, while durable goods manufacturing saw 22,000 resignations. The quits rate rose to 2.9% from 2.8% in January.
U.S. stocks were trading higher amid signs of progress in peace talks between Russia and Ukraine. The dollar slipped against a basket of currencies. The widely tracked U.S. two-year/10-year Treasury yield curve inched closer to inversion, a signpost of recession, as traders bet that aggressive policy tightening by the Fed could hurt the economy over the longer term.
INFLATION EXPECTATIONS SOAR 
Consumers' inflation expectations over the next 12 months accelerated to 7.9%, the highest since the series started in 1987, from 7.1% in February. With inflation expectations surging, fewer consumers planned to buy cars over the next six months. But intentions to buy big-ticket items like refrigerators and washing machines increased. 
Plans to buy a house were unchanged, remaining below January's high reading as rising mortgage rates, combined with soaring prices, make home purchasing unaffordable, especially for first-time buyers. Still, demand for housing remains underpinned by the strong labor market.
The 30-year fixed mortgage rate is well above 4%. The Fed this month increased its policy interest rate by 25 basis points, the first hike in more than three years. Fed Chair Jerome Powell has said the U.S. central bank must move ""expeditiously"" to raise rates and possibly ""more aggressively"" to keep high inflation from becoming entrenched. 
House prices continue to march higher as builders struggle to bridge the supply gap because of shortages and higher prices for inputs like softwood lumber for framing, as well as cabinets, garage doors, countertops and appliances.
A third report showed the S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller's 20 metropolitan area home price index increased 19.1% on a year-on-year basis in January after rising 18.6% in December. Cities like Miami, San Diego, Las Vegas, Denver, Los Angeles and San Francisco scored hefty increases.

Strong house price inflation was reinforced by a fourth report from the Federal Housing Finance Agency showing home prices accelerated 18.2% in the 12 months through January after advancing 17.7% in December. Annual price growth in excess of 20% was recorded in the Mountain, Pacific, South Atlantic and East South Central regions.
""We expect house prices will continue on their upward trajectory in coming quarters, although growth will slow from its rapid pace experienced over the past year and a half,"" said Brent Campbell, an economist at Moody's (NYSE:MCO) Analytics in West Chester, Pennsylvania.

The Conference Board said on Tuesday its consumer confidence index rose to a reading of 107.2 this month from a downwardly revised 105.7 in February. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the index decreasing to 107.0 from the initially reported reading of 110.5 in February.

The large downward revision to February put that reading at the lowest in a year. Russia invaded Ukraine in late February, an event that triggered a global surge in oil prices, which sent U.S. gasoline prices to a record high earlier this month. 
""The Present Situation Index rose substantially, suggesting economic growth continued into late (in the first quarter),"" said Lynn Franco, senior director of economic indicators at The Conference Board in Washington. ""Expectations, on the other hand, weakened further with consumers citing rising prices, especially at the gas pump, and the war in Ukraine as factors.""

Economists in a Reuters poll forecast 210,000 jobs would be created in Latin America's largest economy last month.
The figure, however, came below the 397,463 jobs created in February 2021, according to adjusted figures.
The Economy Ministry has been saying that job creation would help fuel an improving economy in 2022, though analysts continue to predict a severe negative impact on activity from double-digit interest rates and high inflation.
A net 215,421 jobs were created in the services sector in February, with industry gaining 43,000. There were 39,453 net jobs created in construction, 17,415 in agriculture and 13,219 in commerce.
The figures do not include the country's nearly 40 million undocumented workers, who do not have formal employment registration.
The number of formally registered workers rose to 41.2 million in February, an increase of 0.8% from the previous month, the ministry said.
In the first two months of this year, a net 478,862 jobs were created, down from 651,756 in the same period last year.

PARIS (Reuters) -France and Germany saw bigger than expected drops in consumer confidence this month as rising inflation and concern about the impact of Russia's invasion of Ukraine took their toll, surveys showed on Tuesday.
The European Central Bank insists the euro zone can avoid recession, but the collapse in consumer morale in its two top economies is a setback. Italy, the third largest economy, is due to downgrade its growth targets, sources in Rome said.
In Germany, the GfK institute said its consumer sentiment index, based on a survey of around 2,000 people, dropped to -15.5 points heading into April from a revised -8.5 points a month earlier and the lowest since February 2021.
""In February, hopes were still high that consumer sentiment would recover with the easing of pandemic-related restrictions. However, the war in Ukraine caused these hopes to vanish into thin air,"" GfK consumer expert Rolf Buerkl said in a statement.
Economists polled by Reuters had on average expected the index to drop to -14.0.
In France, the INSEE official statistics agency said its consumer confidence index fell to 91 points from 97 in February, falling short of economists' expectations in a Reuters poll for 94 and the worst headline figure since February 2021.
""A fall of that extent is rare,"" BNP analysts commented in a note that observed that sharper monthly drops had only previously occurred around the 1993 recession and the 2020 lockdown.
NO PRE-ELECTION BOUNCE
The result also ran counter to the improving trend usually seen ahead of presidential elections when optimism rises that a new political order will translate into improved standards of living.
Ahead of next month's French election, the government has put together a package of measures worth 25 billion euros ($27 billion) to reduce the pain of high energy prices and inflation.
But that did little to ease inflation fears with the proportion of households expecting inflation to increase jumping by 50 points to its highest since INSEE's survey began in 1972.
As part of the government measures, France has capped increases in gas and power prices, made one-off anti-inflation payouts to low-income households and offered a rebate on fuel prices.
In Germany, the ruling coalition agreed last week on a second package of measures in as many months to give people relief from soaring power, heating and fuel costs.
Under the 17 billion euro package, German workers and families will receive extra public cash, a tax cut on petrol and cut-price public transport tickets.
Separately, the trade union-linked IMK institute forecast Germany's economy would grow more slowly than expected and could even contract this year due to the war in Ukraine. 
Its analysts predicted a base scenario of 2.1% growth - less than half the 4.5% they saw for 2022 back in December - but said a worst-case scenario including much higher energy prices could even see a 0.3% contraction.
The deteriorating consumer confidence is not limited to France and Germany.
Based on a flash estimate last Wednesday, euro zone sentiment collapsed in March to 18.7 points, the lowest level since the start of the COVID-19 crisis in April and May 2020.
Italy, the euro zone's third-largest economy, also saw a bigger than expected decline in consumer confidence, the national statistics office said last week.
On Tuesday sources close to the matter told Reuters that Mario Draghi's government is preparing next week to slash its 2022 growth forecast to 2.8% from a previous 4.7% goal set in September due to surging energy costs and turmoil linked to Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
The Ukraine war also caused the steepest decline in Belgian consumer confidence since records began in 1985, while Dutch consumer morale dropped to its lowest level in nine years in March.

Economists polled by Reuters this month expect the euro zone to grow 3.8% this year and 2.5% next, marginally down from 3.9% and 2.5% predicted last month.

Price increases peaked in July and have cooled off slightly in recent months. Still, demand for homes remains strong two years after the pandemic hit the U.S., with bidding wars and cash offers common in hot markets. 
A lack of properties to buy has combined with rising mortgage rates to keep some potential buyers on the sidelines, particularly renters trying to crack into the market.

The INSEE official stats agency said its consumer confidence index fell to 91 points from 97 in February, plunging steeply in the wake of Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
The result, the lowest since February 2021, fell short of economists' forecasts for 94 points on average in a Reuters poll and flew in the face of a improving trend observed ahead of previous presidential elections. France has a presidential election next month. 

The share of households expecting inflation to increase over the coming year jumped 50 points to the highest level since the survey began in 1972, INSEE said.
With the election looming next month, the government has budgeted more than 25 billion euros ($27 billion) in measures to cap gas and power prices, make inflation offsetting handouts to low-income households and offer a rebate on fuel prices.

Shenzhen's recent ""war"" on COVID-19 has hurt up to 93% of the local small and medium-sized companies surveyed by the state-controlled newspaper, with many suffering production disruptions due to shutdowns, interruptions in supply chains, and delays in order executions. 
Shenzhen allowed businesses and factories to restart operations on March 21 after authorities declared the latest outbreak had been brought under control.
The city, which has grappled with multiple outbreaks so far this year, conducted three rounds of mass testing in March after a spike in infections.
The outbreaks were modest by international standards, but Shenzhen authorities were swift to implement measures including business shutdowns under China's so-called ""dynamic"" zero-COVID policy.
In the Securities Times survey, 93% of the 97 companies that responded said the epidemic had raised their operating expenses, including labour, logistics and raw materials costs. 
About half of them had 100 to 500 employees, while 26% commanded a labour force of over 500. 
Compounding their woes, they said, has been difficulty in accessing financing. 
More worrying than the short-term effect of the shutdowns is the long-term contraction in demand caused by the epidemic, the newspaper warned, citing a ""profound"" impact on Chinese demand from COVID-19. 
Companies complained about changes in consumer behaviour from delays in surgical operations to purchases of new mobile phones. 
Data on China's factory and services sector for March due out in coming days are expected to reflect the COVID-related pain. 
The epicentre of China's COVID containment efforts has since moved to Shanghai, where the megacity of 26 million residents is facing its worst flare-up since China's initial 2020 outbreak. 
Beijing has vowed to stabilise economic growth in a year when President Xi Jinping is expected in the autumn to secure a third term as leader in a once-in-five-years congress of the ruling Communist Party. 

""Although Beijing on some occasions has also called to minimise the economic cost of (its zero-COVID strategy), local government officials in practice have been ratcheting up mandatory mass testing and social distancing measures in fear of being accused of dereliction of duty,"" Nomura said. 
""The consequence is that China's economy faces the most severe pressure since the spring of 2020.""

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australian retail sales beat forecasts again in February as shoppers defied storms and coronavirus waves to return to cafes and department stores for the second-best month ever of spending.
Data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics out on Tuesday showed retail sales climbed 1.8% in February from the previous month to A$33.1 billion ($24.76 billion), handily beating forecasts of a 1.0% gain.
That left sales up a huge 9.1% on February last year and followed a surprisingly upbeat 1.6% gain in January, suggesting household spending overall was set for a strong first quarter.
""Most discretionary spending industries experienced strong rises once again as consumer cautiousness lessened, leading to an increase in mobility and improved business conditions,"" said Ben James, an ABS director of statistics.
Cafes and restaurants saw gains of 9.7% in February, from the previous month, while the department store and clothing sectors both climbed more than 11%.
The splurge looks to have continued with the latest card data from Commonwealth Bank of Australia (OTC:CMWAY) (CBA) showing further gains in the two weeks to March 25 as flooding on the east coast caused only a brief dip.
""Spending on recreation continued its recent strength with clothing and footwear and dining out also strengthening in the fortnight,"" said CBA economist Harry Ottley. ""Spending on transport remained elevated, reflecting high petrol prices.""
The record cost of petrol has been punishing for consumer sentiment, however, with ANZ Bank's weekly survey showing the mood on personal finances was the worst since the depths of the pandemic in mid-2020.
The rising cost of living has become a hot political issue ahead of an election expected in May and the government will try to use its budget later on Tuesday to appease voters with cash handouts and temporary cuts to fuel taxes.
The ANZ survey also showed consumer inflation expectations surging to decade highs, a headache for the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) which is weighing when to start raising interest rates from all-time lows of 0.1%.
The central bank has said it would be patient in the hope wages would pick up, and a hike was likely later in the year. 

Markets are wagering it will have to act much more aggressively to head off inflation and have a rise to 0.25% priced in by June, and then a string of hikes to at least 1.75% by year end.

(Reuters) -U.S. new vehicle sales could fall to the lowest first-quarter volume in the past decade as chip shortages and the Ukraine crisis squeeze inventories and rising prices push less affluent buyers out of the market, research firm Cox Automotive said Monday. 
U.S. car and light truck sales are expected to fall more than 24% to about 1.22 million units in March and decline more than 16% in the first quarter. 
""Make no mistake, this market is stuck in low gear,"" said Charlie Chesbrough, senior economist at Cox Automotive, adding that sales will remain at current levels until supply improves.
Cox forecasters said the U.S. economy should not experience a recession. But Cox cut its forecast for U.S. car and light truck sales in all of 2022 to 15.3 million vehicles, down 700,000 vehicles from its January outlook. And even hitting the new target will require significant improvement in supply chain disruptions, Cox said.
Fresh lockdowns in China as well as Russia's invasion of Ukraine have reignited supply bottlenecks that were easing over recent months. Tight supplies have pushed new vehicle prices to record high levels.
Detroit's mainstream brands and Nissan (OTC:NSANY) Motor Corp are getting hurt as less affluent consumers leave the new vehicle market, Cox analysts said during a call. 
Households with less than $75,000 in annual income now account for nearly two percentage points less of the U.S. light vehicle market than a year ago, Chesbrough said. The average income of a new vehicle buyer is now $124,000.

Detroit mainstream brands such as Chevrolet are losing market share, while Cox predicted Japan's Toyota could be the top selling automaker in the U.S. market for the first quarter.
""Long-term, you are shrinking the pool of people who are likely to buy"" a new vehicle, said Cox Chief Economist Jonathan Smoke.

144,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 28, 2022 11:31AM ET</span>",U.S. goods trade deficit narrows in February; still near record highs,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. trade deficit in goods narrowed in February, but the fall reversed only a fraction of the surge to a record high in January, suggesting that trade would again weigh on economic growth in the first quarter.
Though the advance indicators report from the Commerce Department on Monday showed businesses continuing to restock last month, the pace slowed from late 2021, implying that there would probably be no contribution to gross domestic product growth from inventory investment either.
""We think trade might subtract about two-three percentage points from GDP growth in the first quarter,"" said Daniel Silver, an economist at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) in New York. ""While it looks likely to us that the real change in inventories will be strong again, it may end up comparable to the large increase reported for the fourth quarter and therefore inventories could be fairly close to a neutral factor for GDP growth in first quarter."" 
The trade deficit last month fell 0.9% to $106.6 billion, the Commerce Department said on Monday. The goods trade deficit hit an all-time high of $107.6 billion in January.
Exports increased 1.2% to $157.2 billion. Economists believe exports, which were not adjusted for inflation, were flattered by higher prices rather than increased volumes. A blockade of U.S-Canada border crossings by Canadian truck drivers last month likely reduced export volumes. 
The government will publish February's comprehensive trade report, which will include country data, next Tuesday. 
Last month's rise in goods exports was led by a 6.3% surge in shipments of consumer goods. Food exports accelerated 3.6%, while industrial supplies increased 2.6%. But motor vehicle exports dropped 3.4% as production continued to be hampered by a global semiconductor shortage. There were also substantial declines in exports of capital goods and other goods.
IMPORT GROWTH MODERATES
Imports of goods gained 0.3% to $263.7 billion. They were curbed by a 9.9% decline in imports of motor vehicles as well as a 3.0% drop in food imports. But there were strong increases in imports of industrial supplies and other goods. 
Capital goods imports also rose as did consumer goods, pointing to strong business and consumer spending. Trade has subtracted from gross domestic product growth for six straight quarters. A shift in spending from services to goods during the COVID-19 pandemic led to a boom in imports as domestic manufacturers struggled with snarled supply chains.
A resurgence in coronavirus infections in China and Russia's war against Ukraine could worsen supply constraints.
""The strong economic recovery in the U.S. from the pandemic has supported imports while a relatively slower global economic recovery has weighed on exports,"" said Abbey Omodunbi, a senior economist at PNC Financial (NYSE:PNC) in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. 
""The goods trade outlook is cloudy. New lockdowns in Shanghai and increased uncertainties from the Russia-Ukraine crisis will weigh on U.S. exports.""
Businesses continued to replenish inventories in February, though the pace was less frantic than towards the end of last year. Wholesale stocks increased 2.1% after climbing 1.1% in January. Retail inventories rose 1.1% in February following a 1.9% advance in January. 
Motor vehicle inventories gained 0.9% after surging 2.5% in January. Excluding motor vehicles, retail inventories increased 1.2% after accelerating 1.7% in January. This component goes into the calculation of GDP growth. 
Inventory investment accelerated at a robust seasonally adjusted annualized rate of $171.2 billion in the fourth quarter, contributing 4.90 percentage points to the quarter's 7.0% growth pace. 
Despite February's solid rise, inventories are likely to be neutral to GDP growth this quarter as they would need to increase at a faster rate than in the fourth quarter to contribute to growth. First-quarter GDP growth estimates are mostly below a 1.0% pace. 

Some economists believe the pace of inventory investment is sufficient to contribute to GDP growth this year. 
""These strong levels are broadly consistent with our view that inventory investment will provide solid support for GDP this year, with inventories remaining very low in relation to sales after having been pared in earlier stages of the pandemic,"" said Jonathan Millar, an economist at  Barclays  (LON:BARC) in New York.

145,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 27, 2022 08:40PM ET</span>","China industrial profits up, but mired in single-digit growth","BEIJING (Reuters) -Profit growth at China's industrial firms accelerated in January-February in line with other signs of momentum in the economy, although the outlook clouded by COVID-19 outbreaks and the war in Ukraine is stoking calls for supportive measures.
Profits rose 5.0% in from a year earlier, up from a 4.2% gain in December, the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) said on Sunday.
The growth in January-February was driven by surging profits in the energy and raw materials sectors, thanks to higher prices of commodities such as crude oil and coal. January and February data are typically combined to smooth out distortions from the Lunar New Year holiday, which can fall in either month. 
Downstream, monthly profit growth among other industrial firms has been weighed down by high raw material costs, languishing in the single-digits since November.
The slightly faster industrial profit growth was in step with improvement in NBS data on industrial output, retail sales and fixed-asset investment in January-February, suggesting the impact of recent policy measures were starting to be felt. 
Still, challenges have emerged this year including China's most serious COVID outbreak since early in the pandemic in 2020, driven by the Omicron variant, threatening to disrupt local economies and further chill consumer spending. 
""The gap between upstream and downstream profit margins widened as downstream profit margins fell further,"" Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) analysts wrote in a note. 
""We expect the COVID outbreak in multiple provinces to weigh on industrial profits in the near term.""
Given the coronavirus flare-ups, policies to further ease monetary and fiscal measures can be expected, they said. 
The financial hub of Shanghai has been battling with its worst COVID spell in the past month since the initial outbreak in China two years ago.
UKRAINE 
Global upheavals such as Russia's attack on Ukraine have also created uncertainty over international supply chains and the potential for even higher commodity and energy prices, ultimately weighing on the bottom line of Chinese firms.
""The countries in conflict are important exporters of energy and agricultural products, and comprehensive sanctions on Russia may have a huge negative impact on global supply chains,"" according to an opinion piece in state-controlled China Daily on Monday. 
""As the current positive manner of economic performance is hard-won and potential risks still exist, China should launch expansionary policies as soon as possible to protect incipient recovery.""
Vice Premier Liu He said recently that Beijing will take measures to boost the economy in the first quarter and that monetary policy would be set to support growth.
To ease financial burdens for smaller firms, China has pledged around 1.5 trillion yuan ($240 billion) in value-added tax (VAT) rebates.
The finance ministry said on Thursday China will exempt the 3% VAT levied on some small firms, the country's main source of jobs.

The Ifo institute said its business climate index dropped to 90.8 in March from a downwardly revised 98.5 in February. A Reuters poll of analysts had pointed to a March reading of 94.2.
""The message from Germany's most important economic barometer is clear: the German economy is very likely to slide into recession,"" said Thomas Gitzel, chief economist at VP Bank Group.
The publication of the purchasing managers' index on Thursday gave some hope the German economy had so far been able to absorb the economic consequences of the war, but Friday's Ifo index ""teaches us otherwise,"" Gitzel said.
""The extreme divergence between the situation and expectations is typical. Even if not much has actually happened, uncertainty due to the war is very high,"" said Jens-Oliver Niklasch, senior economist at Landesbank Baden-Wuerttemberg.
Ultimately, the uncertainty goes far beyond the Ukraine war, raising questions about the sustainability of Germany's business model, said Andreas Scheuerle at Decabank, pointing to the one-sided dependence of Europe's largest economy on supplier and customer countries.
According to Commerzbank (DE:CBKG)'s Joerg Kraemer, companies are particularly afraid of such risks as a Western boycott of Russian oil, which would lead leave the market considerably undersupplied and catapult the prices upwards.
The index for business expectations also fell to 85.1 from 98.4, the sharpest plunge since the outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic.
At the moment, two-thirds of industrial companies want to raise their prices more than ever before and retailers are also looking to follow suit, Ifo economic expert Klaus Wohlrabe told Reuters.
""This is a domino effect,"" he said.

The service sector can initially rejoice at the easing of COVID-19 curbs, but trouble is looming on the horizon as filling up the car tank has become a burden and families will have to cut down on leisure activities, Gitzel said.
At the same time, the relief package announced by the German government on Thursday is nowhere near enough to compensate for the increased costs, Gitzel said.

Pending home sales declined in the South, Midwest and West, but rose in the Northeast. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast contracts rebounding 1.0%. Pending home sales decreased 5.4% in February on a year-on-year basis.
""A lack of supply that is showing few signs of easing is boosting prices and impacting affordability,"" said Rubeela Farooqi, chief U.S. economist at High Frequency Economics in White Plains, New York. ""Further increases in mortgage rates as the Fed hikes and starts balance sheet reduction will be an additional constraint for sales going forward.""
Sales of previously owned homes tumbled in February, but remained above their pre-pandemic level. The inventory of used houses is at record lows. Shortages and expensive building materials have made it harder for builders to ramp up construction, leading to double-digit growth in houses prices. 
Mortgage rates surged in February and have continued to push higher after the Federal Reserve last week raised its policy interest rate by 25 basis points, the first hike in more than three years. They are likely to continue accelerating as Fed Chair Jerome Powell on Monday said the U.S. central bank must move ""expeditiously"" to raise rates and possibly ""more aggressively"" to keep high inflation from becoming entrenched.
The 30-year fixed rate averaged 4.42% this week, the highest since January 2019, from 4.16% in the prior week, data from mortgage finance agency  Freddie Mac  (OTC:FMCC) showed on Thursday.
According to the NAR, higher mortgage rates and sustained house price inflation had resulted in a 28% year-over-year jump in mortgage payments as of February. 
U.S. stocks were mostly higher. The dollar slipped against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices fell.
GASOLINE PRICES STABILIZING 
Other data on Friday confirmed that consumer sentiment wobbled in March as gasoline prices surged to a record high in the wake of Russia's war against Ukraine, lifting one-year inflation expectations to the highest level since 1981. 
The University of Michigan's final consumer sentiment index dropped to 59.4 in March, the lowest reading since August 2011. It was slightly revised down from the preliminary reading of 59.7 earlier in the month. The index was at 62.8 in February and it has now declined for three straight months.
Some economists viewed the modest revision from early this month as a sign that the worst was over and than ebb in sentiment could be coming to an end.
The survey places more emphasis on gasoline prices and the stock market. The Conference Board's consumer confidence index, which puts more weight on the labor market, remains well above its COVID-19 pandemic lows. 
Gasoline prices appear to be stabilizing after setting a record high of $4.331 per gallon on March 11. Prices averaged $4.243 per gallon on Friday, according to AAA.
Economists maintained that the continued slump in the University of Michigan's sentiment index was overdone relative to fundamentals and they expected the economy to continue growing. First-time applications for unemployment benefits are at a 52-1/2-year low and wages are rising at a strong clip.
There were 11.3 million job openings at the end of January. Consumers have accumulated more than $2 trillion in excess savings, which should help to cushion the blow from high inflation. The share of consumers planning to buy motor vehicles increased compared to February, while intentions to purchase major household items rose modestly. Home buying plans fell.

""The continuing weakness in confidence does not warrant any immediate change to our near-term forecast for consumer spending as the relationship between spending and sentiment is loose,"" said Scott Hoyt, a senior economist at Moody's (NYSE:MCO) Analytics in West Chester, Pennsylvania.
Consumers' inflation expectations were unchanged from earlier this month. The survey's one-year inflation expectations jumped to 5.4%, the highest since November 1981, from 4.9% in February. Its five-year inflation expectations held steady at 3.0% for a second straight month.

BRASILIA (Reuters) - Inflation in Brazil grew more than expected in the month to mid-March, the biggest jump for that period in seven years, data showed on Friday, underscoring across-the-board price pressures despite aggressive monetary tightening led by the central bank. 
Brazil's official IPCA-15 consumer price index rose 0.95% in the month, down from 0.99% in February but above the median forecast in a Reuters poll of a 0.87% increase.
According to IBGE statistics agency, all nine groups of products and services surveyed recorded higher prices, especially food and beverages, which rose 1.95% over the previous month.
Inflation in the 12 months to mid-March climbed to 10.79%, also above the 10.69% projection in the poll. 
That is far from the central bank's year-end target of 3.5%, reflecting an already complex domestic inflationary dynamic that was further impacted by the surge in commodity prices after Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

Brazil's central bank chief Roberto Campos Neto said inflation should peak in April, stressing that the short-term figure will be a ""little higher"" than previously expected by policymakers.
Earlier this month, the central bank raised the country's benchmark interest rate by 100 basis points to 11.75%, from a record-low of 2 last March, and signaled another hike of the same size in May. That could wrap up a rate hike cycle that should weigh on the economy this year.

TORONTO (Reuters) - Toronto realtor Nasma Ali has noted a marked slowdown in housing demand in the red-hot Greater Toronto Area over the past few weeks, which she sees as a likely precursor to a reckoning in the suburbs and surrounding towns that have seen blistering price growth over the past two years. 
""I had listings that, in January, would have had a 100+ showings,"" Ali, chief executive of broker One Group, said. ""All of a sudden, we're only getting five to six in four days. This is a transition period and it's not for all markets or price points. But we're seeing it."" 
Already, homes listed for sale in supply-constrained Toronto have fallen at a slower pace than sales in February from a year earlier, compared with most of last year when listings lagged sales.
The slowdown in major cities like Toronto and Vancouver and their surrounding areas appears to be gathering steam, driven by a confluence of factors.

Worsening housing affordability, rising fixed and variable mortgage rates, and accelerating inflation following Russia's invasion of Ukraine is shifting sentiment.
Record-low mortgage rates helped propel Canadian home prices 52% higher over the past two years. But as fixed mortgage rates rip higher alongside surging bond yields and variable rates climb following the Bank of Canada's first hike in three years, demand is cooling. 
Money markets are betting the central bank will increase its policy rate to 2.25% by year-end, up from a current 0.5%. [BOCWATCH]
""This is the most dramatic increase in five-year fixed rates that I can remember, and I've been in this business for two decades,"" said David Larock, a mortgage agent at Integrated Mortgage Planners. ""I'm starting to see purchase and sale agreements come in with financing conditions, which has been unheard of in the last couple of years,"" he said.
Marnie Bennett, owner of Bennett Property Shop Realty in Ottawa, said she has seen a shift in the market, particularly at the lower end, as affordability concerns dissuade first-time buyers, and investors cash out near the peak. 
""It's only because interest rates are so low that there's any affordability left,"" said BMO Capital Markets Senior Economist Sal Guatieri. ""But that affordability will erode pretty quickly,"" he said, adding the central bank's rate hikes ""will douse the flames somewhat.""
While that is unlikely to cause major damage to household finances, it will put pressure on marginal buyers, he said.
Pedro Antunes, chief economist at the Conference Board of Canada, expects a decline of about 10% in home prices from peak to trough, driven by the end of pandemic income supports, rising interest rates and the return to more normal consumer spending patterns. 
""People are going to start taking their vacation trips south and perhaps not be ready to put quite as much into a new mortgage,"" he said.
Despite the softness, both Toronto and Vancouver have seen price growth of 27% and 20% respectively from a year ago. Prices are up 20.6%, on average, nationwide.

""It's still a seller's market,"" said Toronto realtor Lisa Bednarski at BSpoke Realty. ""But what we're going to stop seeing are the homes that sell for inexplicable amounts above their market values.""

Fuelled by a strong post-pandemic recovery, industrial prices had been soaring in Spain even before Russia's invasion of Ukraine exerted additional pressure on power costs. 
Prices rose 40.7% in February, the highest level since the data series began in January 1976, led by a 114.4% increase in energy costs compared with the same month last year.
Capital goods rose 4.6%, boosted by increased costs facing carmakers, INE said.

Companies tend to pass on industrial price rises to customers, fuelling inflation. In recent months, energy prices and inflation have soared in European countries, with Spanish inflation is running at its fastest pace in 35 years.
Russia's invasion of Ukraine and the ensuing economic fallout has dented hopes that price rises will ease any time soon and the European Union's southern countries, including Spain, have called for the bloc to adopt common energy policies to face the situation.

151,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 25, 2022 05:06AM ET</span>",UK retail sales and consumer confidence fall as inflation mounts,"By William Schomberg
LONDON (Reuters) -Britons cut back on their shopping in February and consumer confidence levels tumbled this month as accelerating inflation cast a shadow over the world's fifth-biggest economy, data released on Friday showed.
Retail sales volumes unexpectedly fell by 0.3% in February from January. Economists polled by Reuters had on average forecast a 0.6% monthly rise. 
Excluding automotive fuel, which rose in price in February as tensions between Russia and Ukraine escalated, sales volumes fell by a sharper 0.7%.
Some of the fall was linked by the Office for National Statistics to stormy weather which kept some shoppers at home while the fading of the Omicron COVID-19 meant people returned to pubs and restaurants at expense of grocery retailers. 
But rising prices meant the amount of money spent on food shopping rose, even as volumes fell.
Analysts said the data - combined with a drop in polling firm GfK's measure of consumer confidence in March to levels last seen in November 2020 - was a taste of things to come as inflation climbs higher.
GfK's gauge of personal finances for the coming year slumped to a joint record low, matched only by the reading in July 2008 when the global financial crisis was reaching a climax.
Inflation hit a 30-year high of 6.2% in February and the government's budget watchdog this week forecast it will go close to 9% in late 2022, contributing to the biggest fall in living standards since at least the 1950s.
""Against that backdrop, it seems all but inevitable that households will continue to pare back spending in the coming month,"" Bethany Beckett, an economist with Capital Economics, said. 
Finance minister Rishi Sunak announced tax cuts this week that he said would help to ease the squeeze on households, but analysts said his plan did little to help those on lowest incomes.
There were some bright spots for retailers.
The easing of the coronavirus crisis, and the subsequent increase in people socialising and returning to workplaces, led to a 13% leap in clothing sales in February from January.
The share of online sales in value terms was its lowest since March 2020 at 27.8% but overall sales were 3.7% above their pre-coronavirus levels of February 2020.

Volumes of fuel bought surpassed their pre-pandemic levels for the first time, although the amount of money spent on fuel grew more quickly, reflecting the higher prices.
Compared with a year earlier, overall sales volumes were up by 7.0%, short of the 7.8% growth expected in the Reuters poll.

152,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 24, 2022 09:46PM ET</span>",Core inflation in Tokyo hits 2-year high as energy costs soar,"By Yoshifumi Takemoto and Kantaro Komiya
TOKYO (Reuters) -Core consumer prices in Japan's capital rose at the fastest pace in more than two years in March, propelled by energy costs that have hit a four-decade high following Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
The relentless uptrend in global commodity prices could ruin Japan's fragile recovery from the pandemic, even as domestic COVID-19 infections wane and social distancing curbs are reduced, analysts say.
The Tokyo core consumer price index (CPI), which excludes volatile fresh food but includes energy items, rose 0.8% year-on-year in March, the fastest pace since December 2019. It was also quicker than a median market forecast for a 0.7% gain and the 0.5% rise in February.
""While Japan's recovery from the pandemic remains slow, reopening Western economies have propped up global inflation before Japan could reopen its economy,"" said Toru Suehiro, senior economist at Daiwa Securities.
""Now prices are rising further on the Ukraine (war), which is such an ill-timed curb on consumption for Japanese economy.""
The inflation measure in Japan's capital is considered a leading indicator of the nationwide core CPI that is released around a month later.
A 26.1% surge in energy prices - the fastest annual growth in 41 years - drove up the Tokyo core CPI for March, the data showed.
However, gasoline price inflation has slowed from February thanks to fuel subsidies the government expanded earlier this month.
Prices also increased among a wide range of items from wheat-based food to entertainment services.
In the overall reading that includes fresh food prices, Tokyo CPI in March rose 1.3% from a year earlier, hitting the highest since April 2019.
But the one-off effect of cuts in cellphone fees stripped 1.08 points off the overall index, it showed.
Even before Russia's invasion of Ukraine, Japan's central bank had expected core inflation to approach its elusive 2% target, according to the minutes of their January meeting released on Thursday.
Prime Minister Fumio Kishida is set to instruct his cabinet next week to draw up new relief, such as fuel subsidies and other measures for households.
In April, part of the special mobile fee effect disappears, but the government's expected extension of fuel subsidies may prevent Japan's core CPI reading from flaring up much higher than 2%, Daiwa's Suehiro said.

Cost hikes driven by the Ukraine conflict will take roughly six months to reach consumer electricity and gas bills, so the inflationary blow to Japanese households will culminate later this year, Suehiro said.
""I expect an around 2% (core) inflation to continue until the end of 2022,"" he said. ""Economic growth in April-June will still be solid thanks to a rebound in service spending...but I'm worried about July-September and later.""

153,By Bloomberg,"<span>Mar 24, 2022 08:18PM ET</span>",Tokyo Inflation Hits Fastest Clip in Two Years on Energy,"(Bloomberg) -- The cost of living in Tokyo increased by the biggest margin in more than two years this month as the impact of surging oil prices prompted another acceleration of inflation.
Consumer prices excluding fresh food climbed 0.8% in the capital in March from a year earlier, according to the ministry of internal affairs Friday. Economists had expected an increase of 0.7%. Price moves in Tokyo are a leading indicator for national inflation. 
Even with the acceleration, inflation in Tokyo still remains well below the Bank of Japan’s 2% target and is unlikely to nudge Governor Haruhiko Kuroda to follow his global peers in tightening policy for now.
The governor said last week that Japan’s inflation dynamics are very different from Europe and the U.S. and insisted there was no need to follow the rate hikes of global peers including the Federal Reserve that are looking to cool price growth.
With monetary stimulus set to remain in place, attention is shifting to Prime Minister Fumio Kishida and what he might do to minimize the economic pain of higher energy prices among businesses and households before elections this summer.
The March figures showed energy prices rose 26% from a year earlier, boosting overall prices by 1.2 percentage point, cushioning the temporary drag from cell phone fee cuts. The ongoing war in Ukraine is set to keep oil prices volatile.
Japan’s nationwide inflation is expected to pick up further speed as the yen continues to weaken, a factor that will increase import prices. The impact of sharp mobile fee reductions last year will start to drop off from April when economists expect a jump in price readings. 
Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) Japan joined the growing list of businesses raising prices this week. It will raise bean prices for the first time in 16 years on the cost of higher raw materials, according to a statement. 
What Bloomberg Economics Says...
“We expect Tokyo’s inflation to accelerate to 2% in April on higher prices of energy and imported food, inflated by a drop in the yen.”

While quasi-emergency measures for the pandemic were lifted from all regions this week, policy makers are closely looking at how rising energy prices might keep a lid on pent-up demand and the purchasing power of households known for their entrenched deflationary mindset. 
About 85% of respondents in a survey by Jiji said price increases in gasoline and daily necessities are affecting their standard of living.
Local media reported this week that Kishida is going to call for measures next week to address the impact of higher energy prices and inflation.
The Sankei newspaper reported Tuesday that the government and ruling coalition are preparing to draw up a stimulus package worth more than 10 trillion yen ($82 billion).

154,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 24, 2022 11:06AM ET</span>",U.S. weekly jobless claims drop to lowest level since 1969,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The number of Americans filing new claims for jobless benefits dropped to a 52-1/2-year low last week, while unemployment rolls continued to shrink, pointing to rapidly diminishing labor market slack that will keep boosting wage inflation.
The strength in the job market reported by the Labor Department on Thursday may push the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates by half a percentage point at its next policy meeting in May. Fed Chair Jerome Powell on Monday said the U.S. central bank must move ""expeditiously"" to raise rates and possibly ""more aggressively"" to keep high inflation from becoming entrenched.
The Fed last week increased its policy interest rate by 25 basis points, the first hike in more than three years.
""U.S. businesses are not laying off workers because they know the enormous challenges they're facing in filling open positions,"" said Ryan Sweet, a senior economist at Moody's (NYSE:MCO) Analytics in West Chester, Pennsylvania. 
""If initial claims remain below 200,000 for a period of time, it will raise a red flag with the Fed.""
Initial claims for state unemployment benefits fell 28,000 to a seasonally adjusted 187,000 for the week ended March 19, the lowest level since September 1969. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast 212,000 applications for the latest week.
Last week's drop in claims was widespread, with large decreases in California, Michigan, Kentucky and Illinois. 
Claims have been declining in part as COVID-19 restrictions across the country have been lifted amid a massive drop in coronavirus cases. They have declined from a record high of 6.149 million in early April 2020. 
There are no signs that Russia's war against Ukraine, which has sent U.S. gasoline prices to record highs and is expected to worsen the strain on global supply chains, has impacted the labor market.
But supply bottlenecks are restraining business spending on equipment. A separate report from the Commerce Department on Thursday showed orders for non-defense capital goods excluding aircraft, a closely watched proxy for business spending plans, slipped 0.3% last month after jumping 1.3% in January.
Economists had forecast these so-called core capital goods orders would rise 0.5%. 
Shipments of core capital goods gained 0.5% last month after increasing 2.1% in January. Core capital goods shipments are used to calculate equipment spending in the gross domestic product measurement. Economists still expect strong business investment in equipment this quarter.
""It is possible that the February declines represent a shift in businesses' intentions for capex, but the February figures also may just reflect noise in the monthly data,"" said Daniel Silver, an economist at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) in New York. ""We think real equipment spending is on track for strong growth in the first quarter even with related price increases offsetting some of the nominal gains.""
U.S. stocks rebounded from a sharp drop on Wednesday. The dollar rose against a basket of currencies. Prices of U.S. Treasuries fell.
LABOR CRUNCH
Companies are desperate for workers. There were 11.3 million job openings at the end of January, with a record 1.8 open positions per unemployed person. 
This misalignment between demand for labor and supply is boosting wage growth, which is providing some cushion to households against the soaring gasoline prices, as well as feeding into high inflation. 
The claims report also showed the number of people receiving benefits after an initial week of aid decreased 67,000 to 1.350 million during the week ended March 12, the lowest since January, 1970. The so-called continued claims data covered the period during which the government surveyed households for March's unemployment rate.

Continued claims declined sharply between the February and March survey periods. The unemployment rate fell to a two-year low of 3.8% in February.
""These data suggest that the March employment situation report is likely to be similar to recent reports, which have shown strong job growth and continuing declines in the unemployment rate,"" said Conrad DeQuadros, senior economic advisor at Brean Capital in New York.

S&P Global (NYSE:SPGI) said on Thursday its flash U.S. Composite PMI Output Index, which tracks the manufacturing and services sectors, rose to a reading of 58.5 this month. That was the highest reading since July 2021 and followed 55.9 in February.
A reading above 50 indicates growth in the private sector. The continued rebound from a slump in January mostly reflected pent-up demand and the easing of COVID-19 restrictions across the country amid a massive decline in coronavirus cases, as well as less severe supply chain disruptions.
The flash composite orders index rose to a nine-month high, with businesses reporting that ""a greater availability of inputs allowed them to be more competitive and win new customers."" 
With new orders and unfinished work piling up, companies hired workers at the sharpest pace since April 2021. 
Inflation continued to push higher, with companies reporting more price hikes for raw materials, fuel and energy. Prices are likely to remain elevated as Russia's invasion of Ukraine and lockdowns in China amid a COVID-19 outbreak slow the improvement in global supply chains.
Consumer prices notched their biggest annual rise in 40 years in February. 
Though businesses were broadly upbeat about the outlook this year, the degree of confidence suffered amid worries about the soaring input costs and the Russia-Ukraine war. According to S&P Global, businesses in the services sector were less upbeat, concerned about the impact of reduced disposable incomes as the cost of living rises.

The survey's flash manufacturing PMI jumped to a reading of 58.5 this month from 57.3 in February. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the index for the sector, which accounts for 11.9% of the economy, slipping to 56.3. 
Its flash services sector PMI increased to a reading of 58.9 this month from 56.5 in February. Economists had forecast a reading of 56.0 this month for the services sector, which makes up more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity.

Initial unemployment claims decreased by 28,000 to 187,000 in the week ended March 19, Labor Department data showed Thursday. The median estimate called for 210,000 applications in a Bloomberg survey of economists.
Continuing claims for state benefits dropped to 1.35 million in the week ended March 12.
The drop in claims is consistent with a labor market in which employers are desperately trying to hang onto workers and attract new ones. Applications should stay low as the combination of dwindling savings and decades-high inflation is raising Americans’ financial incentive to work.

157,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 24, 2022 06:47AM ET</span>",Euro zone March business growth strong but outlook darkens -PMI,"By Jonathan Cable
LONDON (Reuters) - Euro zone business growth was stronger than expected this month, a survey showed on Thursday, although prices rose at a record pace, likely adding to pressure on the European Central Bank to raise interest rates.
However, some of that expansion came from a rebound following the lifting of COVID restrictions and the outlook is murky as supply chain issues caused by the coronavirus pandemic have worsened following Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
S&P Global (NYSE:SPGI)'s Flash Composite Purchasing Managers' Index, seen as a good gauge of overall economic health, slipped to 54.5 in March from 55.5 in February although it was comfortably above the median 53.9 forecast in a Reuters poll.
Anything above 50 indicates growth.
""March's euro zone PMI survey is consistent with our view that the economy will grow more slowly than most anticipate this year, while inflation will overshoot expectations,"" said Jack Allen-Reynolds at Capital Economics.
""The survey also showed that supply problems worsened, which firms linked to the war in Ukraine as well as delays from China following the latest COVID outbreak there.""
Activity in Germany, Europe's largest economy, dipped this month as output price inflation hit a new record high and the war in Ukraine impacted demand as well as supply chains, earlier data showed.
But French business activity accelerated unexpectedly to an eight-month high as easier COVID restrictions boosted the service sector and eclipsed concerns about the Ukraine crisis' impact on manufacturing.
In Britain, outside the common currency area, the private-sector services PMI hit its highest in nine months but manufacturing output was reported at its lowest in five months.
S&P Global said the reopening of the British economy after pandemic restrictions had helped offset the drag from the conflict in Ukraine, Brexit and rising prices.
OPTIMISM SLUMP
Both the euro zone composite input and output prices indexes were at their highest in the survey's history.
The output prices index jumped to 65.7 from 62.3 suggesting inflation, already a record 5.8% in February, has further to climb. The ECB would like it at 2%.
""Price pressure remains very high. Accordingly, consumers will have to expect prices to continue to rise in the coming months. This increases the pressure on the ECB to initiate a turnaround in monetary policy,"" said Christoph Weil at Commerzbank (DE:CBKG).
Earlier this month the ECB said it would stop pumping money into financial markets this summer, paving the way for an increase in interest rates.
A PMI covering the bloc's dominant service industry fell to 54.8 this month from 55.5 but was ahead of the Reuters poll estimate for 54.2.
Demand was resilient and with more pandemic-related restrictions eased firms increased headcount at a faster rate. The services employment index rose to 54.8 from 53.6.
While factory activity remained solid the pace of growth slowed to its weakest since January last year. The manufacturing PMI dropped to 57.0 from 58.2 but was ahead of expectations for 56.0.

An index measuring output, which feeds into the composite PMI, sank to 53.6 from 55.5.
High inflation and concerns over Russia's invasion of Ukraine put a severe dent into optimism. The factory future output index plummeted to 53.8 from 68.5, its lowest reading since May 2020 - not long after the coronavirus pandemic began.

(Reuters) -Russia's National Wealth Fund (NWF), which accumulates the country's oil revenues, fell 11.5% month-on-month to $154.8 billion in February as the value of Russian companies it was invested in sagged, finance ministry data showed on Wednesday.
Unprecedented Western sanctions against Russia for what Moscow calls ""a special operation in Ukraine"" that began on Feb. 24 have caused a big fall in Russian stocks. 
The NWF, originally designed to help balance the pension system, stood at 9.7% of gross domestic product projected in 2022 as of March 1, down from 10.2% of projected GDP, or $174.9 billion, a month earlier.
The fund's liquid assets stood at $116.6 billion, or 7.3% of projected 2022 GDP as of March 1 compared with $112.7 billion, or 6.6% of projected GDP a month earlier, the ministry said.

The fund's investment in ordinary shares of Russia's No.1 lender Sberbank was worth an estimated 1.5 trillion roubles, down from 3 trillion roubles a month earlier, while the value of its investment in flagship carrier Aeroflot had shrunk to 30.7 billion roubles from 47.4 billion. 
Russia had planned to use NWF money to replace part of state borrowing this year, while also planning to channel up to 1 trillion roubles of the fund's money to support the battered stock market, as authorities look for ways to shield the economy from sanctions.

The preliminary S&P Global/CIPS composite Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) for March edged down to 59.7 from a historically high 59.9 in February, much less of a fall than the drop to 57.8 forecast in a Reuters poll of economists.
The PMI for Britain's private-sector services hit its highest in nine months, but output in the manufacturing sector was reported at its lowest in five months.
Chris Williamson, chief business economist at S&P Global (NYSE:SPGI), said the further reopening of the economy after COVID-19 restrictions had helped to offset the drag from the conflict in Ukraine, Brexit and rising prices.
""However, the outlook darkened as concerns over Russia's invasion exacerbated existing worries over soaring prices, supply chains and slowing economic growth,"" he said. 
Average prices charged rose by the most since records began in 1999, driven by the services sector as businesses sought to pass on unprecedented rises in their operating expenses.
The Bank of England, which has raised interest rates at its last three meetings and is expected to do so again in May, is watching closely for signs that the recent acceleration in consumer price inflation is becoming embedded in the economy.

The PMI's measure of business optimism dropped to its lowest since October 2020.

""We expect growth of only between 2.2% and 3.1% this year,"" Ifo's chief economist Timo Wollmershaeuser said in a statement. In December, Ifo had forecast 3.7% growth. 
The institute revised its inflation forecast to between 5.1% and 6.1%, up from 3.3% which it had predicted in December.
""The Russian attack is dampening the economy via significantly higher raw material prices, sanctions, increasing supply bottlenecks for raw materials and increased economic uncertainty,"" said Wollmershaeuser.
The reduced forecasts come after three other institutes slashed their predictions last week due to the Ukraine war. The trio - the IfW, the RWI and the IWH - gave forecasts ranging from 2.1% to 3.1%.
The German government most recently forecast 2022 growth of 3.6%, up from 2.9% last year.

At the same time, Ifo said full order books for industry and the normalisation of the COVID-19 pandemic are likely to boost the economy in the longer run.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Sales of new U.S. single-family homes unexpectedly fell in February amid rising mortgage rates and higher house prices, which are squeezing out some first-time buyers from the market.
Despite the second straight monthly decline reported by the Commerce Department on Wednesday, sales remained above their pre-pandemic level. Economists saw reduced affordability curbing activity in the near-term, but expected the new housing market to plod along this year given pent-up demand, a record low inventory of previously owned homes and strong wage gains.
""With interest rates climbing further because of the negative supply shock emanating from the Russian invasion of Ukraine, home sales are likely to trend lower in coming months,"" said David Berson, chief economist at Nationwide in Columbus, Ohio. ""But unless mortgage rates spike or the economy stalls or worse, the falloff in new home sales should be modest.""  
New home sales decreased 2% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 772,000 units last month. January's sales pace was revised down to 788,000 units from the previously reported 801,000 units. Sales surged 59.3% in the Northeast and increased 6.3% in the Midwest. But they fell 1.7% in the densely populated South and tumbled 13.0% in the West.
New homes are a leading indicator for the housing market as they are counted at the signing of a contract.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast new home sales, which account for 11.4% of U.S. home sales, would rebound to a rate of 810,000 units. Sales declined 6.2% on a year-on-year basis in February. They peaked at a rate of 993,000 units in January 2021, which was the highest since the end of 2006. 
Mortgage rates surged in February and have continued to push higher after the Federal Reserve last week raised its policy interest rate by 25 basis points, the first hike in more than three years, and laid out an aggressive plan to push borrowing costs to restrictive levels by 2023.
The 30-year fixed rate vaulted 23 basis points to a three-year high of 4.50% last week, data from the Mortgage Bankers Association showed on Wednesday.
Stocks on Wall Street were trading lower as oil prices rose. The dollar gained versus a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury yields fell.
SUPPLY-DEMAND IMBALANCE
Though, mortgage rates remain low by historical standards, strong house price inflation has combined to significantly increase the typical monthly mortgage payment.
""Mortgage payments as a share of median family income have risen above 20% for the first time since late 2007,"" said Matthew Pointon, senior property economist at Capital Economics in New York. ""That will act to cool housing market activity. A record low number of existing homes on the market that implies new sales will grind out a small gain over 2022.""
Data last week showed sales of previously owned homes fell sharply in February. 
The median new house price in February increased 10.7% from a year ago to $400,600. House prices have risen 31% compared to three years ago. None of the houses sold last month were below $200,000. Strong house price growth is expected to persist through this year and into 2023.
""We may be approaching a pivot point when higher home costs and higher mortgage rates cool both sales and price increases, but given the supply-and-demand imbalance, we may not hit that point this year,"" said Robert Frick, corporate economist at Navy Federal Credit Union in Vienna, Virginia.
There were 407,000 new homes on the market, the highest since August 2008 and up from 398,000 units in January. Houses under construction made up 65% of the inventory, with homes yet to be built accounting for about 26%.

The backlog of homes approved for construction but yet to be started is at an all-time high as builders struggle with shortages and higher prices for inputs like lumber for framing, as well as cabinets, garage doors, countertops and appliances.
At February's sales pace it would take 6.3 months to clear the supply of houses on the market, up from 6.1 months in January.

166,By Bloomberg,"<span>Mar 23, 2022 10:18AM ET</span>",U.S. New-Home Sales Declined in February for a Second Month,"(Bloomberg) -- Sales of new U.S. homes fell in February for a second month, suggesting high prices and rising mortgage rates may be keeping prospective buyers on the sidelines.
Purchases of new single-family homes decreased 2% to a 772,000 annualized pace following a downwardly revised 788,000 in January, government data showed Wednesday. The median estimate in a Bloomberg survey of economists called for a 810,000 rate. 
The drop in sales suggests buyers are shying away from the market amid high home prices and rising mortgage rates as the Federal Reserve tightens policy. A recent report showed a measure of homebuilders’ sales expectations for the next six months slumped in March to the lowest since June 2020 amid growing concerns over the combination of rising construction costs and higher interest rates.
“We recognize that interest rates are rising and inflation is a legitimate threat,” Stuart Miller, executive chairman of  Lennar  Corp (NYSE:LEN)., said on an earnings call last week. Still, the homebuilder reported better-than-expected quarterly orders and raised its forecasts on expectations that demand will continue to outweigh supply.
The new-home sales report, produced by the Census Bureau and the Department of Housing and Urban Development, showed the median sales price of a new home jumped 10.7% in February from a year earlier, to $400,600. 
The number of homes sold during the month and awaiting the start of construction -- a measure of backlogs -- rose from January to 209,000, Wednesday’s report showed.
There were 407,000 new homes for sale as of the end of February, the most since August 2008, though roughly 91% were either under construction or not yet started. At the current sales pace, it would take 6.3 months to exhaust the supply of new homes, compared with 4.5 months one year ago.
Regionally, sales rose in the Northeast and Midwest and fell in the South and West.
New-home purchases account for about 10% of the market and are calculated when contracts are signed. They are considered a timelier barometer than purchases of previously-owned homes, which are calculated when contracts close. Separate data last week showed those sales fell in February to a six-month low.

Power and LMC Automotive said.
Supply bottlenecks were showing signs of easing in recent months, but that progress is likely to be stalled by Russia's invasion of Ukraine as well as new lockdowns in China following a resurgence in COVID-19 infections.
""This year, with fewer than 900,000 units in inventory, it will be impossible for the sale pace to even approach last year's level,"" said Thomas King, president of the data and analytics division at J.D. Powers. 
U.S. retail sales of new vehicles could fall 27.8% to 1,044,500 units in March from a year earlier, according to a report released by the consultants on Wednesday.
The consultants expect global vehicle sales in March to suffer from the added effect of the war in Ukraine and an increase in inflationary pressure on consumers worldwide.
Total new-vehicle U.S. sales for the month, including retail and non-retail transactions, are expected to reach 1,188,300 units, a 28.9% decrease from last year, the report showed.
With supply still lagging behind demand, the U.S. average of new-vehicle retail transaction price in March is expected to rise 17.4% to $43,737, dropping from the previous high in December 2021 at $45,283. 

The seasonally adjusted annualized rate for total new-vehicle sales is expected to be 12.7 million units, down 5.1 million units from 2021.
Separately, research firm Cox Automotive said https://www.coxautoinc.com/news/february-2022-forecast-u-s-auto-sales earlier this month that there is no indication that inventories will notably improve in March, and that the seasonally adjusted annual rate will drop well below January and February.

LONDON (Reuters) -British inflation shot up faster than expected last month to hit a new 30-year high, worsening a historic squeeze on household finances that finance minister Rishi Sunak is under pressure to ease in a budget update later on Wednesday.
The Office for National Statistics said consumer prices rose by 6.2% year-on-year in February after a 5.5% rise in January, its highest rate since March 1992.
Britain now has the second-highest annual inflation rate among Group of Seven countries, behind only the United States as global commodity and energy prices soar, exacerbated by Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
The median forecast in a Reuters poll of economists had pointed to a reading of 5.9% and only three of the 39 respondents had expected such a strong reading.
The ONS highlighted household energy bills - up almost 25% on a year ago - and petrol as the biggest drivers of February's price jump.
In a blow to poorer households, the ONS said food prices were rising across the board, unlike in normal times when some prices typically go up and others fall.
Sunak will aim to show at 1230 GMT that he is helping Britons through the worst cost-of-living squeeze in decades. [nL2N2VQ0F5]
Options include a fuel duty cut, pushing up the threshold at which people start to pay into the social security system and ensuring welfare payments keep up with inflation.
Yael Selfin, chief economist at KPMG UK, said the figures would also put pressure on the Bank of England to keep on raising interest rates, but she said it was still likely that price growth would peak before long. 
""Provided inflation expectations can be managed and global commodity prices stabilise by next year, we should see inflation returning to the Bank of England's 2% target by mid-2024,"" Selfin said. 
""This may require fewer rate rises than markets currently anticipate.""
Dan Boardman-Weston, chief investment officer at BRI Wealth Management, said raising rates at a time of high household bills and rising taxes could stifle the economic recovery.
""The Bank will need to carefully balance the need to try and tame inflation whilst not tipping the economy into a recession,"" he said.
The ONS said consumer prices rose by 0.8% in month-on-month terms, marking the biggest February rise since 2009.
Last week, the BoE raised its forecast for annual inflation to peak above 8% - more than four times its target - during the April-June period. Regulated household energy bills are due to jump by more than half next month.

Core inflation, which excludes the direct impact of food and energy costs, rose to 5.2% from 4.4% - also its highest since March 1992.
Inflation pressure ahead continued to build as manufacturers increased their prices by 10.1%, the biggest annual rise since September 2008 although it was in line with the median Reuters poll forecast.

Headline inflation rose by 4.3%, exceeding economists' median forecast of 4.2%, according to a statement from the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS). 
The core inflation rate — the central bank's favoured price measure — rose to 2.2% in February on a year-on-year basis, down slightly from 2.4% in the previous month. A Reuters poll of economists had forecast a 2.5% increase.
Selena Ling, head of treasury research and strategy at OCBC, said she expected core prices to stay elevated in the first half of the year.
""We are seeing pricing pressure across a whole slew of different products and services. The tight labour market hasn't really fundamentally changed, so I think the pressure is still on MAS to tighten (interest rates) in April,"" she said.
The MAS tightened monetary policy in January this year, in its first out-of-cycle move in seven years, as global supply constraints and brisk economic demand elevated inflation pressures across the region.

The Singapore dollar fell marginally to S$1.3574 per dollar after the data was released.
The slight easing of core prices in February was due to lower inflation for services, food, electricity and gas, the MAS statement said.

172,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 22, 2022 05:20AM ET</span>",UK borrows less than forecast before Sunak's fiscal statement,"By David Milliken and Andy Bruce
LONDON (Reuters) -British public borrowing has fallen by more than half since its peak during the pandemic, but debt servicing costs are rising rapidly, official figures showed on Tuesday ahead of new budget plans from finance minister Rishi Sunak.
Sunak is under pressure to announce measures on Wednesday that will ease the immediate impact on households from soaring inflation, which is largely driven by higher energy costs, exacerbated by Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
Borrowing for the first 11 months of the 2021/2022 financial year was 138.4 billion pounds ($182.3 billion), the Office for National Statistics said. This is 52% below the record 290.9 billion pounds borrowed between April 2020 to February 2021, when the public finances bore the brunt of the COVID-19 pandemic. 
Compared with the government's most recent budget forecasts in October, Sunak has cash to spare.
Borrowing for 2021/22 is comfortably on track to undershoot the 183 billion pounds or 7.9% of gross domestic product forecast by the Office for Budget Responsibility, largely thanks to stronger-than-expected tax revenue. 
But Sunak, in response to Tuesday's figures, said he wanted to take a ""responsible"" approach.
""With inflation and interest rates still on the rise, it's crucial that we don't allow debt to spiral and burden future generations with further debt,"" the finance minister, or chancellor, said in a statement.
Borrowing in 2020/21 hit a peacetime record of 14.8% of GDP. And although net debt is now falling as a share of GDP, around a quarter of British borrowing costs are tied to the rate of inflation, which is close to a 30-year high.
Debt servicing costs in February were 53% higher than a year earlier at 8.2 billion pounds.
""Strong tax receipts and a year-on-year fall in public borrowing present a positive backdrop to the chancellor's Spring Statement on Wednesday. But high inflation and the consequences of geopolitical uncertainty signal tougher fiscal times ahead,"" said Martin Beck, chief economic advisor to EY ITEM Club. 
Borrowing in February alone came in much higher than expected at 13.1 billion pounds - more than 5 billion pounds above economists' average forecast in a Reuters poll - although this overshoot was largely cancelled out by a 4.2 billion pound upward revision to January's budget surplus.
Public sector net debt, excluding state-owned banks, totalled 2.327 trillion pounds or 94.7% of GDP. 
Most economists expect Sunak to offer relatively limited support to hard-pressed households, in order to reduce government borrowing further after its COVID-19 surge and allow tax cuts nearer to a national election due by 2024.
Measures under consideration for announcement on Wednesday include reducing vehicle fuel taxes, raising the income level at which workers start paying social security contributions, and speeding up inflation-linked increases to welfare benefits.

But Sunak has made clear he wants to stick with plans announced in September to raise the overall rate of payroll taxes paid by workers and employers to fund rising health and social care costs.

OTTAWA (Reuters) - Canadian retail sales bounced back in January, beating expectations, as shoppers ventured out to car dealerships and home improvement shops, official data showed Friday, though February retail sales likely fell.
Retail sales increased 3.2% to C$58.94 billion ($46.7 billion) in January, led by higher sales of motor vehicles and parts, Statistics Canada said. Analysts had, on average, forecast a gain of 2.4%.
February retail sales most likely fell 0.5%, Statscan said in a preliminary estimate.

The expected decline in February was based on responses from 36.6% of companies surveyed, Statscan said. The average final response rate for the survey over the previous 12 months has been 89.9%.
But a February drop in retail sales is unlikely to move the Bank of Canada off its current path of multiple rate hikes, said economists.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The euro zone's trade balance was in deficit for the third consecutive month in January as surging energy prices led to a sharp increase in the value of imports, even before the Russian invasion of Ukraine prompted further price spikes.
Eurostat said the non-adjusted trade deficit of the 19 countries sharing the euro was 27.2 billion euros ($30.1 billion) compared with a 10.7 billion euro surplus a year earlier in January 2021. 
Payments for imports jumped by 44.3% year-on-year, while revenues from exports grew by only 18.9%.
Euro zone trade is rarely in deficit, but this was the third consecutive month of shortfall, and a substantially larger figure than in the previous two months.
The euro zone last had a negative trade balance in January 2014 and last experienced deficits of more than one month in 2011.
Germany's trade surplus fell by 78% from January 2021, France's deficit deepened, while Italy turned from surplus to deficit.
Data for the whole 27-nation European Union showed the cost of energy product imports more than doubled in January from a year earlier, with marked increases also for imports of other raw materials, chemicals and machinery.
The EU's trade deficits with energy supplier Russia more than doubled to 11.9 billion euros and with Norway grew from just 0.1 billion euros a year earlier to 5.8 billion euros. The deficit also nearly doubled with China to almost 34 billion euros, and widened with India and South Korea.

The EU maintained a surplus with the United States, Britain and Switzerland.
Adjusted for seasonal swings, the euro zone trade was also in deficit for a third consecutive month, although the 7.7 billion euro figure for January was slightly smaller than December's 9.7 billion euro shortfall.

The Federal Reserve on Wednesday raised its policy interest rate by 25 basis points, the first hike in more than three years, and laid out an aggressive plan to push borrowing costs to restrictive levels by 2023. The U.S. central bank said Russia's war against Ukraine was ""likely to create additional upward pressure on inflation and weigh on economic activity.""
""The Russian invasion of Ukraine adds some uncertainty to the outlook as energy prices have spiked, and business and consumer sentiment has taken a hit,"" said Dante DeAntonio, a senior economist at Moody's (NYSE:MCO) Analytics in West Chester, Pennsylvania. ""However, we expect firms to mostly look beyond the near-term volatility, especially given the difficult hiring environment that remains."" 
Initial claims for state unemployment benefits decreased 15,000 to a seasonally adjusted 214,000 for the week ended March 12. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast 220,000 applications for the latest week. A 16,006 drop in claims in New York erased notable increases in Michigan, California and Ohio. 
Claims have declined from a record high of 6.149 million in early April 2020. The three-week old Russia-Ukraine war poses a risk to the U.S. labor market through disruptions of supply chains and record high gasoline prices. With companies hungry for labor, economists are optimistic the labor market and economy will ride out the storm.
There were 11.3 million job openings at the end of January, with a record 1.8 open positions per unemployed person. This misalignment between demand for labor and supply is boosting wage growth, which should provide some cushion to households against soaring gasoline prices.
Fed Chair Jerome Powell on Wednesday described the labor market as ""extremely"" tight, telling reporters that ""we think this labor market can handle, as I mentioned, tighter monetary policy, and the overall economy can as well.""

So far, the economy is holding up. A second report from the Philadelphia Fed on Thursday showed factory activity in the mid-Atlantic region accelerated in March, with manufacturers reporting strong growth in new orders as well as shipments.
Factories in the region encompassing eastern Pennsylvania, southern New Jersey and Delaware hired more workers and increased hours for employees. They, however, continued to struggle with higher input prices and delays getting materials, which kept order backlogs long.
Strong manufacturing was also underscored by a third report from the Fed showing production surged 1.2% in February, despite motor vehicle output sinking 3.5% because of a continued global shortage of electronic components.
""The impact of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, while mostly not reflected in this February report, could worsen supply problems, but our analysis suggests only minimal direct exposure for manufacturing,"" said Shannon Seery, an economist at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) in New York. 
Stocks on Wall Street were trading higher. The dollar fell against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices rose.

STRONG HOMEBUILDING
Last week's claims data covered the period during which the government surveyed business establishments for the nonfarm payrolls component of March's employment report. Claims fell considerably between the February and March survey periods, which bodes for job growth this month.
The economy created 678,000 jobs in February. Employment growth has been aided by the return of some workers to the labor force amid a significant decline in COVID-19 infections. 
More could rejoin the workforce this month. The claims report showed the number of people receiving benefits after an initial week of aid dropped 71,000 to 1.419 million during the week ended March 5, the lowest since February 1970.
The run on upbeat data was extended by a fourth report from the Commerce Department showing housing starts jumped 6.8% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.769 million units in February, the highest level since June 2006
While permits for future homebuilding fell 1.9% to a rate of 1.859 million units, they were not too far from the nearly 16-year high touched in January, suggesting an acute shortage of houses will continue to underpin residential construction even as mortgage rates rise.
Single-family housing starts, which account for the biggest share of homebuilding, jumped 5.7% to a rate of 1.215 million units last month. Starts for housing projects with five units or more gained 0.8% to a rate of 501,000. 
Graphic: Housing starts: https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-STOCKS/byprjezjnpe/hsbp.png 
The backlog of houses approved for construction that are yet to be started hit a record 273,000 units as builders struggle with shortages and very expensive materials.

""The record high number of units that were authorized but not started, combined with the permits data, suggests that housing construction will continue to add to growth in the coming months, to the extent that builders can contend with supply constraints,"" said Conrad DeQuadros, senior economist at Brean Capital in New York. 
In the wake of the data, the Atlanta Fed raised its estimate for first-quarter GDP growth to a 1.3% annualized rate from a 1.2% pace. It has been steadily boosting its forecast from as low as a 0.5% rate of contraction at the end of February. The economy grew at a robust 7.0% pace in the fourth quarter.

The Teranet-National Bank Composite House Price Index, which tracks repeat sales of single-family homes in major Canadian markets, had climbed 1.3% in January from December. The data is not seasonally adjusted.
Home price gains also picked up speed on an annual basis, with the index rising 17.7% in February from a year ago, up from a 16.6% gain in January and edging closer to the August 2021 record of 18.4%.
Halifax, Nova Scotia continued to have the fastest rising home prices of Canada's major cities, up 32.5% on the year and 3.0% on the month in February. Hamilton, Ontario home prices jumped 27.9% on the year and 3.1% on the month. 

All 11 major cities posted gains on the year, with the 18 other urban centers not included in the main index also all posting year-over-year gains.

181,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 17, 2022 09:56AM ET</span>",U.S. manufacturing output beats expectations in February,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Production at U.S. factories accelerated in February, shrugging off a continued slump in motor vehicle output, pointing to sustained strength in manufacturing amid a healthy demand for goods even as consumer spending reverts to services. 
Manufacturing output increased 1.2% last month after edging up 0.1% in January, the Federal Reserve said on Thursday.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast factory production accelerating 0.6%. Output jumped 7.4% compared to February 2021.
Manufacturing, which accounts for 11.9% of the economy, has benefited from a shift in spending to goods from services during the COVID-19 pandemic. 
But manufacturers have struggled to cope with the strong demand amid an acute worker shortage, caused by the coronavirus, on factory floors and other places along the supply chain.
Supply bottlenecks had shown signs of easing in recent months, but that progress is likely to be stalled by Russia's war against Ukraine as well as new lockdowns in China following a resurgence in COVID-19 infections. 
Production at auto plants fell 3.5% last month, marking the third straight monthly decline. Motor vehicle production continues to be restrained by a global shortage of electronic components.
February's surge in manufacturing output combined with a 0.1% gain in mining to lift industrial production 0.5%. That followed a 1.4% jump in January. Utilities production dropped 2.7% after vaulting 10.4% in January amid freezing temperatures in many parts of the country. 
Capacity utilization for the manufacturing sector, a measure of how fully firms are using their resources, increased 0.9 percentage point to 78.0% in February. It is 2.5 percentage points higher than its pre-pandemic level but 0.1 percentage point below its long-run average.

Overall capacity use for the industrial sector rose 0.3 percentage point to 77.6% last month. It is 1.9 percentage points below its 1972-2021 average.
Officials at the Fed tend to look at capacity use measures for signals of how much ""slack"" remains in the economy — how far growth has room to run before it becomes inflationary.

Housing starts jumped 6.8% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.769 million units last month, the Commerce Department said on Thursday. Data for January was revised higher to a rate of 1.657 million units from the previously reported 1.638 million units. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast starts increasing to a rate of 1.690 million units.
Permits for future homebuilding fell 1.9% to a rate of 1.859 million units. They increased in January to levels not seen since May 2006.
Despite mortgage rates rising as the Federal Reserve tightens monetary policy to fight high inflation, homebuilding is likely to remain supported by a dearth of homes available for sale. The U.S. central bank on Wednesday raised its policy interest rate by 25 basis points, the first hike in more than three years. The Fed also laid out an aggressive plan to push borrowing costs to restrictive levels by 2023.
There is a huge backlog of houses approved for construction that are yet to be started as builders struggle with shortages and very expensive materials. The National Association of Homebuilders said on Wednesday its measure of single-family homebuilders confidence fell to a six-month low in March. Its gauge of future sales was the lowest since June 2020.
""While housing demand should be negatively impacted by higher mortgage rates, housing starts should be buffered by the large number of new homes that have been sold but haven't yet been started,"" said Isfar Munir, an economist at  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) in New York. ""These homes will have to be built at some point and will count as a housing start at that time.""
Single-family housing starts, which account for the biggest share of homebuilding, jumped 5.7% to a rate of 1.215 million units last month. Single-family homebuilding increased in the Northeast, Midwest and South, but fell in the West. 

Single-family building permits slipped 0.5% to a rate of 1.207 million units.
Starts for housing projects with five units or more gained 0.8% to a rate of 501,000. Building permits for this housing segment dropped 4.5% to a rate of 597,000.

183,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 16, 2022 09:01PM ET</span>",Japan's machinery orders fall for first time in 5 months,"By Daniel Leussink
TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's core machinery orders slipped for the first time in five months in January, a worrying sign for an economy already facing heightened pressure from the Ukraine war and high energy and raw material prices.
The decline in core orders hurts hopes that a pickup in business spending will support private demand in the world's third-largest economy as firms struggle with surging input prices, a chip shortage and supply disruptions.
Core orders, a highly volatile data series regarded as an indicator of capital spending in the coming six to nine months, contracted 2.0% in January from December, posting their first drop in five months, the Cabinet Office data showed.
It was largely in line with economists' median estimate of a 2.2% contraction and followed a 3.1% jump in the previous month.
""The fall in machinery orders in January suggests that business investment may not recover much this quarter from a disappointing 2021,"" said Tom Learmouth, Japan economist at Capital Economics.
Japanese firms could delay spending plans due to higher commodity and transportation costs that are sending wholesale inflation soaring and squeezing corporate margins.
Compared with a year earlier, core orders, which exclude volatile numbers from shipping and electric power utilities, advanced 5.1% in January, the data found.
Orders from manufacturers lost 4.8% month-on-month, while those from non-manufacturers saw a 1.9% contraction.
""It's worrying that orders fell for most manufacturers,"" said Masato Koike, senior economist at Dai-ichi Life Research Institute.
""Business conditions will likely worsen ahead for manufacturers as energy costs rise due to the crisis in Ukraine,"" he said.

After contracting in the third quarter of last year, Japan's economy returned to growth in October-December. But the rebound was smaller than initially estimated due to weaker growth in private consumption and capital expenditure. 
Ruling coalition officials this week called for a fresh spending package to offset the economic blow from the Ukraine crisis, which is already hurting households and retailers by driving up energy and food costs.

184,By Bloomberg,"<span>Mar 16, 2022 09:00PM ET</span>",Australian Unemployment Drops to 4% in Boost for Rate Hawks,"(Bloomberg) -- Australia’s jobless rate fell to a 13-1/2 year low as the economy added more jobs than expected in February, in a result that’s likely to embolden hawks who are predicting an interest-rate increase as early as June.
Unemployment declined to 4% in February, the lowest level since August 2008, exceeding expectations for it to edge down to 4.1%, Australian Bureau of Statistics data showed on Thursday. Employment rose 77,400 from a month earlier, led by full-time roles, and more than double estimates. Labor market participation also edged higher.
“Participation rose to a new record high in February and was around 0.6 percentage points higher than the start of the pandemic,” said Bjorn Jarvis, head of labor statistics at the ABS. “The increase in participation continues to be particularly pronounced for women.”
The Australian dollar pushed slightly higher and was trading at 73.13 U.S. cents at 11:42 a.m. in Sydney.
The result suggests the Reserve Bank is likely to soon see the wages rises it wants before raising rates, with leading indicators pointing to the labor market tightening further. Money markets are pricing an RBA hike in June, while most economists have settled on August for rate liftoff.
Job ads data released last week showed construction and mining, mobile plant operators, animal and horticulture, education and healthcare are facing the sharpest labor squeeze at the moment.
Australia Help-Wanted Notices Surge as Omicron Wave Dissipates
RBA Governor Philip Lowe says policy makers can wait longer before raising rates as inflation Down Under isn’t as pressing as in other jurisdictions. He’s testing to see how far he can drive down the jobless rate with a record-low 0.1% cash rate before wages growth take off.
His stance contrasts with the Federal Reserve, which raised interest rates for the first time since 2018 on Wednesday, a week after the European Central Bank delivered a hawkish surprise.

WELLINGTON (Reuters) - New Zealand's gross domestic product (GDP) returned to growth in the final quarter of 2021 as the economy emerged from COVID-19 lockdowns, and economists said the data supported expectations the central bank would raise interest rates further. 
Production-based output grew by 3.0% in the quarter, Stats NZ said on Thursday. That was a touch below economists' median expectations of a 3.2% rise and a sharp turnaround from a revised 3.6% fall in the September quarter, when lockdowns had curbed activity.
The Reserve Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ) last month forecast growth for the December quarter at 2.3%.
""The Q4 GDP data reflect a robust, albeit very stimulated economy,"" ANZ economists said in a report. 
While there were a number of uncertainites on the outlook, the main concern was rising inflation in New Zealand that would require the RBNZ to further tighten policy, they added.
Annual GDP rose 3.1%, a little below a Reuters poll forecast of a 3.3% rise.
The RBNZ has already raised interest rates three times since October.
""Given that the rebound in activity in Q4 was above the RBNZ's expectations, today's data will keep the Bank on its hiking path,"" Ben Udy, economist at Capital Economics, said in a note.
OMICRON OUTBREAK
Economic growth improved as New Zealand's largest city, Auckland, moved out of a lengthy lockdown that had hit retail, manufacturing, construction and recreational activities in the prior quarter. Other parts of the country had also experienced shorter lockdowns in the third quarter.
Consumer and government spending were strong in the fourth quarter as was business investment, while trade was a drag as the country sucked in more imports, the data showed. There was also a big drag from inventories as companies ran down stocks to meet demand.

New Zealand's economy is being hit again this year as the country experiences its first significant nationwide outbreak of coronavirus infections as the Omicron variant spreads.
Although there are few restrictions in place, growing case numbers and hospitalisations have tempered people's desires to go out while sickness and isolation requirements are hurting some manufacturing sectors.

186,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 16, 2022 03:01PM ET</span>","U.S. retail sales slow, huge savings likely to provide a cushion against inflation","By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. retail sales increased moderately in February as more expensive gasoline and food forced households to cut back spending on other goods like furniture, electronics and appliances, which could restrain economic growth this quarter.
The report from the Commerce Department on Wednesday, however, showed the rebound in sales in January was much stronger than initially estimated. Record gasoline and high food prices are hitting lower-income households the hardest. 
Overall, consumers are being cushioned by at least $2.5 trillion in excess savings accumulated during the COVID-19 pandemic. Worker shortages with a near-record 11.3 million job openings at the end of January are boosting wages and allowing some Americans to pick up extra shifts to augment their income. 
""Though cooling after January's splurge, American consumers appear reasonably well positioned to keep spending, supported by recent massive job gains and high household savings,"" said Sal Guatieri, a senior economist at BMO Capital Markets in Toronto.
""This assumes, of course, no further major blows to fuel and food costs, confidence, and financial conditions stemming from the Russia-Ukraine war.""
Retail sales increased 0.3% last month. Data for January was revised sharply higher to show sales surging 4.9% instead of 3.8% as previously reported. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast retail sales growth slowing to 0.4%, with estimates ranging from as low as a 0.7% fall to as high as a 1.7% rise. 
Retail sales increased 17.6% from a year ago. Economists also viewed the pull back in monthly sales last month as pay back after January's surge, which was the largest gain in 10 months. Others saw the moderation as the beginning of a shift in spending back to services from goods amid a significant decline in coronavirus infections.
The Federal Reserve on Wednesday raised its policy interest rate by 25 basis points, the first hike in more than three years, to quell inflation. The U.S. central bank laid out an aggressive plan to push borrowing costs to restrictive levels by next year. Fed said Russia's war against Ukraine was ""likely to create additional upward pressure on inflation and weigh on economic activity.""
Retail sales are mostly made up of goods and are not adjusted for inflation. Last month, sales at auto dealerships increased 0.8%. The rise likely reflected higher prices amid shortages, as motor vehicle manufacturers reported a decline in unit sales in February. Auto sales accelerated 6.9% in January.
Receipts at service stations shot up 5.3%. Gasoline prices jumped 24 cents to an average of $3.49 per gallon last month from January, according to data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration. They have since pushed to a record high above $4 per gallon after Russia's invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24. 
The three-week war, which has killed hundreds of civilians, has boosted wheat prices and is expected to put more pressure on strained global supply chains. 
Annual consumer prices increased by the most in 40 years in February. Inflation is likely to remain uncomfortably high, with a separate report from the Labor Department on Wednesday showing import prices increasing 1.4% in February, lifted by higher costs for petroleum products and food.
Stocks on Wall street were trading higher amid signs of progress in Ukraine-Russia peace talks. The dollar slipped against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury yields rose.
UNDERLYING STRENGTH 
Retail sales in February were held back by a 3.7% plunge in receipts at online retailers. Sales at furniture stores fell 1.0%. Consumers also cut back on spending at health and personal care stores, with sales declining 1.8%. Receipts at electronic and appliance stores dropped 0.6%. 
But consumers spent more on clothing as well as sporting goods, hobbies, musical instruments and books. Receipts at restaurants and bars rebounded 2.5%. Restaurants and bars are the only services category in the retail sales report.
Excluding automobiles, gasoline, building materials and food services, retail sales fell 1.2% in February. Data for January was revised substantially up to show these so-called core retail sales rebounding 6.7% instead of 4.8% as previously reported.
Core retail sales correspond most closely with the consumer spending component of gross domestic product. The upward revision to January core retail sales offset the decline in February, which could leave consumer spending on a fairly strong growth path in the first quarter.
Indeed, economists at  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) raised their consumer spending growth estimate to a 4.3% annualized rate from a 2.7% pace. That lifted their GDP growth forecast for the first quarter to a 3.7% rate from a 2.5% pace. 

Morgan Stanley's GDP growth estimates are on the upper end of the range, with some forecasts below a 1% pace. The economy grew at a robust 7.0% rate in the fourth quarter.
""Today's report continues to reflect strong consumer demand in the first quarter, despite the headwinds of elevated inflation,"" said Ellen Zentner, chief U.S. economist at Morgan Stanley in New York. ""Upside in food services spending also indicates that we should see more upside in services spending this month, which will be reflecting in the personal spending report in two weeks.""

Business inventories rose 1.1% after advancing 2.4% in December, the Commerce Department said on Wednesday. Inventories are a key component of gross domestic product. January's increase was in line with economists' expectations. Inventories gained 11.4% on a year-on-year basis in January.
Retail inventories increased 2.0% in January, instead of 1.9% as estimated in an advance report published last month. That followed a 4.7% jump in December.
Motor vehicle inventories climbed 2.4% as estimated last month. They accelerated 6.9% in December. Retail inventories excluding autos, which go into the calculation of GDP, advanced 1.8%, rather than the 1.7% estimated last month.
Inventory investment surged at a robust seasonally adjusted annualized rate of $171.2 billion in the fourth quarter, contributing 4.90 percentage points to the quarter's 7.0% growth pace. Most economists see further scope for inventories to rise, noting that inflation-adjusted inventories remain below their pre-pandemic level. Sales-inventory ratios are also low.
But inventories are likely to be neutral to GDP growth this quarter, as they would need to increase at a similarly fast rate as in the fourth quarter to contribute to growth. 
Growth estimates for the first quarter have been slashed to below a 1% rate from around a 2% pace following Russia's war against Ukraine, which has boosted crude oil prices, sending U.S. gasoline prices to record highs. The Feb. 24 invasion of Ukraine has also led to a spike in prices of other commodities like wheat and is expected to further strain global supply chains.

Wholesale inventories increased 0.8% in January. Stocks at manufacturers rose 0.7%. 
Business sales increased 3.7% in January after falling 0.5% in December. At January's sales pace, it would take 1.25 months for businesses to clear shelves, down from 1.29 months in December.

(Reuters) -Canada's annual inflation rate accelerated in February to hit a fresh 30-year high, with broad price gains hitting consumers on all fronts, data showed on Wednesday, bolstering the case for the Bank of Canada to move forcefully on rates.
At 5.7%, the gain beat analysts' estimates of a rise of 5.5% and is the highest since August 1991, when the inflation rate hit 6.0%, Statistics Canada said. It was the 11th consecutive month above the Bank of Canada's 1% to 3% control range.
""Price increases were broad-based in February, pinching the pocketbooks of Canadians,"" Statscan said.
Gasoline prices jumped 32.3% compared with February 2021, while grocery prices were up 7.4%. Shelter costs jumped 6.6%, the biggest increase since 1983. Canadian home prices hit a new all-time high in February, data showed on Tuesday.
Price gains accelerated in six of eight major component baskets, with all three core measures of inflation rising.
""This is certainly not just the food and energy story ... We're seeing these gains sweeping through the core as well,"" said Doug Porter, chief economist at BMO Capital Markets.
The CPI common measure, which the Bank of Canada says is the best gauge of the economy's performance, rose to 2.6% from 2.3% in January. CPI trim was 4.3% and CPI median was 3.5%.
The Bank of Canada hiked its policy rate for the first time in more than three years earlier this month, and Governor Tiff Macklem said the bank was prepared to act aggressively going forward to keep inflation expectations grounded.
Red-hot inflation could force that action, said economists.
""It adds to the case for having a bit of a bigger rate hike at the next meeting and shutting down the (bond) purchase program, as they've already guided,"" said Derek Holt, vice president of capital market economics at Scotiabank. 
""I think they have to hit the policy rate harder given how far behind they are on the inflation mandate,"" he added.

Money Markets see a roughly 60% chance of a 50 basis-point move from the Bank of Canada at its April meeting, with a total of seven hikes expected in 2022. [BOCWATCH]

192,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 16, 2022 12:56AM ET</span>",Japan consumers' inflation expectations hit record high in March - survey,"TOKYO (Reuters) - Japanese consumers' inflation expectations hit a record high in March, a government survey showed on Wednesday, as people's perceptions of future price moves were affected by surging energy and food costs blamed on the Ukraine crisis.
While heightening inflation expectations could help the Bank of Japan (BOJ) achieve its elusive 2% price target, there is a danger that the rising raw material costs could cool consumption and the broader economy unless accompanied by wage hikes, analysts say.
Consumers' one-year inflation expectations hit 2.67% in March, up from 2.43% in February, and were the highest since comparable data became available in 2014, the survey showed.
Of the total, 15.5% said they expect prices to rise by around 3% a year from now, up from 13.7% in February and the highest ratio since 2019, according to the survey.
The survey was conducted between March 3-7.
Years of money printing by the BOJ has failed to fire up inflation to its 2% target, as weak consumption kept firms from raising prices for fear of scaring away buyers.
With wholesale inflation hitting four-decade highs, however, a growing number of companies are passing on costs to households. Analysts expect core consumer inflation, now hovering around zero, to approach the BOJ's 2% target from April due in part to surging energy costs.

Inflation expectation surveys are among factors the BOJ scrutinises in guiding monetary policy. But BOJ officials have stressed the bank's resolve to keep policy ultra-loose unless rising inflation is accompanied by steady increases in wages.
The BOJ is set to keep monetary policy ultra-loose on Friday and warn of heightening economic risks from the Ukraine crisis, unfazed by prospects of rising inflation and anticipated U.S. interest rate hikes.

193,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 16, 2022 12:50AM ET</span>",China Feb new home price growth stalls as demand remains frail,"BEIJING (Reuters) -China's new home prices stalled in February after eking out a small gain a month earlier, official data on Wednesday showed, pointing to still fragile demand despite a gradual easing in property curbs by authorities to boost buying sentiment.
Average new home prices in China's 70 major cities were flat at 0.00% month-on-month, compared with a 0.1% gain in January, according to Reuters calculations based on data released by the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS).
From a year earlier, new home prices rose 2.0%, the slowest pace since December 2015, and also easing from the 2.3% growth in January.
China's property market slowed down sharply last year as Beijing's deleveraging campaign triggered a liquidity crisis in some major property developers, leading to bond defaults, a plunge in share prices and projects being shelved or left unfinished.
Authorities mainly in small cities have rolled out a slew of easing steps including smaller down-payments, cuts in mortgage rates and relaxations in purchase of second homes.
The looser regulations have yet to drive a nationwide rebound.
Monthly new home prices rose 0.5% in tier-one cities including Beijing and Shanghai, narrowing from the 0.6% growth in January.
In tier-two cities, which include some provincial capitals, new home prices were flat on month after January's 0.1% gain, while in tier-three and tier-four cities, prices fell 0.3%, widening from the 0.2% decrease in January. 
""A slight cooling in prices compared to January shows that there is resistance to a bounce,"" said Yan Yuejin, research director of Shanghai-based E-house China Research and Development.
""We should be wary of a rapid cooling in tier-three and four cities.""
At the annual meeting of parliament earlier this month, Premier Li Keqiang said China will better meet homebuyers' legitimate needs, and will implement city-specific policies.
The number of cities reporting price gains decreased to 27 from 28 in January.
A surge in domestic Omicron cases in recent weeks have also cooled somewhat recovering demand in big cities.
Mainland China reported 1,952 new confirmed coronavirus cases on Tuesday, the country's national health authority said, compared with 3,602 a day earlier.
The outbreaks have led to a home buying freeze in local property markets in Shanghai, Shenzhen and the eastern city of Hangzhou, with a small rebound seen being halted, said Zhang Dawei, chief analyst at property agency Centaline.

""(But) the market is expected to stabilise in March-April as mortgage lending, the biggest factor, is easing.""
Household loans, mostly mortgages, suffered a rare contraction of 336.9 billion yuan in February, compared with 843 billion yuan in January, pointing to continued weakness in the property market, according to central bank data last week.

TOKYO (Reuters) -Japan reported a wider-than-expected trade deficit in February as an energy-driven surge in import costs caused by massive supply constraints added to vulnerabilities for the world's third-largest economy.
Exports rose slightly less than expected despite a rebound in China-bound shipments, in a worrying sign for an economy facing growing uncertainty from supply challenges and Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
""There's a big likelihood the trade deficit will expand further,"" said Takeshi Minami, chief economist at Norinchukin Research Institute.
""Although car exports picked up in February, they aren't in a situation of growing steadily due to supply disruptions and a chip shortage, while imports are swelling as oil and raw material prices soar."" 
Imports surged 34.0% in the year to February, Ministry of Finance data showed on Wednesday, above a median market forecast for a 28.0% gain in a Reuters poll.
That outstripped a 19.1% year-on-year rise in exports in February, resulting in a 668.3 billion yen ($5.65 billion) trade deficit, which was bigger than the 112.6 billion yen shortfall expected in a Reuters poll.
February's deficit was, however, narrower than January's 2.19 trillion yen gap, which was the biggest in a single month in eight years.
The finance ministry said exports declined a seasonally adjusted 0.5% from the previous month, underscoring headwinds in outbound shipments. Imports rose a seasonally adjusted 2.7% month-on-month.
""Exports fell again in February, though they should rebound over the coming months provided the recent Omicron outbreak in China doesn't cause major supply chain disruptions to resurface,"" said Tom Learmouth, Japan economist at Capital Economics.
""Adding in the merchandise trade data for February, net trade could knock off as much as 1.0 percentage point from GDP (gross domestic product) growth this quarter as exports tread water but imports rise strongly.""
By region, exports to China, Japan's largest trading partner, expanded 25.8% in the 12 months to February on stronger semiconductor machinery shipments to the country, after posting a Lunar New Year-linked contraction in the prior month.
Exports to the United States, the world's largest economy, grew 16.0% from the previous year in February, on stronger shipments of cars and semiconductor machinery.
The two biggest items contributing to the rise in imports were oil, including from United Arab Emirates, and liquefied natural gas, such as from Australia, the data showed.
The Reuters Tankan poll for March showed Japanese manufacturers feared a fresh surge in energy prices due to the Ukraine crisis, even as they reported the first improvement in their business confidence in three months.
Japan's economy rebounded less than initially estimated in the final quarter of 2021, the government said last week, on weaker growth in consumer and business spending.
The downgrade in fourth quarter growth was bad news for policymakers tasked with sustaining a fragile recovery as the Ukraine crisis clouds the outlook for the global economy.
Norinchukin's Minami said that worsening conditions due in part to rising raw material prices could end up squeezing Japanese manufacturers' profits and may lead to economic growth forecasts being lowered for fiscal 2022, which starts in April.

Many expectations are still for 2.0%-3.0% growth in the coming fiscal year, he added.

SEOUL (Reuters) -South Korea's annual unemployment rate fell to the lowest on record in February, with jobs growth staying at a near 22-year-high, though the increase was mainly due to a low base and the government's fiscal spending.
The seasonally adjusted unemployment rate last month dropped to 2.7%, Statistics Korea data showed on Wednesday, the lowest since data releases began in June 1999. It came in at 3.6% in January.
The number of employed increased by 1.037 million from a year earlier in February, not far from January's jobs growth of 1.135 million, which was the most since March 2000.
February's figures were also flattered by comparisons to the very weak readings from a year earlier.
The country posted 12 straight months of job losses through to February 2021, while the jobless rate soared to over a 20-year high of 5.2% in January 2021, as the coronavirus hit the nation's labour market.
A breakdown of data showed 254,000 jobs were added in healthcare and social services in February 2022, a quarter of the total, while some 135,000 jobs were added in transportation and warehouses.
Jobs in the wholesale and retail industry, however, continued to shrink, losing 47,000 jobs from a year earlier. Those in the key manufacturing sector rose 32,000, but that was less than a month earlier and growth remained weak.
The fast-spreading Omicron variant will likely take a toll on the already gloomy outlook for such sectors, with the country reporting a daily record of 400,741 new coronavirus cases for Tuesday.
Some 1.78 million people have been forced to stay at home for treatment, the Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency said.

Wednesday's jobs data comes a week after conservative South Korean opposition candidate Yoon Suk-yeol won a tight presidential election, with jobs being one of the major challenges for the president-elect.
To shore up the economy, the government has allocated about a third of the total government expenditure to welfare and jobs, and promised to spend about 70% of the annual fiscal budget during the first half of 2022.

196,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 15, 2022 07:21PM ET</span>","Japan March manufacturers' mood up, Ukraine crisis clouds outlook - Reuters Tankan","By Kantaro Komiya
TOKYO (Reuters) - Japanese manufacturers' business confidence improved for the first time in three months in March, as automakers became less pessimistic, though firms feared a fresh surge in energy prices due to the Ukraine crisis, the Reuters Tankan poll showed.
Service-sector sentiment turned negative for the first time since October due to COVID-19 curbs and as global inflation squeezed corporate profits, according to the poll, which tracks the Bank of Japan's (BOJ) closely watched ""tankan"" quarterly survey.
While the mood among manufacturers remained positive for the 14th straight month, managers voiced concerns about a wide array of downside risks that cloud the outlook for the world's third-largest economy, days before the BOJ's next policy meeting.
""It's a quadruple whammy,"" said a machinery maker manager in the poll, referring to Russia's invasion of Ukraine, a hit to output from Omicron infections, supply disruptions and soaring costs on everything from high-tech chips to transportation.
The Reuters Tankan manufacturers' sentiment index rose to 8 in March from 6 last month, marking its first month-on-month improvement since December. The service-sector index extended a decline for the second month to a five-month low of minus 1, compared with the previous month's 3.
(For a detailed table of the results, click)
Manufacturers' sentiment got a boost from fading pessimism among automakers, whose sub index rose to a three-month high of minus 14 in March from February's minus 29.
Support also came from growing optimism among food and precision machinery producers, and the steel/nonferrous metals sub-sector turning less negative.
Many firms, however, expressed worries about commodity inflation in the March 2-11 poll of 501 big and mid-sized companies, of which 240 responded.
""While demand is recovering, price hikes in energy and raw materials have made it hard to maintain profit levels,"" said a paper company manager.
In non-manufacturing, three out of six sectors saw their sentiment worsen, including real estate/construction and retailers. 
The government's extension of coronavirus curbs has been suppressing shopper turnout and prevented sales from recovering to their pre-pandemic levels, a retail manager said.
While nationwide daily infections peaked at more than 100,000 in early February, they remained elevated through much of the month. The government may lift pandemic curbs still in place in Tokyo and 17 other prefectures as early as March 21, when they are set to expire.
Looking ahead, manufacturers saw business sentiment rising to 11 three months ahead, while services firms expected their mood to recover to 10, but those outlook readings were less positive than 18 and 14, respectively, recorded last month.
The Reuters Tankan index readings are calculated by subtracting the percentage of respondents who say conditions are poor from those who say they are good. A positive reading means optimists outnumber pessimists.

The Bank of Japan will release its quarterly tankan business survey next on April 1 at 8:50 a.m. local time (March 31, 2350 GMT).
The central bank is scheduled to end a two-day rate review on Friday, its first since the start of the Ukraine crisis.

197,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 15, 2022 03:57PM ET</span>",Argentina inflation soars; president vows 'war' on surging prices,"By Hernan Nessi and Jorge Iorio
BUENOS AIRES (Reuters) -Argentina's monthly inflation rocketed to 4.7% in February, the state statistics agency said on Tuesday, the highest since March 2021 and far above forecasts as the South American country's president promised a ""war"" against spiraling prices.
The grains-producing country's annual inflation rate was already running at over 50% when Russia's invasion of Ukraine super-charged global commodities costs, a major headache for the government ahead of general elections next year.
Center-left President Alberto Fernandez, with an eye on a inflation targets recently agreed with the International Monetary Fund (IMF), pledged to roll out a package of anti-inflation measures at the end of the week.
""I promise another fight will start on Friday, the war against inflation in Argentina,"" he said. ""We are going to put an end to speculators and we are going to put things in order.""
The monthly jump was well above an estimated 4% rise projected by analysts polled by Reuters. Prices jumped 8.8% year-to-date and 12-month rolling inflation hit 52.3%.
The government has agreed an economic plan as part of a $45 billion deal with the IMF that targets inflation of 38%-48% this year. That agreement needs Congress and IMF board approval.
The Economy Ministry said in a statement that the war in Ukraine was pushing up commodities prices while a drought in Argentina had hit grain production.
""The Russian-Ukrainian war is present in Argentina and that is seen in the prices paid for everything associated with commodities, which are increasing,"" Economy Minister Martin Guzman had said on Monday.
Argentina, the world's No. 1 processed soy exporter and No. 2 for corn, has benefited from high grains prices on its exports, though it has struggled to tamp down domestic prices. 
""The rise in the price of commodities worldwide adds more fuel to the fire,"" said Isaías Marini, an economist at consulting firm Econviews. ""The figure for March will probably be even higher than that for February.""
The government has imposed caps on some grains exports and price freeze agreements on some foods. This week it halted new overseas sales of soy oil and meal, its top exports.
Horacio Larghi, economist at consultancy Invenómica said rising prices of food inputs would start to feed through to consumers.
""In March the situation has become very complicated with strong increases in flour and oils prices, which will undoubtedly soon be transferred to the prices of final goods,"" he said.

198,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 15, 2022 12:31PM ET</span>",Poorest Britons suffer biggest pay squeeze,"By David Milliken
LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's lowest-paid workers have seen the biggest squeeze on their pay over the past 12 months, according to figures on Tuesday which suggest the cost of living crisis is likely to prove even more painful than headline figures imply.
British consumer price inflation hit a nearly 30-year high of 5.5% in January and is forecast by economists to reach 8% in April, boosted by a 50% rise in household regulated energy tariffs on top of the impact of Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
Britain's main measure of wages - average weekly earnings - is already struggling to keep up, with pay in the three months to January 4.8% higher than a year before.
But separate figures based on employers' tax reports showed that pay for the lowest-earning 10% of staff - who make 8,124 pounds ($10,612) a year - has risen just 0.6% over the past year.
By contrast, the highest 10% of earners - who make 57,900 pounds a year - have seen a 4.9% pay rise and the richest 1% have enjoyed a 6.5% pay rise.
""These pay trends help to explain the UK's (tax) revenue-rich recovery, but also means real wages will fall fastest for those who can least afford it,"" the Resolution Foundation think tank said.
Some of the difference probably reflects distortions as staff move on and off furlough, but top earners have still done best overall since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. Wages for the lowest-paid 10% have risen 8.1% versus a 9.1% rise for the top 10%.

Britain's main minimum wage rate of 8.91 pounds an hour is due to rise 6.6% to 9.50 pounds an hour on April 1. But most workers will also face a higher tax burden from increased social security charges which take effect at the same time.

199,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 15, 2022 11:57AM ET</span>","Gasoline, food lift U.S. producer prices in February","By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. producer prices increased solidly in February as the cost of goods like gasoline surged, and further gains are in the pipeline following Russia's war against Ukraine, which has made crude oil and other commodities more expensive.
The report from the Labor Department on Tuesday offered more evidence that inflation would remain uncomfortably high in the months ahead, despite underlying price pressures at the factory gate rising moderately last month. 
The Federal Reserve is expected to raise interest rates on Wednesday for the first in just over three years, with inflation running way above the U.S. central bank's 2% target. Economists are forecasting as many as seven rate hikes this year.
""We expect March PPI to show larger increases as commodity prices increase and global trade disruptions amplify,"" said Will Compernolle, a senior economist at FHN Financial in New York. ""For consumer prices to slow, firms will first have to grapple with disruptions from the Russian invasion and new lockdowns in the heart of China's most productive regions.""  
The producer price index for final demand increased 0.8% after accelerating 1.2% in January. Goods prices shot up 2.4%, the largest gain since December 2009, after rising 1.5% in January. A 14.8% jump in wholesale gasoline prices accounted for nearly 40% of the increase in goods prices. Gasoline prices rose 3.3% in January. Food prices advanced 1.9% last month.
Services were unchanged after increasing 1.0% in January. 
The PPI climbed 10% in the 12 months through February, matching the gain in January. Last month's increase in the PPI was in line with economists' expectations. The data does not capture the jump in prices of oil and other commodities, like wheat, following Russia's invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24.
Stocks on Wall Street were trading higher as oil prices retreated to below $100 a barrel after Russia said it was in favor of the 2015 Iran nuclear deal resuming as soon as possible. Crude oil prices shot up more than 30%, with global benchmark Brent hitting a 14-year high of $139 a barrel, in the aftermath of Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
The dollar dipped against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices were largely trading higher.
SENTIMENT TAKES A HIT
Higher oil prices and the Russia-Ukraine war weighed on business sentiment in New York state. In a separate report on Tuesday, the New York Fed said its general business conditions index slumped 14.9 points to -11.8 in March, the weakest reading since May 2020. A reading below zero indicates a contraction in factory activity in the state.
Manufacturers reported a contraction in new orders and shipments, but continued to pay higher prices for inputs as well as charge more for their finished goods.
""Geopolitical uncertainty likely bears much of the blame,"" said Adam Kamins, an economist at Moody's (NYSE:MCO) Analytics in West Chester, Pennsylvania. ""Many firms are sitting tight, either because their customers are doing so or in order to gauge the economic ramifications of the invasion.""
Despite the pullback in oil prices, inflation is likely to remain hot as a resurgence in COVID-19 infections in China, a major source of raw materials for U.S. factories, puts more pressure on supply chains. Inflation was already a problem before the Russia-Ukraine war.
The government last week reported an acceleration in consumer prices in February, with the annual inflation rate posting its largest increase in 40 years.
High inflation, mostly in the form of more expensive gasoline, has prompted economists to trim their economic growth estimates for this year. So far, a recession is not anticipated as households accumulated massive savings during the pandemic.
Excluding the volatile food, energy and trade services components, producer prices climbed 0.2% in February, the smallest gain since November 2020. The so-called core PPI increased 0.8% in January. It was last month held back by a 4.2% decline in portfolio management fees as investors dumped equities in favor of the dollar and U.S. Treasuries. 
There were also decreases in the prices of hotel and motel rooms as well as apparel, jewelry, footwear, and accessories retailing. That offset a 1.9% rise in the cost of transportation and warehousing services. Airline fares rebounded 3.0%, while healthcare costs rose moderately. 
In the 12 months through February, the core PPI increased 6.6% after gaining 6.8% in January. 
With the CPI and PPI data in hand, economists are estimating that the core personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index rose 0.4% in February after gaining 0.5% in January. 

That would lead to an annual increase of 5.5% in the core PCE price index, which advanced 5.2% on a year-on-year basis in January. It is one of the key inflation measures watched by Fed officials. 
""This is consistent with the idea that underlying inflation is running at or above 5%,"" said Andrew Hollenhorst, chief U.S. economist at  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) in New York. 
 
"
200,By Bloomberg,"<span>Mar 15, 2022 08:54AM ET</span>","U.S. Producer Prices Rise 10%, Setting Stage for Fed Rate Hike","(Bloomberg) -- Prices paid to U.S. producers rose strongly in February on higher costs of goods, underscoring inflationary pressures that set the stage for a Federal Reserve rate hike this week. 
The producer price index for final demand increased 10% from February of last year and 0.8% from the prior month, Labor Department data showed Tuesday. That followed an upwardly revised 1.2% monthly gain in January.
The median forecasts in a Bloomberg survey of economists called for a 10% year-over-year increase and a 0.9% monthly advance.
Two year Treasury yields extended declines and U.S. stock futures rose after the data showed producer prices rose less than expected on a monthly basis.
The data reflect the biggest monthly gain in the price of goods in data back to 2009, with two-thirds of the increase due to energy. It’s the latest indication of rapid inflation in the U.S., and prices are poised to accelerate further after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine sent prices of some raw materials to new highs. 
While that bolsters the case for the Fed to be aggressive in tamping down inflation in the coming months, the central bank will have to balance curbing inflation without stifling economic growth.
The Fed will have the latest inflation data in hand for its meeting that concludes Wednesday, when policy makers are widely expected to increase interest rates for the first time since 2018. Along with the decision, the Fed will release updated forecasts for inflation and growth.
The data suggest persistent inflationary pressures in production will filter through to consumer prices, which rose in February at the fastest pace in 40 years, in part due to higher gasoline, food and housing costs. That’ll only worsen given the war, and China’s lockdown of Shenzhen -- one of the nation’s most populous cities and a technology hub -- is expected to disrupt fragile supply chains even more.
Core Prices
Excluding the volatile food and energy components, the so-called core PPI increased 0.2% from a month earlier and was up by a 8.4% from a year ago, both missing estimates. 
There were signs in other parts of the economy that inflationary pressures were cooling. Prices for final demand services were little changed from January, the first month without an increase since December 2020. An increase in transportation and warehousing services costs was offset by declines in portfolio management and apparel and accessories retailing.

BERLIN (Reuters) -German investor sentiment suffered a record slide in March due to the war in Ukraine and economic sanctions on Russia, a survey showed on Tuesday, with collapsing expectations making a recession in Europe's largest economy ""more and more likely"".
The ZEW economic research institute said its economic sentiment index dropped to -39.3 points from 54.3 in February. The fall was the biggest since the survey began in December 1991. A Reuters poll had pointed to a reading of 10.0 for March.
""A recession is becoming more and more likely. The war in Ukraine and the sanctions against Russia are significantly dampening the economic outlook for Germany,"" ZEW President Achim Wambach said in a statement.
""The collapsing economic expectations are accompanied by an extreme rise in inflation expectations,"" he added. 
An index for current conditions fell to -21.4 from -8.1. The consensus forecast was for a reading of -22.5.
Germany's finance minister said on Monday the cabinet would approve a draft 2022 budget on Wednesday but that he would submit supplementary fiscal plans to parliament in the coming weeks to reflect the economic impact of the war in Ukraine.
In evidence of the fallout from the Ukraine crisis in corporate Germany, Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) CEO Herbert Diess said on Tuesday the full impact of the war was not yet clear and was throwing the carmaker's 2022 outlook into question.
German industrial production rose at the start of the year, but economists said it could slump due to the fallout from the war in Ukraine.
Alexander Krueger at Hauck Aufhaeuser Lampe, a private bank, said the ZEW result was ""a disaster for the economic outlook.""
""The ZEW index gives a bad foretaste of sentiment indicators still to come,"" he added. ""The economy is teetering on the brink of recession.""

The European Central Bank said last week it will stop pumping money into financial markets this summer, paving the way for an increase in interest rates as soaring inflation outweighs concerns about the fallout from Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
""The ECB's job is not getting any easier with the darkening economic outlook,"" said Ulrich Wortberg, economist at Heleba.

The European Union's statistics office Eurostat said industrial output in the 19 countries sharing the euro was unchanged month-on-month in January and down 1.3% year-on-year.
Economists polled by Reuters had expected a 0.1% monthly gain and a 0.5% annual decline.
Eurostat said the non-durable consumer goods, such as clothing, rose by 3.1% from December. Production of durable consumers goods, intermediate goods such as steel, energy and capital goods all fell, the latter by 2.4%.

In year-on-year terms, output of non-durable consumer goods showed the strong increase of 7.0%, while capital goods, such as machinery and equipment for industry, declined by 8.4%.
Industrial output is an important component of gross domestic product, which rose 0.3% quarter-on-quarter in the October-December period for a 4.6% year-on-year expansion.

LONDON (Reuters) -Britain's unemployment rate dropped below its pre-pandemic rate in the three months to January while pay rose faster than expected, according to official figures that are likely to bolster the Bank of England's plans to raise interest rates. 
The jobless rate fell more than expected to 3.9%, despite the Omicron wave of COVID-19, data from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) showed on Tuesday. That was down from 4.1% in the last quarter of 2021 and its lowest level since the three months to January 2020.
Job vacancies hit a fresh record high in the three months to February at 1.318 million, underscoring the labour shortage facing many employers.
""The further tightening in the labour market will only encourage the Bank of England to raise interest rates on Thursday ... despite the coming extra hit to households' real incomes from the war in Ukraine,"" said Paul Dales, chief UK economist at Capital Economics.
The BoE is expected to raise the Bank Rate by a quarter point to its pre-crisis level of 0.75% after the central bank's monthly policy meeting on Thursday.
Some of its policymakers have been concerned by a BoE survey of businesses which showed firms planned to raise pay by nearly 5% this year - much more than previous years or pay settlements suggested by other surveys.
Four policymakers voted last month to raise rates to 0.75% rather than the 0.5% finally decided upon.
The BoE is worried that high inflation caused by soaring energy prices and post-COVID bottlenecks could prove slow to dissipate. 
PAY BARELY MATCHES PRICES
Average earnings in the three months to January were 4.8% higher than a year earlier, above forecasts in a Reuters poll for a 4.6% rise.
While this is barely keeping up with the rate of inflation - and equivalent to a 0.1% real-terms pay rise using the ONS's preferred CPIH inflation rate - it represents faster pay growth than in the run-up to the pandemic.
However, a narrower measure of real-terms pay excluding bonuses was 1.0% lower than a year earlier - the biggest annual fall since the three months to July 2014.
Living standards are likely to see their biggest drop in 30 years this year, according to BoE forecasts that pre-date the latest inflation shock caused by Russia's invasion of Ukraine, which has sent energy and some commodity prices surging.
In the medium term this squeeze to real incomes is likely to limit inflation pressures as domestic demand is hit and unemployment rises, the BoE predicts.
Economists are also unsure whether the pandemic has led to any lasting change in British workers' bargaining power, which has been weak since the 2008 global financial crisis.
Although British economic output is now slightly higher than before the pandemic, its labour force has shrunk by around 500,000 - largely due to workers aged 50 and over dropping out, often to retire early.
Tuesday's figures showed employment fell by 12,000 in the three months to January, below poll forecasts for a rise of 23,000.

Less reliable preliminary payroll figures for February - which are based on tax data that does not include the self-employed - showed a monthly surge of 275,000. But January's increase was revised down to 61,000 from 108,000.
British finance minister Rishi Sunak said he was confident that the labour market was ""in a good position to deal with the current global challenges"" with redundancies at record lows.

Industrial output rose 7.5% in January-February from a year earlier, the fastest pace since June 2021 and up from a 4.3% increase seen in December, data from National Statistics Bureau showed on Tuesday. That compared with a 3.9% rise expected by analysts in a Reuters poll. 
Retail sales, a gauge of consumption that has been lagging since COVID-19 hit, expanded 6.7% year-on-year amid rising demand during the Lunar New Year holidays and Winter Olympic Games. It also marked the quickest clip since June last year and beat expectations of a 3.0% increase in the poll.
It eked out a 1.7% gain in December. 
The surprisingly strong performance of the world's second largest economy in the New Year may have enabled the People's Bank of China (PBOC) to hold policy rates steady on Tuesday, Iris Pang, Greater China chief economist at ING, said in a note. 
The PBOC kept the rate on its one-year medium-term lending facility loans unchanged earlier in the day, dashing expectations for a cut, although investors believe policymakers may resume monetary easing soon to prop up the cooling economy.
The statistics released combined January-February economic data to help smooth out distortions caused by the Lunar New Year holiday, which fell in early February this year.
One highlight from the data was the strong growth in retail sales, which received a boost from product sales related to the Winter Olympic Games, such as skiing equipment and ice sports, Fu Linghui, spokesman for the statistics bureau, told a press conference.
The mascot Bing Dwen Dwen has been an unexpected star of the Beijing Olympics, with thousands of fans lining up in sub-freezing temperatures to buy merchandise - from magnets and key chains to bags and stuffed toys - and factories scrambling to make more.
The solid numbers came after growth lost momentum throughout last year due to a liquidity crunch in the property market and strict anti-virus measures that hit consumption.
""Indeed, every data point has been rebounding, mainly because policy effects kicked in early this year, with loosening in the infrastructure and property sectors. Catering spending also remained relatively strong,"" said Qu Qing, chief economist at Jianghai Securities.
However, analysts warn any nascent recovery, which would help China achieve an ambitious target of around 5.5% for 2022, could not be sustained due to surging COVID cases, a weak property market and the uncertain global recovery.
China stocks fell sharply on Tuesday as an increase in coronavirus cases overshadowed the data and threatened the outlook.
""The economic recovery momentum in January-February was good. At the same time, we should also see that the external environment is still complex and severe, and China's economic development faces many risks and challenges,"" said Fu from the statistics bureau.
Analysts expect the central bank to continue to ease policy to support the economy. 
""We should still cut interest rates and reserve requirement ratios as soon as possible. There should not be any hesitation in terms of providing support from loosening policies,"" said Wang Jun, chief economist at Zhongyuan Bank.
Premier Li Keqiang said last week that he is confident of hitting this year's economic growth target of around 5.5% despite challenges including the war in Ukraine. Li also vowed to provide more policy support in the year.
INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENT PICKING UP 
Fixed-asset investment rose 12.2% in January-February from a year earlier, compared with the 5.0% increase tipped by a Reuters poll and 4.9% growth in 2021. The figure was the highest since July last year.
Infrastructure investment rose 8.1%, helped by a move to front-load 2022 local government special bonds to this year. 
Property investment rose 3.7% from a year in the first two months of 2022, following a 13.9% slump in December, data showed.
The downturn in the property market also showed signs of easing, but sales are still mired in contraction while new construction starts fell by double digits.
""We have continued to stabilise land prices, house prices and expectations, and there have been positive changes in the real estate market,"" Fu said.
China's property market chilled last year as Beijing's deleveraging campaign triggered a liquidity crisis in some major property developers, leading to bond defaults, a plunge in share prices and projects being shelved or left unfinished.

""The resurgence of COVID in multiple provinces poses an additional drag on activity growth. Despite local property policy easing, property indicators, in particular new starts and land sales, deteriorated further. More policy easing would be required to achieve the challenging 'around 5.5%' growth target this year,"" analysts at Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) wrote in a note. 
The nationwide survey-based jobless rate rose to 5.5% in February, up from 5.3% in January, but Fu said the rise was largely due to seasonal factors and the rate could drop after March.

Investing.com – China’s factory production, retail sales, and fixed asset investment beat expectations in the first two months of 2022. The growth came despite the country’s latest COVID-19 outbreak, a property market downturn, and growing global uncertainties.
National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) data released on Tuesday showed that Chinese industrial production grew 7.5% year-on-year in January-February 2022, the fastest pace since June 2021. Forecasts prepared by Investing.com predicted a growth of 3.9% while a growth of 4.3% was recorded for December 2021.
Retail sales grew 6.7% year-on-year, also the fastest since June 2021, due to rising demand during the Lunar New Year holidays and the Beijing Winter Olympics. This contrasts with the 1.7% growth in December 2021 and forecasts prepared by Investing.com that predicted a growth of 3%.
The data also showed that fixed asset investment rose 12.2% year-on-year, compared with the 4.9% growth in December 2021, the highest since July 2021. Forecasts prepared by Investing.com predicted a growth of 5%. The unemployment rate rose to 5.5% in January-February, above the 5.1% that was recorded in December 2021 and predicted in forecasts prepared by Investing.com.
“Overall, the economy had good recovery momentum in January and February,” NBS spokesman Fu Linghui said in a statement. However, the “external environment still remains complex and grim, and there are many risks and challenges faced by China’s economy,” the statement added.
However, the latest COVID-19 outbreak, and ensuing lockdowns, could spread to more cities and impact economic growth, warned some investors.
""I don't think we should be fooled by the surprisingly strong Jan-Feb data... We should still cut interest rates and reserve requirement ratios as soon as possible,"" Zhongyuan Bank chief economist Wang Jun told Reuters. ""There should not be any hesitation in terms of the support from loosening policies.""
The People's Bank of China also kept the one-year medium-term lending facility unchanged at 2.85%, going against expectations for a cut.
China’s factory activity is normally slow during the first two months of the year due to the Lunar New Year holidays. However, many workers did not travel during the holiday due to COVID-19 prevention measures, which kept productivity levels up."
207,By Bloomberg,"<span>Mar 14, 2022 10:18PM ET</span>","China Economy Starts Year Strongly as Covid, War Risks Loom","(Bloomberg) -- China’s economy started the first two months of the year on a strong footing, although risks are growing as the number of local coronavirus cases surge and global energy prices spike due to Russia-Ukraine tensions.
Industrial output grew 7.5% in the two months through February, figures from the National Bureau of Statistics showed Tuesday, compared with 4.3% in December. Economists had expected 4% expansion.
Retail sales rose 6.7%, accelerating from 1.7% in December and beating a 3% increase projected by economists. Investment climbed 12.2% during the two-month period, better than the 5% estimate and last year’s 4.9% growth. The surveyed jobless rate rose to 5.5% last month.        
“Overall the economy had good recovery momentum in January and February,” the NBS said in a statement. However, the “external environment still remains complex and grim, and there are many risks and challenges faced by China’s economy,” it added. 
Data in the first two months are usually distorted by the Lunar New Year holidays and also complicated by the high base of comparison from last year.  
China’s benchmark CSI 300 Index pared a loss of as much as 2.9% after the data, with a sub-gauge of consumer staples trimming its decline by more than half. The futures contract on 10-year government bonds dropped 0.25% as of 10:06 a.m. local time.
Property Slump
The economy has been hit hard by a slump in the property market, with official data showing ongoing weakness in the sector. Residential property sales contracted 22.1% in the first two months of the year from the same period in 2021. 
The outlook for this year is rapidly worsening amid heightened geopolitical tensions and Covid lockdowns in China, making it even harder for the government to achieve its ambitious growth target of around 5.5% this year. 
The People’s Bank of China surprised many by refraining from lowering a key interest rate on Tuesday ahead of the data release. The rate on the one-year medium-term lending facility was left unchanged at 2.85%. A majority of economists in a Bloomberg survey had predicted a 10-basis point cut. 
Instead, the PBOC added monetary stimulus by injecting a net 100 billion yuan ($15.7 billion) of funds into the financial system.  
Credit expansion slowed in February, data released Friday showed, with a key indicator of home mortgages declining for the first time in at least 15 years despite efforts to boost borrowing by cutting rates and lowering down payments. That meant lending to households had the weakest start to any year since 2016. 
The virus outbreaks this month are the worst since the peak of the first wave in Wuhan, and may trigger lockdowns of a larger scale and put much of the world’s second largest economy on halt. The nation has already put major cities including Shenzhen under lockdown, ordered a shutdown of schools and suspension of inter-city bus services in Shanghai, and restricted people in Jilin province from leaving the region. 
The economic cost could subtract 0.8 percentage point from the gross domestic product growth rate if the whole of China’s coastal and northeastern provinces impose similar one-week lockdowns, Australia & New Zealand Banking Group (OTC:ANZBY) Ltd. estimates.

208,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 14, 2022 02:37PM ET</span>",UK business confidence wavering due to Ukraine headwinds - CBI,"LONDON (Reuters) - British businesses' optimism is beginning to falter as the potential impact of Russia's invasion of Ukraine on inflation and consumer spending becomes clearer, the Confederation of British Industry said on Monday.
""Listening to them in the last two weeks, I think you are starting to see business confidence starting to waver now,"" CBI Director-General Tony Danker told the British parliament's Treasury Committee.
Unlike some European countries, Britain trades relatively little with Russia. But higher costs for energy and other inputs were eroding confidence that had been created by the fading of headwinds from the COVID-19 pandemic, Danker said.
Amrita Sen, director of research at economics consultancy Energy Aspects, said she viewed the risk of recession as ""very, very high"" and said Germany could face diesel rationing by the end of the month, with knock-on impacts for Britain.
Jagjit Chadha, director of Britain's National Institute of Economic and Social Research (NIESR), also warned that growth risked grinding to a halt.
""At current energy and oil prices, the UK is skirting very close to a fall in activity. We're going to be hovering around zero next year,"" he told the parliament hearing into the economic impact of the Russia-Ukraine conflict.
British regulated household energy tariffs are already due to rise by more than half next month due to rises in energy costs that pre-date Russia's Feb. 24 invasion.

On Feb. 4 the Bank of England forecast that 2022 would see one of the biggest squeezes on living standards in 30 years, and estimated annual economic growth would slow to about 1.6% by the end of the year.
Inflation is likely to peak above 7% in April, and the central bank is widely expected to raise interest rates back to their pre-pandemic level of 0.75% on Thursday in a bid to stop inflation overshooting its target for too long.

209,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 14, 2022 01:05PM ET</span>","U.S. consumers lift inflation, spending expectations, NY Fed survey finds","By Jonnelle Marte
(Reuters) - U.S. consumers upped their outlook for where inflation will be a year from now and in three years time, and they expect to spend substantially more on food, gas and rent in the next 12 months, according to a survey released on Monday by the New York Federal Reserve. 
Expectations for where inflation will be in one year increased to 6.0% in February from 5.8% in January, returning to the high reached in November for the survey, which was launched in 2013. Expectations for inflation three years out rose to a median of 3.8% from 3.5%, remaining below the levels seen in November and December of last year. The rise in inflation expectations reverses some of the declines seen in January. 
Graphic: Inflation expectations edge higher: https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-FED/CONSUMER-EXPECTATIONS/myvmnbbbzpr/chart.png 
U.S. households are coping with the fastest pace of price increases in 40 years and policymakers are watching closely to see if the shock leads to higher inflation expectations, which could fuel further price hikes, or if consumers largely view the surge in prices as temporary. While near-term inflation expectations have soared, consumers' longer-term expectations have so far been less affected. 
The Russian invasion of Ukraine, which has led to higher fuel prices and may lead to increased food costs, adds more uncertainty to the outlook. 
A measure of market-based U.S. inflation expectations by the London-based ICE (NYSE:ICE) Benchmark Administration (IBA) showed that near-term forecasts jumped sharply in response to government data that showed inflation running about 7%, and rose again after the Russian attack. Long-term inflation expectations inched higher following the Russian invasion.
Fed officials are expected to take a key step in the fight against inflation when they meet this week on Tuesday and Wednesday by raising interest rates from near-zero levels, roughly two years after they slashed rates in response to the coronavirus pandemic. 
The U.S. economy is on more stable footing now, with the unemployment rate at 3.8% and wages rising. But many households are also struggling with rising costs. 

As of February, consumers said they expect their spending to increase by 6.4% in one year, up sharply from the 5.5% anticipated in January and reaching a new high for the survey. They also expect food prices to increase by 9.2% in one year, up from the 5.9% expectation in January, and gas prices to rise by 8.8%, up from a previous estimate of 7.3%. 
The New York Fed's monthly survey of consumer expectations is based on a rotating panel of 1,300 households.

The nights spent in EU short-stay tourist accommodation surged 237% to 102.2 million nights in December compared to a year earlier, Eurostat said, though this remained 27% below the 2019 figure.
Easing coronavirus restrictions and widespread vaccination campaigns helped tourism recover from the early summer, though the emergence of the highly contagious Omicron variant and fresh travel curbs slowed progress over the winter.
Over the entire year, nights spent in tourist lodgings were up 27% from 2020, but remained more than a third under pre-pandemic levels.
The southern coastal nations of Greece, Spain and Croatia led the recovery, all up more than 70%, while Austria, Latvia, and Slovakia saw tourism fall still further from pandemic lows.
Alongside Latvia and Slovakia, Eurostat found that Malta and Hungary were the most impacted by the pandemic, which slashed nights spent in tourist lodgings there by more than half.
Domestic guests made up the bulk of overnight stays at 68%, while those from other EU member states made up nearly a quarter. 

International travel was slower to recover, with nights from guests outside the bloc down to 8% over the last two years, from 18% before the pandemic hit.
Hotels and similar establishments recorded the highest drops compared to 2019, followed by rented holiday accommodation, while campsites were the least affected.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India's annual retail inflation in February for a second consecutive month exceeded 6%, above the central bank's tolerance limit, while economists said policy rates were unlikely to rise soon given worries over economic recovery.
Consumer prices rose 6.07% in February, boosted by rising costs of food, fuel and household items, compared with 6.01% in the previous month, Ministry of Statistics data showed on Monday.
Analysts in a Reuters poll had predicted annual inflation would touch 5.93%, just below the upper limit of the Reserve Bank of India's 2% to 6% target. 
Graphic: India's inflation above central bank's tolerance level for 2 straight months India's inflation above central bank's tolerance level for 2 straight months: https://graphics.reuters.com/INDIA-INFLATION/INDIA/egvbklgkdpq/chart.png 
Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government is worried that rising energy and other commodity prices after the Russian invasion of Ukraine last month, coupled with rupee depreciation could stoke inflationary pressures and hit recovery. 
Food prices, which contribute to nearly half of the consumer price index (CPI), climbed 5.85% year-on-year in February, compared with 5.43% a month before. 
Economists said that in contrast to the U.S. Fed and some other central banks, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) was not expected to raise rates soon despite high inflation given the pressure to support economic recovery. 
Sakshi Gupta, economist at HDFC Bank said the central bank could continue to look beyond high inflation prints — viewing them as a supply side problem — in the near term and lean towards supporting growth.
""We do not expect the RBI to change its stance or policy rate at its April meeting.
RBI's monetary policy committee (MPC) will meet from April 6-8 for its next policy review. 
Economists estimated that the core inflation, excluding volatile fuel and food prices, marginally eased to 5.9% to 5.95% in February from 6% to 6.02% in the previous month. 

Warning against inflationary pressures, Michael Patra, RBI's deputy governor said last week that India's growth story remained as weak as it was during the 2013 'taper tantrum' and geopolitical tensions in Ukraine and Russia were further likely to hurt a recovery.
The RBI's monetary policy committee (MPC) had left the benchmark repo rate unchanged at 4.0% last month, sticking to its accommodative policy stance to help the economy recover from the pandemic.

LONDON (Reuters) - Pet collars and casual clothing are replacing takeaway doughnuts and men's two-piece suits this year as Britain's statisticians update their inflation calculations to account for pandemic trends.
The biggest changes to the inflation basket for 2022 are around food after people ate more at home last year, and increasingly chose plant-based options. 
Vegetarian sausages, canned chickpeas, beans and lentils, dried herbs and frozen readymade Yorkshire puddings have all joined the list.
Anti-bacterial wipes are included for the first time.
The main food item leaving is the single doughnut because Britons have switched to buying multipacks of cakes and pastries to enjoy at home, rather than individual sweet bakery items to snack on while out.
The pandemic has also affected fashion.
""With many people still working from home, demand for more formal clothing has continued to decrease,"" Office for National Statistics head of economic statistics Sam Beckett said.
Women's sports bras and crop tops have been added to reflect new spending on sportswear while men's formal two-piece suits will be replaced by jackets or blazers, which are more widely stocked.
Collars for dogs and cats have been added to reflect greater pet ownership during the pandemic.
Leaving the basket are reference books such as dictionaries and road atlases as people look up similar information online, although cookery books and travel guides remain for now.
Consumer price inflation in Britain is calculated using a basket of more than 700 goods and services which are changed each year to try to keep up with new spending patterns.
With inflation at a 30-year high, the process has come under added scrutiny due to concern that product selections do not adequately reflect the spending choices of poorer people.
The ONS confirmed on Monday that it was making two changes to try to address this, in addition to the normal annual adjustments to the inflation basket.

Later this month people will be able to use a tool on the ONS website to calculate a 'personal' inflation rate that more closely matches their spending patterns.
From 2024 the ONS will include use a far wider range of prices from supermarket tills. This will make it easier to see, for example, if cheaper brands of pasta are rising in price faster or more slowly than expensive ones.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. consumer sentiment fell more than expected in early March as gasoline prices surged to a record high in the aftermath of Russia's war against Ukraine, boosting one-year inflation expectations to the highest level since 1981.
The third straight monthly decline reported by the University of Michigan on Friday pushed consumer sentiment to its lowest level in nearly 11 years. It said 24% of respondents ""spontaneously mentioned the Ukraine invasion in response to questions about the economic outlook."" 
The University of Michigan's preliminary consumer sentiment index dropped to 59.7 in the first half of this month, the lowest reading since September 2011, from a final reading of 62.8 in February. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the index falling to 61.4. 
The survey places more emphasis on gasoline prices and the stock market. The Conference Board's consumer confidence index, which puts more weight on the labor market, remains well above its COVID-19 pandemic lows. 
Economists said the continued slump in the University of Michigan's sentiment index was overdone relative to fundamentals and they expected the economy to continue growing. 
The labor market is churning out jobs at a rapid pace, the unemployment rate is at a two-year low, wages are rising and there were 11.3 million job openings at the end of January. Consumers have amassed more than $2 trillion in excess savings.
""The relationship between spending and sentiment is loose, particularly in the short-run, and real disposable income growth and other determinants of household budgets and finances are more important,"" said Scott Hoyt, a senior economist at Moody's (NYSE:MCO) Analytics in West Chester, Pennsylvania. 
""Support will also be coming from plentiful jobs and abundant available cash and credit for many. The volatility of income expectations may suggest consumers are struggling to understand how labor market tightness and inflation will impact their budgets.""

Following Russia's invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24, crude oil prices jumped more than 30%, with global benchmark Brent hitting a 2008 high at $139 a barrel, before retreating to trade around $110 a barrel on Friday. 
U.S. gasoline prices are averaging a record $4.331 per gallon compared with $3.48 a month ago, AAA data showed.
Further increases are likely after President Joe Biden on Tuesday banned imports of Russian oil into the United States, as part of a wide-ranging tough sanctions against Moscow. 
The University of Michigan survey's gauge of current economic conditions slipped to a reading of 67.8 from 68.2 in February. Its measure of consumer expectations declined to 54.4 from 59.4 in February. 
Graphic: UMich: https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-STOCKS/zgpomzdyepd/umich.png 
The survey's one-year inflation expectations jumped to 5.4%, the highest since 1981, from 4.9% in February. But its five-year inflation expectations held steady at 3.0% for a second straight month, something likely to be welcomed by Federal Reserve officials.
The U.S. central bank is expected to start raising interest rates next Wednesday. Economists expect as many as seven rate hikes this year.

(Reuters) - Canada posted a blockbuster job gain in February, easily beating expectations and more than wiping out January's decline, while the unemployment rate dropped below its pre-pandemic level for the first time, data from Statistics Canada showed on Friday.
The economy added a net 336,600 jobs, more than double the 160,000 analysts had forecast, Statscan said. The jobless rate fell to 5.5%, its lowest level since 5.4% in May 2019, as Canada reopened from strict Omicron restrictions. 
Hours worked surged 3.6%, rising above February 2020 levels for the first time, with the average hourly wage of permanent employees up 3.3%. Overall, employment is now 1.9% above pre-pandemic levels.
""We were expecting strength, but not nearly as much as that,"" said Jimmy Jean, chief economist at Desjardins Group. 
""Canada has a history of a very resilient job market coming out of those (COVID-19) waves... You have a lot of jobs and that will allow consumers to be able to absorb the impact of higher inflation, especially with wages accelerating."" 
Graphic: Canada net jobs losses or gains by month: https://graphics.reuters.com/CANADA-ECONOMY/EMPLOYMENT/klvykbrjevg/chart.png 
The blowout gain comes as the Bank of Canada is widely expected to go ahead with second rate hike at its next meeting in April. Chances of a 50-basis-point hike edged up to 45% from 37% before the report, money market data showed.
Governor Tiff Macklem last week said the central bank has ""considerable space"" left to raise rates and did not rule out a 50 bps move if needed to curb surging consumer prices. Inflation hit a 30-year high in January at 5.1%.
While job market strength boosts the chance of a more aggressive hike going forward, it is not likely to happen in April, with too much uncertainty clouding the outlook, said Doug Porter, chief economist at BMO Capital Markets.
""I think they would need to see a little bit more clarity on the situation in Ukraine, and global financial markets in general, before they took an aggressive step,"" he said. 

""Let's just say their finger is going to be on the 50-basis-points trigger now when conditions allow.""

218,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 11, 2022 05:46AM ET</span>",UK year-ahead inflation expectations rise to highest since 2008,"LONDON (Reuters) - The British public's expectations for the rate of inflation in a year's time rose to the highest since 2008, although the increase in longer-term expectations has been less marked, a quarterly survey by the Bank of England showed on Friday.
The median inflation expectation for 12 months' time rose to 4.3% in February's survey from 3.2% in November, its highest since August 2008. Expectations for two- and five years' time were the highest since 2013 and 2020 at 3.2% and 3.3%.
BoE policymakers closely watch inflation expectations as they view them as a way that temporarily high inflation can become persistent through its effect on companies' pricing plans or employees' wage demands, even after the initial drivers of higher prices have faded.
However a one-off question asked in February's survey showed workers expected their pay to rise by just 2.1% over the next 12 months, far below the rate of inflation.
British consumer price inflation hit its highest in nearly 30 years in January at 5.5% due to higher energy prices and post-pandemic bottlenecks in supply chains. 
Many economists think it could exceed 8% this year and reach its highest since the early 1980s due to the further upward impact on oil and gas prices from Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
Other measures of inflation expectations have moved up too. 

Citi's monthly survey with polling company YouGov showed the public's expectations for inflation in five to 10 years' time rose to 4.1% last month, the joint highest since the series began in 2005, while financial markets price in the highest inflation in more than a decade.
The BoE survey took place in two waves of around 2,200 people around Feb. 4-7 and Feb. 18-21. It was conducted by polling company Ipsos, which has replaced Kantar as the survey provider.

219,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 11, 2022 04:46AM ET</span>","UK economy surges unexpectedly, bolstering case for rate hike next week","By Andy Bruce and David Milliken
LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's economy rebounded much more than expected in January from its coronavirus-related lull in late 2021, according to data on Friday, raising - along with soaring inflation - the likelihood of an interest rate hike next week.
The Office for National Statistics said gross domestic product grew by 0.8% month-on-month in January after a 0.2% decline in December when the Omicron wave of coronavirus held back growth. This was the strongest monthly expansion since June and more than forecast by any economist in a Reuters poll which had pointed to growth of 0.2%.
All the main sectors of Britain's economy grew more than expected, with the wholesale and retail sector as well as pubs and restaurants being particular drivers, the ONS said.
While growth looked likely to continue into February, economists warned of tougher times ahead.
""The cost of living crisis and the influence of the war in Ukraine probably means this is as good as it gets for the year,"" said Paul Dales, chief UK economist at consultancy Capital Economics.
Responding to the data, finance minister Rishi Sunak warned that the Russia-Ukraine conflict had raised uncertainty around the economic outlook and that it warranted vigilance.
With investors focused on the consequences of the conflict in Ukraine, the pound showed little reaction to the January growth figures.
The size of the British economy in January was 0.8% larger than its pre-pandemic level in February 2020 but remained about 4% smaller than if it had continued growing at its trend rate for the last decade, according to a Reuters calculation. 
GRAPHIC: UK economy trend https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/polling/xmvjoewlnpr/Pasted%20image%201646984763695.png 
The ONS said output would be around 1.2% below its pre-pandemic size if extra spending on healthcare was stripped out.
Last month the Bank of England said the economy looked set to grow around 3.75% this year, with inflation peaking at around 7.25% in April - but those forecasts have already been eclipsed by the inflationary consequences of Russia's invasion of Ukraine for financial markets and international trade.
Still, the strength of the economy shown in Friday's data - in addition to galloping inflation - will likely bolster bets that BoE policymakers will raise interest rates next week for the third time in the space of three months.
The British Chambers of Commerce (BCC) warned this could prove to be a mistake.
""Raising interest rates and taxes at this time would weaken the UK's growth prospects further, by undermining confidence and diminishing households' and firms' finances,"" BCC head of economics Suren Thiru said.
Britain's goods trade deficit, excluding volatile flows of precious metals, rose to its widest on record in January at 21.9 billion pounds ($28.6 billion), up from 14.7 billion pounds in December, driven by a sharp widening in the trade deficit with the EU.
Part of the increase was due to a post-Brexit change in how data on trade with the EU was collected. Around 2 billion pounds of a 3 billion pound fall in goods exports to the EU in January was a one-off effect related to this, the ONS said.
Customs officials said a 4.7 billion pound rise in imports from the EU was ""predominantly"" the result of a genuine shift, such as a 2.0 billion pound rise in imports of transport equipment - mostly cars - due to reduced domestic production.

Trade with non-EU countries was little changed from December.

220,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 10, 2022 07:56PM ET</span>",Jobs open up for homeless people in UK labour market squeeze,"By William Schomberg
WATFORD, England (Reuters) - When Zara Asamoah graduated early in the coronavirus pandemic, she had no fixed abode and her chances of finding work looked remote.
Now, thanks to an acute lack of job candidates as Britain's economy reopens and to support from Beam, a crowd-funding charity that helps homeless people into work, Asamoah has a job with a London railway operator and lives in a shared house. 
""It's taken a huge pressure off of me "" said the 25 year-old, who found it hard to apply for jobs without a stable address, and to get a home without regular income.
Globally, a shortage of people to fill jobs after the pandemic wrought changes to labour markets is worrying central banks who fear wage demands will fuel inflation already at multi-decade highs.
In Britain, the problems are exacerbated by a drop in EU workers after the country left the European Union. Vacancies are the highest on record. As a result, organizations that work with people employers were long wary of, including homeless people as well as other typically marginalised groups such as ex-offenders, say more opportunities are opening up.
Beam estimates interest from employers in its services has tripled since the start of the pandemic. It has ramped up operations to help nearly 30 people a month into jobs so far this year, compared with about 3 a month in 2019, before the pandemic.
While firm numbers of how many homeless people are now being drawn into the workplace are hard to come by, the potential pool of labour is large. 
In December, charity Shelter estimated 274,000 people were homeless in England, most of them like Asamoah crashing with friends and family, rather than sleeping rough.
VACANCIES SURGE, WORKFORCE SHRINKS
Britain's ratio of 4.1 vacancies to 100 employee jobs is a record. 
During the pandemic many older workers took early retirement and young people opted to stay in education. In late 2021, the share of 16-64 year-olds not in work and not looking for it stood at 21.2%, up from 20.2% in early 2020, government data shows, equivalent to around half a million missing workers.
Sonali Punhani, chief UK economist at  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN), said the problem was currently even more acute in the United States, where emergency welfare payments have sidelined many workers.
But Brexit meant Britain's recovery would likely be slower. 
""Workers will come back over this year but I don't think participation will come back to pre-pandemic levels,"" Punhani said.
Emily Hocking, head of talent acquisition for buses and trains at Arriva Group, the parent of Arriva Rail London which hired Asamoah, said the situation was ""incredibly tough"" for employers.
""Brexit, COVID - it's completely changed the landscape,"" she said.
Faced with candidate shortages that were ""not sustainable,"" Arriva looked for more hires from new sources. After a successful trial between Beam and its London unit, Arriva now plans a national-level partnership.
A WEEK TURNS TO YEARS
As well as the high demand for labour, organizations such as Beam are key to breaking the cycle that keeps homeless people out of work.
Asamoah was first left without a fixed address in 2016 when her mother was evicted over rent arrears. She stayed first with her boyfriend at the time, then a family friend, then her sister, doing only occasional part-time work.
""A week turned into two weeks. Two weeks turned into a month. A month turned into a year,"" she said. ""I realized that we were just not going to get the family home back.""
Asamoah stuck to her film-making course at university despite the upheaval. After graduating in 2020, she was struggling again to find somewhere to stay when her local council put her in touch with Beam. 
Crowd-funding of just over 3,000 pounds ($3,936) got Asamoah into a shared house a year ago and covered the cost of a laptop and other expenses. Beam coached her on job interviews and introduced her to employers, including Arriva. 
Alex Stephany, Beam's founder, said companies could meet the challenge of worker shortages by doing ""the right thing for society"" and hiring ethically and diversely.
Interventions Alliance, an organisation that helps former offenders find jobs, said it was now much easier to place its clients with a wider range of companies, including transport and hospitality businesses that were previously reluctant.
""There is now much more openness,"" said Suki Binning, the group's executive director for justice and social care. 
For Fox Group, a haulage and construction firm in Blackpool, northwest England, there is potential in nearby Kirkham Prison.
A shift to online shopping in the pandemic made drivers some of the most sought-after workers, compounding the loss of about 4% of Fox's drivers and construction staff after Brexit.
Fox currently employs two former inmates of the prison and seven others who are allowed out to work during the day. In the next few weeks, Fox will open an academy to train and potentially hire 45 inmates as machinery drivers on day release and once they are fully released.

""It's a bit of a no-brainer,"" director Lee Hardy said. ""There are loads of guys out there who want to work and we've got work that we can offer.""

221,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 10, 2022 07:46PM ET</span>",Households squeezed as U.S. consumer prices accelerate; more pain coming,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. consumer prices surged in February, forcing Americans to dig deeper to pay for rent, food and gasoline, and inflation is poised to accelerate even further as Russia's war against Ukraine drives up the costs of crude oil and other commodities.
The broad rise in prices reported by the Labor Department on Thursday led to the largest annual increase in inflation in 40 years. Inflation was already haunting the economy before Russia's invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24, and could further erode President Joe Biden's popularity. 
The Federal Reserve is expected to start raising interest rates next Wednesday. With inflation nearly four times the U.S. central bank's 2% target, economists are expecting as many as seven rate hikes this year. 
Lower-income households bear the brunt of high inflation as they spend more of their income on food and gasoline. 
""Consumers' shock at rapidly rising gas prices at the pump will continue to put pressure on the Fed and policymakers to do something, anything, to slow down the speed at which prices everywhere are moving higher,"" said Chris Zaccarelli, chief investment officer at Independent Advisor Alliance in Charlotte, North Carolina.
The consumer price index increased 0.8% last month after gaining 0.6% in January. A 6.6% rebound in gasoline prices accounted for almost a third of the increase in the CPI. Gasoline prices had declined 0.8% in January. Food prices jumped 1.0%, with the cost of food consumed at home soaring 1.4%. 
Prices for fruit and vegetables increased by the most since March 2010, while the rise in the cost of dairy and related products was the largest in nearly 11 years.
In the 12 months through February, the CPI shot up 7.9%, the biggest year-on-year increase since January 1982. That followed a 7.5% jump in January and was the fifth straight month of annual CPI readings north of 6%. February's increase in the CPI was in line with economists' expectations.
Last month's CPI data does not fully capture the spike in oil prices following the outbreak of the war in Ukraine. Prices shot up more than 30%, with global benchmark Brent hitting a 2008 high at $139 a barrel, before retreating to trade around $112 a barrel on Thursday. 
The United States and its allies have imposed harsh sanctions on Moscow, with Biden on Tuesday banning imports of Russian oil into the United States. Russia is the world's second-largest crude oil exporter. 
U.S. gasoline prices are averaging a record $4.318 per gallon compared with $3.469 a month ago, AAA data showed.
Biden on Thursday acknowledged the hardships Americans were facing from sky-rocketing prices, but blamed Russian President Vladimir Putin's actions.
""As I have said from the start, there will be costs at home as we impose crippling sanctions in response to Putin's unprovoked war, but Americans can know this, the costs we are imposing on Putin and his cronies are far more devastating than the costs we are facing,"" Biden said in a statement. 
Soaring inflation is wiping out wage gains. Inflation adjusted average hourly earnings fell 2.6% on a year-on-year basis in February, the Labor Department said. Moody's (NYSE:MCO) Analytics estimates that inflation at February levels was costing the average household $296.45 per month, up from $276 in January.
Economists expect the annual CPI rate will peak above 8% in March or April and start to slow in the following months as the high readings from last spring drop out of the calculation. 
Stocks on Wall Street were lower. The dollar gained versus a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury yields rose.
SOARING RENT COSTS
Inflation was ignited by a shift in spending to goods from services during the COVID-19 pandemic and trillions of dollars in relief from the government. The resulting surge in demand ran against capacity constraints as the spread of the coronavirus pushed millions of workers out of the labor market, making it harder to move raw materials to factories and finished goods to consumers.
Excluding the volatile food and energy components, the CPI increased 0.5% last month after advancing 0.6% in January.
A 0.5% rise in the cost of shelter like rental accommodation as well as hotel and motel rooms accounted for more than 40% of the increase in the so-called core CPI. The cost of rent jumped 0.6%, the most since March 2005. Rental costs are sticky and will keep core CPI hot. 
""Due to the way rents are sampled in the CPI, resampling every six months, the index tends to lag other indicators such as the Zillow Observed Rent Index, suggesting CPI rents will likely continue to rise strongly for a while yet,"" said Daniel Vernazza, chief international economist at UniCredit in London.
Consumers paid more for household furnishings and operations, motor vehicle insurance as well as clothing and personal care. Airline fares soared 5.2% as sharply declining coronavirus infections boosted demand for travel. 
But prices of new motor vehicles rose modestly while used cars and trucks fell, suggesting some easing in pent-up demand. Motor vehicles were one of the main drivers of inflation because of a global semiconductor shortage.
In the 12 months through February, the core CPI vaulted 6.4%, the largest year-on-year gain since August 1982, after increasing 6.0% in January.
Despite high inflation, tighter monetary policy and the conflict in Ukraine, a recession is not expected. Demand for labor is strong, with a near record 11.3 million job openings at the end of January. Households are sitting on about $2.6 trillion in excess savings.

""The cost to consumers is high,"" said Ryan Sweet, a senior economist at Moody's Analytics in West Chester, Pennsylvania. ""However, there are also reasons to be optimistic that consumers can weather a temporary spike in gasoline prices, as household balance sheets in aggregate are in great shape. Gasoline spending as a share of total nominal consumption is low."" 
Though a separate report from the Labor Department showed initial claims for state unemployment benefits increased 11,000 to a seasonally adjusted 227,000 for the week ended March 5, they remained at levels consistent with a tight labor market.

222,By Bloomberg,"<span>Mar 10, 2022 06:54PM ET</span>",Japan Household Spending Falls as Omicron Brings Back Curbs,"(Bloomberg) -- Japan’s household spending fell in January, as consumers held back on spending during the rapid spread of the omicron variant and renewed restrictions on activity, adding to the risk that the economy will shrink this quarter.
Outlays fell 1.2% from December for the sixth drop in the last nine months, the ministry of internal affairs reported Friday. Spending rose 6.9% from the low levels of a year ago, compared with a 3.4% gain forecast by analysts. 
The fall in spending from last month could contribute to Japan’s recovery slipping back into reverse this quarter with the war in Ukraine adding to the uncertainties for the economic outlook. Household spending accounts for more than half of gross domestic product.
Spending dropped as virus cases shot up from around 500 a day at the beginning of January to more than 100,000 a month later, sapping momentum from a rebound in consumption in the last quarter of 2021. 
The spread of omicron prompted Prime Minister Fumio Kishida’s government to bring back restrictions telling businesses to cut their operating hours and restrict alcohol sales.
The year-on-year gain shows that the hit to spending from the latest restrictions hasn’t been as big as the drop last January during the stricter curbs of a full state of emergency.
While the omicron wave seems to have peaked in February, Kishida has extended this year’s quasi-emergency measures in Tokyo and other areas into late March because the pace of the retreat has been slow. 
What Bloomberg Economics Says...
“Looking forward, we expect a mild drop in 1Q GDP spending, which is a quarter-on-quarter measure. Outlays will be hit by virus curbs that were reinstated in January and have been extended into March for key areas of the country.”

He’s also been trying to speed up a third vaccine shot, which has been lagging behind other advanced nations. Less than 30% of the population has received the booster shot so far. 
Concern is mounting that escalating energy prices exacerbated by sanctions on Russia will continue to keep household consumption subdued even after omicron concerns recede. The government has responded to the increase in gasoline prices by ramping up subsidies, but speculation is emerging that more help will be rolled out. 
Around half of economists surveyed by Bloomberg expect Kishida to unveil further stimulus measures to support the economy ahead of a summer election he needs to do well in to shore up support for his leadership.
Kishida, Japan’s third premier of the pandemic, already put together a 56 trillion yen package in November to support growth.

Annual consumer inflation reached 10.42% as of March 4, as the rouble touched it historic lows following the Russian invasion of Ukraine, followed by harsh Western sanctions which cut off the central bank and banks from the global financial system.

“This inflation report might be just a prelude to an even uglier report when we get the March data. Gasoline prices are up 20% since the beginning of the month. Food costs are up. Goods excluding food and energy downshifted to a slower gear in February, but food and energy will keep inflation looking really hot for at least another month. The Fed can’t bring peace to Ukraine and Russia, so there’s little that monetary policy can do to tame food and energy inflation. It may have to just say that it is serious about fighting inflation, but it is also seriously hamstrung in what it can do right now.”
 
PETER CARDILLO, CHIEF MARKET ECONOMIST, SPARTAN CAPITAL SECURITIES, NEW YORK
“Bottom line is inflation is elevated and there’s more to come.”
“I was looking for inflation to peak in the second quarter but now that depends on oil. Perhaps we won’t see any relief until the end of the year.”
“Powell already told us we should expect a 25 basis point rate hike (this month). It should be 50 basis points or even 75 basis points but that won’t happen because of what’s happening in Ukraine right now.”

The consumer price index jumped 7.9% from a year earlier following a 7.5% annual gain in January, Labor Department data showed Thursday. The widely followed inflation gauge rose 0.8% in February from a month earlier, reflecting higher gasoline, food and shelter costs.
Follow the reaction in real time here on Bloomberg’s TOPLive blog
The median projections of economists in a Bloomberg survey called for the CPI to rise 7.9% from a year ago and 0.8% from January. 
Excluding volatile food and energy components, so-called core prices increased 0.5% from a month earlier and 6.4% from a year ago.
The data illustrate the extent to which inflation was tightening its grip on the economy before Russia’s war brought about a spike in commodities, including the highest retail gasoline price on record. Most economists had expected February would be the peak for annual inflation, but the conflict likely means even higher inflation prints in the coming months.
To combat building price pressures, the Federal Reserve is set to raise interest rates next week for the first time since 2018. At the same time, the geopolitical situation adds uncertainty to the central bank’s rate hiking cycle over the coming year.
Fed officials could take a more hawkish stance if energy price shocks lead to higher and more persistent inflation, but they also may take a more cautious approach if sinking consumer sentiment and declining real wages begin to weigh on growth as the war drags on.
The February report showed that gasoline prices rose 6.6% from the prior month and accounted for almost a third of the monthly increase in the CPI. Some of that may reflect energy price spikes resulting from the first days of Russia’s invasion during the last week of the month. The impact will be more fully captured in the March CPI report. 
So far this month, the retail price of a regular-grade gasoline has increased 19.3% to $4.32 a gallon, according to American Automobile Association data.
Food prices climbed 1% from the prior month, the largest advance since April 2020, the CPI report showed.
While the war’s full impact on the U.S. economy remains unclear, soaring costs of oil, grains and metals are likely to feed through to other commodities and ultimately consumer prices. The Biden administration on Tuesday banned Russian oil imports into the U.S., a move that will add to energy price pressures.

226,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 10, 2022 01:55AM ET</span>",Japan's wholesale prices rise at record pace; Ukraine to spur prices further,"By Leika Kihara
TOKYO (Reuters) -Japan's wholesale inflation accelerated in February at the fastest pace in roughly four decades on rising fuel costs, a sign inflationary pressures were building up even before the Ukraine crisis triggered a broad-based surge in commodity prices.
The recent war-driven spike in goods prices ranging from oil, to metals to grain will likely keep pushing up wholesale prices in a fresh hit to Japan's resource-poor economy, which is heavily reliant on imported raw material, analysts say.
""Even if the war in Ukraine ends, sanctions against Russia will remain and keep prices high mainly for fuel,"" said Takumi Tsunoda, senior economist at Shinkin Central Bank Research Institute.
""The rising inflationary pressure adds to pain for Japan's consumption, which was already weak compared to that of Western economies, and may delay the country's recovery,"" he said.
The corporate goods price index (CGPI), which measures the price companies charge each other for their goods and services, jumped 9.3% in February from a year earlier, Bank of Japan (BOJ) data showed on Thursday, the fastest annual pace since comparable data became available in 1981.
The rise exceeded market forecasts for an 8.7% gain and accelerated from a revised 8.9% gain in January, mainly due to a 34.2% jump in fuel prices. The February index, at 110.7, was the highest level marked since 1985.
Of the total components making up the index, 67% saw prices rise in February from a year before in a sign inflationary pressure was broadening.
The war in Ukraine has led to a further spike in fuel and commodity prices, which will likely push consumer inflation closer to the BOJ's 2% target in coming months but also weigh on the country's fragile economic recovery.
Households and retailers may feel the pain of the recent rise in raw material costs throughout most of the year, as the pass-through of such price increases come with a lag.
The recent rise in wheat costs, for instance, will be reflected in domestic flour prices from July.
While raw material prices jumped 50.9% in February from a year earlier, final goods prices rose just 4.1% in a sign some firms are struggling to pass on the rapid rise in input costs.

Rising energy costs add strains to Japan's economy, which is likely to see growth grind to a halt this quarter as coronavirus curbs hurt consumption.
""Cost-push inflation will continue for the time being,"" said Toru Suehiro, senior economist at Daiwa Securities. ""There's no sign of wage inflation in Japan, which means there's a strong chance consumer sentiment will cool.""

With the Bank of England worried about the labour market overheating, the Recruitment and Employment Confederation (REC) trade body and accountants KPMG said their index of permanent staff placements dropped to 65.3 in February from 66.8 in January.
But pay pressures for permanent staff rose at the second-fastest pace since the survey started in 1997.
""While recruitment activity has slowed slightly, employers across all sectors continued to hire energetically during February,"" said Claire Warnes, head of education, skills and productivity at KPMG UK.

Staff shortages and wage growth that appears to be higher than before the pandemic are part of the reason why the BoE raised interest rates in February for the second time in two months, faster than other major central banks.
The central bank thinks pressures in the labour market will stop inflation falling back fully to its 2% target unless borrowing costs rise further.

LONDON (Reuters) - House price growth in Britain hit a new eight-month high in February as the housing market showed little sign of losing momentum amid a growing cost-of-living squeeze, a survey showed on Thursday.
The Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (RICS) said a net balance of +79% of its members reported a rise in house prices in February, up from +74% in January and its highest since June. A Reuters poll of economists had pointed to a reading of +73%.
The report echoed other surveys that show Britain's housing market retained much of its momentum going into 2022, despite the phasing out of temporary tax breaks on property purchases in the second half of 2021.
But with household budgets being squeezed by high inflation and imminent tax rises, RICS had doubts about whether the housing market can keep up its recent strength - even though there is scant sign of a slowdown now.
""Huge clouds of uncertainty hang over the economic prospects as energy prices continue to surge and the Bank of England grapples with how to manage monetary policy in this challenging environment,"" said Simon Rubinsohn, RICS chief economist.
""Despite all of this, there is little evidence yet that the mood music regarding the expectations for house prices or rents is shifting.""
Expectations for house price growth in the coming 12 months were strong cross all parts of the United Kingdom, the survey showed.
Rents were expected to increase by an average 4.5% over the next 12 months. The proportion of surveyors expecting rents to rise was the highest since December 2012, RICS said.

Rubinsohn said the mismatch between strong demand and a shortage of sellers would likely keep prices high.
""The risk is that these imbalances exacerbate the cost-of-living crisis and the challenges particularly for those on lower incomes,"" he said.

229,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 09, 2022 03:26PM ET</span>","U.S. labor market very tight, job openings near record high in January","By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. job openings fell in January, but remained near record highs as worker shortages persisted, pointing to a tight labor market that will continue to generate strong wage gains and contribute to keeping inflation high.
Job openings, a measure of labor demand, dropped 185,000 to 11.263 million on the last day of January, the Labor Department said on Wednesday in its monthly Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey, or JOLTS report. 
Data for December was revised higher to show a record 11.448 million job openings instead of the previously reported 10.925 million. The government revised the 2021 data.
""The labor market is tight as a drum and this means wage pressures and inflation will persist,"" said Christopher Rupkey, chief economist at FWDBONDS in New York. ""Time will tell if war in Europe and plummeting stock prices will slow down the demand for new hires in the months to come.""
The Federal Reserve is expected to raise interest rates next Wednesday to quell inflation. Economists expect as many as seven rate hikes, though much would depend on the fallout from Russia's war against Ukraine. The United States and its allies have imposed harsh sanctions on Moscow. On Tuesday, President Joe Biden banned imports of Russian oil into the United States.
The two-week war has sent prices of oil, wheat and other commodities soaring. Economists believe the excess demand for labor could provide a shield for the economy even as the Russia-Ukraine war is seen hurting business confidence. 
""The labor market still has the chance to gracefully slow down with demand cooling but not necessarily crashing,"" said Nick Bunker, economic research director for North America at the Indeed Hiring Lab. ""But so far the data on openings and turnover don't show that trend beginning.""
In January, vacancies fell in several industries, with accommodation and food services reporting a 288,000 drop. 
In the transportation, warehousing, and utilities industry, job openings fell 132,000, while unfilled positions in the federal government decreased 60,000. But job openings increased 136,000 in other services businesses. The durable goods manufacturing industry reported 85,000 more job openings. The job openings rate dipped to 7.0% from 7.1% in December.
HUGE DEMAND-SUPPLY GAP 
Hiring rose by a modest 7,000 to 6.5 million. Hiring was little changed in all industries. The hires rate was unchanged at 4.3%. The government reported last week that nonfarm payrolls increased by 678,000 in February. 
There was a 4.8 million gap between the number of job openings and the number of unemployed workers in January, accounting for 2.9% of the labor force. 
Economists view the jobs-workers gap as a better indicator of labor market tightness and wage growth. There were a record 1.8 open jobs per unemployed person in January, also underscoring tight labor market conditions. 
The U.S. Chamber of Commerce urged lawmakers to boost legal immigration.
""It is past time for Congress to act to modernize our broken immigration system,"" U.S. Chamber of Commerce Chief Policy Officer Neil Bradley said in a statement. ""We can't get inflation under control, unclog our supply chains, or fully grow our economy and remain competitive unless we welcome more people into our country to fill these jobs.""
The JOLTS report also showed the number of people voluntarily quitting their jobs decreased by 151,000 to a still-high 4.3 million in January. 
Fewer people quit in retail trade and information sectors, but more left their jobs in finance and insurance. The quits rate fell to 2.8% from 3.0% in December. The revisions also showed 47.8 million quit their jobs in 2021.
""Before the pandemic, quits accounted for 50% of all job separations, on average,"" said Julia Pollak, chief economist at ZipRecruiter. ""In 2021, however, they made up 70%, a sign that workers had more job security than usual and were largely the ones calling the shots."" 

The JOLTS report supported economists' view that a slowdown in wage growth in February was a fluke. Average hourly earning were unchanged last month, which lowered the annual increase in wages to 5.1% from 5.5% in January
""These data tell us far more about the labor market than does the flat reading on overall average hourly earnings for February,"" said Conrad DeQuadros, senior economic advisor at Brean Capital in New York.

Figures from national statistics office INEGI on Wednesday showed consumer price inflation advanced to 7.28% from 7.07% in January, a rate more than double the Bank of Mexico's target. A February reading of 7.23% had been forecast in a Reuters poll.
Core inflation, which strips out some volatile items, accelerated by nearly fourth tenths of a percentage point to 6.59%, the highest rate since mid-2001.
Bank of Mexico (Banxico) board member Jonathan Heath said on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) that core inflation had likely not peaked in February, forecasting it would be above 6.7% in March, and he warned that the Ukraine-Russia conflict could lift prices higher.
""High inflation will be more persistent than we had anticipated, both in Mexico and globally,"" he said.
Banxico targets inflation of 3%, with a one percentage point tolerance range above and below that. In February the bank raised its benchmark interest rate by 50 basis points, a sixth consecutive rise, flagging inflation risks.
Still, Mexico's economy stagnated in the fourth quarter, and Heath last week noted that higher borrowing costs would not make recovery easier.
Capital Economics economist Nikhil Sanghani said that while Mexico is rolling out more fuel subsidies to soften the blow of soaring energy prices, higher costs for food and goods would likely push headline inflation to 7.5% in coming months.

""Against this backdrop, there is a growing chance that Banxico will increase the pace of tightening at its meeting later this month,"" Sanghani said in a research note. 
Compared with the previous month, Mexican consumer prices rose 0.83% in February, the INEGI data showed. The core index increased 0.76% over the same period..

According to the Rosstat data released on Wednesday, prices on nearly everything from bread to gasoline have spiked, with cost of sugar and cereals such as buckwheat - top products that Russians stockpile - showing some of the biggest increases of 20.6% and 18%, respectively. 
Yet the biggest cost rise was in construction materials such as wallpaper and bathroom tiles, with prices spiking by 22.5%, indicating an increased demand to finish renovation projects amid booming costs for imported goods as the rouble was falling. 
Annual consumer inflation reached 10.42% as of March 4, the economy ministry said separately on Wednesday, up from 9.05% as of Feb. 25. Weekly inflation rose to 2.22% from 0.45% in the preceding week. 
The Russian central bank raised its key interest rate to 20% from 9.5% in an emergency move last week, introduced capital controls and told its export-focused companies to sell foreign currency as the rouble tumbled to record lows. 

On Wednesday, the Russian parliament said it was ready to introduce proposals to regulate prices for food, medicines and other goods, with the government separately ordering the prioritisation of grain sales to domestic bakers in order to secure bread for Russians. 
Month on month, inflation was up 1.17% in February, Rosstat said. In the week to March 4, the consumer price index rose 2.22%.

ROME (Reuters) - Italian industrial output posted its steepest fall for more than a year in January, data showed on Wednesday, as the growth outlook for the euro zone's third largest economy weakens amid surging energy prices.
Industrial production declined by 3.4% from the month before, Italy's statistics bureau ISTAT reported. That followed a 1.1% drop in December and was the largest fall since September 2020. 
Italy had not posted two consecutive monthly declines since March and April 2020, at the height of its coronavirus crisis.
The data gets this year off to a weak start even before the economic headwinds generated by the rising energy costs, Russia's invasion of Ukraine and the sanctions imposed on Moscow by Western nations.
In a separate report, ISTAT said the recent rise in energy costs, which crimps the purchasing power of households and the competitiveness of companies, will reduce Italy's economic growth this year by around 0.7 percentage points. 
The Italian economy expanded by 6.6% in 2021 following a record contraction of 9.0% in 2020, a year hobbled by coronavirus lockdowns.
For this year Prime Minister Mario Draghi's government officially forecasts a rise in gross domestic product (GDP) of 4.7%, but the outlook has worsened significantly since that projection was made last autumn.
Draghi acknowledged this on Monday, telling reporters the geopolitical tensions linked to Russia's invasion of Ukraine ""will clearly influence economic growth this year"". 
Amid mounting signs of a slowdown, the Bank of Italy reported on Monday that bad loans at Italian banks rose in January from the month before and bank lending to firms slowed. 
Bologna-based think-tank Prometeia said after January's data it now expected a 2.2% fall in industrial output in the first quarter from the previous three months. 
That would be the first quarterly drop since the fourth quarter of 2020.

On a work-day adjusted year-on-year basis, industry output fell 2.6% in January, and ISTAT reported that it was 1.9% below the level of February 2020, before the pandemic hit the economy. 
January saw marked month-on-month falls across all the main product groups of consumer goods, investment goods, intermediate goods and energy products.

235,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 09, 2022 03:10AM ET</span>","China Feb factory inflation eases, spotlight on global commodities","By Liangping Gao and Ryan Woo
BEIJING (Reuters) - China's factory inflation in February eased to the slowest annual pace in eight months, but analysts expect a pick-up in the coming months from surging prices of global commodities including oil, challenging policy-making to support the economy. 
The producer price index (PPI) increased 8.8% on year, the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) said in a statement on Wednesday, easing from 9.1% growth in January but just higher than an 8.7% rise in a Reuters poll. 
Many Chinese factories closed in the first half of February due to Lunar New Year festivities, putting a temporary leash on demand for raw materials. But the war in Ukraine that erupted late last month has since raised concerns of global supply disruptions, pushing commodity prices to decade-highs.
Month-on-month, the PPI swung to a gain from a decline in January, with international crude oil prices rising sharply and driving up prices in domestic oil-related industries, according to a separate NBS statement. Local prices of non-ferrous metals also rose. 
""We expect year-over-year PPI inflation to stay elevated in the near-term as oil and metal prices increased sequentially due to geopolitical tensions,"" Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) analysts wrote in a note. 
On Monday, an official at the state economic planner also said China's efforts to stabilise commodity prices face new challenges partly due to geopolitical conflicts.
China sources more than 70% of its oil and 40% of its gas from overseas even as the government races to increase domestic output. 
Persistently high oil prices prompted by Russia's attack on Ukraine could cut a full percentage point off the growth of large oil-importing developing economies including China, according to the World Bank on Tuesday.
China is targeting slower economic growth of around 5.5% in 2022 compared with last year, with the government citing headwinds at home and abroad.
POLICY
China's central bank in December cut the reserve requirement ratio (RRR) for commercial lenders, or the amount of cash that banks must hold in reserve, by 50 basis points, releasing 1.2 trillion yuan ($190 billion) in long-term liquidity.
Some analysts said the scope for monetary easing may now be limited due to the threat of higher commodity prices. 
""Sanctions on Russia could axe China-Russian trade and may lead to higher imported prices,"" said Bruce Pang, Head of Macro and Strategy Research at China Renaissance Securities. 
The central bank said on Tuesday it will pay more than 1 trillion yuan in profit to the central government this year, in a bid to help support fiscal spending.
The profits come from its foreign exchange reserve operations in recent years, said the People's Bank of China (PBOC). 
""The PBOC's profit transfer is a better way to ease money supply in my opinion,"" said Tian Yun, former vice director of the Beijing Economic Operation Association. 
""The focus of the PBOC this year would be adjustments on the structure of assets and liabilities to keep a relative loose monetary policy,"" Tian said.
According to ANZ Research, the PBOC profit transfer is equivalent to a liquidity boost from an RRR cut of more than 50 basis points. 
China's consumer price index (CPI) inched up 0.9% in February, the data showed, unchanged from the growth in January and market expectations.

The Chinese government left its 2022 CPI target, unveiled on Saturday, at around 3%, unchanged from 2021. Last year, the CPI rose just 0.9%, reined in by cautious consumer spending.

Investing.com – China's factory inflation fell to the slowest annual pace in eight months in February 2022, thanks to the seasonal effects of the Lunar New Year holiday. However, investors expect it to rise in the coming months as global commodity prices also rise.
National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) data released earlier in the day showed that the producer price index grew 8.8% year-on-year. This was higher than the 8.7% growth predicted in forecasts prepared by Investing.com but lower than the 9.1% growth recorded during the previous month.
The consumer price index (CPI) grew 0.6% month-on-month, higher than the 0.3% growth predicted in forecasts prepared by Investing.com and the 0.4% growth recorded during the previous month. The CPI grew 0.9% year-on-year.
Consumer prices rose slightly from January due to the Lunar New Year and fluctuations in international energy prices but were generally stable compared with the same period in 2021, NBS senior statistician Dong Lijuan said in a statement. Producer prices rose from January due to the rising cost of international commodities such as crude oil and non-ferrous metals, the statement added.
The Lunar New Year holiday in February meant that many Chinese factories were closed and meant lower demand for raw materials. However, the conflict in Ukraine is raising concerns about supply disruptions, pushing energy and global commodities prices to decade-highs.
""The surge in global commodity prices following Russia's invasion of Ukraine will have a much more pronounced impact on the March figures,"" Capital Economics Senior China Economist Julian Evans-Pritchard told Reuters.
China's attempts to stabilize commodity prices are facing new challenges. These include high coal, natural gas, and iron ore prices thanks to COVID-19, a monetary policy shift in big economies, and geopolitical conflicts, an official at the state economic planner said on Monday.
The scope for monetary easing may be limited due to the threat of higher commodity prices, according to some investors.
""Sanctions on Russia could axe China-Russian trade activities and may lead to higher imported prices,"" China Renaissance Securities Head of Macro and Strategy Research Bruce Pang told Reuters.

The producer price index rose 8.8% from a year earlier, official data showed Wednesday, down from 9.1% in January and beating the median estimate of an 8.6% increase in a Bloomberg survey of economists. Consumer-price growth was unchanged at 0.9%, the same as economists projected. 
China only recently managed to tame surging factory prices as global supply constraints eased and the government took steps to curb commodity costs. The recent spike in global energy prices is putting renewed pressure on Chinese manufacturers, threatening to push up costs again, squeeze profits and slow economic growth further.  
Consumer prices rose slightly from January due to the Lunar New Year and fluctuations in international energy prices but was generally stable compared with the same period last year, Dong Lijuan, senior statistician at the National Bureau of Statistics, said in a statement. Producer prices rose from January due to the rising cost of international commodities such as crude oil and non-ferrous metals, she wrote.
Consumer inflation remained muted, mainly due to a further drop in pork prices. Core inflation, which excludes volatile energy and food prices, slowed to 1.1% after remaining unchanged at 1.2% for three straight months. 
China is targeting full-year inflation of around 3%, a goal the state economic planner said authorities are capable and confident of achieving. The government set an ambitious economic growth target of around 5.5% for the year and signaled stronger fiscal stimulus is under way, which could drive the prices of raw materials higher.

238,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 08, 2022 08:51PM ET</span>",Japan downgrades Q4 GDP on service sector weakness,"By Kantaro Komiya and Daniel Leussink
TOKYO (Reuters) -Japan's economic rebound was softer than initial estimates in the final quarter of 2021, revised data showed on Wednesday, as the pickup seen in consumer and business spending was weaker than first reported.
The downwardly revised growth is bad news for policymakers tasked with keeping the country's fragile recovery on track as a jump in commodity prices due to the Ukraine crisis and persistent supply disruptions heighten economic uncertainty.
Revised gross domestic product (GDP) data released by the Cabinet Office on Wednesday showed Japan expanded an annualised 4.6% in October-December. That was lower than economists' median forecast for a 5.6% gain and the preliminary reading of 5.4% released last month.
""This suggests that Japan's economic recovery from the pandemic is weaker than that of Europe and the United States,"" said Takeshi Minami, chief economist at Norinchukin Research Institute.
On a quarter-on-quarter basis, GDP expanded 1.1%, falling short of the median market expectations for a 1.4% gain.
The change was mostly due to the downgrade in private consumption, a government official told a media briefing. 
Private consumption, which makes up more than a half of Japan's GDP, increased 2.4% in October-December from the previous quarter, revised down from an initially-estimated 2.7% gain. Spending in the service sector, in particular, was downgraded to a 3.1% expansion from an initial 3.5% increase.
Recent industry ministry data for December showed spending on services such as restaurants and train rides was weaker than the preliminary estimate based on private-sector figures, the official said.
""Private consumption was likely quite weak in January, due to soft spending on capital goods such as cars and services,"" said Minami, adding fresh uncertainty around Ukraine is cooling business investment.
In the fourth quarter, capital expenditure grew 0.3%, lower than economists' forecasts for a 0.7% gain and a preliminary figure of a 0.4% advance.
While data earlier this month showed robust fourth-quarter business spending, the revised GDP figures reflected weakness in items such as software investment, the official said.
Domestic demand as a whole contributed 0.9 of a percentage point to revised GDP figures, while net exports added 0.2 of a percentage point.
Economists in a Reuters poll last week forecast annualised growth of 0.4% in the January-March quarter, slashing previous projections given Omicron coronavirus variant infections and uncertainties caused by the war in Ukraine.

Yusuke Shimoda, senior economist at Japan Research Institute, said he was still expecting growth to come in positive in the first quarter.
""But we're still in early March,"" he added. ""Further downside risks can't be ruled out depending on Russia's actions.""

The consumer confidence index dropped 4.2% to 96.6 points in March,  Westpac Banking  (NYSE:WBK) Corp. said in a statement Wednesday. That’s the weakest result since September 2020, which was also the last time the index fell below the 100, the level indicating that pessimists outnumber optimists. 
“The war in Ukraine; the floods in southeast Queensland and northern NSW; ongoing concerns about inflation and higher interest rates were all likely to impact confidence, although the size of the decline is still notable,” Westpac Chief Economist Bill Evans said.
A special question on recollections from recent news coverage showed inflation “has really exploded,” Evans said. A year ago, just 8.6% of respondents recalled news on inflation. That soared to 38.7% in March, a 14-year high, he said.
Reserve Bank Governor Philip Lowe earlier Wednesday acknowledged that elevated inflation was likely to be prolonged by the war in Ukraine and added that it was “plausible” that rates will rise later this year. He said the flooding in northeast Australia was likely to cause a spike in fruit and vegetable prices, though policy makers would look through the temporary increase. 
Westpac is sticking to its view that the RBA’s first rate hike will come on Aug. 2, following two more quarterly inflation reports in April and July.

240,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 08, 2022 01:27PM ET</span>","Record U.S. trade deficit, slowing wholesale inventory gains seen curbing economic growth","By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. trade deficit widened to a record high in January as businesses imported more goods to rebuild inventories, potentially setting up trade to remain a drag on economic growth in the first quarter.
Though inventory accumulation continues, the pace is cooling, with other data from the Commerce Department on Tuesday showing the increase in wholesale inventories in January was the smallest in six months amid a decline in motor vehicle stocks.
The reports support views of significantly slower gross domestic product growth this quarter after a robust performance in the final three months of 2021.
""This jump in the trade deficit points to a large drag on GDP growth in accounting terms and real GDP growth in the first quarter looks on track to be close to zero as strong demand gains are met by import growth rather than production increases,"" said Conrad DeQuadros, senior economist at Brean Capital in New York.
The trade deficit surged 9.4% to an all-time high of $89.7 billion in January. Data for December was revised to show a $82.0 billion shortfall instead of the previously reported $80.7 billion. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast an $87.1 billion deficit. 
Imports increased 1.2% to $314.1 billion, also the highest on record. Goods imports surged 1.8% to an all-time high of $264.8 billion. There were record-high imports of food, capital and consumer goods. Crude oil imports increased by $935 million.
Non-petroleum imports were also the highest on record. Imports are rising as businesses continue to replenish inventories to meet strong domestic demand. 
Some of the rise in imports reflected higher prices as well as ships offloading goods after being held up at ports because of worker shortages. Imports of services fell $1.0 billion to $49.3 billion in January, pulled down by transport and travel.
Economists saw a limited impact on trade from Russia's war on Ukraine, which has resulted in the United States imposing trade sanctions on Moscow. 
Russia accounted for only 1% of imports and about 0.4% of exports last year, according to government data. 
President Joe Biden on Tuesday announced a ban on Russian oil and other energy imports, which will push up prices and further fuel inflation. According to government data, the nation imported 52 million barrels of oil from Russia in 2019, accounting for 2.2% of the total imported that year. Data for 2020 and 2022 was impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic.
""The share from Russia may seem like a drop in the bucket, but Russia is still the fourth-largest foreign source of crude oil for the U.S.,"" said Shannon Seery, an economist at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) in New York. ""With the relatively easy ability to ramp up production domestically the direct U.S. exposure should be fairly minimal. That said, the protest against Russian oil is sure to weigh on global supply and drive up energy costs even more than we've already seen."" 
In January, exports fell 1.7% to $224.4 billion. Goods exports decreased 1.5% to $155.9 billion. There was a decline in exports of consumer goods, including pharmaceutical preparations. But capital goods exports increased and exports of industrial supplies and materials were the highest on record.
BIG GROWTH DRAG
Exports of services dropped $1.6 billion to $68.5 billion, reflecting decreases in travel and transportation. The Russia-Ukraine war could curb travel. 
Adjusted for inflation, the goods trade deficit shot up to a record $118.1 billion from $111.7 billion in December. Trade has subtracted from GDP growth for six straight quarters. 
""Exports could bounce back somewhat over the remainder of the quarter, but even so, we think that the trade drag could be around 2 percentage points for the first quarter,"" said Daniel Silver, an economist at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) in New York. 
Most of the imports in January went towards replenishing inventories. In second report, the Commerce Department said wholesale inventories rose by an unrevised 0.8% in January after increasing 2.6% in December. Wholesale inventories advanced 18.1% in January on a year-on-year basis.
Inventories are a key part of gross domestic product.
Wholesale motor vehicle inventories fell 2.2% after vaulting 5.5% in December. Wholesale inventories, excluding autos, increased 1.1% in January. This component goes into the calculation of GDP.
Inventory investment accelerated at a robust seasonally adjusted annualized rate of $171.2 billion in the fourth quarter, contributing 4.90 percentage points to the quarter's 7.0% growth pace. Economists see further scope for inventories to rise as inflation-adjusted inventories remain below their pre-pandemic level. Sales-to-inventory ratios are also low.

But inventories are likely to be neutral to GDP growth this quarter as they would need to increase at a similarly fast rate as the fourth quarter to contribute to growth. In the wake of Tuesday's reports, economists at Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) lowered their first-quarter GDP growth estimate to a 1.0% rate from a 1.5% pace.
Sales at wholesalers shot up 4.0% in January after rising 0.8% in December. At January's sales pace it would take wholesalers 1.20 months to clear shelves, down from 1.24 months in December. Inventories were drawn down for three straight quarters before rebounding in the October-December period.

The Commerce Department said on Tuesday that wholesale inventories rose by an unrevised 0.8% in January. Stocks at wholesalers increased 2.6% in December. Economists polled by Reuters had expected inventories would be unrevised. Wholesale inventories advanced 18.1% in January on a year-on-year basis.

(Reuters) -Canada's exports edged down in January even as energy exports rose, while imports fell sharply off record highs as supply chain hiccups continued to disrupt trade patterns, official data showed on Tuesday.
Imports fell faster than exports, swinging Canada to a C$2.62 billion ($2.04 billion) surplus in January, beating analyst forecasts of C$1.60 billion, Statistics Canada said. But that win was overshadowed by disappointing exports. 
""It's not a great start to the year. I think that jumps out right away. It is a bit disappointing,"" said Stuart Bergman, interim chief economist at Export Development Canada.
Exports slipped 0.2%, with declines in 7 of 11 product sectors, led by motor vehicles and parts, and declining aircraft exports. Those declines were almost entirely offset by higher exports of energy products.
Energy exports rose 8.7% in January, led by natural gas exports, up 66.4%. Crude oil and natural gas prices rose sharply from December and have continued to surge. That should bolster Canada's trade snapshot in the coming months. 
""Looking ahead, we expect red-hot energy prices will continue to buoy exports, with minimal direct impact expected from the sanctions against Russia,"" BMO Capital Markets analyst Shelly Kaushik said in a note.
Canada is the world's fourth largest oil producer and sixth largest natural gas producer.
Two-way automotive was another story, with imports of motor vehicles and parts down 13.9% and exports down 9.6%. 
""Supply chain issues continued to affect the Canadian auto industry in January, forcing most auto manufacturers to reduce production,"" Statscan said.
Overall, imports fell 7.4%, after hitting all-time highs for three consecutive months, with declines in 10 of 11 product sections. 

December's trade deficit was revised wider to C$1.58 billion from C$137 million.
The Canadian dollar was trading 0.1% lower at 1.2835 to the greenback, or 77.91 U.S. cents.

243,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 08, 2022 09:17AM ET</span>",U.S. small business sentiment drops to lowest in over a year - survey,"(Reuters) - U.S. small business confidence fell to the lowest in over a year in February in the face of a wave of inflation that is forcing a record percentage of establishments to raise prices and denting their outlook for the economy, a survey showed on Tuesday.
The National Federation of Independent Business said its Small Business Optimism Index dropped 1.4 points to 95.7 last month from 97.1 in January. It was the lowest reading since January 2021. 
More than a quarter of businesses cited inflation as their largest problem, the highest since 1981, while a record 68% said they were pushing through price increases of their own. But higher prices weren't feeding through to bottom-line profit improvements in many cases, with a larger share of businesses reporting weaker earnings and more than 60% complaining of lost sales opportunities.
“Inflation continues to be a problem on Main Street, leading more owners to raise selling prices again in February,” said NFIB Chief Economist Bill Dunkelberg. “Supply chain disruptions and labor shortages also remain problems, leading to lower earnings and sales for many.”
Supply chain ructions have been a consistent issue as the economy has rebounded from the short but historically deep recession two years ago caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. With demand - for goods in particular - far outstripping supply, inflation has surged to a four-decade high.
The inflation outlook has only worsened in March, with Russia's invasion of Ukraine pushing up prices for everything from fuel to food, dashing the hopes of policymakers like those at the Federal Reserve for a leveling off in price pressures. Tuesday's survey release made no mention of the war, which started in late February.

The Fed is expected to start raising interest rates next week by at least 25 basis points to tame high inflation, but the war in eastern Europe has raised uncertainty about just how far and fast the central bank will be able to go in removing the extraordinary accommodation it put in place two years ago at the start of the coronavirus pandemic.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - One-year U.S. inflation expectations have rocketed higher since Russia's invasion of Ukraine and the longer-term outlook has begun increasing as well, a development likely to be watched closely by the Federal Reserve as it battles to keep price pressures under control.
A new daily index released on Tuesday by the London-based ICE Benchmark Administration (IBA) showed the expected pace of consumer price increases over the next year rising from 3.5% on Feb. 1 to 5.24% as of March 7. The index is based on trading in the roughly $300 billion monthly market for inflation-protected U.S. Treasury securities and in the $100 billion monthly market for inflation swaps contracts.
Inflation anticipated over longer 10- and six-year horizons has also turned abruptly higher since the onset of the Ukraine war, with rates as of Monday around 2.43% and 2.73%, respectively, significantly above the Fed's 2% annual price increase target, the index shows. 
Graphic: ICE inflation expectations index: https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-FED/INFLATION/akvezxjwrpr/chart.png 
Longer-term inflation expectations are monitored closely by the Fed as evidence of whether its policies are keeping inflation psychology at bay. If longer-term expectations continue to rise, it would indicate a loss of confidence in the Fed's ability to control inflation - and make inflation itself harder to beat without painfully high and fast interest rate increases.
""If that number keeps going up those that are setting monetary policy will start to notice higher trend inflation expectations getting priced into the system, and that might impact decision-making,"" said IBA President Timothy Bowler, a former U.S. Treasury official.
Inflation over the next year will be ""heavily influenced by commodity prices,"" and notably oil, he said. The question facing the Fed now is whether that ""all of a sudden spills over"" into the average rates of inflation expected years ahead. 
Measuring expectations and assessing the influence of psychology on the prices set by companies and the wages accepted by workers is an often studied and highly disputed topic. Market measures, deriving inflation rates from different security sales prices, are one tool. Other measures rely on consumer or other surveys.
But however it is measured, policymakers generally feel that, as much as controlling short-term inflation outcomes, they are in the business of keeping long-run expectations stable and close to the Fed's 2% target. A key to the U.S. central bank's success in controlling inflation since the 1980s, in fact, is thought to be public trust in its ability and willingness to do so.
RATE HIKES
February was a tough month for the U.S. central bank on that front.
Headline inflation currently is far above target, and the Fed is planning to raise interest rates at its policy meeting next week and likely throughout this year, hoping to lower the headline number before expectations shift. 
The timing and pace of those increases in borrowing costs, however, have become increasingly uncertain following the invasion of Ukraine, which has produced a conflict driven oil-price shock on a par with that seen in the 1970s. That decade saw U.S. inflation become unmoored and forced the Fed to ramp up interest rates so high that it triggered a recession.
Central bankers have a noted willingness to ""look through"" what are perceived to be temporary increases in energy and commodity prices, even large ones. 
But Fed Chair Jerome Powell told lawmakers in Congress last week that the shock from Russia's military actions could be a ""game changer"" for world markets. If it leads to a steady move higher in inflation expectations, it could trigger more aggressive tightening of monetary policy.
IBA is a unit of Intercontinental Exchange (NYSE:ICE), a firm that develops and sells a variety of market analysis tools.
The inflation expectations index is being made public without charge, Bowler said, to provide a daily view of an issue that could shape central bank policy debates in coming months.
Other organizations publish inflation expectations data, such as the 10-year-ahead expectations provided daily by the St. Louis Fed. The U.S. central bank's staff in Washington combines a broader set of both household survey and market data into a single inflation expectations index, but it is only updated every three months.

Events are moving faster than that. 
Since the onset of the Ukraine war, oil prices have risen more than 25% and are likely to keep consumer inflation higher this year than otherwise might have been the case. The Consumer Price Index is already exceeding a 7% increase on an annual basis, and data due to be released on Thursday is expected to show prices up by 7.9% in February from a year earlier.

Optimism toward domestic market growth dropped 11 percentage points from the previous year, according to the Chamber's report, based on responses from more than 300 member companies. 
Businesses reported rising tensions between the U.S. and China as the top business challenge, followed by inconsistent or unclear laws.
Alan Beebe, president of the American Chamber of Commerce in China, said in a media session there was a brief ""bump"" optimism among companies in China, following Biden's election in 2020.
""But what we’ve seen in the course of last year is that there is a new reality that has set in, where the policies and sentiment of the Trump administration remain in place with the Biden administration,"" Beebe added.
Companies also reported difficulties in hiring both foreign and local talent. 
Strict COVID-19 protocols in China make it difficult for overseas hires to begin working in China. 
Politics have also impeded domestic hiring. 
""Many Chinese talents would rather not work for an American firm. The ‘Brand America’ has started losing value because of the tensions in the [bilateral] relationship,"" one unnamed survey respondent wrote.""
Slowing economic growth has also proven a challenge both for Beijing and U.S. companies in China.

According to the survey released on Tuesday, 59% of respondents anticipate 2021 profits will be up from 2020. But that figure remains lower than pre-COVID levels. 
Despite the dour forecast and challenges, the survey revealed that most companies planned to stay, with two-thirds of them planning to increase investment in China in 2022.

Business confidence jumped to 13 points from a revised 4 in January, recording gains across all industries, a National Australia Bank (OTC:NABZY) Ltd. survey showed Tuesday. Business conditions -- measuring hiring, sales and profits --  climbed to 9 points from a revised 2 to be back above its long-run average. 
The poll was largely concluded before Russia invaded Ukraine, NAB said.
Australia’s economy was hit by the omicron outbreak through December-January as the country shifted to trying to live with the virus, prompting widespread sickness among employees. Still, the labor market held up relatively well through the period, with the jobless rate remaining at 4.2%.
“The employment index has improved considerably as the labor market strengthens, after the virus caused many to be unable to work due to illness or isolation requirements at the peak of the recent wave,” NAB Chief Economist Alan Oster said.
The survey underscores that the A$2.2 trillion ($1.6 trillion) economy is on a swift path to recovery, prompting financial markets to bet interest rate hikes will begin as soon as June. Data on Monday showed job vacancies are at a new pandemic-era high, signaling the labor market is poised to tighten further.
The survey showed business conditions improved across the board, with large gains in retail and transport and utilities. Forward orders, a gauge of future demand, advanced by 4 points to 9 while capex climbed by 5 points to 8. 
The survey also pointed to an inflationary impulse in the economy, with retail price growth rising above 2% in February, suggesting businesses are passing on higher costs to consumers.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan recorded its largest current account deficit since the start of 2014 in January as a jump in oil import costs offset gains in investment income, with continuing uncertainty due to the Ukraine crisis and COVID-19 pandemic.
The current account data highlighted the dependence of Japan's resource-deficient economy on imports of commodities and raw materials, which caused trade deficit to widen.
Japan, the world's third-largest economy, posted a current account deficit of 1.1887 trillion yen ($10.31 billion) in January, the data showed, versus economists' median estimate of a 880 billion yen deficit in a Reuters poll.
It was the second straight month of deficit and marked the second largest deficit under comparable data going back to 1985.
Surging fuel costs drove up the value of imports by 39.9% in January from a year earlier, outpacing a 15.2% rise in exports.
In addition, Japan's trade deficit with China widened in January. China-bound exports slowed before the Lunar New Year break while imports from the country surged due to stocking demand before the holiday period.
""Given such a temporary factor and a hefty investment income surplus, I don't think Japan's balance of payment will swing to deficit as a trend anytime soon,"" said Takashi Miwa, chief economist at Nomura Securities.
Japan earns steady and hefty return from its past investment in securities and direct investment overseas, which have replaced trade as the main driver of its current account surplus in recent years.
While a weak yen also helped inflate the cost of imports, its boost to export volumes was not as great as it once was due to an ongoing shift of exporters' production abroad, analysts say.
Underscoring changes in Japan's economic structure, a steady rise in returns from Japanese direct and portfolio investment overseas helped offset the trade deficit, bringing Japan's primary income surplus to 1.289 trillion yen in January.

The data also showed sharp declines in foreign tourist arrivals, reducing the travel account to a surplus of just 12.3 billion yen. The overall services deficit came to 737.9 billion yen, the data showed.

TOKYO (Reuters) -Japan's bank lending rose at the slowest increase in a decade in February as immediate pressure for corporates to borrow cash continued to ease amid a broader economic recovery from the pandemic slump.
While the central bank's massive money printing will likely keep funding conditions ultra-loose, the crisis in Ukraine could hurt restaurants and retailers still reeling from the COVID-19 curbs, some analysts say.
Lending increased 0.4% in February year-on-year, the slowest pace since May 2012 and following a revised 0.5% gain in January, Bank of Japan (BOJ) data showed on Tuesday, as borrowers continued to pay back loans extended during the pandemic.
""We must keep an eye out on how developments in Ukraine could affect corporate funding through rising crude oil prices,"" a BOJ official told a briefing.
Outstanding loans held by the country's four main categories of banks, including ""shinkin"" or credit unions, stood at 580.048 trillion yen ($5.03 trillion), the BOJ data showed.
""Companies have abundant liquidity, so additional demand for funds remains subdued,"" the BOJ official said.
Lending by major banks fell 1.3% in February from a year earlier after dropping 1.0% in January, marking the biggest decline since August 2021, the data showed.
Regional banks' lending rose 1.7%, marking the smallest increase in more than a decade, the data showed.
At a policy meeting in December last year, the BOJ extended by six months a March 2022 deadline for its pandemic-relief programme to ensure commercial banks' keep channeling funds to small firms.

But it decided to phase out most other parts of the emergency funding scheme from April in a nod to sharp improvements in big firms' financial conditions.

Outbound shipments rose 16.3% in the first two months of the year from the same period a year earlier, official data showed on Monday, beating analyst expectations for a 15.0% rise, but down from 20.9% gain in December.
Imports increased 15.5%, easing from a 19.5% gain in December and below the forecast 16.5% increase.
The customs agency publishes combined January and February trade data to smooth distortions caused by the Lunar New Year, which can fall in either month.
Factory activity normally slows considerably during the long holiday as workers return to their home towns. But for the third year in a row, many factory workers did not return home because of concerns about COVID-19, which kept some factories operating.
""These numbers will probably be well received. China's exports are high and also the imports are continuing,"" said Louis Kuijs, Asia Pacific chief economist at S&P Global (NYSE:SPGI) Ratings, adding that exports remain one component of the economy still supporting growth.
""We need to see how long the economic impact (from the Ukraine crisis) will last. China's economy overall is big and should be to able to continue to grow even in the face of external shocks but export growth will be affected.""
China's booming exports outperformed expectations for much of last year and buoyed growth in the world's second-largest economy, but analysts expect shipments to slow eventually as overseas demand for goods eases and high costs pressure exporters.
Russia's invasion of Ukraine late last month, which it calls a ""special operation"", and mounting international sanctions against Moscow have raised fresh risks for the global economy, adding to months-long strains for China's factories from worldwide supply chain snags.
Tian Yun, former vice director of the Beijing Economic Operation Association, expects China-Europe trade may be disrupted due to the conflict in Ukraine.
""If the Ukraine crisis halts China-EU freight train services or leads to a slower operation efficiency, there will be adverse impact to EU and China's trade. This might be the biggest risk,"" Tian said.
Chinese exporters with exposure to Ukrainian markets have delayed shipments, while some factories with business in Russia have been waiting for payment from their clients before arranging the next shipments, factory officials and analysts told Reuters.
China's exports to Russia surged 41.5% in the first two months of the year, topping growth with other countries, customs data showed on Monday, while imports from Russia rose 35.8%. 
IMPORTS
Lian Weiliang, a vice head at the National Development and Reform Commission, expects the overall cost issues for importers to remain manageable despite rising energy prices driven by the Ukraine crisis.
""The source of China's crude oil and natural gas imports is diverse, with long-term contracts accounting for a large proportion of all deals,"" Lian said at a news conference. ""As long as all parties comply with the contracts, imports can remain stable.""
Analysts say higher prices for energy and agricultural products would provide a boost to the country's imports value for the months to come.
""As domestic infrastructure investment kicks in, the demand for energy commodities will continue to expand,"" said Chang Ran, senior researcher at Zhixin Investment Research Institute.

""The Russia-Ukraine conflict may cause prices of crude oil, natural gas, wheat and others to soar for a period of time. The price factor could bolster imports.""
Beijing has targeted slower economic growth of around 5.5% this year amid an uncertain global recovery and a downturn in the country's vast property sector. While that would mark a sharp slowdown in annual growth, it is nonetheless an ambitious target that would require more policy support, analysts say.

251,By Investing.com,"<span>Mar 06, 2022 11:50PM ET</span>","Chinese Export Growth Slows, Ukraine Crisis Emerges as Fresh Risk to Trade","By Gina Lee
Investing.com – China’s export growth slowed down in January and February 2022 as the country celebrated the Lunar New Year holiday. Although higher than expected, the Russian invasion of Ukraine in late February heightened the uncertainty over the outlook for global trade in 2022.
Data released earlier in the day showed that exports grew 16.3% year-on-year. This was higher than the 15% growth predicted in forecasts prepared by Investing.com but lower than the 20.9% growth recorded during the previous month.
Imports grew 15.5% year-on-year, down from both the 16.5% growth in forecasts prepared by Investing.com and the 19.5% growth recorded during the previous month. The data also showed a trade balance of $115.95 billion, higher than the $99.5 billion in forecasts prepared by Investing.com, as well as the $94.46 billion figure recorded during the previous month.
The data for January and February was combined to smooth distortions caused by the Lunar New Year holiday, which can fall in either month. Factory activity normally slows down over the week-long holiday as workers journey to their hometowns. However, factories kept operating for a third consecutive year as COVID-19 concerns discouraged travel.
China’s export sector exceeded expectations for much of 2021, contributing to economic growth in that year. However, some investors warn of an eventual slowdown as overseas demand for goods eases and exporters feel the pressure from rising costs. The government on Saturday said it is targeting economic growth of “around” 5.5% in 2022 amid an uncertain global recovery and a downturn in the country's vast property sector.
The Russian invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24 and the increasing number of Western sanctions are emerging as a headwind for the global economy. The fresh risk adds to the strain for Chinese factories, which have already felt the pressure from months-long supply chain bottlenecks.
The conflict also saw Chinese exporters with exposure to Ukrainian markets delay shipments. Other factories with business in Russia have been waiting for payment from their clients before arranging the next shipments, factory officials and analysts told Reuters."

Exports rose 16.3% in dollar terms in the January-February period from a year earlier, data from the General Administration of Customs showed Monday, beating the 14% median estimate in a Bloomberg survey of economists. Exports had increased 20.9% in December. 
Imports increased 15.5% on year during the period, below a 17% gain predicted by economists. The trade surplus came in at $116 billion. 
China’s economic activity is typically volatile in the first two months of the year due to the week-long Lunar New Year holiday. Covid outbreaks in some parts of the country also caused temporary business suspensions, although the commerce ministry has said the impact was manageable overall.  
“China’s foreign trade saw a stable start, although the current external environment for foreign trade development is more complex and uncertain,” said Li Kuiwen, spokesperson of the General Administration of Customs, according to state media CCTV.
Steel exports declined 19% to 8.23 million metric tons in the first two months of the year from the same period last year, the data showed. Crude oil imports dropped 4.9%, natural gas purchases fell 3.8% and soybean imports increased 4.1%.
Russia-Ukraine tensions and a spike in oil prices have turned the focus to energy supplies. At a separate briefing by the National Development and Reform Commission on Monday, Vice Chairman Lian Weiliang said China’s sources of crude oil, natural gas are diversified and long term contracts take a “very high” share. 
Trade Boom
Record trade last year helped to underpin China’s rapid economic growth, although momentum weakened in the latter part of the year amid a downturn in the property market. The government set a growth target of about 5.5% for this year, the lowest in more than three decades, yet above economists’ forecasts, suggesting more policy stimulus is needed, such as interest rate cuts and further loosening of property market grips.

Commerce Minister Wang Wentao warned last week of “massive pressure” in maintaining high export growth. Factors that drove overseas shipments to boom last year, such as demand for goods to control the spread of Covid, will dissipate, while firms remain squeezed by supply-chain bottlenecks, rising commodity prices and labor shortages, he said.
Both government data and a private survey of Chinese manufacturing companies showed new export orders continued to contract last month. Meanwhile, manufacturing activity in Southeast Asian nations broadly improved as virus waves ebbed in the region, a sign that production orders could be diverted away from China once again.

ROME (Reuters) - World food prices hit a record high in February, led by a surge in vegetable oils and dairy products, to post a 20.7% increase year-on-year, the U.N. food agency said on Friday.
The Food and Agriculture Organization's (FAO) food price index https://www.fao.org/worldfoodsituation/foodpricesindex/en, which tracks the most globally traded food commodities, averaged 140.7 points last month against a downwardly revised 135.4 in January. That figure was previously given as 135.7.
Higher food prices have contributed to a broader surge in inflation as economies recover from the coronavirus crisis and the FAO has warned https://reut.rs/3JXHPq7 that the higher costs are putting poorer populations at risk in countries reliant on imports.
FAO economist Upali Galketi Aratchilage said concerns over crop conditions and export availabilities provided only a partial explanation to the increase in global food prices.
""A much bigger push for food price inflation comes from outside food production, particularly the energy, fertilizer and feed sectors,"" he said. ""All these factors tend to squeeze profit margins of food producers, discouraging them from investing and expanding production."" 
Data for the February report was mostly compiled before the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Concerns over tensions in the Black Sea area were already weighing on agricultural markets even before the violence flared, but analysts warn a prolonged conflict could have a major impact on grain exports.
FAO said its vegetable oils index rose 8.5% month-on-month in February to chalk up another record high, propelled by rising palm, soy, and sunflower oil prices. Ukraine and Russia account for about 80% of global exports of sunflower oil.
The cereal price index rose 3.0% on the month, with maize prices up 5.1% and wheat prices increasing 2.1%, largely reflecting uncertainty about global supply flows from Black Sea ports. [GRA/]
FAO's dairy price index increased 6.4%, its sixth consecutive monthly rise, underpinned by tight global supplies, while meat prices rose 1.1% in February. 
By contrast, sugar was the sole index to post a decrease, shedding 1.9% from the previous month due partly to favourable production prospects in major exporters India and Thailand. 
FAO also issued its first projections for cereal output in 2022, seeing global wheat production rising to 790 million tonnes from 775.4 million in 2021, thanks in part to hopes of high yields and extensive planting in Canada, the United States and Asia. 
The U.N. agency cautioned however that its projections did not take into account the possible impact of the conflict between Russia and Ukraine.

FAO said maize outputs in Argentina and Brazil in 2022 were forecast at well above-average levels, notably in Brazil where the maize crop was seen reaching a record high 112 million tonnes. 
World cereal utilization in 2021/22 was forecast to rise 1.5% above the 2020/21 level, hitting 2.802 billion tonnes. FAO's forecast for world cereal stocks by the close of seasons in 2022 stood at 836 million tonnes.

COMMENTS:
LIZ YOUNG, HEAD OF INVESTMENT STRATEGY, SOFI
“The reaction here is that this was a strong labor report. (Fed chair) Jerome Powell this week basically said that we're at maximum employment and this further reinforces that, if not, makes it even more maximum employment.”
“It basically tells the Fed you have no excuse, aside from possible contagion risk out of Russia and Ukraine. You have no excuse not to go hard at this inflation problem.” 
JJ KINAHAN, CHIEF MARKET STRATEGIST, TD AMERITRADE, CHICAGO
“If Chairman Powell were going in front of Congress again today, I don’t think he would change anything he said over the last couple of days. 
“The last couple of (unemployment) reports we've been a little bit disappointed at times with some of the numbers. This one is kind of evening out that a little bit in terms it is truly a blowout number.
“If Ukraine wasn’t out there this report would be telling us the economy is pretty red-hot. Without Ukraine there would probably be more pressure to have a 50 basis point rate hike than there will be with Ukraine.”
BRIAN JACOBSEN, SENIOR INVESTMENT STRATEGIST FOR MULTI-ASSET SOLUTIONS, ALLSPRING GLOBAL INVESTMENTS (email)
    ""There’s a lot to like about the employment situation report except that wages are still falling short of consumer price increases. With higher food and fuel prices, consumer budgets will still be under pressure. Thankfully the consumer looked to be in a pretty good position going into this conflict.""
MICHAEL PEARCE, SENIOR US ECONOMIST, CAPITAL ECONOMICS
“The stronger-than-expected 678,000 gain in non-farm payrolls in February and upward revisions to previous months gains is another sign that the real economy has considerable momentum, with the Omicron wave having surprisingly little impact. That will give the Fed greater confidence to push ahead with its planned policy tightening but, with wage growth now leveling off, there is arguably less pressure for officials to front-load an aggressive series of rate hikes over the coming months.”
“The one big surprise in this report was average hourly earnings, which were unchanged in February, with the annual rate dropping to 5.1% from 5.7%. With the composition of payroll gains broad-based, most of that deceleration appears to reflect a genuine easing of pay pressures. While that might seem at odds with the falling unemployment rate, the job openings and quits rates and broader survey evidence have suggested labor shortages are leveling off a bit, which is consistent with pay growth stabilizing.”
SAM STOVALL, CHIEF INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, CFRA RESEARCH, NEW YORK
""Already there are concerns with the Ukraine crisis and this would’ve put additional pressure under the Fed to be more aggressive because of the number of jobs being added and unemployment rate coming down that could put more upward pressure on wage growth. But, because the average hourly earnings actually came in lower than expected it has caused investors to breathe a sigh of relief.""
""We have yet to see a capitulation in share prices and we will need to see that before we can say that the worst is behind us.""
""We've seen bond yields initially decline and are at 1.78% right now for the 10-year and that actually has been supportive of more of the growth oriented sectors because of the flight to safety by investors. However, because investors are gravitating towards bonds at the same time that we are seeing a surge in oil prices, rise in inflation and the expected start to a rate tightening cycle this also threatens a flattening yield curve which is usually not a good sign for the markets.”
PETER CARDILLO, CHIEF MARKET ECONOMIST, SPARTAN CAPITAL SECURITIES, NEW YORK
“The good news is hourly wages were actually flat and up 5.1% on a yearly basis, which still high, but today’s numbers seem to be diminishing that fear of wage inflation. That’s something that the Fed is obviously look at very carefully.”
“It’s a strong report, no question about it, no further increases in hourly wages suggests wage growth that we’ve seen might be coming to a halt.”
“Unemployment was down to 3.8% and the participation rate is up a bit.”
“That question mark – where are all these people and why are they not going back to work? Now that the participation rate is going up it means people are returning to the labor force.”
“It does not change the picture for March. Even due to the current circumstances, the Fed cannot risk not raising rates. They are going to pursue a dovish hike rate this month, nothing that could come back to haunt them due to the geopolitical situation.” 
“The key now is the price of oil. If the price of oil should continue to rise, then the Fed is going to have to get more aggressive. Commodity inflation could reach a point where it could be damaging to economic growth.”

""The number is fantastic. Even manufacturing was nearly twice as good as expected, and the average weekly hours ticked up. all in all, seeing the unemployment rate drop down as well, is all positive and gives chair Powell the green light to go ahead with his 25 bps cut at the next meeting, in spite of the geopolitical headwinds. It shows that COVID is largely in the rear view mirror, the recovery is robust and as we work through geopolitical headwinds, this economy can roar.""
""The most important thing in this report is that the average hourly earnings came in much lower than expected. We're seeing the base effects start to kick in and people who are scared about inflation are going to start to see some relief in the coming months as more supply of labor comes into the market. We saw the labor force participation rate pick up, that's going to leave some of the wage price pressure and inflation numbers overall should start to improve in coming months...maybe we'll see some relief in prices and wages by summertime.""
""But the key issue the average hourly earnings, which is a relief for everyone worried about inflation. All in all recovery’s robust, COVID seems to be winding down and we're starting to get numbers that are showing inflation moderating.""

256,By Investing.com,"<span>Mar 04, 2022 08:40AM ET</span>",U.S. Job Market Recovery Quickened In April; NFP +678k vs 400k Expected,"By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing.com -- The U.S. economy created far more jobs in February than expected, picking up steam again after a brief soft patch due to the winter wave of Covid-19.
The Labor Department said 678,000 nonfarm jobs were created in the month through mid-February, nearly 70% more than the 400,000 consensus forecast. The unemployment rate fell to 3.8% from 4.0% as a result and now stands at its lowest since the start of the pandemic.
However, wage growth decelerated, partially easing the pressure on the Federal Reserve to tighten monetary policy. Average hourly earnings growth slowed to 5.1% on the year from a downwardly revised 5.5% in January. Expectations had been for an acceleration to 5.8%. Average hourly earnings tend to be highly influenced by developments in lower-paying service sector jobs. 
""After January's surprising report, today's report provides reassurance that the job market recovery remains strong,"" said Glassdoor economist Daniel Zhao via Twitter (NYSE:TWTR). Zhao noted that the gains were encouragingly broad-based, and that employment in professional and business services, as well as in transportation and warehousing ""are now solidly above pre-pandemic"" levels.
The numbers are likely to cement expectations that the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates later this month, validating two days of testimony in Congress by Fed Chair Jerome Powell who said that the U.S. labor market and the economy in general were strong enough to justify withdrawing the extraordinary stimulus that has been in place since the outbreak of Covid-19 two years ago.
Chicago Fed President Charles Evans told CNBC that job growth ""has been good for some time now"" and repeated that ""we need to move to a more neutral monetary policy.""

The European Union's statistics office Eurostat said retail sales in the 19 countries sharing the euro rose 0.2% month-on-month for a 7.8% year-on-year increase.
Economists polled by Reuters had expected a 1.3% monthly rise and a 9.1% annual gain.
Sales of food were flat in January compared to December, while automotive fuel sales fell 1.3%, reining in the overall monthly index.

Compared with January 2021, the value of sales of petrol were still 12.7% higher, but online sales were down 6.7% and sales of food, drinks and tobacco were 1.7% lower.
As a proxy for consumer demand, the sales data showed large differences across euro zone countries. Sales in Slovenia surged 32.3% year-on-year in January, while in Finland they fell 2.4%. In Belgium, sales were up a miniscule 0.3% year-on-year, while in its neighbour Germany, the euro zone's biggest economy, they jumped by 10.3%.

The IHS Markit/CIPS UK Construction Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) jumped to 59.1 from 56.3 in January, its highest since June last year.
A Reuters poll of economists had pointed to another reading of 56.3.
Residential work was the strongest in eight months and overall new order growth was the fastest since last August.
Shortages of materials and labour continued to hamper builders but the peak of price pressures appeared to have passed and input cost inflation was its softest since March 2021.
The Bank of England is watching for signs of sustained pressure on prices as it tries to counter a rise in inflation expectations with consumer price inflation running at its highest in 30 years in January at 5.5%.

Supplier delays were considerably lower than in mid-2021, but price and supply constraints pushed overall business confidence to its weakest in just over a year.
The all-sector PMI, which covers the construction, manufacturing and services sectors combined, rose to 59.8 from January's 54.4, driven by a jump in activity in the huge services sector.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's jobless rate rose to 2.8% as the surge in coronavirus infections and mobility curbs hit service sector activity, although a gauge of job availability grew to a 21-month-high in January, government data showed on Friday.
The mixed data came as firms in the world's third-largest economy conclude annual labour talks, while downside pressure from record coronavirus deaths and the Ukraine crisis overshadow the recovery outlook.
""The COVID-19 outbreak continued to halt economic activity in February, partly lingering in March, which is not good for the current employment situation,"" said Takumi Tsunoda, senior economist at Shinkin Central Bank Research Institute.
The seasonally adjusted unemployment rate compared with 2.7% in December, which was also the median forecast in a Reuters poll of economists.
The number of workers stood at 66.9 million in January on a seasonally-adjusted basis, posting the first decline in three months as resignations due to unfavourable business conditions grew by 70,000.
The retail, education and transport sectors were hit hard by the Omicron variant outbreak with reinstated curbs leading to more than 100,000 jobs lost in each of those industries in January, from the same month last year.
Workers on paid furlough increased by 590,000 to a five-month-high of 2.49 million in January from the previous month, especially in hospitality businesses such as restaurants and hotels.
The jobs-to-applicants ratio was 1.20 in January, labour ministry data showed, up 0.03 point from the previous month's 1.17 and higher than a Reuters poll forecast of 1.16.
The reading was the highest since 1.31 marked in April 2020.
A health ministry official said the growth in job openings outpaced that of job-seekers in January because more companies had submitted postings data before domestic COVID-19 infections sky-rocketed later in the month.

Looking ahead, service sector jobs will bounce back as domestic coronavirus infections ease, said Shinkin's Tsunoda.
""Meanwhile, rising uncertainty over the global economy on the Ukraine crisis is making manufacturers wary about investments and hiring.""

The monthly result topped the median forecast of a $3.55 billion surplus in a Reuters poll of economists, and was more than double the $1.8 billion surplus recorded in the same period a year ago.
According to the Economy Ministry, exports surged 32.6% from February 2021 to $22.9 billion, benefiting from a 22.6% expansion in volumes and a 13.5% increase in prices.
Imports rose 22.9% to $18.9 billion as a 30.9% rise in prices more than compensated for a decline of 2.5% in the volume of goods purchased by Brazil. 
In the first two months, the country's trade surplus reached $3.8 billion, jumping 125.4% from a year earlier. 

The Economy Ministry said it expected a record trade surplus of 79.4 billion this year due to a decline in imports, amid more moderate growth in global trade.
The projection, however, was made before Russia's invasion of Ukraine, a conflict that is casting a shadow of uncertainty over trade between countries due to supply bottlenecks after several sanctions were imposed by Western nations on Russia.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits dropped to their lowest level this year last week, while layoffs declined sharply in February, indicating that the labor market recovery was gaining steam.
But the upbeat labor market outlook was overshadowed by a survey on Thursday showing services industry activity slowed for a third straight month in February, with a measure of employment in the sector contracting for the first time since June 2021.
According to the Institute for Supply Management (ISM), services businesses reported they were ""having significant issues with hiring both full time and contract labor,"" and that ""open positions are not being filled, and candidates are looking for more money."" Employment growth at factories also slowed last month, which poses a downside risk to job gains in February.
There were a near record 10.9 million job openings at the end of December. Economists are expecting the government's closely watched employment report on Friday will show another month of solid job growth, with the Omicron COVID-19 variant wave of infections significantly diminished.
""Workers leaving for better-paying jobs and more flexible conditions are annoying for employers, but the churn is neutral for employment on net as long as the workers find a job that satisfies their needs,"" said Will Compernolle, a senior economist at FHN Financial in New York. ""The contraction is not encouraging, but lingering Omicron effects could have spilled into February.""
Initial claims for state unemployment benefits dropped 18,000 to a seasonally adjusted 215,000 for the week ended Feb. 26, the lowest level since Jan. 1 and the second straight weekly drop, the Labor Department said. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast 225,000 applications.
Unadjusted claims declined 21,285 to 194,693 last week, led by big decreases in California and Michigan, which offset a jump in filings in Massachusetts and Rhode Island.
Claims could soon fall back below 200,000, a level they were last below in early December. Claims have plunged from a record high of 6.149 million in early April 2020. The number of people receiving benefits after an initial week of aid edged up 2,000 to 1.476 million during the week ended Feb. 19. 
Tight labor market conditions are fueling wage growth, which is adding to inflation pressures. 
Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell told lawmakers on Wednesday that ""the labor market is extremely tight."" 
Powell said he would support a 25-basis-point interest rate hike at the U.S. central bank's March 15-16 policy meeting and would be ""prepared to move more aggressively"" if inflation does not abate as fast as expected.
Stocks on Wall Street were mostly higher. The dollar rose against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury yields fell.
LAYOFFS TUMBLE
The ISM said on Thursday its non-manufacturing activity index fell to 56.5 in February, the lowest in a year, from 59.9 in January. 
The third straight monthly decline in the index was despite coronavirus cases decreasing substantially from mid-January. A reading above 50 indicates growth in the services sector, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity.
The bulk of the survey was likely conducted before Russia started its war against Ukraine last week, which has boosted prices of oil, wheat and other commodities.
The ISM said supply chain disruptions, capacity constraints, inflation, logistical challenges and labor shortages were affecting services businesses' ability ""to meet demand, leading to a cooling in business activity and economic growth.""
Inflation and supply constraints could worsen because of the Russia-Ukraine conflict. 
""Though Europe will bear the brunt of the economic cost of the Russia-Ukraine crisis, unfavorable geopolitics in the continent threaten to exacerbate supply issues and price pressures for the U.S. services sector,"" said Bernard Yaros, an economist at Moody's (NYSE:MCO) Analytics in West Chester, Pennsylvania.
""There will be disruptions to the transportation and logistics industries, many flights have been canceled or rerouted, leading to increased pressure on cargo capacity."" 
The survey's services industry employment gauge dropped to a 1-1/2-year low of 48.5 from 52.3 in January. It was the first contraction in the index since June 2021. Some companies in the professional, scientific and technical services industry declared that the ""Great Resignation is real."" 
Economists at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) lowered their February payrolls forecast to 375,000 from 450,000 earlier.
According to a Reuters survey of economists, nonfarm payrolls likely increased by 400,000 jobs in February after rising 467,000 in January. The unemployment rate is forecast to fall to 3.9% from 4.0% in January. 

Hopes for a solid employment report were supported by a third report from global outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas showing U.S.-based employers announced 15,245 job cuts in February, down 20% from January. 
Companies also announced plans to hire 215,127 workers last month, the largest February total since Challenger began tracking monthly hiring figures in 2002. That compared to the 77,630 jobs announced in January.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A measure of U.S. services industry activity dropped to a one-year low in February and employment contracted, suggesting that a slowdown in economic growth at the end of 2021 persisted beyond the disruption from the winter wave of COVID-19 cases.
The Institute for Supply Management said on Thursday its non-manufacturing activity index fell to 56.5 last month, the lowest reading since February 2021, from 59.9 in January. 
The third straight monthly decline in the index was despite coronavirus cases, driven by the Omicron variant, decreasing substantially from mid-January. A reading above 50 indicates growth in the services sector, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity. 
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the index rising to 61. The bulk of the survey was likely conducted before Russia started its war against Ukraine last week, which has boosted prices of oil, wheat and other commodities. 
The economy hit a speed bump in December as Omicron raged across the nation. The United States is reporting an average of 61,742 new COVID-19 infections a day, a fraction of the more than 700,000 in mid-January, according to a Reuters analysis of official data.
The ISM's measure of new orders received by services businesses dropped to a reading of 56.1, also the lowest in 12 months, from 61.7 in January. Its services industry employment gauge dropped to a 1-1/2-year low of 48.5 from 52.3 in January. It was the first contraction in the index since June 2021.
The drop could be the result of worker shortages. There were a near record 10.9 million job openings at the end of December. The ADP employment report on Wednesday showed small business payrolls falling in February. Weak employment in the services sector and small business poses a risk to February's nonfarm payrolls.
According to a Reuters survey of economists, the government is likely to report on Friday that nonfarm payrolls increased by 400,000 jobs last month after rising 467,000 in January. 
A measure of order backlogs at services businesses jumped to 64.2 from 57.4 in January, mirroring a similar change in the ISM manufacturing survey published on Tuesday. 
While unfinished work indicated strong demand, it underscored the strained supply chains. The survey's measure of supplier deliveries rose to a reading of 66.2 from 65.7 in January. A reading above 50% indicates slower deliveries. 
As a result, services inflation picked up. The ISM's measure of prices paid by services industries rose to 83.1 from 82.3 in January. The Russia-Ukraine conflict is expected to further stoke inflation pressures.
Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell told lawmakers on Wednesday that he was ""inclined to propose and support a 25-basis-point rate hike"" at the U.S. central bank's policy meeting this month but would be ""prepared to move more aggressively"" if inflation does not abate as fast as expected.

Economists are expecting as many as seven rate hikes this year.

The Commerce Department said on Thursday that factory orders rose 1.4% in January. Data for December was revised sharply higher to show orders gaining 0.7% instead of falling 0.4% as previously reported. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast factory orders would rebound 0.7%. 
Manufacturing, which accounts for 11.9% of the economy, is being underpinned by businesses rebuilding inventories, though tight supply chains remain a constraint. 
Supply bottlenecks could worsen after the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Russia and Ukraine are producers of key materials used to manufacture semiconductors, whose scarcity around the global is hampering motor vehicle production.
In January, there were increases in orders for machinery and transportation equipment. Orders for computers and electronic products were unchanged. Orders for electrical equipment, appliances and components fell.
Shipments of manufactured goods increased 1.2% in January after rising 0.7% in December. Inventories at factories increased 0.7%. Unfilled orders rose 0.9% after advancing 0.8% in the prior month.

The Commerce Department also reported that orders for non-defense capital goods, excluding aircraft, which are seen as a measure of business spending plans on equipment, increased 1.0% in January instead of 0.9% as reported last month.
Shipments of these so-called core capital goods, which are used to calculate business equipment spending in the gross domestic product report, increased at an unrevised 1.9% rate in January.

Nonfarm productivity, which measures hourly output per worker, increased at an unrevised 6.6% annualized rate in the last quarter, the Labor Department said in its second estimate.
Economists polled by Reuters had expected productivity would be revised slightly up to a 6.7% pace. Productivity declined at a 3.9% rate in the third quarter. 
It grew at a 1.9% pace from a year ago. Productivity has been volatile since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. 
Hours worked rose at an unrevised 2.4% rate in the fourth quarter. 
Unit labor costs - the price of labor per single unit of output - grew at a 0.9% rate rather than the previously estimated 0.3% pace. 
They accelerated at a 10.6% pace in the third quarter. Unit labor costs rose at a 3.5% rate from a year ago. 

Despite the moderate increase in labor costs, businesses have been boosting wages as they compete for scarce workers. There were 10.9 million job openings at the end of December.
Hourly compensation jumped at a 7.5% rate in the fourth quarter, revised up from the previously estimated 6.9% pace. It grew at a 6.2% rate in the third quarter. Compensation increased at a 5.5% rate compared to the fourth quarter of 2020.

Initial unemployment claims decreased by 18,000 to 215,000 in the week ended Feb. 26, Labor Department data showed Thursday. The median estimate called for 225,000 applications in a Bloomberg survey of economists.
Continuing claims for state benefits were little changed at 1.48 million in the week ended Feb. 19.
The drop in claims is consistent with a strong labor market recovering from the omicron variant, which forced some businesses to close. The trend should continue as loosening Covid restrictions are likely to encourage Americans to go to work, and employers are keen on retaining workers as activity reignites.
The data come ahead of the government’s monthly employment report, which is currently forecast to show the U.S. added 415,000 jobs in February. A separate report Wednesday showed that U.S. companies added a greater-than-forecast 475,000 jobs last month, according to ADP Research Institute.

266,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 03, 2022 06:36AM ET</span>",UK businesses' inflation expectations hit record highs,"By David Milliken
LONDON (Reuters) - British businesses' expectations for inflation over the next 12 months have risen to their highest in more than five years, according to a Bank of England survey that is likely to boost official concerns that soaring inflation may be slow to fall.
Businesses surveyed from Feb. 4-18 expect inflation in a year's time to be 5.0%, up from 4.3% in January's survey and matching December's reading, which was the highest since the series started in January 2017.
Looking at the three-month average for the survey, the BoE's preferred measure, expected inflation rose to 4.8%, the highest on record.
Consumer price inflation was 5.5% in December and last month, before Russia's invasion of Ukraine sent energy prices even higher, the BoE forecast it would peak at around 7.25% in April before returning to its 2% target over the next two years.
Many policymakers look at surveys of inflation expectations to get a sense of how persistent inflation is likely to be after the initial shocks driving up prices - in this case, higher energy prices and supply-chain difficulties - begin to fade.
Inflation expectations have been rising across a range of measures.
Two other surveys released on Thursday - an IHS Markit purchasing managers' index and a Confederation of British Industry poll - showed inflation pressures in the services sector were the highest since at least 1996 and 1998 respectively.
Households' long-term inflation expectations last month were the highest since 2011, and a measure of financial markets' expectations for five to 10 years ahead closed at its highest since at least 2013 on Wednesday.
The BoE has raised interest rates twice since December and financial markets expect it to raise rates again on March 17, returning Bank Rate to its pre-pandemic level of 0.75%.

Monetary Policy Committee member Catherine Mann highlighted high price and wage expectations in the BoE's last Decision Maker Panel survey as a reason why she wanted to ""front-load"" tightening, and return rates to 0.75% in February.
But others have also noted that surging energy prices will sap consumer spending power, limiting businesses' ability to pass on higher costs over the medium term.

The European Union's statistics office Eurostat said unemployment in the 19 countries sharing the euro fell to 6.8% of the workforce in January from 7.0% in December -- the lowest jobless rate on record in the single currency area.
Economist polled by Reuters had expected a reading of 6.9%. Eurostat said 11.225 million people were without jobs in January, down from 11.439 million the month before.
But prices at factory gates, which herald price trends for consumers, jumped 5.2% month-on-month -- more than double the market expectations -- for a record 30.6% year-on-year surge, accelerating from a 26.3% jump in December.
Economists polled by Reuters had expected a 27.0% year-on-year rise.
The huge increase was mainly a result of an 11.6% monthly and a 85.6% annual increase in oil and gas prices, boosted already by the very threat of a Russian invasion of Ukraine before the aggression actually happened.

The producer price increase will be an additional headache for the European Central Bank because it is bound to boost consumer prices, which the bank wants to keep at 2.0%. 
Consumer inflation was already at a record 5.8% in February and economists expect it will accelerate further.

LONDON (Reuters) - Price rises in Britain's services sector last month were the most widespread in more than 25 years as businesses recovered from the Omicron wave of coronavirus cases, a survey showed on Thursday.
The IHS Markit/CIPS services Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) rose to 60.5 in February from 54.1 in January, just below an initial flash estimate of 60.8 but the highest since June.
However, the survey showed the highest reading for the proportion of firms raising prices since the series began in July 1996 - news which is likely to alarm the Bank of England as consumer price inflation approaches a 30-year high.
The broader composite PMI, which includes Tuesday's upwardly revised manufacturing PMI, rose to 59.9 from 54.2, also the highest since June 2021. Readings above 50 indicate growth.
""Although the latest set of PMI data were encouraging, the inflationary picture still has the potential to limit growth, while it remains to be seen what impact the Russian invasion of Ukraine will have on the service sector and wider economy,"" said Andrew Harker, economics director at IHS Markit.
Financial markets expect the Bank of England to raise rates later this month from 0.5% to their pre-pandemic level of 0.75%, and for rates to reach 1.5% by August.
The BoE forecast last month that inflation would peak at around 7.25% in April when regulated household energy tariffs jump by more than half. 
BoE policymaker Michael Saunders warned on Tuesday that Russia's invasion of Ukraine and the impact on energy prices risked pushing that peak even higher.

IHS Markit said around a third of companies surveyed raised their prices last month, with many reporting higher costs for staff salaries, fuel, utilities and raw materials such as food.
An index for input costs for services companies was its second-highest on record, contrasting with a fall to a 10-month low for the same measure for manufacturers earlier in the week.

MUMBAI (Reuters) - India's trade and current account deficits are likely to widen, putting pressure on the rupee, as global oil prices surge and the domestic economy reopens from a third wave of the pandemic, economists and analysts said.
India's trade deficit widened sharply to $21.19 billion in February compared to $17.94 billion the previous month, preliminary data showed.
""The recent increase in crude oil prices beyond $110/barrel and simultaneous revival of domestic demand pose headwinds to India's current account balance as import bill will likely remain elevated,""  Barclays  (LON:BARC) economist Rahul Bajoria said.
Oil prices have hit their highest levels in almost a decade.
Indian exports dipped to $33.81 billion from $34.06 billion, while imports rose to $55.01 billion from $52.01 billion. 
Exports could dip amid global trade disruptions due to the Ukraine crisis but analysts the impact was likely to be small, with Russia accounting for just 0.8% of India's exports.
""If the slowdown in Russia's economy spills over more broadly, risks to export demand would increase,"" Nomura economists Sonal Varma and Aurodeep Nandi wrote.
""On the flip side, higher commodity prices should help with commodity-based exports like petroleum products and metals. On balance, we believe higher commodity prices will play a key role in further widening the trade deficit,"" they said.
Emkay Global economist Madhavi Arora said the current account deficit as a proportion of gross domestic product could rise by 0.5% with each $10 barrel increase in crude prices. 
She said that with oil above $100 a barrel, the current account deficit could exceed 2.5% of GDP in 2022/23.
""A higher twin deficit, global risks and a change in risk appetite could keep the pressure on the rupee intact,"" she said.

The rupee is expected to trade in a range of 75 to 76.50 to the dollar in the near term with India's large foreign exchange reserves of nearly $633 billion providing a buffer and preventing sharp depreciation.
""While funding requirements are likely to be manageable, we think capital inflows will barely offset the increasing deficit; hence, the (balance of payment) surplus is likely to be small,"" Bajoria said.

As the Omicron coronavirus variant swept across Europe earlier this year, many governments reimposed restrictions. But most of those curbs have been eased.
IHS Markit's final Composite Purchasing Managers' Index, seen as good gauge of overall economic health, climbed to a five-month high of 55.5 in February from 52.3 in January.
However, that was below the 55.8 preliminary estimate which contained 82% of replies and was published on Feb. 21 - before the Russian invasion.
""The survey data for February depict a euro zone economy that was regaining robust growth momentum ahead of the invasion of Ukraine,"" said Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit.
""Business activity accelerated to a pace commensurate with GDP growth in excess of 0.6%, buoyed by a relaxation of virus restrictions.""
As restrictions were eased consumers returned to restaurants, bars and other services while also buying manufactured goods, so the composite new business index climbed to 55.6 from 52.7, its highest since September.
A PMI for the services industry bounced to 55.5 from 51.1, well above the 50 mark that separates growth from contraction but below an initial 55.8 estimate.
Manufacturing growth in the bloc waned slightly last month but activity was still strong and supply chain constraints eased, a sister survey showed on Tuesday, although factories and consumers faced soaring prices. [EUR/PMIM]
Services firms had to bear input costs rising at the fastest rate since the survey began in mid-1998 and increased their prices at a record pace. The output prices index rose to 58.8 from 57.9.
Inflation soared to a record high 5.8% last month, official preliminary data showed on Wednesday, almost triple the European Central Bank's 2.0% target.

That will likely intensify a policy dilemma for ECB policymakers when they meet next week, needing to convey a sense of calm amid war-related market turmoil but also responding to mounting price pressures.
""With inflation risks rising and growth prospects waning, the Ukraine conflict adds to business and household headwinds for the coming months, and exacerbates the difficult juggling act of the ECB in controlling inflation while sustaining a robust economic recovery,"" Williamson said.

IHS Markit's final Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) for services rose to 55.8 in February from 52.2 in January thanks to higher demand. However, the final reading was lower than a preliminary ""flash"" estimate of 56.6.
The composite PMI index, which covers both the services and manufacturing sectors, rose to 55.6 from 53.8 in January, the highest since last August but lower than a flash figure of 56.2.
""Another strong round of job creation across the services economy contributed to a further improvement in the overall labour market in February"" said Phil Smith, associate economics director at IHS Markit.

""However, the survey captured the mood before the escalation of the Ukraine-Russia tensions into a conflict, which brings with it downside risks to the growth outlook,"" Smith said, adding inflationary pressures are still ""uncomfortably high.""
Prices are also likely to stay elevated for longer given the recent developments in energy costs and the threat of fresh supply disruptions, he said.

IHS Markit's Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) of services companies, which account for around half Spain's economic output, rose to 56.6 last month from 46.6 in January, when the indicator was below the 50 mark separating growth from contraction for the first time since March 2021.
""A positive month for Spain’s service sector, with activity and new business rebounding sharply as the adverse impacts of the Omicron wave dissipated,"" IHS Markit's economist Paul Smith said in a report.
""Confidence about the future improved,"" IHS Markit said.
However, concerns about rising operating costs and input prices persisted during the month. Most business people polled said they passed on cost increases to their customers, the survey showed.

The expansion is good news since the January contraction cast some doubt over the speed of the recovery in the first quarter of the year. Quarterly economic growth in the fourth quarter had slowed to 2% from 2.6% in the previous three months.
The Spanish government is targeting 7% growth in 2022 after last year's post-pandemic recovery undershot its goal at 5%.

In the prior year, Germany had attained its first export surplus with Russia since 1993, the office added.
The trade data highlight Germany's reliance for energy on Russia, which supplies more than a third of Europe's gas.
The chief executive of German utility Uniper earlier this year pegged Russia's share of Germany's gas supply at half, although this can fluctuate from month to month.

Economy Minister Robert Habeck said on Wednesday that Germany is prepared should Russia stop exporting gas to the country, Europe's largest economy.
Germany's overall export surplus dropped by 4.2% to 172.9 billion euros in 2021 on a year earlier, the fifth consecutive year the surplus was down, the office said.

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Home rents have risen to a seven-year high in Singapore, already one of the world's most expensive cities, even though the city-state's population has dipped in the past two years.
The rental price index of private residential properties increased to 114.2 in the fourth quarter of 2021, up 9.9% from the same period a year earlier, according to Singapore government data, as demand outstrips supply that has been hit by construction delays because of COVID-19 curbs.
""I need to win the lottery,"" said American Aimee Yager as she described her weeks-long house hunt in Singapore and only finding a new 4-1/2-bedroom home for her family of four after raising her monthly rental budget to about S$10,000 ($7,400). 
""We just can't afford it,"" said Yager, whose experience is echoed by confounded and frustrated tenants, both local and foreign. 
Shortages of workers and materials because of the COVID pandemic has delayed the construction of private condominiums and public Housing Development Board (HDB) apartments. At the same time, rental demand is rising, which analysts attribute to a range of factors. 
Some local Singaporeans are renting while they wait for their apartments to be completed, while high property prices have prompted some landlords to sell their units, reducing the rental stock.
Other Singaporeans returned to the country during the pandemic and repossessed homes that were previously rented out. Young Singaporean professionals are also moving out of family residences and leasing their own space to work from home.
Singaporeans Sebelle Ho and her fiance, who will marry this month, just signed a S$2,800 lease on a two-bedroom HDB apartment, where they will live while waiting for their resale public housing flat to be ready.
But Ho said her hunt for the six-month rental had ""not been easy at all,"" recalling her stress after a potential landlord pulled out of their agreement.
Singaporeans do not typically rent but live in their family home until they get married and become eligible for subsidised public housing. 
The surging property market is adding to the cost of living in Singapore, ranked by the Economist Intelligence Unit as the second-most costly city to live in along with Paris. 
Inflation has climbed to multi-year peaks this year, while fuel and electricity costs are forecast to spike further.
""If companies are recruiting or retaining expatriates in 2022, they're likely to be needing to pay higher salaries or higher overall packages,"" said Lee Quane at relocation firm ECA International.
The vacancy rate of private residential units shrank to 6% at the fourth quarter of 2021 from 7% a year ago, government data showed. Rents have also risen despite expatriates leaving Singapore amid the pandemic.
Analysts expect rents to rise 8%-12% this year, as Singapore loosens border restrictions, allowing more foreigners into the country. 
The city-state is also poised to attract workers from rival financial centre Hong Kong, which is seeing an exodus of expatriates who are unhappy with its stringent COVID prevention rules.
The hot rental streak is likely to continue for a couple of years until construction catches up, said Christine Sun at real estate consultants OrangeTee and Tie. 
Briton Arabella Lambe's family had to look for a new home after their landlord asked for a 50% increase to renew their current S$8,000 lease on a 4,500 square foot (418 square metres) house. When she saw a listing for a 3,000 square foot house in a more central part of town, she snapped it up within hours.

But the rent is still slightly more than the previous one. 
""We're moving into a smaller house. So, I'm hoping that our huge electricity bills that we've been paying are going to be reduced,"" said Lambe. ""We'll just have to sort of cut back on things.""

The precise dates of the survey, which made no mention of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, were not clear. 
Moscow calls its action in Ukraine that began on Feb. 24 ""a special military operation"". The invasion has triggered harsh economic sanctions against Moscow and the Russian central bank.
The Markit index's headline figure rose to 52.1 in February from 49.8 in January, returning above the 50 mark that separates expansion from contraction for the first time since September.
Employment declined in the sector for the third month and at the quickest pace since late 2020, the monthly survey showed.
But business expectations improved as companies planned to step up investment and hoped that client demand will increase.
""Although total demand remained historically subdued, firms were buoyed by efforts to invest in new product lines, as business confidence reached the highest since last September,"" said Sian Jones, a senior economist at IHS Markit, which compiles the survey.
""Although private sector firms were strongly upbeat regarding the outlook, imposed sanctions are expected to hamper growth potential across the Russian economy.""

Western countries have now imposed a wide range of harsh economic and financial sanctions on Russia after its invasion of Ukraine, sending the rouble to record lows and paving the way for a decline in living standards.
A sister survey showed earlier this week that Russian manufacturing activity shrank in February as new orders fell for the first time in six months, as businesses felt the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.

The activity contraction highlights the challenge Japanese policymakers face in stimulating consumer spending to keep a fragile recovery on track as the Ukraine crisis and supply disruptions worsen uncertainty in the economic outlook.
The final au Jibun Bank Japan Services Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) fell to a seasonally adjusted 44.2 from the prior month's final of 47.6, marking the fastest rate of contraction since May 2020.
While activity stayed well below the 50-mark that separates contraction from expansion on a monthly basis, that was better than a seasonally adjusted 42.7 flash reading.
""Activity and new business declined at the sharpest pace since last August,"" said Usamah Bhatti, economist at IHS Markit, which compiles the survey.
Business in the sector saw overall input prices rise for the 15th straight month, citing increased fuel and raw material costs, but that did not lead them to charge more for services as the surge in coronavirus cases hit consumer demand.
""Firms made attempts to stimulate demand by engaging in price discounting measures for the first time in six months, despite a renewed acceleration in average cost burdens,"" said Bhatti.
The composite PMI, which is calculated using both manufacturing and services, fell to 45.8 from January's final of 49.9, contracting at the fastest speed in 18 months.
A separate government data showed Japan's consumer confidence index fell for a third month in February, hitting the lowest in nine months. 

""Higher COVID-19 infections...and a continuous rise in everyday goods prices influenced the consumer sentiment,"" a government official told a press briefing on Thursday, adding record-high 91.7% of consumers surveyed for the data said they expected prices to rise in one year.
The world's third-largest economy is expected to see growth grind to a near halt this quarter, likely growing an annualised 0.4%, as coronavirus curbs and supply bottlenecks weigh on overall activity, a Reuters poll showed this week.

Investing.com – China’s services sector expanded at the slowest pace in six months, a private survey showed on Thursday. The industry continues to struggle under tough containment measures to stop the spread of COVID-19 outbreaks.
The Caixin services purchasing managers index (PMI) was 50.2 in February 2022, lower than the 50.9 predicted in Investing.com forecasts and January’s 51.4 figure. The 50-mark indicates growth.
The data follows that released on Tuesday, which showed that the non-manufacturing PMI for the services sector was 51.6. The manufacturing PMI was 50.2 and the Caixin manufacturing PMI was 50.4.
Continuous outbreaks of COVID-19 in the country have left the services sector vulnerable, with numbers surging past a record 50,000 in the Special Administrative Region of Hong Kong. Measures implemented to contain the cases have dampened demand in sectors such as travel.
New export business fell a second consecutive month, albeit at a slower pace. This meant another reduction of payrolls at China's services firms, but the fall was smaller.
""Demand for services contracted, while supply expanded at a limited pace. The spread of COVID-19 in several regions hurt business operations of service companies,"" Caixin Insight Group senior economist Wang Zhe told Reuters.
""Policymakers should enhance support policies to encourage employment, strengthen structural support for small and mid-size enterprises and effectively reduce the tax burden and fundraising costs for companies,"" he added.
The focus is now squarely on the 13th National People’s Congress, whose fifth annual session, which begins on Mar. 5. The government will disclose the economic targets for 2022, and expectations for more stimulus measures are also growing.
The Caixin services survey also showed that inflationary pressures are starting to ease. It also showed that confidence for the year was at a three-month high as companies look towards a strong economic recovery from COVID-19."
279,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 02, 2022 09:46PM ET</span>",China's Feb services activity expands at slowest rate in six months,"BEIJING (Reuters) - Activity in China's services sector in February expanded at the slowest pace in six months, as the sprawling industry reels from the government's tough containment measures to stop the spread of local COVID-19 outbreaks, a survey showed on Thursday.
The Caixin/Markit services Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) dropped to 50.2 in February - the lowest since August and only a touch above the 50-point mark that separates growth from contraction on a monthly basis - from 51.4 in January.
The softer reading contrasted with a slight pickup in the services sector growth in an official survey on Monday, although both results pointed to a still soft expansion as the industry remains vulnerable to disruptions amid China's zero-COVID approach. 
More Chinese cities are battling local COVID-19 cases in recent weeks, with infections from the city of Hong Kong surging, although the total number of cases pales in comparison with those in other countries.
A sub-index for new business in the private survey stood at 48.8 in February, the first decline since August last year, as services firms reported measures to contain COVID cases, including the travel restrictions, impacted client demand.
New export business fell for the second straight month, although at a slower pace.
That led to another reduction of payrolls at China's services firms, but the extent of decline eased.
""Demand for services contracted, while supply expanded at a limited pace. The spread of COVID-19 in several regions hurt business operations of service companies,"" said Wang Zhe, Senior Economist at Caixin Insight Group.
""Policymakers should enhance support policies to encourage employment, strengthen structural support for small and mid-size enterprises and effectively reduce the tax burden and fundraising costs for companies,"" said Wang from Caixin Insight.
China's economy rebounded strongly from a pandemic-induced slump in 2020, though momentum started to flag in the summer of last year, as a debt crisis in the property market and strict anti-virus measures hit consumer confidence and spending.
Top officials have vowed to stabilise growth this year and all eyes are on the annual meeting of its top legislative body that begins on March 5 during which the government will unveil economic targets for the year and likely more stimulus measures.

The survey also showed inflationary pressures eased a bit. A sub-index for input costs stood at 52.5, compared with 54.5 the previous month, although it marked the 20-month of growth. 
Confidence towards the year ahead, however, picked up to a three-month high as firms expect a strong post-pandemic recovery.

280,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 02, 2022 08:01PM ET</span>",Many UK services businesses plan record price rises - CBI,"LONDON (Reuters) - A record share of firms in Britain's business and professional services sector expect to raise prices over the next three months as they face surging cost pressures, a survey showed on Thursday, adding to the Bank of England's inflation challenge.
The Confederation of British Industry said business and professional services firms were more likely to raise prices than at any time since the survey began in 1998. Consumer services companies' pricing plans were the highest since 2007.
""Rising inflation and cost pressures are hitting firms' profitability and their bottom line. The spectre of further price increases is being felt across the board,"" said Charlotte Dendy, the CBI's head of economic surveys.
The BoE has raised interest rates twice since December in a bid to stop an energy-led surge in inflation to a 30-year high from shifting businesses' pricing behaviour upwards in the long term.
Financial markets expect the central bank to raise rates again this month and for interest rates to reach 1.5% by August, up from 0.5% now.

The quarterly CBI survey, conducted from Jan. 28 to Feb. 15, showed sales growth slowed over the previous three months, when many companies were hit by the Omicron wave of coronavirus.
However, hiring and investment intentions remain strong and the businesses forecast a pick-up in business volumes over the coming quarter.

281,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 02, 2022 03:57PM ET</span>","U.S. firms buffeted by high inflation and worker shortages, Fed survey shows","(Reuters) - The U.S. economy expanded at a modest to moderate pace from mid January through mid February while inflation pressures broadened and employers continued to struggle to find workers, a Federal Reserve report showed on Wednesday.
The mixed picture illustrated in the U.S. central bank's latest survey of business contacts across the country mirrors wider economic data that showed a booming jobs market and resilient economic activity in January despite a surge in COVID-19 cases, inflation running at a 40-year high, and a scramble for workers with wages rising at the fastest pace in many years.
Worryingly, there appeared few indications that price pressures will soon ease with rising input costs felt across a range of industries.
""Prices charged to customers increased at a robust pace across the nation...firms reported they expect additional price increases over the next several months as they continue to pass on input cost increases,"" the Fed said in its survey, known as the ""Beige Book,"" which was conducted across its 12 districts through Feb. 18.
The Fed remains on track to raise interest rates from near zero, where they have been held since the onset of the pandemic, as it begins a tightening cycle to rein in inflation at its next policy meeting on March 15-16. 
Fed Chair Jerome Powell said earlier on Wednesday he was ""inclined to propose and support a 25-basis-point rate hike"" at that meeting but would be prepared to move more aggressively at meetings later in the year if inflation does not abate as fast as expected.
However, Powell added that the U.S. economic outlook has become highly uncertain in the wake of Russia's invasion of Ukraine and that the Fed would proceed carefully.
The Fed's latest report contained some signs that a feared wage-price spiral, where higher inflation expectations leads to accelerated wage gains, could be close at hand, although a few districts reported signs of wage growth moderation.
""Firms continued to increase compensation...with mixed success. Contacts reported they expect the tight labor market and consequent strong wage growth to continue,"" the Fed said.
The San Francisco Fed reported employers in Alaska and Utah citing candidates who missed scheduled interviews and newly hired workers who failed to show up on the first day at their new job. Many firms told the Cleveland Fed that employee turnover was high ""for various reasons, including a greater desire to work remotely, receive higher wages, change careers, or find better working conditions."" 

Elsewhere, a high-end restaurant told the Atlanta Fed it was using a new system that allowed employees to ""shift surf"" at several restaurants to match personal scheduling needs and make more money, ""which ultimately resulted in staffing shortages at some establishments.""
Among reporting districts, the overall economic outlook over the next six months remained stable and generally optimistic, although firms highlighted an elevated degree of uncertainty.

282,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 02, 2022 03:46PM ET</span>",U.S. private payrolls rise solidly as labor market continues to gain traction,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. private employers hired more workers than expected in February and data for the prior month was revised sharply higher to show strong job gains instead of losses, aligning with other reports that have painted an upbeat picture of the labor market.
The ADP National Employment Report on Wednesday suggested the economy was on solid footing as the winter wave of COVID-19 infections driven by the Omicron variant was subsiding. But some economists raised concerns about the report's credibility because of the sharp upward revision to January's data.
Private payrolls increased by 475,000 jobs last month. Employers added 509,000 jobs in January rather than laying off 301,000 workers as was initially reported. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast private payrolls rising by 388,000 jobs.
""Huge revisions undermine ADP's credibility,"" said Michael Pearce, a senior economist at Capital Economics in New York. ""Quite frankly, with January's 301,000 reported drop revised into a 509,000 gain, the ADP figures are as much noise than signal."" 
ADP chief economist Nela Richardson, however, said revisions were part of the process, drawing parallels with the Labor Department's Bureau of Labor Statistics, which compiles the closely watched monthly employment report. 
""If you look over the last three months, like the November, December (data), BLS also has substantially revised their numbers over the course of 2021,"" said Richardson. ""I think what's important to remember is the overall trend. Both NER and the BLS are showing more than 6 million jobs created in 2021."" 
The ADP report is jointly developed with Moody's (NYSE:MCO) Analytics and was published ahead of the BLS' more comprehensive and closely watched employment report for February on Friday. It has a poor record predicting the private payrolls count in the BLS employment report because of methodology differences.
While the initial ADP estimate showed private payrolls fell for the first time in a year in January, the BLS reported that the private sector hired 444,000 workers, with large upward revisions to employment gains in November and December.
FEBRUARY COUNT OVERSTATED?
According to the ADP report, large companies accounted for almost all of the job gains in February, with employment at small businesses declining by 96,000, a potential red flag. 
""This segment (small businesses) is often the canary in the coal mine,"" said Joel Naroff, chief economist at Naroff Economics in Holland, Pennsylvania. ""I am not saying that we are headed to a major slowdown in job growth, or even a decline in payrolls, but it is likely the ADP report overstated the number of workers hired in February.""  
Businesses continue to report difficulties finding workers. The Federal Reserve's Beige Book report on Wednesday showed ""widespread strong demand for workers remained hampered by equally widespread reports of worker scarcity, though some districts reported scattered signs of improving labor supply.""
The report was based on information collected on or before Feb. 18. There were a near-record 10.9 million job openings at the end of December.
Tightening labor market conditions are feeding into higher inflation pressures. Fed Chair Jerome Powell told lawmakers on Wednesday that the U.S. central bank would move forward with plans to raise interest rates this month, but Russia's war against Ukraine had made the outlook ""highly uncertain.""
Economists are expecting as many as seven rate hikes this year. Stocks on Wall Street were trading higher. The dollar fell against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury yields rose.
""We expect little fallout on the U.S. labor market, but there are major downside risks in the months ahead,"" said Gus Faucher, chief economist at PNC Financial (NYSE:PNC) in Pittsburgh. ""These include a recession in Europe, even higher inflation because of rising energy prices, and the increasing likelihood that the Fed could be forced to raise interest rates so aggressively to combat inflation that the recovery stalls.""
Indications are that companies maintained a strong pace of hiring in February. Data from Homebase, a payroll scheduling and tracking company, showed substantial increases in the number of employees on the job as well as hours worked in mid-February. 

According to UKG's workforce activity report, shift work in February recorded its largest monthly gain since the spring of 2020. The workforce management software company said the surge meant that the impact of the Omicron variant of COVID-19 on hourly shift work was over. 
That aligns with expectations for another month of solid employment gains in February. Nonfarm payrolls likely increased by 400,000 jobs after rising 467,000 in January, according to a Reuters survey of economists. Private payrolls are forecast to have increased by 378,000 jobs in February.

283,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 02, 2022 12:08PM ET</span>","Euro zone inflation soars to new high, intensifying ECB dilemma","By Balazs Koranyi and Francesco Canepa
FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Euro zone inflation soared to another record high last month, intensifying a policy dilemma for the European Central Bank, which will need to convey a sense of calm amid war-related market turmoil but also respond to mounting price pressures.
Inflation in the 19 countries sharing the euro accelerated to 5.8% from 5.1% in January, the highest figure in the bloc's two decades, beating expectations for 5.4% and also confounding the ECB's own projection for a drop, data from Eurostat showed on Wednesday.
A 32% jump in energy costs drove inflation last month but unprocessed food prices were also up sharply, rising 6.1% and making inflation especially painful for lower income families. 
But the ECB's chief economist Philip Lane called for ""tolerating a temporary increase in the inflation rate"", which was caused by a shock in the supply of fuel and other goods. 
""In the event of an adverse supply shock, the horizon over which inflation returns to the target level could be lengthened in order to avoid pronounced falls in economic activity and employment,"" Lane added. 
With energy prices soaring due to Russia's war in Ukraine, inflation will exceed 6% as soon as this month, analysts said, and even the full year average will be over 5%, more than twice the ECB's 2% target. 
As price pressures had been building for months, the ECB was all but certain to accelerate its exit from ultra easy policy at its meeting next week. But the war has thrown those plans into turmoil, leaving the policy outlook uncertain.
Still, policy hawks have not fully abandoned their calls for tighter policy as price pressures are now broad and not merely a function of a spike in oil prices.
""If price stability requires it, the ECB Governing Council must adjust its monetary policy course,"" Bundesbank President Joachim Nagel said. ""We need to keep our sights trained on the normalisation of our monetary policy.""
Nagel, however, stopped short of making the case for the ECB to curb stimulus this month.
Hawks argue that given a surge in underlying inflation, which filters out volatile fuel prices, maintaining exceptional stimulus is inappropriate.

PURCHASING POWER
The problem for the ECB is that, while war is likely to boost prices above all forecasts this year, it is a negative for both growth and inflation in the longer term, a horizon that is more relevant for the central bank. 
High energy costs sap household purchasing power, eat into corporate margins and weigh on investment. They are also likely to impact the price of other goods and services, particularly food prices, as natural gas is the biggest cost in fertiliser production. 
Meanwhile financing conditions have already tightened, mainly due to falling share prices, particularly a 25% drop in the euro zone bank index since mid-February, although there has been no broad market turmoil.
ECB board member Fabio Panetta, an outspoken policy dove, has already made the case for holding off on any further policy tightening. 
ECB Vice President Luis de Guindos, considered a centrist, acknowledged that the February inflation figure was a negative surprise but warned that war will dent growth.
""It is to be expected that the conflict through the macroeconomic channel and the channel of confidence and sentiment in the markets will end up having an impact from the point of view of higher inflation and lower economic growth"", de Guindos said.

Markets, which priced in 50 basis points of interest rate hikes this year just weeks ago, now only see around 20 basis points worth of increases. 
The ECB will next meet on March 10 and the policy decision remains wide open and subject to developments in Ukraine.

285,By Bloomberg,"<span>Mar 02, 2022 08:36AM ET</span>","U.S. Job Growth More Than Forecast in February, ADP Data Show","(Bloomberg) -- U.S. companies in February added more jobs than forecast as Covid-19 cases dropped and restrictions eased, encouraging more Americans to work.
Businesses’ payrolls rose by 475,000 last month, according to ADP Research Institute data released Wednesday. The median forecast in a Bloomberg survey of economists called for a 375,000 rise. The initial January print showed a 301,000 plunge in the month, the worst since April 2020, but was revised up to a 509,000 gain.
The greater-than-expected job growth points to a labor market rebounding strongly from the omicron variant’s spread in January, which led to business closures and kept many workers at home sick. Covid-19 cases have dropped significantly and restrictions are easing across the country, which should help wary Americans get off the sidelines and back to work.
The data precede Friday’s monthly employment report from the Labor Department, which is currently forecast to show that private payrolls increased by 383,000 in February. The ADP figures don’t always follow the same pattern as the Labor Department’s data.
ADP’s payroll data represent firms employing nearly 26 million workers in the U.S.
“Last month large companies showed they are well-poised to compete with higher wages and benefit offerings, and posted the strongest reading since the early days of the pandemic recovery,” ADP Chief Economist Nela Richardson said in a statement. 
“Small companies lost ground as they continue to struggle to keep pace with the wages and benefits needed to attract a limited pool of qualified workers,” she said.
Companies with fewer than 50 employees lost 96,000 jobs in the month, while large businesses gained 552,000 jobs.
Service-provider employment rose by 417,000 in February, led by leisure and hospitality, trade and transportation and professional and business services. Payrolls at goods producers increased by 57,000.

286,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 02, 2022 07:12AM ET</span>","Turkey's trade deficit surges, energy costs add to risks","By Nevzat Devranoglu
ISTANBUL (Reuters) - Turkey's trade deficit widened 186% year-on-year in the first two months of the year due to a surging energy bill, data showed on Wednesday, as soaring commodities prices prompted economists to raise their current account deficit forecasts.
The trade deficit stood at $8.1 billion in February. Exports climbed 25.4% year-on-year to $20 billion and imports jumped 45.6% to $28.1 billion, mainly due to swelling energy imports, trade ministry data showed.
Trade Minister Mehmet Mus said in a televised speech that severe winter conditions coupled with the increase in energy prices caused the spike in imports.
Russia's invasion of Ukraine has pushed oil prices to their highest since 2014 at more than $110 a barrel, raising risks for energy importer Turkey. Prices of grains, which Turkey imports mainly from Ukraine and Russia, have also surged.
The conflict could also slash Turkey's tourism revenues, as Ankara tries to implement President Tayyip Erdogan's new economic programme that prioritises production and exports with the aim of achieving a current account surplus.
Turkey's lira had traded broadly stable since the beginning of this year, but blew through 14 against the dollar last week due to rising tensions between Moscow and Kyiv.
It weakened 1.5% on Wednesday, before paring its losses.
Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) said in a recent note that Turkey's reliance on tourism revenues from fighting parties as well as rising commodity prices is likely to lead to higher inflation, a wider current account deficit and lower economic growth.
It revised a current account deficit forecast for 2022 to 2.5% of GDP from 1.5% previously, adding that the conflict can renew pressure on the lira.
QNB Finansbank revised its 2022 current account deficit forecast up to $25 billion from a previous $10 billion. The government expects the current account to reverse course and record a surplus.

JP Morgan also doubled its current account deficit forecast to 2.2% for this year from 1.1% of GDP.
Turkey imported most from Russia, China and Germany last month. The top three destinations for Turkish exports were Germany, the United States and the United Kingdom, trade ministry data show.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. manufacturing activity picked up more than expected in February as COVID-19 infections subsided, though hiring at factories slowed, contributing to keeping supply chains snarled and prices for inputs high.
The Institute for Supply Management (ISM) said on Tuesday the outlook for manufacturing over the next two months was favorable, noting that backlog orders last month grew by the most in 11 years. Factories also reported strong order growth.
The survey was, however, conducted before last Thursday's invasion of Ukraine by Russia, which some economists say could further choke supply chains, and especially worsen the shortage of semiconductors. The conflict has caused a surge in oil and wheat prices, among other commodities. Russia and Ukraine are producers of key materials used to manufacture semiconductors.
""Falling coronavirus cases should help the domestic side of the economy improve further in the spring months, but spillover from higher energy and food prices and international shipping disruptions related to the Russia-Ukraine war are a downside risk to manufacturing near-term,"" said Bill Adams, chief economist at Comerica (NYSE:CMA) Bank in Toledo, Ohio. 
The ISM's index of national factory activity increased to a reading of 58.6 last month from 57.6 in January, which was the lowest since November 2020. 
A reading above 50 indicates expansion in manufacturing, which accounts for 11.9% of the U.S. economy. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the index rising to 58.0. 
All of the six largest manufacturing industries - transportation equipment, machinery, computer and electronic, food, chemical, as well as petroleum and coal products reported moderate-to-strong growth.
Manufacturing is regaining momentum in line with the broader economy after hitting a speed bump as coronavirus infections, driven by the Omicron variant, surged across the country. The United States is reporting an average of 69,704 new COVID-19 infections a day, a fraction of the more than 700,000 in mid-January, according to a Reuters analysis of official data.
The ISM survey's forward-looking new orders sub-index increased to 61.7 last month from 57.9 in January, which was the lowest reading since June 2020. Goods spending has surged as the pandemic curbed demand for services like travel. Even if spending reverts back to services as the health situation improves, economists expect demand for goods to remain strong.
Customer inventories have remained extremely lean for more than 60 months.
Stocks on Wall Street tumbled as the Russia-Ukraine crisis deepened. The dollar rose against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury yields fell.

HIRING SLOWS 
The survey's measure of factory employment slipped to a reading of 52.9 last month from a 10-month high of 54.5. It had increased for five straight months. According to Timothy Fiore, chair of the ISM Manufacturing Business Survey Committee, ""a higher-than-normal quits rate and early retirements continued.""
Manufacturers reported difficulties filling open jobs. There were a near record 10.9 million job openings across the U.S. economy at the end of December.
The ISM's gauge of unfinished work at factories rose to 65.0 from a reading of 56.4 in January. The 8.6-percentage point increase was the largest since January 2011. All of the six big manufacturing industries reported expanded backlogs. 
The order backlog index dropped 6.4 points in January, the largest decrease since April 2020. February's reversal suggested that global supply chains remained stressed. 
That was also evident in the survey's measure of supplier deliveries, which rose to 66.1 from 64.6 in January. A reading above 50% indicates slower deliveries to factories.
Makers of computer and electronic products complained that the ""electronic supply chain is still a mess."" Similar sentiments were echoed by their counterparts in the transportation equipment industry who said ""supply of transportation services continues to be a major issue for the supply chain.""
Electrical equipment, appliances and components manufacturers reported that they ""are not able to increase builds to cut into the backlog."" 
Inflation at the factory gate remained hot. The survey's measure of prices paid by manufacturers dipped to a still-high reading of 75.6 from 76.1 January, pointing to sustained inflation pressures. 
Inflation could accelerate in the months ahead, with Russia facing severe disruption to its exports of all commodities from oil and metals to grains after western nations imposed stiff sanctions.
""We expect the heat to remain turned up on prices for some time still amid the continued supply imbalance and higher energy and commodity costs as a result of Russia's invasion of Ukraine,"" said Tim Quinlan, a senior economist at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) in Charlotte, North Carolina.
Inflation was already a problem before the invasion, with annual consumer prices posting their biggest increase in 40 years in January. The Federal Reserve is expected to raise interest rates this month. Economists are anticipating as many as seven rate hikes this year.

A separate report from the Commerce Department on Tuesday showed construction spending increased 1.3% in January, boosted by strong outlays on single-family homebuilding and private nonresidential structures. That followed a 0.8% rise in December.

LONDON/TOKYO (Reuters) - Factories around the world sustained a brisk recovery in February amid signs the Omicron coronavirus variant was having less of an impact, but the Ukraine crisis has rapidly emerged as a risk to supply chains and is likely to exacerbate cost pressures.
Strong international sanctions against Russia in response to its invasion of Ukraine have jolted markets and boosted oil prices, adding to headaches for economies and businesses already reeling from rising input costs.
""The war in Ukraine is a major new source of uncertainty,"" Reserve Bank of Australia Governor Philip Lowe said on Tuesday after his bank kept interest rates at a record low.
Global supply chains, still not recovered from the pandemic, are now facing further disruption and cost inflation due to airspace closures which are affecting the air freight industry.
Meanwhile, a spike in commodities prices caused by the invasion is also likely to prop up inflation, already at multi-year highs in many countries, and complicate policies for central banks as they balance the need to arrest an unwelcome rise in prices and underpin growth.
""The pick-up in global inflation has been widespread and persistent and has shown few signs of having peaked,"" said Pawel Borowski, senior analyst at Fitch Ratings.
""High and rising inflation has been an enduring feature of economic recoveries in many major economies, shifting the outlook for monetary policy.""

The ECB is due to publish its latest staff projections for growth and inflation on March 10 and is widely expected to lift its forecast for price rises. 
Inflation in the bloc hit a record high 5.4% last month, preliminary official data is expected to show on Wednesday, likely adding pressure on the European Central Bank to tighten policy.
""On inflation, we expect a huge upward revision to 2022,"" noted economists at JP Morgan.
STRONG FEBRUARY
While the conflict in Ukraine poses a big risk for the global economy, indicators from February showed conditions had been robust ahead of the significant escalation in the crisis.
Data for most of the manufacturing surveys was collected before the Russian invasion. 
In the United States, the Institute for Supply Management's index of national factory activity increased to a reading of 58.6 last month from 57.6 in January. The ISM said the outlook for manufacturing for March and April was favorable, noting that backlog orders increased by the most in 11 years in February. But economists saw some risks from the Russia-Ukraine conflict. 
""Falling coronavirus cases should help the domestic side of the economy improve further in the spring months, but spillover from higher energy and food prices and international shipping disruptions related to the Russia-Ukraine war are a downside risk to manufacturing near-term,"" said Bill Adams, chief economist at Comerica (NYSE:CMA) Bank.
The subsiding Omicron wave also boosted factory activity in Europe last month. IHS Markit's February Purchasing Managers' Index showed although momentum in euro zone manufacturing growth waned slightly last month activity was still strong as demand rose at the fastest pace in six months. [EUR/PMIM]
British factory output grew last month at the fastest rate since July, IHS Markit said. [GB/PMIM]
Chinese factory surveys, both official and private sector, also showed activity in expansionary territory, pointing to resilience in the world's second-largest economy despite cost pressures.
Despite the pick-up, China's official PMI remains well below its pre-pandemic average, said Julian Evans-Pritchard, senior China economist at Capital Economics.
""The upshot is that China's economy appears to have struggled for momentum so far this year,"" he said.
Japan's factory activity growth slowed to a five-month low in February on continued COVID-19 curbs and rising input costs. Growth in activity also slowed in Taiwan and Indonesia.

""The most immediate hit from the crisis will come from rising oil prices, which will deal a severe blow to many Asian economies,"" said Toru Nishihama, chief economist at Dai-ichi Life Research Institute in Tokyo.
""Russia is a big exporter of gas, rare metals and other goods critical for chip production. That means the crisis could aggravate supply chain disruptions, which would be bad news for countries like Japan, South Korea and Taiwan.""

289,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 01, 2022 10:38AM ET</span>",U.S. construction spending surges in January on homebuilding,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. construction spending surged in January, boosted by strong outlays on single-family homebuilding and private nonresidential structures. 
The Commerce Department said on Tuesday that construction spending increased 1.3%. Data for December was revised higher to show construction outlays rising 0.8% instead of 0.2% as previously reported. 
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast construction spending gaining 0.2%. Construction spending increased 8.2% on a year-on-year basis in January. 
Spending on private construction projects shot up 1.5% in January. Outlays on residential construction increased 1.3%. 
Single-family homebuilding spending advanced 1.2%, while outlays on multi-family housing projects dipped 0.1%.
Despite January's jump, homebuilding remains constrained by higher prices for building materials, especially framing lumber. The United States last November nearly doubled the duties on imported Canadian softwood lumber after a review of its anti-dumping and countervailing duty orders.
The National Association of Homebuilders said last month that building material production bottlenecks were raising construction costs and delaying projects. 
Residential investment rebounded moderately in the fourth quarter after two straight quarterly declines.

Investment in private non-residential structures like gas and oil well drilling accelerated 1.8% in January, suggesting a rebound in spending early in the first quarter. Spending on structures fell for a third straight quarter in the October-December period.
Spending on public construction projects gained 0.6% in January. Outlays on state and local government construction projects fell 0.5%, while federal government spending soared 13.8%.

The IHS Markit Canada Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) rose to a seasonally adjusted 56.6 in February from 56.2 in January, posting its highest level since November last year. A reading above 50 shows growth in the sector.
""Growth was underpinned by a quicker expansion in output, following sharp uplifts to headcounts and supportive domestic demand conditions,"" Shreeya Patel, an economist at IHS Markit, said in a statement.
Demand climbed following a further relaxation of COVID-19 restrictions, IHS Markit said. Some Canadian provincial governments dialed back restrictions last month that were put in place to slow the spread of the Omicron variant.
The output index rose to 53.2 from 51.5 in January, while the measure of employment was at 54.6, up from 53.2. Still, material scarcity remained a headwind, causing lead times to lengthen.

The suppliers' delivery times index was at the fifth-lowest in the 11-year history of the survey, while measures of input and output prices edged higher.
""For now, businesses in Canada are coping with external pressures, but issues surrounding rising costs and supply are likely to persist for the duration of the year,"" Patel said.

The Markit Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) fell to 48.6 in February from 51.8 in the previous month, slipping below the 50.0 mark that separates expansion from contraction for the first time since September.
""Weak market demand conditions and the ongoing impact of the pandemic led to the first declines in output and new orders since August 2021, both of which were solid overall,"" said Sian Jones, a senior economist at IHS Markit, which compiles the survey.
New export orders declined at the steepest pace in four months, while inflationary pressures intensified as supplier costs increased and logistics issues continued to hamper supplier deliveries, the monthly survey showed.
Russian manufacturers also recorded the steepest decline in employment since August 2021, according to the survey which did not mention the Russian attack on Ukraine that took place on Feb. 24 and triggered harsh economic sanctions against Moscow and the Russian central bank.

""Nonetheless, manufacturers remained upbeat regarding the outlook for output over the coming year. Optimism was not dampened by current subdued demand and ongoing headwinds, and reached its highest level since August 2019,"" Jones said.

Investing.com – Chinese factory activity recorded an unexpected expansion in February, thanks to growing new orders. However, downward pressures continue to build and the impact of the Russian invasion of Ukraine remains to be seen.
Data from the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) released on Tuesday showed that the manufacturing purchasing managers index (PMI) was 50.2, above the 50-point mark indicating growth. Forecasts prepared by Investing.com predicted a figure of 49.9. while January’s figure was 50.1.
The economic recovery from COVID-19 had a strong start in 2020. However, the recovery started to slow down in the summer of 2021 due to a debt crisis in the property sector and strict measures to curb the spread of the virus, which hit consumer confidence and spending. The government has vowed to stabilize the recovery in 2022, and the focus is now on the 13th National People’s Congress, whose fifth annual session begins on Mar. 5.
Meanwhile, the recent Russian invasion of Ukraine will likely lead to global supply chain bottlenecks, which could add to months-long strains for Chinese factories.
However, on a positive note, the data also showed that new orders grew for the first time since August 2021 as demand improved following the Lunar New Year holidays in February. However, production growth cooled, with a sub-index standing at 50.4 compared with 50.9 in January.
""New orders returned to the expansionary territory, suggesting that manufacturing market demand has been quickly released since the holiday,"" NBS senior statistician Zhao Qinghe said in a statement accompanying the data’s release.
""After the Spring Festival, manufacturing activities have gradually returned to normal.""
The private Caixin manufacturing PMI was 50.4, compared to the Investing.com forecast number of 49.5 and January’s 49.1 figure. The non-manufacturing PMI for the services sector was 51.6, higher than January’s 51.1 figure.
But sporadic COVID-19 outbreaks across China continue to be of concern. An outbreak in the eastern city of Suzhou caused some factories to shut down temporarily, while the Special Administrative Region of Hong Kong continues to report a surge in cases."

The official manufacturing Purchasing Manager's Index (PMI) registered 50.2 in February, remaining above the 50-point mark, which separates growth from contraction, and picking up a touch from 50.1 in January, data from the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) showed on Tuesday. 
Analysts had expected the PMI to ease to 49.9.
China's economy rebounded strongly from a pandemic-induced slump in 2020, though momentum started to flag in the summer of last year, as a debt crisis in the property market and strict anti-virus measures hit consumer confidence and spending.
Policymakers have vowed to stabilise growth this year and all eyes are on the annual meeting of its top legislative body that begins on March 5 during which the government will unveil economic targets for the year and likely more stimulus measures.
Russia's invasion of Ukraine has raised fresh risks for the global economy, adding to months-long strains for China's factories from worldwide supply chain snags. 
""In February, PMI stayed above 50, reinforcing expectations that the economy is on track for a recovery, likely due to pro-growth policies rolled out by the government,"" said Zhang Liqun, analyst at China Federation of Logistics & Purchasing.
Zhang said that demand was still weak and inflationary pressures are building. ""China should continue to implement various policies to expand domestic demand and boost government investment... and to ensure the supply of raw materials and stabilise prices. ""
New orders grew for the first time since August last year, as demand improved following the Lunar New Year holidays. Sectors such as pharmaceutical, special equipment and auto industries expanded quickly last month. 
However, the growth in production slowed, with a sub-index standing at 50.4, compared with 50.9 in January.

""After the Spring Festival, manufacturing activities have gradually returned to normal.""
INFLATION, SUPPLY CHAIN HEADWINDS
Inflationary pressures continued to build. A gauge for raw material prices stood at the highest in four months.
A separate private PMI survey also showed China's factory activity returned to growth last month, buoyed by expanding new orders.
The property sector may provide some support this year. 
A Reuters poll showed the property market will rebound later in the year as authorities loosen some of the financing curbs on property developers and some localities relax buying requirements, bolstering buyer sentiment. China's new home prices rose for the first time in January since September
Indeed, an index of construction activity stood at 57.6 in February, up from 55.4 the previous month. 
Still, the overall momentum is hostage to persistent headwinds from various sources, some analysts say.
""The latest surveys suggest that the pace of economic growth edged up slightly in February,"" Julian Evans-Pritchard, senior China economist at Capital Economics. 
""But it remains weak amid continued supply shortages, higher imported inflation and persistent disruption to services activity.""
China is still battling sporadic COVID-19 outbreaks across the country, while imported cases from Hong Kong surged. That had dented consumer sentiment. 

A survey on China's sprawling services sector on Tuesday showed growth picking up slightly in February. 
China's official composite PMI, which combined manufacturing and services, stood at 51.2 in February compared with 50.1 in January.

294,By Bloomberg,"<span>Feb 28, 2022 09:18PM ET</span>",China’s Manufacturing Improves Despite Holiday Disruptions,"(Bloomberg) -- China’s manufacturing activity gained in February despite holiday and virus disruptions, with sentiment among larger businesses improving while smaller firms continued to slump.
The official manufacturing purchasing managers’ index rose to 50.2, the National Bureau of Statistics said Tuesday, beating the median estimate of 49.8 in a Bloomberg survey of economists. The non-manufacturing gauge, which measures activity in the construction and services sectors, increased to 51.6, above the consensus forecast. The 50-level separates expansion from contraction. 
Manufacturing activity at the beginning of each year is usually distorted by the week-long Lunar New Year holidays, which fell mostly in February this year. Many businesses and factories shut down and people traveled back to their hometowns for family gatherings during the period, although virus restrictions in parts of the country prompted some to remain in the cities where they work.  
New orders picked up, while factory managers reported stronger expectations for business activity in coming months. Input and output prices also gained, suggesting inflation pressures may rise. 
The improvement in the PMI came mainly from larger businesses, with sentiment among smaller firms continuing to slump. That suggests Beijing will likely tailor its financial support toward that sector, said Xing Zhaopeng, senior China strategist at Australia and New Zealand Banking Group. 
“The authorities will place more emphasis on small and medium-sized enterprises in our view, so policy support will be targeted and measured through fiscal and industrial policies going forward, instead of monetary easing,” he said.
The government and central bank shifted to easing mode in the second half of last year as economic momentum faltered under a property downturn and sporadic virus outbreaks. The People’s Bank of China has cut interest rates, reduced the amount of cash banks must hold in reserve, and boosted credit expansion in the economy. 
The Politburo, the Communist Party’s top decision making body, vowed last week to strengthen macroeconomic policies to stabilize the economy this year, suggesting more support could be unveiled at the National People’s Congress that kicks off this week. 
The Caixin Manufacturing PMI, a separate private survey focused more on smaller, export-oriented businesses, also showed mild improvement in February. The index gained to 50.4, beating the median forecast of 49.1 in a Bloomberg survey of economists. 
Chinese stocks are set for their third straight day of gains on Tuesday. The benchmark CSI 300 Index rose as much as 0.8% in early trading, with consumer staples and industrial shares leading the gain.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia's trade performance last quarter was much less of a drag on the economy than first thought implying upside risk for growth, even as imports outstripped exports and hefty dividend payments flowed offshore.
Data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics on Tuesday showed the current account surplus narrowed to A$12.7 billion ($9.22 billion), from A$22 billion in the third quarter.
Yet net exports trimmed only 0.2 percentage points from gross domestic product in the quarter, when analysts had looked for a 1.0 percentage point hit.
Government spending was also a minor drag in the quarter but that was more than offset by a big rise in firms' inventories, leaving analysts bullish on growth.
""Net exports represent a much smaller drag on growth in Q4 than anticipated,"" said Andrew Hanlan, a senior economist at Westpac. ""Our Q4 GDP forecast is upgraded from 2.8% qtr to 3.3%qtr.""
Figures for fourth-quarter GDP are due on Wednesday and the median forecast had already been for a hefty rise of 3% as consumer demand surged back from coronavirus lockdowns.
The brisk recovery shows every sign of continuing with retail sales jumping in January and banks reporting healthy spending on their cards through February.
That resilience supports the Reserve Bank of Australia's (RBA) optimistic outlook on growth as it holds its monthly policy meeting on Tuesday.
The central bank is considered certain to keep interest rates at 0.1% and reiterate it will be patient on hiking as it waits for a long-desired pick up in wages growth.
RBA Governor Philip Lowe has said it was plausible a first rate rise could come later this year if the economy continues to recover, while markets are pricing in a move as early as July.
The Russian invasion of Ukraine has added geopolitical uncertainty to the mix, and combined with massive floods in New South Wales and Queensland to darken the public mood.
An ANZ survey of consumers out on Tuesday showed a sharp drop in sentiment last week, while inflation expectations ran at a seven-year high of 5.3% as petrol prices hit record peaks.
The heat also seems to be coming out of the housing market with prices in Sydney falling in February for the first time in 17 months, though the shift to the country continues apace.

Figures from property consultant CoreLogic showed national home prices rose 0.6% in February, almost half the 1.1% jump seen in January. Values in Sydney dipped 0.1% and Melbourne went flat, hurt by a rush of supply and higher mortgage rates.

SEOUL (Reuters) -South Korea's trade sector swung back to a surplus in February from a record deficit a month earlier, powered by stronger-than-expected growth in exports, but the recovery faces some risks from Russia's invasion of Ukraine. 
Exports in February expanded 20.6% from a year earlier to $53.91 billion, trade ministry data showed on Tuesday, beating a forecast for 18.2% growth in a Reuters' poll and faster than the 15.2% gain in January. It also marked the 16th straight month of expansion.
""Continued rise in oil prices and high semiconductor prices boosted exports growth, adding to the solid exports volume,"" said Kim Ye-in, an analyst at Korea Investment & Securities.
A breakdown by items showed sales of semiconductors, the nation's top export, jumped 24% year-on-year, while those for petrochemicals, oil and steel products also surged 24.7%, 66.2% and 40.1%, respectively.
By destination, exports to China, South Korea's biggest trading partner, gained 16%, and those to the United States and European Union rose 20.9% and 8.6%, respectively.
Imports, meanwhile, jumped 25.1% in February to $53.07 billion, with those of crude oil, gas and coal totalling $12.5 billion. That brought the trade balance to a $0.84 billion surplus, after a record $4.83 billion deficit in January.
However, the outlook for the trade balance and exports may depend on the Ukraine crisis with a raft of sanctions imposed on Russia for its invasion of its neighbour further disrupting global supply chains.
""Price pressure on energy products will continue for the time being ... with imports value of crude oil seen growing at a solid pace,"" said Kim Yeon-jin, an analyst at Eugene Investment & Securities.

""Input price pressures intensified further, with average cost burdens rising at the sharpest pace in thirteen-and-a-half years,"" said Bhatti.

""Firms doubled down on efforts to protect against future disruption and price pressures by raising safety stocks of raw materials and other inputs at the quickest pace in the history of the survey,"" he added.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australian home prices extended their long ascent in February, though Sydney saw the first dip in 17 months as a rush of supply, rising mortgage rates and stretched affordability cooled the market.
Figures from property consultant CoreLogic out on Tuesday showed national home prices rose 0.6% in February from January, when they increased 1.1%.
Prices in the major cities edged up only 0.3%, while the regions gained 1.6% amid a pandemic-induced rush to greener pastures.
""Demographic tailwinds, low inventory levels and ongoing demand for coastal or treechange housing options are continuing to support strong upwards price pressures across regional housing markets,"" said CoreLogic's research director, Tim Lawless.
National prices were up 20.6% for the year, with the median home worth A$728,034. The same home in Sydney is priced at A$1.1 million ($798,600.00), a major reason the market there has been slowing.
Values in Sydney actually fell 0.1% in February, while Melbourne was flat and Perth added 0.4%. Brisbane fared better with a rise of 1.8%, while Adelaide gained 1.5%.
The long boom in prices has been a windfall for household wealth and consumer confidence. The Australian Bureau of Statistics estimates the value of the housing stock surged by a trillion dollars in the six months to September to reach A$9.3 trillion ($6.57 trillion).
Yet regulators have become concerned by the rapid growth in housing debt and tightened some lending rules last year.
Rates for fixed mortgages have also been rising along with government bond yields as the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) flagged a possible rise in interest rates later this year.

The central bank holds a policy meeting on Tuesday and is expected to be patient for now amid geopolitical uncertainty and the lingering drag of the coronavirus.

300,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 28, 2022 02:07PM ET</span>","U.S. goods trade deficit hits record high, seen weighing on first-quarter GDP growth","By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. trade deficit in goods widened sharply to a record high in January amid an increase in imports as businesses continued to replenish depleted inventories.
The pace of inventory accumulation reported by the Commerce Department on Monday was, however, slower than in recent months. That, together with the surge in the goods trade deficit, prompted economists at Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) to lower their gross domestic product growth estimate for the first quarter by 0.5 percentage point to a 1.5% annualized rate.
The economy grew at a 7.0% pace in the fourth quarter, with inventories contributing a whopping 4.90 percentage points.
""We remain on track for another strong gain in real business inventories in the first quarter, although inventories may end being fairly close to a neutral factor for GDP growth considering that the fourth quarter buildup of inventories also was substantial,"" said Daniel Silver, an economist at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) in New York. 
The goods trade deficit jumped 7.1% to an all-time high of $107.6 billion last month. Imports of goods increased 1.7%, led by food and motor vehicles. There were also large increases in imports of industrial supplies, capital and consumer goods. Imports of other goods, however, tumbled 15.3%.
Exports dropped 1.8%, weighed down by consumer goods, motor vehicles, food and other goods. But exports of capital goods and industrial supplies increased.
Trade has been a drag on gross domestic product for six straight quarters. Economists saw a limited impact on trade from the Russian-Ukraine conflict, which has resulted in the United States imposing same trade sanctions on Moscow. Russia accounted for only 1% of imports and about 0.4% of exports last year, according to government data.
""While the Russian invasion of Ukraine is driving a sharp increase in energy prices, its implications for trade flows will be less noticeable,"" said Mahir Rasheed, an economist at Oxford Economics in New York. ""Russia and Ukraine make up less than 1% of monthly import volumes and an even smaller share of U.S. exports, so the war has little bearing on the trade outlook.""
U.S. stocks were trading lower as investors assessed the fallout from a raft of sanctions imposed by Western countries on Russia. The dollar rose against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury yields fell.
INVENTORIES RISING 
The increase in imports last month largely reflected the rebuilding of inventories. Stocks at wholesalers increased 0.8% after climbing 2.3% in December. Inventories of durable goods, items which are meant to last three year and longer, rose 1.0%, while stocks of wholesale nondurable goods climbed 0.5%. 
Retail inventories rose 1.9% after jumping 4.7% in December. They were lifted by a 2.4% increase in motor vehicles, which followed a 7.0% surge in December. 
Motor vehicle production remains constrained by a global semiconductor shortage. Excluding motor vehicles, retail inventories gained 1.7% after advancing 3.9% in December. This component goes into the calculation of GDP growth.
Inventory investment increased at a seasonally adjusted annualized rate of $171.2 billion in the fourth quarter, one of the largest in years. Growth estimates for the first quarter range from as low as a 0.6% rate to as high as a 5.4% pace.
""Because of the way GDP is calculated, it would require a similarly sized expansion in inventories to contribute that level of growth,"" said Matt Colyar, an economist at Moody's (NYSE:MCO) Analytics in West Chester, Pennsylvania. ""We do not expect the build in the first quarter to exceed the record-breaking fourth-quarter build. As a result, we expect inventories to subtract 0.3 percentage point off GDP growth."" 
Most economists see further scope for inventories to rise, noting that inflation-adjusted inventories remain below their pre-pandemic level. Inventory-to-sales ratios are also low.
Restocking, after three straight quarters during which inventories were drawn down, is supporting manufacturing.
A survey from the Dallas Federal Reserve on Monday showed factory activity in Texas continued to expand in February, though at a slightly slower pace. The survey's production index, a key measure of state manufacturing conditions, dipped two points to a reading of 14.5. 

A reading above zero indicates growth in manufacturing in the region. Despite the moderation in activity, factories reported strong growth in new orders and were upbeat about business conditions. The survey's general business activity index shot up 12 points to a reading of 14.0. 
""The manufacturing sector continues to expand in spite of supply network dislocations and input shortages,"" said Rubeela Farooqi, chief U.S. economist at High Frequency Economics in White Plains, New York.

301,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 28, 2022 07:33AM ET</span>",UK public inflation expectations hit record levels: Citi/YouGov,"By Andy Bruce
LONDON (Reuters) -The British public's expectations for inflation over the next five to 10 years hit a joint record high in February, according to a survey that is likely to strengthen the Bank of England's intention to raise interest rates further in the coming months.
U.S. bank Citi and polling firm YouGov said their gauge of expectations for inflation in five to 10 years' time rose to 4.1% from 3.8% in January, equalling a record high struck in June 2011.
With inflation surging to its highest levels since the early 1990s, the BoE is worried that expectations for rapidly rising prices will become engrained and make it harder for it to return inflation to its 2% target once the immediate price shock has passed.
The BoE raised interest rates on Feb. 3 for the second time in two months and warned further modest tightening would be needed in the coming months to bring inflation back to its 2% target in the next two to three years.
Monday's survey showed public inflation expectations for the coming 12 months hit an outright record of 5.6% from 4.8% in January.
""Today's data, especially the level of long-term expectations, suggest a growing risk that expectations could become de-anchored,"" said Citi economist Benjamin Nabarro, adding that this was still not his base case.
""However, these risks do now merit particular vigilance as CPI inflation exceeds 8% in the months ahead. For the (BoE), these data - alongside recent developments - may increase the risk of an outsized move in Bank Rate in March.""

Financial markets expect the BoE to increase rates to 0.75% from 0.5% this month, and for rates to reach 1.5% by August, but before Russia's invasion of Ukraine investors saw a strong chance of a half-point rate rise in March.
The Citi/YouGov survey, which dates back to 2005, polled 2,076 people between Feb. 22 and Feb. 23.

The official manufacturing Purchasing Manager's Index (PMI) is expected to ease to 49.9 in February, its lowest reading in four months, from 50.1 in January, according to the median forecast of 35 economists polled by Reuters on Monday. A reading below the 50-point mark indicates a contraction from the previous month.
""Apart from seasonality impact from Lunar New Year timing shifts, production curbs during the Winter Olympics and still-subdued property sector activity likely weighed on upstream demand,"" analysts at  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) said in a note on Friday. They expect National Bureau of Statistics manufacturing PMI to have slipped to 49.6.
The week-long Lunar New Year holidays began at the end of January and the Beijing Winter Olympics took place from Feb. 4-20. 
However, Capital Economics expects some upside surprise to the data, citing loosened COVID-19 restrictions as outbreaks were contained. 
""Early indicators suggest that conditions improved in February. Most localised restrictions on industrial areas and port cities were lifted thanks to fewer outbreaks this month compared to January.""
China's economy started last year on a strong footing, rebounding from a pandemic-induced slump the previous year. Momentum started to flag in the summer, however, weighed down by debt problems in the property market and strict anti-virus measures that hit consumer confidence and spending.
Policymakers have vowed to stabilise growth this year and all eyes are on the annual meeting of its top legislative body that begins on March 5 during which the government will unveil economic targets for the year and likely more stimulus measures.
New bank lending hit a record high in January, latest data showed, after the central bank lowered benchmark lending rates to jump-start the economy.
The official PMI, which largely focuses on big and state-owned firms, and its sister survey for the services sector, will be released on Tuesday.

The private Caixin manufacturing PMI will also be published on the same day. Analysts expect the headline reading will edge up slightly to 49.3 from 49.1 previously.
Analysts at Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) said seasonality tends to generate a small upward bias to the Caixin manufacturing PMI in February.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's factory output shrank for the second month in January as the auto sector grappled with production suspensions due to the pandemic, with Russia's invasion of Ukraine intensifying pressure on an economy facing the risk of a contraction. 
Even before the Ukraine crisis erupted, factories in the world's third-largest economy were struggling with global parts supply disruptions and coronavirus infections of the Omicron variant at home.
""Car output decreased substantially due to a worsening chip shortage and supply bottlenecks,"" said Takeshi Minami, chief economist at Norinchukin Research Institute.
""That spilled over (into other industries such as) steel, which also fell.""
Factory output slumped 1.3% in January from the previous month, official data showed on Monday, hurt by falling production of cars as well as declining iron, steel and non-ferrous metals.
That meant output extended declines to a second month, after slipping 1.0% in December, and came in weaker than a 0.7% loss forecast in a Reuters poll of economists.
Japanese car producers including  Toyota  Motor (NYSE:TM) Corp and Suzuki Motor Corp have faced output cuts after being hit by supply chain disruptions and seeing pressure from a record surge in COVID-19 infections at home.
Monday's data showed output of cars and other motor vehicles slumped 17.2% from the previous month in January, falling for the first time in four months and pulling down the headline output figure by nearly 2.7 percentage points.
DOWNSIDE RISKS
Complications from the Ukraine crisis posed serious downside risks to Japan's output and broader economy, Minami added, saying output could be curbed if the conflict triggers a global commodity and energy shortage.
""The longer the war between Ukraine and Russia lasts, the stronger sanctions are likely to become,"" he said. ""It depends how far things will go.""
Manufacturers surveyed by the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) expected output to advance 5.7% in February and 0.1% in March. A government official said those forecasts were taken as of Feb. 10, and did not reflect Russia's invasion of the Ukraine.
Separate data showed retail sales expanded for the fourth consecutive month from a year earlier in January, rising 1.6% due in part to a flattered comparison to last year's low levels. That compared to a median market forecast for a 1.4% gain.
But retail sales dropped a seasonally adjusted 1.9% from the prior month, the second monthly downturn in a sign of the negative impact a surge of coronavirus infections was having on momentum.

""The falls in both retail sales and industrial production in January confirm that the Omicron surge has knocked back the recovery,"" Tom Learmouth, Japan economist at Capital Economics, said in a note.
""We think consumer spending will fall across this quarter, but it should rebound sharply in Q2.""

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australian retail sales were surprisingly strong in January as shoppers weathered a surge in Omicron cases with aplomb, suggesting the economy maintained considerable momentum into the new year. 
Data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics out on Monday showed retail sales climbed 1.8% in January to A$32.5 billion ($23.3 billion), the second highest level on record and easily beating forecasts of a 0.4% gain. 
That followed a 4.4% drop in December, which was distorted by the popularity of online sales that had pulled spending into November. 
Weekly figures from banks on card spending show activity was been quick to revive once coronavirus cases began to tail off in mid-January and is now running well above the levels of a year ago.
""With new virus cases now only a quarter of their mid-January peak, AppleMaps routing requests are now well above their 2020 levels and the number of visitors at retail & recreation facilities has rebounded, too,"" said Marcel Thieliant, a senior economist at Capital Economics.
The Russian invasion of Ukraine and the resulting spike in commodity prices has added a fresh layer of uncertainty to the outlook, though so far the impact on Australia has been minor.
""Australia's trading relationship with Russia and Ukraine is negligible,"" said Gareth Aird, head of Australian economics at CBA. ""It is our expectation the economy will largely be insulated provided the major military powers in Europe and the U.S. do not fight Russia in Ukraine or elsewhere.""
Higher petrol prices could act as a tax on consumers, while also adding to inflationary pressure, making policy more difficult for the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA).
So far, the central bank has said a first rate rise could come later this year if the economy continues to improve, though markets are pricing in a hike to 0.25% as early as July.
The central bank holds its March policy meeting on Tuesday and is considered certain to keep rates at 0.1%.[AU/INT]
Markets will be keen to see its reaction to the sudden bout of geopolitical uncertainty and to recent data showing wages only picked up modestly in the fourth quarter of last year.
Other data out on Monday showed households continued to borrow heavily with mortgage credit running at an annual pace of 7.7% in January amid a booming housing market.

Figures for gross domestic product (GDP) for the December quarter are due on Wednesday and are expected to show economic growth rebounded by a strong 3% as an easing in coronavirus lockdowns unleashed a wave of pent up consumer spending.

The National Association of Realtors (NAR) said on Friday its Pending Home Sales Index, based on signed contracts, declined 5.7% last month to 109.5. Pending home sales fell in the South, Northeast and Midwest, but rose in the West. 
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast contracts, which become sales after a month or two, rebounding 1.0%. Pending home sales dropped 9.5% in January on a year-on-year basis.

An acute shortage of previously owned homes is hampering sales. Demand for housing could slow as mortgage rates increase, which together with high prices will further erode affordability, especially for first-time buyers. Mortgage rates are near three-year highs.
""With inventory at an all-time low, buyers are still having a difficult time finding a home,"" said NAR chief economist Lawrence Yun. ""Given the situation in the market, mortgages, home costs and inventory, it would not be surprising to see a retreat in housing demand.""

Orders for non-defense capital goods excluding aircraft, a closely watched proxy for business spending plans, jumped 0.9% last month last month, the Commerce Department said on Friday. These so-called core capital goods orders gained 0.4% in December. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast core capital goods orders rising 0.5%. 
Shipments of core capital goods accelerated 1.9% last month after increasing 1.6% in December. 
Core capital goods shipments are used to calculate equipment spending in the gross domestic product measurement.
Business spending on equipment rebounded in the fourth quarter after being weighed down by motor vehicle shortages in the July-September quarter. A global shortage of semiconductors is hampering motor vehicle production.
Economists saw limited impact on equipment spending on energy production from the surge in oil prices after Russia invaded Ukraine. Brent crude prices on Thursday rose above $100 per barrel for the first time since 2014 and retreated to about $98.7 a barrel on Friday.
According to Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), shale investment had become less sensitive to price increases.

Orders for durable goods, items ranging from toasters to aircraft that are meant to last three years or more, advanced 1.6% last month after rising 1.2% in December. They were boosted by a 3.4% increase orders for transportation equipment, which followed a 1.7% rise in December. 
Motor vehicle orders fell 0.4% after increasing 1.8% in December. Orders for the volatile civilian aircraft category increased 15.6% after rising 23.9% in December. Boeing (NYSE:BA) reported on its website that it had received 77 aircraft orders last month compared to 80 in December.

National statistics institute ISTAT's manufacturing confidence index fell to 113.4 in February from a downwardly revised 113.7 in January, lower than a median forecast of 113.9 in a Reuters survey of 12 analysts.
The January figure was previously given as 113.9. 
However, ISTAT's composite business morale index, combining surveys of the manufacturing, retail, construction and services sectors, rose to 108.2 from a previous 105.3 thanks to improved sentiment among service providers and building companies.
Consumer confidence this month fell to 112.4 from 114.2 in January, below a median forecast of 115.0 in the Reuters' poll and hitting its lowest level since last May.
ISTAT said the decline was caused by a deterioration in opinions on both the general and personal economic situation. 
In the manufacturing sector, the outlook for both orders and production expectations fell, with a decumulation of stocks registered.
The euro zone's third largest economy is forecast by the government to grow 4.7% this year, when gross domestic product is seen returning to pre-pandemic levels, but the Bank of Italy warned last month of growing downside risks to the economic outlook.

310,By Bloomberg,"<span>Feb 24, 2022 07:00PM ET</span>",Tokyo Consumer Inflation Picks Up Speed Led by Energy Gains,"(Bloomberg) -- The rise in the cost of living in Tokyo matched its fastest pace in the last two years in February, an acceleration from January that suggests nationwide price growth is also due to pick up speed, driven by elevated energy prices.
Excluding fresh food, consumer prices in the capital increased 0.5% from a year earlier, according to the ministry of internal affairs Friday. That outpaced a 0.4% gain expected by economists. 
Even if the faster pace is also reflected at the national level that would still leave price growth far behind the global trend and the Bank of Japan’s 2% target.
Still, the stronger-than-expected price rises suggest Japan’s inflation pulse may be quickening more than expected and could fuel speculation that the BOJ might consider adjusting policy amid a wave of hawkish moves by its global peers in response to stronger price gains.
A sharper jump in the consumer price index is also widely expected in April when slashed phone bill charges from last year start to drop out of the calculations. 
The Russian invasion of Ukraine is also likely to keep oil prices elevated or push them up further.
What Bloomberg Economics Says...
“Higher costs of imported goods such as food and energy, further fueled by a weaker yen, are likely to buoy consumer prices. For consumers, rising prices of gasoline and food are bad news -- and could hit sentiment and damp spending.”
--Yuki Masujima, economist

Energy costs contributed 1.06 percentage point to overall prices, showing that climbing oil markets have again been the driving force behind Japan’s core inflation numbers.
Prime Minister Fumio Kishida said Friday that the government will ramp up support for those affected by the surge in oil prices after already subsidizing gas stations to cap rising gasoline prices.

Even without the commodity factor, Japan’s inflation is projected to accelerate from April on the phone factor. Nationally, cheaper phone charges have been pushing down the overall inflation index by around 1.5 percentage point in recent months.
BOJ Governor Haruhiko Kuroda  reiterated Thursday that the current level of inflation doesn’t require the bank to consider making any policy adjustments. The governor underscored that stance with actions last week when the BOJ intervened in the bond market to keep yields low for the first time since 2018. 
Keeping 10-year yields near its zero target is part of the bank’s measures to stimulate the economy and prices.
In a sign of the growing cost pressures on companies, Yaokin Co., producer of a popular 10-yen ($9 cents) snack for children, announced late last month it would raise its price tag to 12 yen for the first increase in 42 years.

BENGALURU (Reuters) - Soaring house prices in New Zealand will grind to a halt this year and Australia will follow suit in 2023 as expected higher interest rates rein in two housing markets that are among the least affordable in the world, a Reuters poll predicted.
A multi-year boom in house prices based on near-zero interest rates has gifted homeowners with record piles of equity but is pushing the dream of home ownership further out of reach for first-time buyers, especially those on lower incomes.
While house prices have racked up double-digit gains in both countries over the last year of the pandemic, they rose the most in New Zealand - by nearly 30%. That property market is now the least affordable among OECD nations.
But wages failing to keep pace with living costs, along with the added burden of three interest rate hikes since October from the Reserve Bank of New Zealand and more on the way is expected to slam the brakes on the market.
The Feb. 9-24 Reuters poll of property market analysts showed New Zealand average home prices declining about 1.0% this year. They were then expected to climb 1.5% in 2023 and 2.7% in 2024.
""Prices can't go up forever...pandemic-era policy stimulus sent prices into the stratosphere and (now) we are already seeing the housing market slow down in New Zealand pretty quickly,"" said Jeremy Couchman, senior economist at Kiwibank.
""But affordability is still a major concern...prices are expected to fall a little; still, it's a big stretch to pull together a deposit for first homebuyers. It is going to be difficult for them, unfortunately.""
New Zealand's average home price surpassed NZ$1 million for the first time. When asked to describe the level of New Zealand house prices on a scale of 1 to 10, from extremely cheap to extremely expensive, the median response was 9. For Auckland, it was rated 10. 
""We're not talking about large falls in house prices for 2022, so I don't expect it to become a buyer's market,"" said Mike Jones, senior economist at ASB Bank.
""But the balance of power is expected to shift away from sellers more towards buyers, as extra supply comes on stream, and rising interest rates put a big dent in housing demand."" 
In Australia, where prices have nearly doubled since the global financial crisis of 2007-09, they were expected to rise another 6.7% this year, due to record low interest rates.
But that blistering pace of house price appreciation was forecast to come to an end next year and fall 5%.

""The 20%-plus gains in house prices over the past year won't be repeated in 2022...in 2023, we see prices falling modestly as higher mortgage rates start to bite,"" wrote Adelaide Timbrell, senior economist at ANZ.
Australia's central bank will raise interest rates for the first time in a decade in the third quarter, slightly earlier than thought one month ago, a separate Reuters poll forecast. [AU/INT]

313,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 24, 2022 11:51AM ET</span>",U.S. labor market recovery gaining steam; unemployment rolls smallest in 52 years,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits fell slightly more than expected last week, indicating that the labor market recovery was gaining traction.
The weekly jobless claims report from the Labor Department on Thursday also showed unemployment rolls shrinking to levels last seen in 1970, underscoring the tightening labor market conditions. There is an acute shortage of workers, with a near record number of job openings, keeping layoffs minimal.
""Beyond weekly moves, we see the downtrend in filings persisting as virus-related disruptions continue to dissipate and businesses return to more normal operations,"" said Rubeela Farooqi, chief U.S. economist at High Frequency Economics in White Plains, New York. ""Overall, strong demand for labor amid labor shortages suggest layoffs will remain low.""
Initial claims for state unemployment benefits decreased 17,000 to a seasonally adjusted 232,000 for the week ended Feb. 19. That almost reversed the prior week's surge, which economists had blamed on week-to-week volatility in the data and the delayed impact of winter storms early in the month.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast 235,000 applications for the latest week.
Unadjusted claims tumbled 24,824 to 214,873 last week, led by a sharp decline in Missouri. There were also significant decreases in New York, Ohio, Tennessee, Florida and New Jersey, offsetting a large increase in Michigan. 
With 10.9 million job openings at the end of December, claims are likely to fall back below 200,000 in the coming weeks. They were last below this level in early December.
Many Federal Reserve officials view labor market conditions as already at or very close to maximum employment. The U.S. central bank is expected to start raising interest rates in March to tamp down inflation, with economists anticipating as many as seven hikes this year. 
The upbeat labor market news was eclipsed by Russia's invasion of Ukraine, which analysts warned could hurt the U.S. economy as surging oil prices boost inflation, hampering consumer spending. Brent crude prices rose above $100 per barrel for the first time since 2014, which will drive gasoline prices higher. Consumer prices notched their largest year-on-year gain in 40 years in January.
""An extended war in Eastern Europe could lead to higher global energy prices and higher U.S. inflation, forcing the Fed to tighten monetary policy aggressively, and higher interest rates could become a larger headwind for the U.S. economy,"" said Gus Faucher, chief economist at PNC Financial (NYSE:PNC) in New York.
Stocks on Wall Street tumbled. The dollar rallied against a basket of currencies, while U.S. Treasury yields fell as investors sought a safe haven.
SHRINKING JOBLESS ROLLS
Unemployment claims have plunged from a record high of 6.149 million in early April 2020. The number of people receiving benefits after an initial week of aid dropped 112,000 to 1.476 million during the week ended Feb. 12. That was the lowest level for these so-called continuing claims since March 14, 1970.
The continuing claims data covered the period during which the government surveyed households for February's unemployment rate. Continuing claims declined between the January and February survey weeks, implying an improvement in the unemployment rate, which was at 4.0% last month.
Fewer people on unemployment rolls also suggest that some out-of-work Americans are returning to the labor force, which could help ease the worker shortage. 
Tightening labor market conditions are boosting wage growth and contributing to high inflation. Rising wages and better job security should, however, help underpin consumer spending and sustain the economic expansion despite the headwinds from tighter monetary policy and the Russia-Ukraine conflict. 
A separate report from the Commerce Department on Thursday confirmed that economic growth accelerated in the fourth quarter as the drag from a resurgence in COVID-19 infections over the summer, driven by the Delta variant, eased. 
Gross domestic product increased at a 7.0% annualized rate last quarter, the government said in its second GDP estimate. That was slightly up from the previously reported 6.9% pace. The economy grew at a 2.3% pace in the third quarter. In 2021, the economy grew 5.7%, the best performance since 1984. 
The upward revision to fourth-quarter GDP growth reflected more business spending on equipment and investment in homebuilding than initially thought. 
The economic momentum briefly faltered amid an onslaught of coronavirus infections fueled by the Omicron variant. Activity has since picked up as cases subsided.
Retail sales surged in January and business activity rebounded in February, data showed this month. That has created an upside risk to GDP growth estimates for the first-quarter, which are mostly below a 2.0% rate.
The United States is reporting an average of 80,131 new COVID-19 infections a day, sharply down from the more than 700,000 in mid-January, according to a Reuters analysis of official data.
Though a third report showed new home sales dropped 4.5% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 801,000 units in January, the housing market remains underpinned by strong demand amid a severe shortage of houses.

""We continue to expect robust GDP growth of 3.5% this year and believe the expansion can withstand Fed tightening,"" said 
Lydia Boussour, lead U.S. economist at Oxford Economics in New York.

314,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 24, 2022 10:32AM ET</span>",U.S. new home sales fall in January as prices march higher,"WASHINGTON(Reuters) - Sales of new U.S. single-family homes fell slightly more than expected in January, likely as rising mortgage rates and higher prices sidelined some first-time buyers from the market.
New home sales fell 4.5% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 801,000 units last month, the Commerce Department said on Thursday. December's sales pace was revised higher to 839,000 units from the previously reported 811,000 units.
Sales dropped in the Midwest, Northeast and the densely populated South. But they rose in the West. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast new home sales, which account for more than 10% of U.S. home sales, falling to a rate of 806,000 units.
Sales tumbled 19.3% on a year-on-year basis in January. 
They peaked at a rate of 993,000 units in January 2021, which was the highest since the end of 2006. Mortgage rates are near three-year highs.
The new housing market remains underpinned by a record-low inventory of previously owned homes. Demand for housing is expected to remain strong even as mortgage rates increase, which together with high prices will further erode affordability, especially for first-time buyers.
The median new house price in January increased 13.4% from a year ago to $423,300. There were 406,000 new homes on the market, up from 394,000 units in December.
Houses under construction made up 65% of the inventory, with homes yet to be built accounting for about 26%. 

The backlog of homes approved for construction but yet to be started is at an all-time high as builders struggle with shortages and higher prices for inputs like softwood lumber for framing, as well as cabinets, garage doors, countertops and appliances.
At January's sales pace it would take 6.1 months to clear the supply of houses on the market, up from 5.6 months in December.

The closely watched core price index, which strips out some volatile food and energy prices, climbed 0.43% in early February, the national statistics agency INEGI said. That was above expectations in a Reuters poll for a 0.31% increase.
Annual core inflation accelerated to 6.52%, beating expectations for a 6.40% rise. The last time the annual core price index reached that level was in the first half of July 2001.
Headline consumer price inflation rose 0.42% during the first half of February, above expectations for a 0.38% increase, while annual headline inflation jumped to 7.22%, versus a forecast for 7.17%.
The jump in inflation suggests Mexico's ""central bank is struggling in its battle to contain price pressures,"" said Nikhil Sanghani, emerging markets economist at Capital Economics.
Earlier this month, Banxico, as the Bank of Mexico is known, raised its benchmark interest rate for the sixth consecutive time, citing inflation. 
Banxico targets inflation of 3% with a one percentage point tolerance range above and below that. 

""The recent surge in global commodity prices as a result of the Russia-Ukraine crisis will keep inflation high in the coming months, meaning Banxico's tightening cycle has much further to run,"" said Sanghani.
Banxico will make its next monetary policy decision on March 24, a week after the U.S. Federal Reserve is expected to raise interest rates after years of sitting near zero.

The CBI's monthly retail sales balance halved to +14 in February from +28 in January, a bigger fall than economists' forecasts in a Reuters poll for a small decline to +25.
However sales for the time of year improved sharply in February from January, with the balance rising to +16 from -23.
""The easing of COVID-19 restrictions - including the end of work-from-home guidance - has, unsurprisingly, encouraged shoppers to return to the high streets,"" CBI economist Martin Sartorius said.
January's headline sales figures had been bolstered by comparisons with a year earlier when non-essential retailers were closed due to lockdown restrictions.
""There are other challenges facing retailers, however. Conflict in Ukraine means energy prices and transport costs will rise further, adding more pressure on retailers' operating costs and biting into households' spending power,"" Sartorius said.
Quarterly CBI figures showed that retailers raised selling prices by almost as much as in late 2021, which saw the biggest price rises since 1990.

Prices are expected to rise even faster over the next three months, the CBI said. 
Previously released official data showed that British retail sales grew faster than expected in January as the impact of the Omicron wave of coronavirus cases eased. But analysts have warned of a tough year ahead as inflation rises to a 30-year high, squeezing households' disposable income.

The revision came as the statistics office raised its export growth forecast for this year, with global demand for the island's technology products buoyed by 5G, electric vehicles and high end computing.
Gross domestic product (GDP) is expected to rise 4.42% this year, the Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics said, up from 4.15% growth forecast in November.
However, that will be a slower pace than the 6.45% logged for 2021, which was the fastest rate in over a decade since it expanded 10.25% in 2010.
The directorate said the economic global impact of COVID-19 was gradually dissipating, with continued strong demand for semiconductors, the main plank of Taiwan's economy.
It foresaw exports this year rising 9.69%, from 6.14% predicted before.
The government is watching the impact of the war in Ukraine.
Deputy Minister of Economic Affairs Chen Chern-chyi said he expected the impact of the conflict on Taiwan to be ""controllable"", but that they were keeping an eye on supply chains and in close touch with companies.
Cabinet spokesman Lo Ping-cheng added that Taiwan's economic fundamentals remained good, but the government will ""extend a hand"" if there are any ""irrational"" movements in the currency and stock markets.
Taiwan's benchmark stock index closed down 2.6% on Thursday.
Taiwan's exports are a bellwether of demand for global tech giants such as Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), as the island is a major producer of semiconductors, a global shortage of which has rattled firms like auto makers and boosted Taiwanese corporate profits.
In the fourth quarter, GDP expanded by a revised 4.86% from a year earlier, slightly down from a preliminary reading of 4.88%, the agency added.
Another risk is the slowdown in the economy of China, Taiwan's top trading partner.

China's economy grew 8.1% in 2021 and 4.0% in the final quarter, faster than expected but still its weakest pace since the second quarter of 2020, off the back of weak consumption and a property downturn.
China will announce its goal for this year's economic growth next Saturday when Premier Li Keqiang opens the annual meeting of parliament in Beijing.

321,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 24, 2022 12:05AM ET</span>","Hong Kong Jan home prices at 11-month low, hit by COVID","HONG KONG (Reuters) - Hong Kong private home prices dropped for the fourth consecutive month in January to the lowest since February 2021, official data showed on Thursday, as the financial city was hit by a new wave of COVID-19 outbreak.
The prices eased 1.1% last month, according to the data, compares to a revised fall of 0.1% in December. The January monthly drop was also the biggest in eleven month. 
Hong Kong's property market is among the world's most expensive and has stayed largely resilient during the mass protests in 2019 and the pandemic over the past two years, supported by robust demand and lower interest rates. 
Its home prices reached a record high in September before consolidating.
Some property agents lowered their full-year price forecast this month as coronavirus infections surged in the Chinese-ruled city and the government rolled out some of the most stringent social restrictions in the world, affecting many businesses.
Hong Kong Property Services expected prices to fall within 5% in the first quarter, but rise 3-5% for the full year on a rebound after the pandemic stabilizes. 
""In the last four waves of outbreak, prices all recovered afterward,"" Dave Ma, Hong Kong Property Services chief operations officer, said. ""Compared to the first outbreak, sellers are not slashing prices as much now and the transaction volumes are higher because people are looking for bargains.""
He said some sellers offloaded property below market price because their business was seriously affected by the pandemic.
Property developers are delaying their new launches, resulting in a plunge in new home transactions. For the secondary market, realtor Centaline expected deal number in February to drop 18% from January to a 24-month low.
Seen as a boost to the property market, the government announced a relaxed rule to allow first-time buyers to borrow 80% mortgage for homes transacted HK$12 million ($1.54 million) and below, compared to HK$10 million previously, while 90% for HK$10 million and below, compared to HK$8 million previously.

For transactions more expensive than HK$12 million, which is the mid- and large-sized home market, buyers can only borrow up to 50%.

BENGALURU - Strong demand is likely to make Dubai house prices rise more sharply this year than previously thought, although plentiful supply is likely to ensure the city state stays a buyer's market for a few more years, a Reuters survey found.
    The Gulf region's trade and tourism hub and host of World Expo, Dubai has experienced a boom in property deals. The sale values of real estate transactions until November last year were the highest yearly sales figures since 2014, Dubai Land Department data shows.
    A Reuters survey of 12 analysts taken Feb. 9-23 found expectations of continued strength, with Dubai housing prices forecast to rise at a faster pace than predicted three months ago. 
It found average home prices were expected to climb 7.5% this year and 5.5% next, compared to 5.0% each in the November survey.
    ""While improvements in the overall economy, along with the continued arrival of new residents, look set to support modest rises in residential sales prices and rents, a strong supply pipeline will likely limit the extent of market-wide uplifts,"" Chris Hobden at Chestertons MENA said.
    According to most analysts who answered an extra question, the Dubai property market will remain a buyer's market for at least the next couple of years. This is in sharp contrast to most residential markets around the world experiencing runaway price rises, particularly during the pandemic. 
    ""There is still a large (amount) of supply that is likely to be completed across Dubai in the next two to three years. This is likely to favour buyers going forward,"" said Swapnil Pillai at Savills.
    An oversupply of homes saddled the real estate sector for several years and will keep Dubai affordable for a while yet. On an affordability scale of 1 to 10 where 1 is extremely cheap and 10 is extremely expensive, analysts returned a median of 5.
    ""Given that Dubai continues to be a buyer's market, developers will refrain from increasing prices substantially. Therefore, affordability may continue for some years,"" said Anuj Puri, chairman at ANAROCK Property Consultants.
    When asked what will happen to affordability over the next two-to-three years, there was a split between all 12 analysts. While six said it would improve, six expected it to worsen, indicating uncertainty around market direction.
    For now increasing demand, especially from foreign investors, high immigration, and a sharp upturn in the economy will be the most significant upside risks, according to respondents to an extra question.

    However, they also cited downside risks including higher interest rates, a depleting stock of affordable homes, and an economic slowdown because of political instability in the region and around the globe.

SYDNEY (Reuters) -Australian business investment bounced modestly last quarter as demand recovered from pandemic lockdowns and miners benefited from high resource prices, while future spending plans were again marked higher. 
Figures from the Australian Bureau of Statistics on Thursday showed capital expenditure rose a real 1.1% in the December quarter to A$33.3 billion ($24.03 billion), though that missed market forecasts of a 2.6% increase.
Investment by miners climbed 2.5%, while other sectors lagged with a 0.5% increase. 
Spending plans for the year to end-June 2022 were upgraded to A$144.8 billion, at the higher end of analysts' estimates and a sign business confidence weathered the disruptions well.
The early estimate for 2022/23 came in at A$116.7 billion, which was 11% higher than the first estimate for 2021/22.
The miss on fourth-quarter spending will shave some forecasts for gross domestic product (GDP), data for which is due next week.
Yet growth still looks to have rebounded strongly as an easing in coronavirus lockdowns unleashed a wave of pent-up spending by households, which typically account for around 51% of GDP.
A new data series from the ABS released this week showed nominal household spending surged a huge 22% in the fourth quarter, compared to the badly hit third quarter.
Even accounting for a 1.3% jump in consumer prices, that implies real household spending may have boomed by around 10% and dwarfed any drag from other sectors.
Analysts are generally tipping GDP growth of around 2.5% for the fourth quarter, more than making up for the third quarter's 1.9% decline.
More recently, the spread of the Omicron variant did curb spending in January but consumers seem back on track now that cases have tailed off. 

The latest data from ANZ showed spending on its cards by households and businesses had recovered quickly in February. Just last week, spending on dining and takeaway was up 9% on a year ago, non-food retailing 10%, and travel 38%.

(Reuters) - Small businesses continue to struggle financially and many are facing greater challenges with managing supply chain challenges and hiring enough workers, according to a survey released Tuesday by the Federal Reserve. 
While some small businesses have seen their revenues increase, the recovery has been uneven, with smaller firms and those owned by racial minorities seeing fewer gains, the report showed. 
""Many small businesses have not recovered to prepandemic levels, with the effects of the pandemic hitting disproportionately hard among firms in the leisure and hospitality sector, smaller firms, and firms owned by people of color,"" Fed researchers said in a statement.
The survey, which was conducted between September and November of 2021, found that 63% of firms still had revenues below pre-pandemic levels, and 43% of businesses had lower employment. The Fed polled nearly 11,000 small employers across the country that have less than 500 workers. 
Businesses are having a hard time finding enough workers and resolving supply-chain issues, the survey found, with 60% of firms naming hiring issues and 60% listing supply-chain issues as a top operational challenge faced over the past 12 months.
The report, done in collaboration with the 12 regional Fed banks, found that many small businesses are still in rough financial shape because of the pandemic. 

More than half, or 59%, of firms surveyed said they were in ""fair"" or ""poor"" financial shape, nearly unchanged from 57% a year earlier, according to the report. 
Those outcomes continued to vary by race. Some 55% of white-owned businesses described their financial condition as ""fair"" or ""poor."" But that rose to 81% of Asian-owned businesses, to 76% for Black-owned firms and to 74% for Hispanic-owned businesses, similar to last year.

SYDNEY (Reuters) -Australian wages picked up last quarter as a rapidly tightening labour market drove intense competition for workers, but annual growth was still short of levels that policy makers say would justify a rise in interest rates.
Figures from the Australian Bureau of Statistics out on Wednesday showed its wage price index (WPI) rose 0.7% in the December quarter, matching forecasts and the largest increase since late 2013.
The annual rate picked up to 2.3%, but missed forecasts of 2.4% which caused a dip in the local dollar. The private sector saw growth of 2.4%, while the public payroll lagged at 2.1%.
Wage growth was still only back to where it was in mid-2019 and short of the 3%-plus levels the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) argues is needed to keep inflation at target.
It is also below consumer price inflation of 3.5%, meaning real pay is going backwards.
Of the 18 industries the ABS covers on wages the only one to clear 3% last quarter was accommodation and food, reflecting the lack of migrant labour with the borders closed.
National pay claims have not topped 3% since early 2013 and there is a lot of structural inertia in the pay award system, a major reason the RBA believes it can keep policy super-loose until later in the year.
Financial markets are not so sure and have long been pricing in a hike in the 0.1% cash rate by June, with rates reaching 1.25% by year end.
The labour market is clearly tightening with unemployment having fallen sharply to a 13-year low of 4.2% and expected to drop further given vacancies are at record highs.
Cost pressures from supply bottlenecks and high global commodity prices are also percolating through the economy.
Australia's second largest grocery chain  Coles Group  (OTC:CLEGF) Ltd on Tuesday warned inflation had broadened last quarter and would last through the first half of the year.
The RBA itself recently signalled a switch away from focussing just on wages to a range of measures to gauge price pressures, including unit labour costs, job switching, bonuses and industry liaison.

""Anecdotally, wage growth is ""everywhere but in the data"","" noted Catherine Birch, a senior economist at ANZ. ""But given the shift in the balance of power towards employees, and the overseas experience, we think the wage growth will hit 3% by the second quarter and 3.5% by year end.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. consumer confidence fell to a five-month low month in February, with fewer consumers planning to purchase homes, automobiles and go on vacation over the next six months amid concerns about the short-term economic outlook.
The survey from the Conference Board on Tuesday also showed consumers' inflation expectations rising after moderating for two straight months. But with the labor market rapidly churning out jobs and COVID-19 cases subsiding, the second straight monthly decline in confidence and drop in buying intentions likely do not signal a major slowdown in consumer spending. 
Retail sales surged in January even as confidence ebbed. Consumers accumulated more than $2 trillion in excess savings during the pandemic, which should help to underpin spending.
""Though inflation is high and a major concern for consumers, it hasn't historically restricted spending,"" said Robert Frick, corporate economist at Navy Federal Credit Union in Vienna, Virginia. ""With the Omicron wave quickly subsiding and many states and cities lifting restrictions, we should expect spending, especially on services, to accelerate.""
The Conference Board said its consumer confidence index dipped to a reading of 110.5 this month, the lowest since last September, from 111.1 in January. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the index decreasing to 110.0. 
The index remains above its pandemic lows. Unlike the University of Michigan's consumer sentiment index, which fell to a decade low in mid-February, the Conference Board survey puts more emphasis on the labor market. 
The survey's measure of current conditions improved, likely because of declining coronavirus infections that were driven by the Omicron variant. Its gauge of expectations for growth in the short term fell to a five-month low, suggesting a cooling in growth in the first half of the year. 
But the slowdown will probably be modest, with business activity regaining speed in February as the drag from the Omicron surge diminished.
In a separate, data firm IHS Markit said its flash U.S. Composite PMI Output Index, which tracks the manufacturing and services sectors, rebounded to a reading of 56.0 this month from 51.1 in January. It attributed the sharp rise to ""employees returning from sick leave, increased traveling and greater availability of raw materials.""
Stocks on Wall Street fell amid escalating Russia-Ukraine tensions. The dollar slipped against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury yields rose. 
TIGHT LABOR MARKET
The Conference Board's so-called labor market differential, derived from data on respondents' views on whether jobs are plentiful or hard to get, fell to a still-high reading of 42.0 this month from 43.0 in January. This measure correlates to the unemployment rate from the Labor Department. There were 10.9 million jobs openings at the end of December. 
Consumers' inflation expectations over the next 12 months increased to 7.0% from 6.8% last month. With inflation expectations rising, fewer consumers planned to buy cars and other big-ticket items over the next six months. Consumers were also not keen on vacations, with the share planning to go on holiday over the same period the smallest since June 2021.
Plans to buy a house also fell, likely reflecting rising mortgage rates, which combined with soaring prices are making home purchasing unaffordable, especially for first-time buyers.
Record low housing supply is driving up prices. The backlog of homes approved for construction but yet to be started is at an all-time high as builders struggle with shortages and higher prices for inputs like softwood lumber for framing, as well as cabinets, garage doors, countertops and appliances.
There is a migration from metro areas with expensive homes to areas in the Mountain West and South regions, where houses are relatively more affordable. The migration, fueled by both remote work and strong regional economies, is driving up house prices, analysts and realtors say.
A third report showed the S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller's 20 metropolitan area home price index rose 18.6% on a year-on-year basis in December after advancing 18.3% in November. 
The increase was led by Phoenix, where prices shot up 32.5% over the past year. Prices surged 29.4% in Tampa and accelerated 27.3% in Miami. Both are experiencing rapid growth in technology and financial sectors. There was also strong price appreciation in San Diego, Las Vegas, Denver and Los Angeles. 
""The influx of new investment is pulling in new residents from the Northeast, many of whom have sold homes at prices well above the median in Tampa and Miami, which allows them to bid aggressively for the paucity of homes that are on the market,"" said Mark Vitner, a senior economist at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) in Charlotte, North Carolina.
Strong house price inflation was reinforced by a fourth report from the Federal Housing Finance Agency showing home prices increased 17.6% in the 12 months through December after a similar gain in November. There were big gains in the Mountain, Pacific, South Atlantic, East South Central, West South Central and New England regions.

Though mortgage rates are near three-year highs, they are expected to remain low by historical standards.
""Consequently, house prices will extend their upward trend in 2022 driven by a combination of limited supply and steadily rising demand,"" said Brent Campbell, an economist at Moody's (NYSE:MCO) Analytics, in West Chester, Pennsylvania.

Data firm IHS Markit said on Tuesday its flash U.S. Composite PMI Output Index, which tracks the manufacturing and services sectors, rebounded to a reading of 56.0 this month from 51.1 in January. It attributed the sharp rise to ""employees returning from sick leave, increased traveling and greater availability of raw materials.""
A reading above 50 indicates growth in the private sector.
The acceleration in business activity in the survey mirrors the recent improvement in the so-called hard data. 
Initial claims for state unemployment benefits have declined from a three-month high of 290,000 in mid-January and retail sales shot up in January.
The United States is reporting an average of 121,134 new coronavirus cases a day, sharply down from more than 700,000 in January, according to a Reuters analysis of official data. The Omicron variant of the coronavirus is driving infections.
The flash composite orders index climbed to 57.5 from 55.2 in January, with customers making additional purchases to avoid future price hikes. Consumer prices notched their largest annual increase in 40 years in January.
The survey's measure of input prices paid by businesses rebounded from January's ten-month low. 
The pick up in activity this month was across the board. The IHS Markit survey's flash services sector PMI rose to a reading of 56.7 from 51.2 in January. 
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast a reading of 53.0 this month for the services sector, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity.
Services industry businesses reported increases in orders and employment. They continued to face higher prices for inputs. 

Activity also regained momentum in the manufacturing sector, with strong order growth and rising employment. The survey's flash manufacturing PMI climbed to 57.5 from 55.5 in January. Economists had forecast the index for the sector, which accounts for 11.9% of the economy, rising to 56.0. 
Manufacturers also reported some easing in the cost of inputs, though prices still remained very high.

The Confederation of British Industry (CBI) said a net balance of +77% of manufacturers surveyed this month planned to raise prices, up from +66% in January - the highest reading since December 1976, a year of financial crisis in Britain.
The survey also showed a net balance of +20% of factories reporting rising orders, down from +24% in January. While this was the weakest reading for four months, it was still well above the survey's long-run average.
""Manufacturers will be buoyed by strong order books and output growth, but amid ongoing cost pressures, almost four in five firms expect to increase prices in the next three months,"" said CBI deputy chief economist Anna Leach.
She urged finance minister Rishi Sunak to use his spring budget statement, due next month, to do more to help manufacturers. 

The official annual rate of consumer price inflation rose to 5.5% in January, the highest since March 1992.
The Bank of England this month predicted that inflation will peak at around 7.25% in April, when household energy bills are due to rise by more than half.

The Ifo institute said its business climate index rose to 98.9 from an upwardly revised 96.0 in January, the highest level since August last year. A Reuters poll of analysts had pointed to a February reading of 96.5.
""The results of the February Ifo survey are a clear sign that the German economy will benefit massively from the easing of the coronavirus crisis in the coming months,"" said Joerg Kraemer, chief economist at Commerzbank (DE:CBKG).
At the same time, a possible escalation of the situation in Eastern Europe hangs over Europe's largest economy ""like the Sword of Damocles,"" experts said.
""While such a strong reading would normally spread optimism, last night's Russia-Ukraine developments have probably made this prominent leading indicator rather backward-looking,"" ING economist Carsten Brzeski said.

""The uncertainty will increase massively,"" Ifo expert Klaus Wohlrabe told Reuters, adding the biggest risk for German companies comes from rising energy prices. ""That would be poison for the recovery,"" Wohlrabe said.

LONDON (Reuters) -The euro zone economic recovery regained momentum this month as an easing of coronavirus restrictions gave a boost to the bloc's dominant service industry, a survey showed, but consumers faced prices rising at a record rate.
As the Omicron coronavirus variant swept across Europe some governments reimposed measures to contain its spread, but with large swathes of the population now vaccinated many of those measures have been eased. 
IHS Markit's Flash Composite Purchasing Managers' Index, seen as guide to overall economic health, jumped to a five-month high of 55.8 in February from 52.3 in January, significantly above the median 52.7 forecast in a Reuters poll.
""The surge in the euro zone flash Composite PMI for February suggests activity is recovering well from the pandemic-related weakness over the winter,"" said Andrew Kenningham at Capital Economics.
""Having regained its pre-pandemic level in Q4 2021, the euro zone economy is likely to expand at a reasonable pace in the first quarter of this year and should accelerate in the next two quarters as tourism, travel and hospitality get back to normal.""
A flash PMI for the service industry soared to 55.8 from 51.1, a five-month high and above all forecasts in a Reuters poll that had predicted only a modest rise to 52.0. Anything above 50 indicates growth.
Improving demand for services pushed business activity across Germany's private sector to a six-month high, while in France growth was stronger than expected, helped by an improvement in the COVID-19 situation.
In Britain, outside the common currency bloc and the European Union, the private sector picked up at the fastest pace since June 2021, as spending on travel, leisure and entertainment rose after an easing of coronavirus cases.
Factories had another solid month and the flash euro zone manufacturing PMI only dipped from January's 58.7 - where the Reuters poll predicted it would hold - coming in at 58.4. An index measuring output, which feeds into the composite PMI nudged up to 55.6 from 55.4.
Activity could have been faster but lingering supply chain bottlenecks and booming demand meant factories were unable to keep up, and the backlogs of work index rose to 58.7 from 56.9.
With the economy reopening, and amid hopes the worst of the pandemic is over, optimism improved across the board. The services business expectations index climbed to 68.7 from 67.2.
""The forward-looking indicators were also encouraging as year-ahead sentiment rose in February to its strongest since June 2021,"" said Ricardo Amaro at Oxford Economics.
""The weak start to the year means euro zone GDP growth is likely to remain modest in Q1, but today's PMI results chime with our forecast that solid growth will resume in Q2.""
The economic rebound came despite overall prices charged by firms rising at the fastest rate since IHS Markit began collecting the data in late 2002. The composite output prices index climbed to 62.7 from 61.9.
Inflation in the euro zone hit a record high in January and the European Central Bank is under growing pressure to tighten monetary policy. A Reuters poll last week suggested the Bank would raise its deposit rate in the second half of this year, and not wait until 2023 as previously expected. [ECILT/EU]

""The PMI suggests the winter economic dip could be much milder than expected, labour market pressures continue to build and second-round effects are resulting in more broad-based price pressures at the moment,"" said Bert Colijn at ING. 
""Expect this to add to hawkish pressures ahead of the European Central Bank March meeting.""

339,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 21, 2022 07:35AM ET</span>","German producer prices soar as Bundesbank, BDI warn on economy","BERLIN (Reuters) -German producer prices rose in January at their fastest rate since modern records began, soaring 25% and extending a run of sharp increases likely to keep businesses under financial stress and consumer inflation high.
Monday's Federal Statistics Office showed most of the rise was due to spiralling energy costs, which the BDI industry association said were threatening to hamper an economy that the country's central bank said was probably shrinking due to increased coronavirus-induced worker absences. 
The jump in factory gate costs, considered a leading indicator for consumer prices, was the biggest since 1949, when West and East Germany were founded and the country's post-war economic data series began.
Analysts polled by Reuters had expected a repeat of December's figure of 24.2%. Sharp (OTC:SHCAY) increases of 18.4% and 19.2% were logged in October and November, respectively.
That succession of jumps in the PPI measure, taken before products are processed further or go on sale, suggests ""the pressure in the inflation pipeline remains high,"" said Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) economist Ralph Solveen. 
""We expect the (consumer) inflation rate in Germany to hover around 5% percent into the autumn,"" he added, one percentage point more than the Ifo economic institute's average forecast for 2022. 
LBBW analyst Jens-Oliver Niklasch agreed that ""it's likely that retailers will pass on at least some of this (PPI pressure) on to end consumers"".
Separately, the Bundesbank warned of parallel pressures on economic activity from COVID-19, saying a new wave of infections that were stopping many from going to work would probably cause gross domestic product to shrink for the second quarter in a row between January and March.
""Unlike in previous waves ...it is not just activity in the services sector that is likely affected by containment measures and behavioural changes,"" Germany's central bank wrote in a monthly report, while forecasting a rebound in the spring.
""Instead, pandemic-related absence from work is likely to dampen economic activity markedly also in other sectors.""
ECB DILEMMA
The economic pattern in the euro zone's biggest economy is being replicated elsewhere in the single currency bloc, complicating the European Central Bank's task of engineering a smooth transition back towards its consumer inflation target of 2% at a time of high but volatile price pressures and headwinds to growth.
The ECB this month opened the door for the first time to an interest rate hike in 2022 and is set to decide in March how quickly to wind down the bond-buying scheme at the heart of its monetary stimulus programme.
It has argued that longer-term inflation trends remain skewed upward by transitory factors, especially energy costs, which the statistics office said rose 66.7% year-on-year in Germany in January.
The BDI said on Monday that those costs, which show no sign of abating, were threatening to cripple the economy and called for government action to ensure German companies remained globally competitive.

In a survey of more than 400 companies, nearly two-thirds said rising energy costs were posing a strong challenge, while nearly a quarter said they threatened their existence, it said.
Stripping out energy costs, German producer prices rose 12% in January.

340,By Bloomberg,"<span>Feb 21, 2022 04:54AM ET</span>",U.K. Services Roar Back With Strongest Growth in 8 Months,"(Bloomberg) --
U.K. services companies rebounded more quickly than anticipated in February as coronavirus restrictions were lifted, according to a report that will pile pressure on the Bank of England to ramp up interest rates next month.
The travel, leisure and entertainment industries roared back to life after spending was hit by the omicron outbreak in January, the survey of purchasing managers by IHS Markit showed. An index of services-sector activity soared by 6.7 percentage points to 60.8, the highest for eight months and well above the 55.5 median forecast in a Bloomberg survey.
The resurgence was accompanied by intensifying inflation pressures, with costs rising at the second-fastest pace on record and services firms hiking prices in response. Traders are fully pricing in a 25 basis-point interest-rate increase when the BOE next meets in March, with the strong possibility of a 50 basis-point move, a scale unprecedented since the BOE gained independence in 1997.
“The odds of an increasingly aggressive policy tightening have shortened, with a third back-to-back rate rise looking increasingly inevitable in March,” said Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit.
With headline inflation at a 30-year high and forecast to top 7% in April, more than triple the BOE target, policy makers are expected to deliver a series of rate rises that will see benchmark borrowing costs hit almost 2% by the end of the year. Markets are pricing in a half-point increase at one of the next two meetings.
The performance of the services industry is crucial because it makes up around 80% of the U.K. economy. The manufacturing sector had a less spectacular month, with an index of activity remaining at 57.3. That still implies a healthy rate of expansion, and the reading was slightly stronger than economists forecast.
Williamson said questions remain about whether the economy can sustain the revival, with the cost of living crisis escalating and the risk of conflict between Russia and Ukraine hanging over the economy and markets. “Downside risks to the demand outlook have risen,” he said.

Taiwan's export orders, a bellwether of global technology demand, rose 11.7% from a year earlier to $58.87 billion last month, data from the Ministry of Economic Affairs showed on Monday, though that was the slowest growth rate in 15 months.
It marked the 23rd straight month of expansion, with the pace largely tracking the median forecast for a rise of 12.0% in a Reuters poll.
Orders for telecommunications products rose 3.9% on year and up 13.5% for electronic products in January, normally the start of the low season with Christmas out of the way, with the ministry reporting good demand and easing supply chain problems.
Growth has been supported by the work-from-home-trend during the pandemic as well as a global semiconductor shortage.
However, while the ministry said demand would continue to be supported by tech, especially ""ardent"" demand for chips, it warned supply chain issues were still present along with COVID-19 worries.
Taiwanese companies such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd (TSMC) are major suppliers to Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) Inc and other global tech firms.
In December, export orders rose 12.1% from a year earlier to $67.9 billion, far better than economist forecasts.
The ministry said it expects an increase in export orders in February to be in a range of between 5.6% and 9.2% from a year earlier. The first week of the month was marked by the Lunar New Year holiday in Taiwan and its largest trading partner China.

Orders from the United States rose 18.6% in January from a year earlier, a faster rate of expansion compared with the 16.9% logged in December, while orders from China increased 8.9%, versus a gain of 4.5% the previous month.

The index moved further above the 50 points threshold which marks an expansion in activity.

The composite February PMI number for France - which includes both the manufacturing and services sectors - rose to 57.4 points from 52.7 in January, beating a forecast for 53.1 points.
French economic activity has been helped by an improvement in the country's COVID-19 situation, which in turn has led to COVID restrictions gradually being eased.
Earlier this month, France eased some restrictions on travellers coming into the country who hold a COVID vaccine certificate, which could help tourism in France.

""The slump in January proved to be short-lived as business activity growth accelerated sharply in February to its strongest since last June,"" said IHS Markit senior economist Joe Hayes.
""Now that the trajectory of COVID-19 in France is on the downturn, this should continue to facilitate greater activity levels across both sectors,"" added Hayes.

IHS Markit's flash services Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) rose to 56.6 in February, up from 52.2 last month and the highest reading since August.
As a result, the composite PMI, which tracks the manufacturing and services sectors that together account for more than two-thirds of the German economy, also rose to a six-month high of 56.2, from 53.8 in January.
On the other hand, the flash manufacturing PMI dropped to 58.5 from 59.8, below analyst forecasts for a reading of 59.5, as staff absences due to COVID-19 infections offset strong order growth and easing supply chain bottlenecks.
The results showcased the resilience of the German economy, whose recovery from the pandemic was held back last year by supply shortages and fears that the Omicron variant could result in crippling lockdowns.
""The German economy continued to regain momentum in February following December's brief stagnation in output growth,"" said Phil Smith, Economics Associate Director at IHS Markit, adding there were also positive signs from the manufacturing sector.

""Although goods production rose at a softer pace, data on new orders showed the fastest rise in six months. Moreover, supply chain pressures appeared to ease further as average lead times lengthened to the least extent since Nov. 2020,"" he said.

BANGKOK (Reuters) -Thailand's economy returned to growth in the fourth quarter, expanding faster than expected, but the 2021 pace was one of the slowest in Southeast Asia and the recovery this year is likely to be modest as tourism remains well below pre-pandemic levels.
The government maintained its gross domestic product (GDP) growth outlook at 3.5%-4.5%, counting on a limited impact from the Omicron-driven coronavirus outbreak, stronger domestic demand and tourism and continued support from exports and public investment. 
Southeast Asia's second-largest economy expanded a seasonally adjusted 1.8% in the December quarter from the previous three months, data from the National Economic and Social Development Council showed on Monday, outstripping a forecast 1.4% increase in a Reuters poll, and after a revised seasonally adjusted 0.9% contraction in the third quarter.
The state planning agency expected 5.5 million tourists in 2022, up from a forecast of 5 million in November, after the government resumed a quarantine waiver for overseas visitors this month to help revive the vital sector, which normally accounts for about 12% of Thai GDP.. 
However, those numbers are still well below 40 million foreign tourist arrivals in 2019.
Analysts at Capital Economics expect the overall economic recovery over 2022 is likely to be weak, and would largely depend on how quickly tourists return.
""While we expect a sustained recovery in the tourism sector to get underway this year, arrivals will still be far fewer than pre-pandemic, meaning the overall economic recovery will remain weak,"" they wrote in a note to clients.
FISCAL, TOURISM SUPPORT
From a year earlier, GDP grew 1.9% in October-December, beating a forecast 0.7% rise, and against a revised 0.2% contraction in the previous three months.
For 2021, however, Thailand's GDP growth of 1.6% was one of the slowest in Southeast Asia, after a revised 6.2% contraction in 2020.
Fourth-quarter growth was helped by robust exports and a recovery in domestic activity following an easing of coronavirus curbs and as borders reopened to foreign visitors.
The economy is likely to perform well in the first quarter of this year, but there is some inflationary pressure, NESDC chief Danucha Pichayanan told a news conference.
""The main driver will be exports and fiscal disbursement, with tourism and domestic consumption adding to the support,"" he said.
The agency maintained its forecast export growth at 4.9% this year.

The government has introduced billions of dollars of relief measures to revive the economy while the central bank has left its key rate unchanged at a record low of 0.50% since May 2020.

349,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 21, 2022 12:10AM ET</span>",China's new home prices perk up as big city demand returns,"BEIJING (Reuters) - China's new home prices rose for the first time since September on a monthly basis, official data for January showed on Monday, as efforts to soften the blow from tough regulatory curbs on property supported buyer sentiment, particularly in big cities.
Average new home prices in China's 70 major cities climbed 0.1% from a month earlier in January, compared with a 0.2% drop in December, according to Reuters calculations from data released by the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS).
China's property market, accounting for a quarter of gross domestic product by some metrics, has slowed due to Beijing's push to cut leverage in the sector amid defaults at heavily-indebted players such as China Evergrande Group.
To ease the pain for developers, authorities have taken a slew of measures since late 2021, including giving real estate firms easier access to funds from escrowed accounts.
""The marginal improvement in the financial and credit environment since the fourth quarter of last year helped the value of transactions to bottom out,"" said Xu Xiaole, analyst at Beike Research Institute. 
Credit conditions are expected to continue to ease, which would help lift transactions and stabilise home prices, Xu said.
Household loans, mostly mortgages, surged to 843 billion yuan ($133 billion) in January, more than doubling from 371.6 billion yuan in December, according to central bank data earlier this month.
Overall new bank lending more than tripled in January from the previous month. Chinese lenders tend to front-load loans at the start of the year to get higher-quality customers and win market share.
BIG CITY GAINS
The number of cities reporting price gains rose to 28 from 15 in December, driven mainly by the larger tier-one and tier-two cities.
Average prices of new housing in the country's four largest cities - Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou and Shenzhen - swung from a month-on-month decrease of 0.1% in December to an increase of 0.6% in January, the NBS said in a separate statement.
The biggest swing was seen in Guangzhou, where prices rose 0.5% from a 0.6% decline.
Beijing, Shanghai and Shenzhen increased 1.0%, 0.6% and 0.5%, respectively.
""The rise in tier-one cities has less to do with seasonal factors and more due to purchasing power amid (easing) credit policies in place,"" said Yan Yuejin, research director of Shanghai-based E-house China Research and Development Institution.
Last month, developers in Shenzhen and Beijing took some measures to boost sales, offering buyers a 1% discount for cash payments.
""Prices in tier-one cities will definitely continue to rise,"" Yan said.
Though easing measures are helping, new home prices rose at the slowest pace of 2.3% since December 2015 from a year earlier, narrowing from the 2.6% growth recorded in December. 
The central government, while keeping curbs on speculative purchases and blind borrowing, is expected to roll out more measures to support buyer sentiment, which has sharply weakened due to the liquidity crisis faced by developers.
A handful of cities not constrained by regulatory restrictions on purchases are starting to relax downpayment rules for home purchases in a bid to stoke buyer interest.
""The market is expected to gradually stabilise in March or April,"" said Zhang Dawei, chief analyst with property agency Centaline. 

""First- and second-tier cities will be the first to come out of the downturn.""

350,By Bloomberg,"<span>Feb 20, 2022 09:18PM ET</span>",China Home Prices Barely Fall in Glimmer of Hope for Developers,"(Bloomberg) -- China’s home price declines eased for a second month in January, offering a rare sign of hope to the embattled property sector. 
New home prices in 70 cities, excluding state-subsidized housing, fell 0.04% last month from December, when they dropped 0.28%, National Bureau of Statistics figures showed Monday. Values in the secondary market declined 0.28%, down for a sixth month.
Sentiment in China’s home market has been dented by a worsening liquidity crisis among real estate developers following a regulatory clampdown on excessive leverage. Zhenro Properties Group Ltd. late Friday become the latest developer to warn it may not meet its obligations, another negative surprise only weeks after it announced plans to redeem a perpetual bond. 
“Homebuyers are still in a heavy wait-and-see mode after price cuts in December extended to the New Year,” said Chen Wenjing, associate research director at China Index Holdings. “Many cities will likely remain lackluster this month.”
Chinese authorities have been racing to arrest the property slowdown, which has been hurting growth in the world’s second-largest economy. Banks in several Chinese cities have cut mortgage down payments for some homebuyers, according to local media, in a move that may boost flagging housing demand.
Still, the outlook remains bleak. Yu Liang, chairman of China Vanke Co., one of the country’s largest developers, urged staff to prepare for a battle that could make or break the firm, the South China Morning Post reported last week. Global credit rating firms are withdrawing their assessments on property bonds, while a string of auditor resignations is adding to doubts over financial transparency weeks before earnings season.

Activity in the services sector shrank at the fastest rate since May 2020 as demand weakened after the country saw coronavirus infections spike to a record due to the Omicron variant.
The au Jibun Bank Flash Japan Manufacturing PurchasingManagers' Index (PMI) fell to a seasonally adjusted 52.9 from a final 55.4 in the previous month. A reading below 50 indicates contraction from the previous month, above 50 expansion.
""Manufacturers signalled a reduction in output for the first time in five months, though the rate of contraction was considerably softer than that seen in the dominant services sector,"" said Usamah Bhatti, economist at IHS Markit, which compiles the survey.
The survey showed a marked lengthening of delivery times exacerbated material shortages, causing input prices to rise at the fastest rate since August 2008.
""Firms continued to report that rising input prices and material shortages, notably in fuel and metals continued to dampen private sector activity,"" Bhatti said.
Manufacturers saw stockpiles of raw materials and other inputs rise at the sharpest pace since the start of the survey in October 2001.
Both manufacturers and service-sector firms became lessoptimistic about business conditions in the 12 months ahead, the survey showed.

WASHINGTON(Reuters) - U.S. home sales unexpectedly increased in January, but investors paying in cash are squeezing out first-time buyers from the housing market amid record low inventory and higher prices.
The surge in sales of previously owned homes last month reported by the National Association of Realtors on Friday also reflected buyers rushing in to close contracts in anticipation of mortgage rates rising further. Investors made up the largest share of transactions in six years last month. 
Mortgage rates have climbed to levels not seen since 2019 as the Federal Reserve is expected to start increasing interest rates next month to tame soaring inflation. Economists are anticipating as many as seven rate hikes this year.
""This is the rush to get in before borrowing costs move higher,"" said Jennifer Lee, a senior economist at BMO Capital Markets in Toronto. ""Unfortunately, first-timers are being priced out of the increasingly expensive purchase.""
Existing home sales jumped 6.7% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 6.50 million units last month. Sales rose in all four regions, with strong gains in the Midwest, the most affordable region. Sales soared 9.3% in the densely populated South, which is experiencing an influx of residents from other regions as companies embrace remote work.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast sales decreasing 1.0% to a rate of 6.10 million units. 
Home resales, which account for the bulk of U.S. home sales, fell 2.3% on a year-on-year basis. 
Strong demand for housing against the backdrop of a strengthening labor market and massive savings is outstripping supply, curbing sales. Builders have been unable to significantly ramp up construction because of shortages and higher prices for inputs like softwood lumber for framing as well as cabinets, garage doors, countertops and appliances.
According to a report this week from the National Association of homebuilders, delivery of these products was taking ""months,"" raising construction costs and delaying projects. The Commerce Department reported on Thursday that the backlog of homes approved for construction but yet to be started raced to a record in January.
Stocks on Wall Street were trading lower amid building tensions in Ukraine. The dollar rose against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices were higher.
HOUSING SHORTAGE
Tight supply is keeping house prices elevated. The median existing house price increased 15.4% from a year earlier to $350,300 in January. Sales remained concentrated in the higher price brackets, where houses are less scarce. 
Sales of homes $250,000 and below, the much sought after price category, continued to decline. 
First-time buyers accounted for 27% of sales last month, compared to 33% a year ago. Rising mortgage rates could make home buying even less affordable for this group.
Individual investors or second-home buyers, who make up many cash sales, bought 22% of homes. That was the largest share since October 2015 and was up from 15% a year ago. Investors are renovating, and either reselling or renting the homes to take advantage of the hot housing market. All-cash sales made up 27% of transactions compared to 19% last January.
There were a record-low 860,000 previously owned homes on the market last month, down 16.5% from a year ago. At January's sales pace, it would take an all-time low 1.6 months to exhaust the current inventory, down from 1.9 months a year ago.
A six-to-seven-month supply is viewed as a healthy balance between supply and demand. In January, houses typically remained on the market for 19 days, down from 21 days a year ago.
Seventy-nine percent of homes sold last month were on the market for less than a month. 

The 30-year fixed-rate mortgage averaged 3.92% in the week ending Feb 17, the highest since May 2019, according to data from mortgage finance agency  Freddie Mac  (OTC:FMCC). That was up from 3.69% in the prior week. Economists expect rising mortgage rates will contribute to slowing sales this year. 
""Resilient demand and strong income gains will underpin the housing market, but limited supply and declining affordability from both higher prices and sharply higher mortgage rates will constrain the pace of sales,"" said Nancy Vanden Houten, lead U.S. economist at Oxford Economics in New York.

OTTAWA (Reuters) - Canadian retail sales most likely rose 2.4% in January from December, preliminary data from Statistics Canada showed on Friday, following on a 1.8% decline in December as consumers stayed home amid concerns over the Omicron coronavirus variant.
Retail sales totaled C$57.05 billion ($44.91 billion) in December, down from C$58.06 billion in November. For full year 2021, retail sales came in at C$674 billion, an all-time record, Statscan said. 
In December, sales were down in eight of 11 subsectors, representing 41.7% of retail trade. The clothing and accessories, and furniture and home furnishings subsectors, led the declines.
""However, there was good news from the advance data for January which points to a rebound,"" Andrew Grantham, senior economist at CIBC Capital Markets, said in a note.
""That will provide an offset to other areas of the services sector within monthly GDP, which will have seen sharp declines during the month due to enhanced restrictions."" 
Statscan said about 15% of retailers reported continued impacts in December from floods in British Columbia, which shut roads and rail access to Canada's largest port in Vancouver. In volume terms, retail sales were down 2.5% in December.

The flash estimate for January was based on responses from 50.6% of companies surveyed, Statscan said. The average response rate is 90.0%. 
The Canadian dollar was trading nearly unchanged at 1.2706 to the greenback, or 78.70 U.S. cents.

LONDON (Reuters) - British shoppers began to return to stores last month after many stayed away during a wave of COVID-19 cases that peaked at the turn of the year, although fast-rising inflation is curbing their spending power.
Retail sales volumes rose by 1.9% in January after a 4.0% decline in December, the Office for National Statistics said, the largest rise since lockdown rules for non-essential stores in England were relaxed in April 2021.
The monthly increase was greater than the average 1.0% gain forecast in a Reuters poll, although December's drop in sales was slightly bigger than first estimated.
Britain's wider economy shrank by 0.2% in December, according to an initial estimate last week.
""The solid rise in retail sales volumes in January adds to the signs that the Omicron-induced hit to activity was smaller and shorter-lived than previously thought. Even so, the cost of living crisis means the outlook for retailers is anything but bright,"" said Adam Hoyes, economist at Capital Economics.
Households face rapidly surging consumer price inflation, which hit its highest in nearly 30 years in January at 5.5%, and is forecast by the Bank of England to peak above 7% in April.
A separate measure of inflation used to calculate January's retail sales data rose to 6.7%, the highest since this data began in 1997.
Fast-rising prices for energy and food leave consumers with less spare cash to spend on non-essentials, and 2022 looks set to bring the biggest squeeze on households disposable income in 30 years.
(Graphics: https://graphics.reuters.com/BRITAIN-ECONOMY/RETAIL/myvmnjzwdpr/chart.png)
January's sales volumes were 9.1% higher than a year earlier, when non-essential shops were shut due to lockdown restrictions, and 3.6% above pre-pandemic levels.
Britain's retail sector as a whole was relatively resilient through the COVID-19 pandemic, with sales exceeding January 2020 levels in July 2020, thanks to a big shift to online shopping.
However some retailers, especially clothes stores with little online presence, found it much harder to recover from repeated lockdowns. 
Clothing and footwear sales fell 5.0% in January - which the ONS said might be down to smaller-than-usual discounts in the seasonal sales - and are 13% below pre-pandemic levels.
Some pandemic trends have been slowly reversing. The percentage of sales made online fell to 25.3% in January, its lowest since March 2020 although still well above the 19.8% seen in February 2020 before the pandemic.

Food sales dropped below pre-pandemic levels for the first time.
""More people returned to eating out and there was also anecdotal evidence suggesting higher demand for takeaways and meal-subscription kits,"" ONS statistician Darren Morgan said.

359,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 18, 2022 02:31AM ET</span>",France unemployment hits 13-year low in boost for Macron,"By Leigh Thomas
PARIS (Reuters) -France's unemployment rate fell in the final quarter of last year to the lowest level since 2008, data showed on Friday, boosting Emmanuel Macron's economic credentials less than two months before a presidential election.
The unemployment rate fell to 7.4% from 8.0% in the previous three months, the INSEE statistics agency said. A Reuters poll of eight economists had on average forecast 7.8%.
It was the lowest level of unemployment since the third quarter of 2008, with the exception of an anomalous unrepresentative drop at the start of the pandemic because jobseekers could not look for work during a nationwide lockdown.
Stubbornly high unemployment has long been the bane of previous French presidents, and Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire called the drop in the fourth quarter a ""great victory against resignation and fatalism"".
""With Emmanuel Macron we tried something different, we reformed the labour market, we supported apprenticeships, we cut taxes and overhauled the tax system, now the results are there,"" Le Maire said on RTL radio.
The drop put the rate within reach of a campaign promise Macron made in 2017 to cut unemployment to 7% by the end of his term.
Widely expected to seek second five-year term in an election in April, Macron is heading into the vote with one of the strongest economic track records in generations for an incumbent president.
With growth last year of 7%, the European Union's second-biggest economy expanded the fastest in more than five decades in 2021, boosting the labour market as firms struggled to keep up with a recovery in client demand.

Beyond the headline decrease in joblessness, INSEE's quarterly employment report also had good news for youth employment, which was the lowest since 1981 at 15.9% and down sharply from 24.7% when Macron took office in 2017.
However, the employment rate, the share of the workforce in work, dipped slightly to 73.3% although it still remained close to its highest level in decades as well.

JAKARTA (Reuters) - Indonesia booked a current account surplus for the first time in a decade in 2021, data showed on Friday, but its balance of payments came under pressure in the final quarter due to bond market outflows and higher imports.
Bank Indonesia (BI) data showed Southeast Asia's largest economy recorded a $3.3 billion current account surplus last year, equivalent to 0.3% of gross domestic product, helped by a commodity price boom and strong demand from trade partners. It was Indonesia's first surplus since 2011.
The 2021 balance of payments registered a $13.5 billion surplus.
Persistent current account deficits and reliance on foreign portfolio inflows have previously contributed to the volatility of the rupiah, but analysts say last year's surplus should help steady the currency this year even as global liquidity tightens.
Signs of an acceleration in the U.S. Federal Reserve's monetary tightening have already spurred outflows from the Indonesian bond market, squeezing capital and financial accounts in the fourth quarter, data showed.
The current account surplus narrowed to $1.42 billion, or 0.4% of GDP, in the fourth quarter, from a $4.97 billion surplus, or 1.7% of GDP, in the previous three months, on rising imports and freight costs.
The fourth quarter also saw a deficit of $844 million in the balance of payments, compared with the July to September period's $10.69 billion surplus.
JP Morgan analyst Sin Ben Ong said fourth-quarter bond outflows of $4.9 billion were the second largest in more than a decade, but he noted that net foreign exchange reserves ""exhibited remarkable resilience"".
He said this would reduce BI's need to move its policy rate in lockstep with the Fed. 

BI's latest outlook is for the current account to swing back to a deficit of between 1.1% to 1.9% of GDP in 2022, on moderating commodity prices and rising domestic demand as economic recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic strengthens.
Bank Mandiri's analyst Faisal Rachman predicted a 2.15% current account deficit and limited portfolio inflows this year, and that the balance of payments will likely post a smaller surplus than in 2021.

362,By Bloomberg,"<span>Feb 17, 2022 07:09PM ET</span>",Japan Inflation Slows Toward Zero as Global Price Gap Grows,"(Bloomberg) -- Japan’s key inflation measure weakened last month in another sign that Japan’s price dynamics are at odds with a global trend of rapid acceleration that is prompting central bank action overseas.
Growth in consumer prices excluding fresh food slowed to 0.2% in January from a year earlier, compared with 0.5% in the previous month, according to the ministry of internal affairs Friday. 
Economists had expected a gain of 0.3% as an earlier boost from higher hotel charges largely dropped out of the calculations.    
The dent in price gains underscores Japan’s status as an outlier amid global inflationary pressures and could cool recent speculation that the Bank of Japan might consider adjusting policy even before Governor Haruhiko Kuroda finishes his term next year.
The BOJ chief has repeatedly reiterated his view that there is no need to discuss normalizing policy with prices still so distant from a 2% target. 
The central bank underlined its commitment to stick with its stimulus framework earlier this week when it offered to buy government bonds at a fixed rate to keep yields below a ceiling.
Still, the speculation of possible changes is likely to rumble on as other central banks make hawkish pivots in their policy direction. 
Prices in Japan are also expected to jump in April when the impact of slashed phone fees fades out of index, another factor that will likely keep market players chattering.
What Bloomberg Economics Says...
“We expect core inflation to pick up slightly in February. Elevated energy prices and a weaker yen are likely to support the core inflation gauge.”

Click here to read the full report.
The release showed that energy costs contributed 1.2 percentage point to overall prices, an indication of how important climbing oil markets have been in driving up Japan’s inflation readings. Oil prices hit their highest since 2014 this week. 
Gains in hotel fees, a key price booster in recent months, eased to less than 1% in January, sapping overall momentum. Accommodation costs had been surging due to year-earlier comparisons with a period when government-initiated discounts for the travel industry were still in effect.
Last year’s sharp cuts to mobile phone fees continued to push down the overall index by around 1.5 percentage point.
Yoshiki Shinke, chief economist at Dai-Ichi Life Research Institute, is among an increasing number of economists seeing a good chance of the price data hitting the BOJ’s price target this spring and hovering around that level to fuel market expectations of an unwinding of stimulus.
Kuroda has said the central bank is looking for sustainable inflation backed by wage growth, a combination needed to overcome an entrenched deflationary mindset. 
The dislike of price increases among companies and consumers was illustrated this week by a big supermarket chain dropping the products of a diaper maker because it had pushed up its prices.

363,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 17, 2022 12:18PM ET</span>",U.S. labor market still tightening; freezing temperatures chill homebuilding,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The number of Americans filing new claims for jobless benefits unexpectedly rose last week, but remained below pre-pandemic levels as labor market conditions continue to tighten.
The first increase in a month reported by the Labor Department on Thursday did not change economists' expectations for another month of solid employment gains in February. 
There is an acute shortage of workers, which has seen employers boosting wages and offering other incentives to retain their workforce as well as attract labor. Economists blamed the rise in claims on week-to-week volatility in the data and harsh weather in some parts of the country.
""Given the regular noise in the data and the range of factors that can impact filings we don't think the recent jump in initial claims filings is particularly worrisome at this point,"" said Daniel Silver, an economist at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) in New York. ""Overall, we think that the labor market remains tight.""
Initial claims for state unemployment benefits increased 23,000 to a seasonally adjusted 248,000 for the week ended Feb. 12. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast 219,000 applications for the latest week.
Unadjusted claims climbed 7,742 to 238,482 last week, lifted by big increases in Missouri, Ohio and Kentucky, which offset notable declines in Pennsylvania, New Jersey and Wisconsin.
Claims had been declining since hitting a three-month high in mid-January as coronavirus cases, fueled by the Omicron variant, raged across the country. Infections have dropped significantly in recent weeks. 
There were a near record 10.9 million job openings at the end of December. Claims have plunged from an all-time high of 6.149 million in early April 2020.
Last week's data covered the period during which the government surveyed business establishments for the nonfarm payrolls portion of February's employment report. Claims are well below their 290,000 level in mid-January. The economy created 467,000 jobs in January.
Stocks on Wall Street slumped amid escalating tensions between the West and Russia over Ukraine. The dollar rose against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury yields fell. 
MAXIMUM EMPLOYMENT
A survey from the Philadelphia Federal Reserve on Thursday showed employment at factories in the mid-Atlantic region rose strongly in February, and manufacturers also increased hours for workers. But factory activity in the region that covers eastern Pennsylvania, southern New Jersey and Delaware, grew moderately because of persistent supply constraints. 
Strong wages gains from the tight labor market and snarled supply chains are boosting inflation. 
Minutes of the Federal Reserve's Jan. 25-26 meeting published on Wednesday showed ""many"" officials at the U.S. central bank ""viewed labor market conditions as already at or very close to those consistent with maximum employment."" 
The Fed is expected to start raising interest rates in March to quell inflation, with economists anticipating as much as seven hikes this year.
The claims report also showed that the number of people receiving benefits after an initial week of aid dropped 26,000 to 1.593 million in the week ended Feb. 5. 
""There are no signs here of a change in labor market trends,"" said Conrad DeQuadros, senior economic advisor at Brean Capital in New York.
Freezing temperatures depressed homebuilding in January. A third report from the Commerce Department showed housing starts dropped 4.1% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.638 million units last month.
Temperatures were below average from the Midwest and Tennessee Valley to the Northeast in January, according to the National Centers for Environmental Information. 
Single-family housing starts, which account for the biggest share of homebuilding, tumbled 5.6% to a rate of 1.116 million. Starts fell in the Northeast, Midwest and South, but rose in the West. Last month's decline is, however, probably temporary as building permits rose 0.7% to a rate of 1.899 million units, the highest since May 2006. Single-family permits surged 6.8% to a rate of 1.205 million units, a one-year high. 
The supply of previously owned homes on the market is at record lows. But builders are facing challenges from soaring prices for inputs. 
Prices for softwood lumber, which is used for framing, shot up 25.4% in January, government data showed this week. 
The National Association of Homebuilders said on Wednesday that building material production bottlenecks were delaying projects, noting that ""many builders are waiting months to receive cabinets, garage doors, countertops and appliances.""
The supply squeeze was underscored by a surge in the backlog of houses approved for construction but not yet started to a record last month.
Rising mortgage rates could also slow demand for housing, especially among first-time buyers. The 30-year fixed mortgage rate jumped above 4% last week for the first time since 2019, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association.

""Rising mortgage rates pose a significant risk to housing demand, but it's unclear what type of lag would exist for this impact to appear in the construction data,"" said Isfar Munir, an economist at  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) in New York.
""New homes can be sold before they are started, and last-bid attempts to buy homes before mortgage rates increase further could boost new home sales before the Fed actually begins hiking, this would be a positive tailwind for housing starts, at least for a few months.""

364,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 17, 2022 09:23AM ET</span>",U.S. housing starts fall in January amid freezing weather; permits surge,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. homebuilding fell more than expected in January as many parts of the country experienced freezing temperatures, but a surge in permits suggested a rebound in the coming months was likely amid a severe shortage of homes on the market.
Housing starts dropped 4.1% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.638 million units last month, the Commerce Department said on Thursday. Data for December was revised slightly up to a rate of 1.708 million units from the previously reported 1.702 million units. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast starts would fall to a rate of 1.700 million units.
Permits for future homebuilding in January rose 0.7% to a rate of 1.899 million units, the highest since 2006. 
Temperatures were below average from the Midwest and Tennessee Valley to the Northeast in January, according to the National Centers for Environmental Information. 
Single-family housing starts, which account for the biggest share of homebuilding, dropped 5.6% to a rate of 1.116 million units last month. Single-family homebuilding fell in the Northeast, Midwest and South, but rose in the West.
Single-family building permits surged 6.8% to a rate of 1.205 million units. The supply of previously owned homes on the market is at record lows, which should keep builders busy. 
But builders are facing challenges from soaring prices for inputs. Prices for softwood lumber, which is used for framing, shot up 25.4% in January after a 21.3% rise in December, the Labor Department's producer price report showed this week. The United States last November nearly doubled the duties on imported Canadian softwood lumber after a review of its anti-dumping and countervailing duty orders.

The National Association of Homebuilders said on Wednesday that building material production bottlenecks were raising construction costs and delaying projects. The NAHB noted that ""many builders are waiting months to receive cabinets, garage doors, countertops and appliances.""
Rising mortgage rates could also slow demand for housing, especially among first-time home buyers. The 30-year fixed mortgage rate jumped above 4% last week for the first time since 2019, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association. Mortgage rates are rising as the Federal Reserve is expected to start hiking interest rates next month to tame high inflation.

MADRID (Reuters) - Exports of Spanish goods soared 21.2% last year to surpass pre-pandemic levels despite global supply chain problems and the impact of Brexit, although Spain's trade deficit nearly doubled due to soaring energy prices, customs data on Thursday showed.
Helped by oil products, food and pharmaceuticals, 2021 exports hit around 317 billion euros ($360 billion), 9.1% higher than in 2019, when global trade was flowing normally before the COVID-19 pandemic.
Overall imports rose almost 25% to 343 billion euros. Spain's trade deficit nearly doubled to 26 billion euros from 2020. Excluding energy products, the trade deficit would stand at just 852 million euros versus a surplus of 1.1 billion euros in 2020.
Exports to Britain were still 5.4% below 2019 levels and imports of British goods have fallen by 26% after the country's exit from the European Union in January 2021, with some border controls yet to be implemented.
A senior source from the department of Commerce told Reuters the easing of trade tensions between Europe and the United States also helped the Spanish exports recovery, as well as a lesser dependence on markets most affected by supply problems such as Asia.
Spain was one of the countries affected by the tariffs imposed in the US-EU Airbus dispute, and in a row over taxes on big tech companies.
By type of traded goods, only the auto sector performed below 2019 levels, with an 8.5% drop in exports and a 19.5% slump in imports, largely due to global shortages of semiconductors that have led to temporary closures of some factories.
Vaccines against COVID-19 also helped boost Spain's exports thanks to pharmaceutical plants in the country producing vials.

In total, 5.5 billion euros worth of vaccines were imported in 2021 and 4.7 billion euros were exported.

367,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 17, 2022 05:06AM ET</span>",Japan's trade deficit jumps to 8-year high as commodity imports soar,"By Daniel Leussink and Kantaro Komiya
TOKYO (Reuters) -Japan ran its biggest trade deficit in a single month in eight years in January as high energy costs swelled imports and manufacturers struggled with global supply constraints, causing a decline in car shipments.
The growing trade deficit highlights the world's third-largest economy's vulnerability to soaring commodity costs and slowing demand from giant neighbour China as the economy there struggles to maintain momentum.
Imports soared 39.6% year-on-year in January to hit a record high in terms of their value in yen, coming to 8.5231 trillion yen ($73.81 billion), Ministry of Finance data showed on Thursday, above a median market forecast for a 37.1% increase. 
That greatly outstripped a 9.6% rise in exports in the year to January, bringing the trade balance to a deficit of 2.1911 trillion yen, its biggest in a single month since January 2014.
The deficit was much bigger than the median estimate for a 1.607 trillion yen shortfall.
""Exports tend to go down in January due to seasonal factors as factory operation rates are usually low due to New Year holidays,"" said Takumi Tsunoda, senior economist at Shinkin Central Bank Research Institute.
""So it's easy for the trade balance to go in the red in the month, but the deficit was still large, even when taking that into account.""
A big factor in the deficit was a decline in car exports, said Tsunoda, which swung into contraction from an expansion in the previous month.
Manufacturers including  Toyota  Motor (NYSE:TM) Corp and Suzuki Motor Corp have been forced to temporarily close some plants after facing supply chain disruptions and pressure from a record surge in COVID-19 infections at home.
Imports were pushed up by surging incoming shipments of petroleum, coal and liquefied natural gas.
CHINA-BOUND EXPORTS FALL
By region, exports to China, Japan's largest trading partner, shrank 5.4% in the 12 months to January, posting its first contraction in 19 months, while imports jumped 23.7% to post their largest rise in four months.
That was likely in part due to slower exports and a front-loading of demand ahead of China's week-long Lunar New Year holiday that started on the last day of January.
A bigger cause of worry was the slowing momentum of China's massive economy, which is facing weakening consumption and a property downturn, some analysts said.
""China's economic slowdown could weaken exports going forward,"" said Ryosuke Katagi, market economist at Mizuho Securities.
U.S.-bound shipments, another key market for Japanese goods, grew 11.5% in January, as stronger machinery shipments outweighed a fall in car exports. 
Separate government data showed core machinery orders, which serve as a leading indicator of capital spending in the coming six to nine months, were up 3.6% in December from the prior month, better than an expected 1.8% fall.
Manufacturers expected core orders to decline 1.1% in January-March, after a 6.5% gain in the previous quarter. 

Japan's economy grew slightly less than expected in the final quarter of 2021 as falling coronavirus cases helped prop up consumption, government data showed on Tuesday, though a record surge in Omicron variant cases and the high raw material prices are clouding the outlook.

SYDNEY (Reuters) -Australia's unemployment rate held at a 13-year low in January as a surge in coronavirus cases took more of a toll on hours worked than on jobs, and hiring still rising moderately in the month.
Figures from the Australian Bureau of Statistics on Thursday showed employment rose 12,900 in January, pipping forecasts of a flat outcome and following two months of exceptional gains.
The unemployment rate stayed at 4.2%, matching the lowest reading since 2008 when it bottomed out at 4.0%. The impact of the Omicron wave was felt most in hours worked which slid 8.8% as employees stayed home sick or were forced to isolate.
Yet these workers remained attached to their jobs and unemployment barely moved, setting the stage for a quick rebound now that coronavirus cases have tapered off.
""As cases have fallen sharply we expect the impact on the labour market to fade in February,"" said Ben Udy, an economist at Capital Economics.
""It highlights the resilience of the labour market and supports our forecast that the RBA will hike rates in June.""
The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) has been aiming to drive unemployment to 4% or lower in the hope of reviving wage growth after years of sub-par growth, and is now near that goal.
The tightening labour market combined with rising inflation also suggests a rate rise is getting closer. RBA Governor Philip Lowe last week said it was plausible a hike could come later in the year should the economy recover as expected.
Markets are wagering the 0.1% cash rate could rise to 0.25% as early as June, and keep climbing to 1.25% by year end. Among the major local banks, CBA is tipping a first rise in June, Westpac sees August, ANZ September and NAB November.
Much will depend on how wages progress with the ABS wage price measure for the December quarter due next week. Analysts look for an uptick to 2.4%, which would be the fastest pace since 2014 but short of the 3%-plus desired by the RBA.
Still, the central bank recently emphasised it was looking at a wider suite of labour cost indicators and not just wages to decide when to tighten policy.
Analysts took that as a sign the RBA could hike even with wages running at less than 3%.
""ABS data, private surveys and our internal data that captures salaries paid into CBA bank accounts indicates that wages growth has further accelerated,"" says Gareth Aird, CBA's head of Australian economics.

He also expects the consumer price report for the March quarter to show an alarming acceleration in core inflation to 3.5%, up from 2.6% and above the RBA's 2-3% target band.
""We expect the RBA to move to an explicit hiking bias at the May Board meeting and raise rates to 0.25% in June,"" said Aird.

Employment increased by 12,900 roles in January from a month earlier, Australian Bureau of Statistics data showed Thursday. Unemployment was steady at 4.2% despite participation edging up. The impact of the omicron variant of coronavirus was seen in hours worked, which dropped by 8.8%.
Australian bonds advanced after the jobs numbers, bringing the three-year yield down two basis points to 1.63%. The Aussie dollar edged lower to 71.96 U.S. cents. Futures traders trimmed bets that the Reserve Bank will hike interest rates in May to about 60%, from 80% odds seen on Tuesday.
“Nationally, and in New South Wales and Victoria, the number of people who worked reduced hours because they were sick was around three times the pre-pandemic average for January,” said Bjorn Jarvis, head of labor statistics at the ABS. “In other states and territories, it was twice as many people.”
The survey was conducted in the first two weeks of January, at the peak of the omicron wave when Australia had about 800,000 active Covid-19 cases.
The strength of Australia’s labor market is a key reason why economists and financial markets expect the RBA will begin raising rates in coming months. Governor Philip Lowe, by contrast, reckons it will take time for low unemployment to translate into much faster wages growth, suggesting a tightening cycle remains some way off.
RBA Says Pickup in Wages Growth Likely to Be ‘Only Gradual’ (1)
Figures from the National Skills Commission this week showed the Internet Vacancy Index climbed 4.4% last month to a 13-year high. Over the year to January, recruitment activity is up nearly 41% with advertisements at all-time highs in 10 occupations.
The RBA forecasts unemployment will this year fall below 4%, a level unseen since the early 1970s, though wages growth is only seen lifting to 3% in 2023. Lowe wants faster wages growth in order to sustainably return inflation to its 2-3% target before he begins raising rates after a prolonged period of weak consumer-price growth.

370,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 16, 2022 08:02PM ET</span>",U.S. retail sales race to record high; economy shows strength ahead of rate hikes,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. retail sales increased by the most in 10 months in January, lifting the level of sales to a record high amid a surge in purchases of motor vehicles and other goods, but higher prices could limit the boost to economic growth this quarter.
The report from the Commerce Department on Wednesday showed underlying strength in the economy ahead of anticipated interest rate increases from the Federal Reserve starting in March, although retail sales in December were much weaker than initially estimated.
""The strong rebound in January retail sales, though partly in response to last year's weak finish and inflated by higher prices, suggests consumers still have plenty in the tank to propel the expansion forward this year,"" said Sal Guatieri, a senior economist at BMO Capital Markets in Toronto. ""Rate hikes won't cool their jets for a while, making the Fed's job of driving down inflation that much harder.""
Retail sales surged 3.8% last month, the largest rise since last March. That raised sales to their highest level since the government started tracking the series in 1992. 
Data for December was revised down to show sales declining 2.5% instead of 1.9% as previously reported. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast retail sales would rise 2.0%, with estimates ranging from as low as 0.7% to as high as 4.4%.
Retail sales increased despite consumer sentiment sagging to a decade low in recent months. Spending is being supported by massive savings, high household wealth and a tightening labor market, though inflation is eroding wage gains. 
The broad increase in sales was led by motor vehicles. 
Auto sales typically fall in January after the holiday promotional season. Given the ongoing scarcity of motor vehicles because of a global shortage of semiconductors, the drop last month was probably smaller than had been expected by the seasonal factors, the model used by the government to iron out seasonal fluctuations in data. 
That likely resulted in the seasonal factors being more generous than in previous years. Unadjusted auto sales were the highest for the month of January going back to 1992.
Economists expect this boost to fade in March. Auto sales could also fall, with a separate report from the Fed on Wednesday showing motor vehicle production declined in January for a second straight month. That curbed overall growth in manufacturing output to 0.2% last month.
""Despite some caveats to the retail sales report, at least we can be assured that consumers are not pulling back their crucial support for the economy even though they are experiencing a marked decline in confidence if not being downright depressed about what the future holds,"" said Christopher Rupkey, chief economist at FWDBONDS in New York.
Stocks on Wall Street fell as investors worried the strong retail sales could give the U.S. central bank ammunition to aggressively tighten monetary policy. 
Financial markets are pricing in nearly even odds of a 50-basis-point interest rate increase next month. Economists expect as many as seven rate hikes this year.
Minutes of the Fed's Jan. 25-26 meeting published on Wednesday showed decisions to raise rates would depend on a meeting-by-meeting analysis of data.
The dollar slipped against a basket of currencies while U.S. Treasury prices were mixed.

Retail sales last month were also lifted by higher prices because of shortages amid strained supply chains. They are mostly made up of goods and are not adjusted for inflation. 
Retail sales - https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-STOCKS/egvbkldkapq/retailsales.png 
Economists estimated that retail sales rose about 2.8% in January when adjusted for inflation, which put them back in line with their pre-pandemic trend. 
Receipts at auto dealerships snapped back 5.7% after dropping 1.6% in December. Sales at electronics and appliance stores increased 1.9%. Building materials stores sales surged 4.1%. There were also gains in receipts at food and beverage stores as well as clothing retailers. 
But sales at sporting goods, hobby, musical instrument and book stores fell 3.0%, suggesting consumers were cutting back on discretionary spending likely because of inflation. Sales at service stations fell 1.3% amid lower gasoline prices. 
Receipts at restaurants and bars dropped 0.9% as COVID-19 infections, driven by the Omicron variant, reduced mobility. Restaurants and bars are the only services category in the retail sales report. Online retail store sales surged 14.5%.
Excluding automobiles, gasoline, building materials and food services, retail sales soared 4.8% in January. Data for December was revised lower to show these so-called core retail sales falling 4.0% instead of 3.1% as previously reported.
Core retail sales correspond most closely with the consumer spending component of gross domestic product.
Economists estimated that inflation-adjusted core retail sales rose 2.7% last month. The so-called real core retail sales are what matter in the measurement of consumer spending growth.
January's solid real core retail sales suggested that consumer spending this quarter would probably not be as weak as economists had expected. Real consumer spending declined 1.0% in December, which had set consumption on a slower growth path.
""The recent volatility in the data makes it hard to detect the underlying trend, but the recent momentum for consumer spending now looks stronger than we were anticipating,"" said Daniel Silver, an economist at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) in New York.

Growth estimates for consumer spending are mostly below a 2.0% annualized rate. Consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, increased at a 3.3% pace in the fourth quarter.
Economists at Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) raised their first-quarter GDP growth estimate by 1.5 percentage points to a 2.0% rate. The economy grew at a 6.9% pace in the fourth quarter. Growth in 2021 was the strongest since 1984.

Import prices increased 2.0% last month, the largest rise since April 2011, after declining 0.4% in December, the Labor Department said on Wednesday. In the 12 months through January, prices accelerated 10.8% after rising 10.2% in December.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast import prices, which exclude tariffs, advancing 1.3%.
The report followed news on Tuesday that producer prices increased by the most in eight months in January. Consumer prices also rose solidly last month, with the annual inflation rate posting its largest increase in 40 years.
Supply bottlenecks had shown signs of easing towards the end of 2021, but that progress stalled as COVID-19 cases, driven by the Omicron variant, raged around the globe. 
Imported fuel prices shot up 9.3% last month after decreasing 8.3% in December. Petroleum prices surged 9.5%, while the cost of imported food accelerated 3.6%. 
Excluding fuel and food, import prices rose 1.1%. These so-called core import prices gained 0.6% in December. They increased 6.2% on a year-on-year basis in January.

The report also showed export prices advanced 2.9% in January after dropping 1.6% in December. Prices for agricultural exports rose 3.0%. Nonagricultural export prices increased 2.9%.

372,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 16, 2022 10:36AM ET</span>",U.S. business inventories increase solidly in December,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. business inventories increased strongly in December, with motor vehicle stocks accelerating, a sign that the worst of the global semiconductor shortage was probably behind.
Business inventories increased 2.1% after rising 1.5% in November, the Commerce Department said on Wednesday. Inventories are a key component of gross domestic product. December's increase was in line with economists' expectations. Inventories shot up 10.5% on a year-on-year basis in December.
Retail inventories surged 4.2% in December, instead of 4.4% as estimated in an advance report published last month. That followed a 2.0% increase in November. 
Motor vehicle inventories accelerated 6.8% as estimated last month. They increased 4.2% in November.
That would suggest the global shortage of semiconductors, which has constrained motor vehicle production, was easing. But that improvement in supply has not been evident in producer inflation data, which showed wholesale motor vehicle and
equipment prices increasing a solid 0.7% in January. 
Retail inventories excluding autos, which go into the calculation of GDP, jumped 3.3%, rather than 3.6% as estimated last month.
Inventory investment increased at a seasonally adjusted annualized rate of $173.5 billion in the fourth quarter, the second-largest quarterly increase on record.
Most economists see further scope for inventories to rise, noting that inflation-adjusted inventories remain below their pre-pandemic level. Sales-to-inventory ratios are also low.
Inventories contributed 4.90 percentage points to the fourth quarter's 6.9% annualized growth pace. Restocking, after three straight quarters during which inventories were drawn down, is supporting manufacturing.

Wholesale inventories increased 2.2% in December. Stocks at manufacturers rose 0.3%.
Business sales fell 0.7% in December after increasing 1.1% in November. At December's sales pace, it would take 1.29 months for businesses to clear shelves, up from 1.25 months in November.

OTTAWA (Reuters) -Canada's annual inflation rate accelerated again in January to hit a fresh 30-year high at 5.1%, as food and housing costs continued to rise, official data showed on Wednesday, bolstering the case for a steady series of interest rates hikes.
January's figure is the highest since 5.5% recorded in September 1991 and the 10th consecutive month above the Bank of Canada's 1%-to-3% control range, Statistics Canada data showed. Analysts polled by Reuters had expected inflation to remain at 4.8% in January.
""It's hotter than expected,"" said Derek Holt, vice president of capital markets economics at Scotiabank. ""To me this suggests that the economy is moving on from Omicron's effects. 
""The restrictions may have added a little bit to the inflationary pressures. But there is certainly no slowdown,"" he added.
Shelter costs jumped 6.2% in January year-on-year, the fastest pace since February 1990, while food prices rose 5.7% as shopping for groceries became more expensive, both on supply chain issues and unfavorable growing conditions. 
With price gains widespread, it appears businesses are passing on cost increases to consumers, analysts said. Rising energy prices, Canada's record-smashing housing market, and wage pressure are set to send inflation still higher.
""Simply put, this is far too hot for comfort for the Bank of Canada, so expect a steady series of rate hikes in the coming meetings,"" Doug Porter, chief economist at BMO Capital Markets, said in a note.
Porter expects four hikes in a row, to start, but added ""it may well require much more than that to bring inflation to heel.""
Bank of Canada Governor Tiff Macklem has said interest rates need to rise to tackle hot inflation and Canadians should expect multiple hikes.
Still, analysts doubted the data would be enough to sway the central bank to hike by 50 basis points rather than 25 basis points at its March 2 policy meeting. Money markets see about a 30% chance of the larger increase.
""It's clear that central bankers need to tighten policy, but high household debt levels will temper the Bank of Canada's aggressiveness,"" Royce Mendes, head of macro strategy at Desjardins Group, said in a note.

The CPI common measure, which the central bank says is the best gauge of the economy's underperformance, rose to 2.3% from 2.1% in December.
The Canadian dollar was trading 0.2% higher at 1.2684 to the greenback, or 78.84 U.S. cents.

374,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 16, 2022 09:51AM ET</span>",U.S. manufacturing output rises moderately in January,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Production at U.S. factories increased moderately in January as motor vehicle output fell for a second straight month amid an ongoing global shortage of semiconductors.
Manufacturing output gained 0.2% last month after dipping 0.1% in December, the Federal Reserve said on Wednesday. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast factory production rebounding 0.3%. Output increased 2.5% compared to January 2021.
Shortages of materials have also afflicted other segments of manufacturing, in addition to the motor vehicle industry.
Spending shifted towards goods from services during the COVID-19 pandemic, but manufacturers have struggled to cope amid an acute shortage of workers on factory floors and other places along the supply chain, caused by the coronavirus.
Manufacturing, which accounts for 11.9% of the U.S. economy, remains supported by still-lean inventories at businesses as demand for goods remains strong.
Production at auto plants fell 0.9% last month after slipping 0.4% in December. Excluding motor vehicles, manufacturing increased 0.3% in January.
Last month's gain in manufacturing output combined with a record 9.9% jump in utilities to boost industrial production 1.4%. That followed a 0.1% fall in December.
Demand for utilities was boosted by freezing temperatures in many parts of the country in January. Mining production increased 1.0%, with oil and gas well drilling advancing 6.2%.
Capacity utilization for the manufacturing sector, a measure of how fully firms are using their resources, rose 0.1 percentage point to 77.3% in January. It is 1.8 percentage points higher than its pre-pandemic level but still 0.8 percentage point below its long-run average.

Overall capacity use for the industrial sector increased 1.0 percentage point to 77.6% last month. It is 1.9 percentage points below its 1972-2021 average.
Officials at the Fed tend to look at capacity use measures for signals of how much ""slack"" remains in the economy — how far growth has room to run before it becomes inflationary.

375,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 16, 2022 08:47AM ET</span>",Factbox - UK inflation at 30-year high - what's changed since 1992?,"LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's inflation rate hit its highest since March 1992 in January when it rose to 5.5% and is expected to extend its climb to above 7% in April, prompting fears of the sort of wage-price spiral that once dogged the country's economy.
Here are five things that have changed the inflation picture since the early 1990s.
BANK OF ENGLAND - The British central bank was only given an inflation target in October 1992, after the country fell out of the European Exchange Rate Mechanism which had kept sterling pegged against a basket of other European currencies.
The central bank gained full operational independence in 1997, taking responsibility for supporting or slowing the economy via interest rates out of the hands of politicians. Since then, inflation has averaged roughly 2% a year.
THE LAWSON BOOM - Britain's economy boomed in the late 1980s and sweeping tax cuts by Margaret Thatcher's finance minister Nigel Lawson were blamed for a sharp rise in inflation. Current finance minister Rishi Sunak has overseen the biggest-ever peacetime borrowing surge to prop up the economy during the COVID-19 pandemic, but the tax burden is now on course to hit its highest since the 1960s.
WAGE DEALS - Another driver of Britain's high inflation three decades ago were strong wage increases that were secured by trade unions, which remained powerful players in the early 1990s despite a big decline in their membership over the previous decade. Wage increases have lagged behind inflation for much of the period since the global financial crisis of 2008-09.
STERLING - In March 1992, the pound was still part of the European Exchange Rate Mechanism which kept the currency pegged at a value that proved too high for the government and the Bank of England to defend against speculative attack six months later on ""Black Wednesday"". The de-pegging of the pound eventually set Britain's economy on course for a recovery.

INTEREST RATES - The BoE kept its base rate above 10% throughout much for the 1980s and it stood at 10.375% in March 1992. Bank Rate is currently about one-twentieth of that level at 0.5%. It is expected to rise as the BoE seeks to stamp out any long-term increase in inflation expectations, but only to about 2% in a year's time, according to interest rate futures markets. Private economists think it will peak lower than that.
CHINA - The rise of China and other low-cost manufacturing countries in the 2000s helped bring down inflation for consumers in rich economies around the world. But the gradual rise of costs in emerging economies, and more recently the disruption wrought by the coronavirus pandemic, has hammered global supply chains, pushing up prices for many goods.

The value of overall purchases rose 3.8% in January after a downwardly revised 2.5% drop in the prior month, Commerce Department figures showed Wednesday. The figures aren’t adjusted for inflation. 
The median estimate in a Bloomberg survey called for a 2% advance in overall retail sales from the prior month.
The broad-based advance in sales underscores the resiliency of Americans’ demand for merchandise. While the omicron variant and related surge in Covid-19 infections likely dampened services spending in the month, an improving labor market has helped consumers continue to spend on things like cars and furniture despite decades-high inflation and a collapse in confidence.

JERUSALEM (Reuters) -Israel's economy grew at its fastest pace in 21 years in 2021 as consumer spending, exports and investment rebounded with double-digit gains following a pandemic-stifled 2020, raising the spectre of the central bank raising interest rates soon. 
The economy grew 8.1% last year, the Central Bureau of Statistics said on Wednesday, well above the Bank of Israel's forecast of 6.5% and a sharp rebound from a 2.2% contraction in 2020.
The bureau noted growth in Israel last year was one of the strongest globally and compared with an OECD average of 5.3%.
The central bank projects growth of 5.5% in 2022. It has said it is in no rush to start raising short-term interest rates but that faster-than-expected growth and rising inflation could prod policymakers to join peers in the United States and Europe in hiking rates.
Israel's benchmark rate stands at 0.1%.
""These are very robust (GDP) numbers reflecting strong economic activity towards the end of 2021, which is supportive for a rate hike, most likely on April 11th,"" said Leader Capital Markets chief economist Jonathan Katz.
The next rate decision is due on Monday.
On Tuesday, the bureau said the annual inflation rate rose to 3.1% in January - breaking above the government's 1-3% target range for the first time in more than a decade.
Like most countries, Israel in 2020 was hurt by the pandemic and a series of lockdowns to contain the spread of COVID-19. But in 2021, a rapid vaccination rollout allowed a reopening of much of the economy apart from the tourism sector.
Israel has only recently started to allow foreign tourists to enter the country again.
Consumer spending, which accounts for half of economic activity, rose by close to 12% in 2021, while exports - another key growth driver - gained nearly 14% despite a stronger shekel currency, while investment in fixed assets was up 10.5%.
In the fourth quarter of 2021, gross domestic product grew an annualised 16.6% in from the prior three months, according to a preliminary estimate, above the 5% growth anticipated in a Reuters poll of economists.
Private spending jumped 19.2%, while exports surged 26.3% and investment grew 14.1%. Government spending and imports also rose sharply during the last three months of the year.
Third-quarter GDP was revised to annualised growth of 6.7% from a prior 2.7% rate.

Growth in 2021 was the fastest in Israel since an 8.9% pace in 2000.
The shekel gained 1% against the dollar, while Tel Aviv shares were also up 1%.

378,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 16, 2022 07:12AM ET</span>",U.S. mortgage interest rates top 4% for first time since 2019,"(Reuters) - The interest rate on the most popular U.S. home loan surged by the most in nearly two years last week, shooting above the 4% level for the first time since 2019 as financial markets anticipate that the Federal Reserve will respond to the highest inflation in a generation with an aggressive run of rate hikes.
The Mortgage Bankers Association on Wednesday said its weekly measure of the average contract rate on a 30-year, fixed-rate mortgage climbed to 4.05% in the week ended Feb. 11 from 3.83% a week earlier. That was the highest since October 2019 and the largest weekly increase since March 2020 when the onset of the coronavirus pandemic was roiling financial markets.
The Fed responded to the pandemic-induced recession by cutting its benchmark rate to near zero and buying trillions of dollars in government bonds and mortgage-backed securities, and mortgage rates fell to historic lows below 3%. 
But with the economy recovering, the job market nearing full employment and inflation running at the highest rate since the early 1980s, the Fed is now seen rapidly reining in that accommodation. Policymakers have signaled an initial rate hike at their upcoming meeting in mid-March, and officials are debating openly about how fast to proceed after that. 
That reset has driven up the yields on the Treasury securities that influence mortgage rates, and home financing costs have followed suit: MBA's 30-year contract rate has climbed roughly a full percentage point in about five months.

The rate rise is crimping application volumes for mortgage refinancings in particular, with MBA's refinancing index dropping to a two-year low and the refinancing share of all loan applications at the lowest level since July 2019.
Overall loan application volumes fell 5.4% last week and purchase applications dropped 1.2%.

LONDON (Reuters) -British consumer prices rose at the fastest annual pace in nearly 30 years last month, intensifying the squeeze on households and reinforcing the chances that the Bank of England will raise interest rates for a third meeting in a row.
The annual rate of consumer price inflation rose to 5.5% in January, the highest since March 1992, when Britain was emerging from a long period of inflation-feeding high wage deals. This was above most economists' forecasts in a Reuters poll for it to hold at December's 5.4% rate.
Earlier this month the Bank of England predicted inflation will peak at around 7.25% in April, when household energy bills are due to rise by more than half.
""This morning's upside surprise to UK inflation serves to underscore a recent global trend: higher and more persistent inflation has caught central banks on the back foot and opened the door to more interest rate hikes this year,"" said Ambrose Crofton, global strategist at J.P. Morgan Asset Management.
U.S. consumer price inflation hit a 40-year high of 7.5% in January, while inflation in the euro zone was a record 5.1%.
The BoE has already raised rates twice since December - to 0.5% from 0.1% - and financial markets expect a further increase to 0.75% or 1% on March 17 after its next meeting.
Two-year British government bond yields hit their highest since 2011 shortly after the inflation data was released.
Financial markets expect BoE interest rates to rise to 2% by the end of 2022, though most economists say they will not get close to that level.
""There will probably then be another hike in May taking interest rates to 1.0%, but we think that's where the (BoE) committee will pause as the inflation outlook becomes more benign,"" said Thomas Pugh, economist at RSM UK.
The British central bank has said it does not expect inflation to return to its 2% target until early in 2024. The bulk of economists think inflation will fall faster.
Markets expect energy prices to fall sharply next year, and there are some signs of easing global supply chain pressures.
But working-age households are facing their biggest annual disposal income squeeze in 30 years - not least because Prime Minister Boris Johnson's government plans to put up payroll taxes for workers and businesses in April.
The opposition Labour Party - as well as some Conservative lawmakers - have called on the government to scrap the increase.
COSTLIER CLOTHING
January's pick-up in inflation reflected less seasonal discounting by retailers than a year earlier, the Office for National Statistics said.
A record 6.3% annual rise in the prices for clothing and footwear added 0.2 percentage points to the CPI rate, while food and drink prices increased by 4.3%, the most since April 2013.
Petrol prices were lower than December, but are still 23.6% higher than a year earlier, while the cost of second-hand cars was 28.7% higher.
Core inflation, which excludes sometimes volatile prices for energy, food, alcohol and tobacco, rose to 4.4% in January from 4.2% in December, its highest since these records began in 1997.
Retail price inflation - a longer-running series which the ONS says is no longer accurate, but which is used in commercial contracts and to set interest payments for some government bonds - was the highest since March 1991 at 7.8% in January.

There were signs of further inflation pressure ahead as manufacturers increased prices by 9.9%, the biggest annual jump since September 2008 and above all forecasts in a Reuters poll. 
But the surge in manufacturers' raw material costs slowed slightly, rising by 13.6% which was down from 13.8% in December and a peak of more than 15% in November.

The European Union's statistics office Eurostat said industrial output in the 19 countries sharing the euro rose 1.2% month-on-moth in December for a 1.6% year-on-year gain.
Economists polled by Reuters had expected a 0.3% monthly rise and a 0.5% annual decline.
Eurostat said the monthly increase was led by capital goods rising 2.6% from November, which helped offset shrinking production of energy and durable consumer goods.

But in year-on-year terms durable consumer goods showed a strong increase of 2.7%, behind only the output of non-durable goods which jumped 7.7%, while capital goods declined 1.0%.
Industrial output is an important component of gross domestic product, which rose 0.3% quarter-on-quarter in the October-December period for a 4.6% year-on-year expansion.

381,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 16, 2022 02:41AM ET</span>","Norway 2021 GDP growth strongest in 14 years, Q4 beats forecast","OSLO (Reuters) -Norway's mainland economy grew last year by 4.2%, its quickest pace since 2007 as the country rebounded from a pandemic-driven slump in activity, Statistics Norway (SSB) data showed on Wednesday.
The October-December quarter saw growth of 1.4% compared with the July-September period, the statistics office said, beating expectations of 1.2% in a Reuters poll of analysts.
The crown currency strengthened against the euro to trade at 10.0950 at 0717 GMT, from 10.1080 just before the data release.
Mainland GDP, which excludes the often volatile impact from Norway's oil and gas production, is the most commonly watched measure of how the economy is performing.
In 2020, it contracted by 2.3% in what was estimated to be the weakest development in 75 years as strict COVID-19 lockdown measures hampered business activity.
Last year's growth was primarily driven by a rebound in a wide range of service industries that were hard hit in the initial stage of the pandemic, the statistics office said.
""In April of 2021, the gradual reopening of society began, and activity in the mainland economy grew each month from April to November,"" SSB economist Paal Sletten said in a statement.
Many restrictions were brought back in December however to help combat the rapid spread of the Omicron variant, causing a slowdown in the final month of the year, SSB said.
Norway in recent weeks again scrapped most curbs however, setting the stage for bars, restaurants, entertainment venues and other activities to resume full business.
""Society has reopened and the conditions for further normalisation are thus present,"" Sletten said.

The Norwegian central bank, which began raising rates last year, plans to hike three times in 2022, and some economists believe the pace of tightening will be even quicker.
The third-quarter mainland GDP reading was revised up to 2.8% from 2.6% originally.

382,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 16, 2022 12:51AM ET</span>","China's inflation slows, leaving room for policy easing","BEIJING (Reuters) -China's factory-gate inflation eased to its slowest pace in six months and consumer price growth also softened in January amid weakening property sector demand, new coronavirus curbs and government efforts to rein in surging materials costs.
The producer price index (PPI) increased 9.1% from a year ago, the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) said in a statement on Wednesday, slower than the 9.5% growth tipped by a Reuters poll and a 10.3% gain in December. It was the weakest pace since July.
While producer prices in the world's second-largest economy remain elevated thanks to critical supply issues and home and abroad, China's relatively benign consumer inflation contrasts with cost pressures seen in most other economies.
Analysts believe cooling inflation could provide room for the People's Bank of China (PBOC) to ease policy to support the slowing economy, even as major central banks elsewhere tighten policy.
""Inflation concerns are unlikely to hold back the (People's Bank of China) from more policy loosening measures,"" said Sheana Yue, China Economist at Capital Economics.
China's consumer price index (CPI) inched up 0.9% last month from a year earlier. Economists in a Reuters poll had expected a 1% rise following a 1.5% uptick in December.
""Lower inflation reflects the weak domestic demand,"" said Zhiwei Zhang, Chief Economist at Pinpoint Asset Management. ""Macro policies have turned more supportive but it takes time for the impact to be transmitted to the economy.""
The Chinese economy, particularly its vast manufacturing sector, has struggled with elevated production costs due to high global energy prices.
In January, coal mining and washing prices surged 51.3% year-on-year and oil and gas extraction prices jumped 38.2%.
China's state planner earlier this month said global inflation is likely to persist for some time, but expressed confidence in the country's ability to cope with abnormal price fluctuations.
The National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) said it expects producer price inflation to slow further this year while consumer price inflation picks up.
LUXURY TO EASE
The PBOC has cut interest rates and pumped cash into the financial system to lower borrowing costs, with more easing steps expected.
Capital Economics' Yue expects further policy rate cuts before the middle of the year.
The scope to ease is a rare luxury enjoyed by China, in contrast to developed central banks, which have either begun raising interest rates or are widely expected to this year.
At the same time, policymakers are wary of loosening credit conditions too much and too fast, which could re-ignite speculation-driven spikes in property prices.
The property sector has cooled due to curbs on borrowing by developers and increasingly wary buyers.

""On interest rate cuts, policymakers do not want to undo all the results they achieved last year in the property market,"" said Nie Wen, chief economist at Hwabao Trust.
""They finally managed to curb the fast-rising (property) prices, so any cuts to interest rates will be structural and aimed at supporting the real economy, rather than further stimulating the property market.""

Investing.com – China’s factory-gate inflation slowed to its slowest pace in six months in January 2022, thanks to government curbs bringing raw materials prices down.
Data from the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) showed that the producer price index (PPI) rose 9.1% year-on-year, slower than the 10.3% growth recorded in December 2021 and the 9.5% growth in forecasts prepared by Investing.com.
Consumer price inflation also slowed year-on-year. The NBS data showed China’s consumer price index (CPI) grew 0.9% year-on-year, slower than the increase of 1.5% recorded in December and the 1% growth in forecasts prepared by Investing.com.
The CPI grew 0.4% month-on-month, also slower than the 0.5% growth in forecasts prepared by Investing.com and December’s 0.3% contraction.
China’s economy faces several headwinds in the year ahead, including a troubled property sector as well as weaker consumer confidence and spending as COVID-19 outbreaks lead to strict prevention and control measures.
However, the slow decrease in factory-gate price inflation from the 26-year high hit in October 2021 could cushion downstream firms struggling with high raw material costs and supply bottlenecks.
Although Inflation is expected to persist for some time globally, China’s ability to deal with abnormal price fluctuations has improved, the National Development and Reform Commission said earlier in the month.
The supply of coal, oil, and gas will be “guaranteed”, the country’s state planner added in articles released earlier in February. It also forecasts that the PPI would slow down further, while the CPI picks up, in 2022.
Investors also expect the People’s Bank of China to take further action to prop up a slowing economic recovery, with lowering inflation providing it the room to do so. The central bank already pumped a net CNY100 billion ($15.75 billion) into the banking system on Tuesday via its medium-term lending facility (MFL)."

385,By Bloomberg,"<span>Feb 15, 2022 09:00PM ET</span>","China’s Inflation Slows, Giving Central Bank Room to Ease Policy","(Bloomberg) -- China’s inflation eased in January, providing Beijing with more leeway to shore up the economy ahead of a key political leadership meeting later this year. 
The producer price index rose 9.1% from a year earlier, official data showed Wednesday, weaker than economists’ forecasts for a 9.5% increase and down from 10.3% in December. Consumer prices grew 0.9% last month from a year earlier, slower than a projected 1% increase.
A moderation in inflation in recent months has given the central bank scope to cut interest rates and pump liquidity into the financial system to support a faltering economy. Beijing shifted to a more pro-growth bias late last year as a property market slump and repeated virus outbreaks dragged down growth in the world’s second-largest economy. While the People’s Bank of China refrained from cutting interest rates this week, market watchers expect further reductions in coming months.
The retreat in factory-gate inflation in January was largely due to the high base of comparison a year earlier. Higher costs in January continued to squeeze manufacturers, with purchasing managers’ surveys showing both input and output price sub-indexes signaling faster gains.
On Tuesday Premier Li Keqiang repeated the government’s pledge to keep prices stable and help companies in downstream sectors ease cost pressures. Authorities should “attach great importance to solving the constraints in economic operations and stabilize market expectations,” the regular State Council meeting chaired by Li concluded.
Consumer inflation stayed subdued, despite a seasonal spike in demand around the Lunar New Year holidays, which began on the last day of January this year. The reading was mainly dragged lower by food prices, which dropped 3.8% in January. Pork prices dropped at a faster pace of 41.6% and prices of fresh vegetables fell 4.1%. 
Core inflation, which excludes volatile energy and food prices, rose 1.2%, the same as in November and December, a sign of subdued consumer demand. Confidence remained weak during the seven-day Lunar New Year break, a usually busy time for spending, with tourism revenue down 4% from the same period last year and 44% below 2019 levels. Services inflation rose 1.7% in January.  
Economists expect China’s factory-gate inflation to continue softening during the year to reach an average of 3.9% in 2022, as supply chain bottlenecks ease and because of comparisons with last year’s higher base. The nation’s top economic planner also predicts that PPI will ease gradually, with tighter monetary policy in the rest of the world helping to weaken the rally in global commodities. Consumer prices are expected to continue their mild gains, as supplies of important necessities are sufficient, the National Development and Reform Commission said in a statement this month.

The economy added 1,135,000 positions in January from a year earlier, an 11th straight month of gains, the statistics office said Wednesday. That’s the most since March 2000 when South Korea was cementing its recovery from the Asian financial crisis. The jobless rate declined to 3.6% from 3.8% in December, exceeding the 3.7% forecast of economists.
The latest data support the view that Koreans have adjusted to living with the virus, even as the omicron variant pushes daily cases to record highs. An extra budget to help support businesses through the current tough operating restrictions is pending in parliament.
Today’s result supports the view that the economy could withstand another interest-rate increase as the Bank of Korea tries to rein in inflation and normalize monetary policy. Most economists see the central bank standing pat this month, before hiking the rate again to 1.5% in the second quarter.
At the same time, a low base effect likely contributed to the annual hiring strength: South Korea’s economy shed 982,000 jobs in January 2021, the biggest year-on-year drop since 1998, at the peak of the Asian financial crisis.
Today’s data showed the medical and welfare industries led the employment gains, with 250,000 positions added in January. Construction, lodging and information technology industries also recorded increases. The financial and insurance industry shed jobs, along with the retail and wholesale sectors.

387,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 15, 2022 05:11PM ET</span>",U.S. producer prices accelerate amid broadening inflation pressures,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. producer prices increased by the most in eight months in January amid a surge in the cost of hospital outpatient care and goods such as food and motor vehicles, another sign that high inflation could persist through much of this year.
Broadening inflation pressures were underscored by other data on Tuesday showing a measure of prices received by factories in New York state surged to a record high in February, while manufacturers reported they continued to pay higher prices for inputs. The reports followed on the heels of news last week of a strong rise in consumer prices in January, with the annual inflation rate posting its largest increase in 40 years.
Financial markets have priced in a better-than-even chance that the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates next month by half a percentage point. 
""This is further evidence of persistent and increasingly embedded inflationary pressure that should keep the Fed leaning towards even more hawkish policy,"" said Andrew Hollenhorst, chief U.S. economist at  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) in New York. ""We continue to expect data over the next month will support a 50-basis-point hike by the Fed in March.""
The producer price index for final demand jumped 1.0% last month, the biggest advance since May, after climbing 0.4% in December, the Labor Department said. 
The PPI was boosted by a 0.7% increase in services, matching the gain in December.
Services were driven by a 1.6% rise in the cost of hospital outpatient care. There were also increases in wholesale retailing for machinery, vehicles, apparel, jewelry as well as footwear. The cost of hotel and motel accommodation rose as did freight transportation by trucks. 
Portfolio management fees jumped 1.9%. But margins for fuels and lubricants retailing fell 9.7%. Airline fares dropped 4.2%.
Wholesale goods prices rebounded 1.3% after dipping 0.1% in December. A 0.8% rise in the prices of goods excluding foods and energy accounted for more than 40% of the broad increase in the costs of goods. Motor vehicle prices rose 0.7%.
Food prices advanced 1.6%, while energy products increased 2.5%. But prices for iron and steel scrap fell 10.7%. Healthcare, portfolio and airline fares are key components in the calculation of the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index, one of the inflation measures watched by the Fed. 
In the 12 months through January, the PPI rose 9.7%. That followed a 9.8% surge in December. Year-on-year PPI is slowing as last year's large increases drop out of the calculation. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the PPI would gain 0.5% on the month and advance 9.1% on a year-on-year basis.
Stocks on Wall Street were trading higher as Russia's withdrawal of some troops near its border with Ukraine assuaged fears of a potential Russian invasion. The dollar slipped against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices were trading largely lower. 
STRONG UNDERLYING INFLATION
Excluding the volatile food, energy and trade services components, producer prices rose 0.9% in January. That was the largest increase in the so-called core PPI in a year and followed a 0.4% gain in December. 
In the 12 months through January, the core PPI increased 6.9% after rising 7.0% in December.
Inflation is running well above the U.S. central bank's 2% target. Economists are expecting as many as seven rate hikes this year. Inflation pressures are also coming from strong wage gains amid tightening labor market conditions.
With the CPI and PPI data in hand, economists are estimating the core PCE price index rose by about 0.6% in January. That would result in the year-on-year rate increasing 5.2%, which would be the largest gain since early 1983. 
A shift in spending to goods from services during the COVID-19 pandemic and trillions of dollars in government pandemic relief boosted demand, which has outpaced supply, igniting inflation. An acute shortage of workers on factory floors and other places along the supply chain are making it difficult to get products to markets.
Though a survey from the New York Fed on Tuesday showed a solid improvement in employment at factories in the region, supply bottlenecks persisted, with delivery times continuing to lengthen. As a result, the survey's measure of prices paid by factories was little changed near its recent peak. 
Its gauge of prices received by manufacturers soared seventeen points to a record high of 54.1. High inflation and snarled supply chains left manufacturers less optimistic about business conditions over the next six months. The survey's measure of future business conditions dropped seven points to 28.2, the lowest reading since the early stages of the pandemic.
While the Institute for Supply Management (ISM) surveys and data on inventory accumulation have suggested some easing in supply constraints, that has not been evident in the PPI data.

""In the months ahead, the PPI will be an important bellwether to gauge if supply chain easing could lead to cooler consumer prices,"" said Will Compernolle, a senior economist at FHN Financial in New York. 
""We don't expect immediate pass-through, but an eventual slowing in producer price increases would be a sign firms are able to increase capacity to meet strong demand.""

The producer price index for final demand increased 9.7% from January of last year and 1% from the prior month, Labor Department data showed Tuesday. The gain from December was the largest in eight months. The median forecasts in a Bloomberg survey of economists called for a 9.1% year-over-year increase and a 0.5% monthly advance.
The figures, which reflected broad increases across categories, further reinforce the Federal Reserve’s intentions to begin raising interest rates next month amid mounting inflation throughout the economy. Transportation bottlenecks, robust demand and labor constraints experienced through 2021 have carried over into this year and risk keeping price pressures well-elevated.
The latest monthly advance indicates inflationary pressures in the production pipeline remain intense, which will continue to filter through into final costs of consumer goods and services.
Data last week showed that consumer prices surged in January by more than forecast, sending the annual inflation rate to a fresh four-decade high. 
Following the CPI report, some Fed officials came out in favor of more aggressive policy action at the central bank’s March meeting. But centrists among the top Fed officials appear skeptical of a half-point hike, and have suggested that there is little need to start a hiking cycle with a half percentage point move move.
Category Breakdown
The cost of energy rebounded in January after falling a month earlier, rising 2.5%. So far this month, crude oil and other energy prices have continued to climb on risks that a Russian attack on Ukraine would prompt serious sanctions by western governments.
Excluding the volatile food and energy components, the so-called core PPI increased 0.8% from a month earlier and was up by a 8.3% from a year ago. 
Prices of goods accelerated in January from a month earlier, rising 1.3%, the most in three months. 
The cost of services advanced 0.7%, matching the prior month. The report captures changes in prices paid to producers as well as margins received by wholesalers and retailers. A major factor in the January increase in the index for final demand services was hospital outpatient care prices, which rose 1.6%.
Producer prices excluding food, energy, and trade services -- a measure often preferred by economists because it strips out the most volatile components -- rose 0.9% from December, the most in a year. Compared with a year earlier, the gauge advanced 6.9%.
Costs of processed goods for intermediate demand, which reflect prices earlier in the production pipeline, rose 1.7% from a month earlier. Compared with a year earlier, the measure was up 24.1%.

The ZEW economic research institute said its economic sentiment index rose to 54.3 from 51.7 in January. A Reuters poll had pointed to a rise to 55.0.
""The economic outlook for Germany continues to improve in
February despite growing economic and political uncertainties,"" ZEW President Achim Wambach said in a statement.
""Financial market experts expect an easing of pandemic-related restrictions and an economic recovery in the first half of 2022. They still expect inflation to decline, albeit at a slower pace and from a higher level than in previous months,"" he added. ""Consequently, more than 50% of the experts now predict that short-term interest rates in the euro area will rise in
the next six months.""
An index for current conditions rose to -8.1 points from -10.2. The consensus forecast was for a reading of -6.0.

Thomas Gitzel of VP Bank said in an note that a Russian military incursion into Ukraine could derail Germany's recovery, especially if Western powers respond with sanctions on Russia's energy sector and the Kremlin stops gas deliveries to Europe.

391,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 15, 2022 05:31AM ET</span>","Spain January CPI rose 6.1% over 12 months, INE's final data show","(Reuters) -Spanish consumer prices rose 6.1% year-on-year in January, final official data showed on Tuesday, up from a first flash estimate of 6.0% released two weeks ago and down from 6.5% in the 12 months to December.
The 12-month inflation rate declined in January for the first time since February 2021, data from the National Statistics Institute (INE) showed.
Prices of housing and utilities were 18.1% higher than in January 2020, but 5 percentage points lower than the 12-month increase recorded in December, INE said in its more detailed second reading. 
Most notably, the year-on-year electricity prices increase in January was lower than in December as a severe snow storm in central Spain caused a peak of demand in January last year.
Core inflation, which strips out volatile food and energy prices, was 2.4% year on year, the highest since 2012 and up from a reading of 2.1% a month earlier, the National Statistics Institute data showed.
Even though it has slowed in January, the inflation rate in Spain was still faster than the rate in the euro zone as a whole, which stood at 5.1%. 

The group's inflation in January hit a record high, defying expectations for a big drop and piling pressure on the European Central Bank to finally admit that price growth is not as temporary and benign as it has long predicted.
However, ECB chief economist Philip Lane reiterated last week that record-high inflation rate in the euro zone was temporary.

The European Union's statistics office Eurostat confirmed its earlier estimate that gross domestic product in the 19 countries sharing the euro rose 0.3% quarter-on-quarter in the October-December period for a 4.6% year-on-year increase.
At the same time euro zone employment rose 0.5% quarter-on-quarter for 2.1% year-on-year rise, as expected by economists polled by Reuters.
Eurostat data also showed that a jump in energy prices hit the euro zone's trade balance hard pushing it into a seasonally unadjusted trade deficit of 4.6 billion euros in December from a surplus o 28.3 billion a year earlier as exports rose 14.1% while imports surged 36.7%.
Adjusted for seasonal swings, the euro zone trade deficit was even larger at 9.7 billion euros in December, up from a 1.8 billion gap in November and surpluses throughout the rest of 2021.

The more expensive energy boosted the European Union's energy trade deficit to a whopping 276.7 billion euros in 2021, up from 157.2 billion in 2020.
Europe's trade gap with its biggest energy supplier Russia more than quadrupled to 69.2 billion euros last year from 15.7 billion in 2020. The trade deficit with Norway, also a major EU energy supplier, swing to a 18 billion deficit from a 6.1 billion surplus in 2020.

TOKYO (Reuters) -Japan's economy rebounded in the final three months of 2021 as falling coronavirus cases helped prop up consumption, though rising raw material costs and a spike in new Omicron variant infections cloud the outlook.
Bank of Japan Governor Haruhiko Kuroda also highlighted escalating tensions in Ukraine as a fresh risk to the central bank's forecast for a moderate economic recovery.
The world's third-largest economy expanded an annualised 5.4% in October-December after contracting a revised 2.7% in the previous quarter, government data showed on Tuesday, falling short of a median market forecast for a 5.8% gain.
Some analysts expect the economy to slump again in the current quarter as rising COVID-19 cases keep households from shopping and supply chain disruptions hit factory output.
""The economy will likely stall in January-March or it could even contract, depending on how the Omicron variant affects service-sector consumption,"" said Takeshi Minami, chief economist at Norinchukin Research Institute.
Economic growth was driven largely by a 2.7% quarter-on-quarter rise in private consumption, which accounts for more than half of Japan's gross domestic product (GDP).
The expansion in consumer spending, which was bigger than market forecasts for a 2.2% gain, came after Japan ended coronavirus curbs in October.
Capital expenditure also rose 0.4%, roughly in line with market forecasts. External demand added 0.2% point to growth, a sign exports continued to benefit from the global recovery.
""As the economy re-opened, service consumption, such as for hotels, restaurants and entertainment, got a big boost,"" said Wakaba Kobayashi, an economist at Daiwa Institute of Research.
Japan's recovery, however, continues to lag other advanced economies, forcing the BOJ to keep monetary policy ultra-loose, even as other central banks eye interest rate hikes.
The country's seasonally-adjusted real GDP, sized around 541 trillion yen ($4.69 trillion), remains below the pre-pandemic level of late 2019.
A record spike in Omicron cases forced the government to impose loose curbs on most areas and keep borders closed, which likely dampened consumption since the outset of this year.
Rising infections have also forced some manufacturers to halt production, causing output disruptions and delivery delays at auto giants such as  Toyota  Motor (NYSE:TM) Corp.
Meanwhile, creeping import costs add risks to Japan's fragile recovery.
""Heightening tensions in Ukraine could have unfavourable effects on global and Japanese growth if they spark a surge in fuel and commodity prices,"" BOJ governor Kuroda told parliament on Tuesday.
Hiroshi Shiraishi, senior economist at BNP Paribas (OTC:BNPQY) Securities, expects economic growth to slow to an annualised pace of 1-1.5% in January-March, or even decline.
""The economy's recovery could delay into later this year as the Ukraine crisis may drive up fuel costs and dampen corporate appetite for capital expenditure,"" he said.

""There's not much left for the government and the central bank to do in terms of new stimulus measures. Both fiscal and monetary policy have reached a limit.""

394,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 15, 2022 04:56AM ET</span>",UK jobs market sends warning signal to Bank of England,"By William Schomberg and David Milliken
LONDON (Reuters) -Britain's labour market is flashing some warning signs for a central bank on guard against a wage-inflation spiral, economists said on Tuesday after official data showed a shrinking workforce and record levels of vacancies.
Annual pay growth in the final quarter of 2021 picked up to 4.3% from 4.2% in the three months to November, reflecting bigger Christmas bonuses than a year ago.
The increase was above all forecasts in a Reuters poll of economists and the Bank of England's prediction.
The central bank's Monetary Policy Committee on Feb. 3 said it expected to tightening monetary policy again soon after raising interest rates for the second time in two months to curb surging inflation pressures. 
""December's pick-up in wage growth will maintain the pressure on the MPC to hike the Bank Rate again at next month's meeting,"" Samuel Tombs, an economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said in a note to clients.
James Smith, at ING, said pay growth appeared to have stabilised at its pre-pandemic levels that were consistent with a tight jobs market.
""However, we still doubt that the UK is headed for a wage-price spiral that would justify the six rate hikes markets are now expecting from the BoE this year,"" Smith said.
The highest inflation in nearly 30 years means that in real terms pay fell in the three months to December for the first time since mid-2020, when many employees were on reduced furlough pay, according to the Office for National Statistics' preferred CPIH inflation measure.
The squeeze on living standards is a challenge for Prime Minister Boris Johnson who has authorised financial support for households to meet surging energy bills. 
BoE Governor Andrew Bailey drew criticism from unions and a rebuff from Downing Street when he said this month that workers should rein in pay demands or risk a wage-inflation spiral. 
Job vacancies hit a new high of just under 1.3 million while the share of inactive working-age people who wanted a job held at a record low.
Many older workers have dropped out of the labour force during the pandemic and there are few good estimates of how many European Union workers have permanently left Britain since Brexit. ONS data shows almost 600,000 fewer people working in Britain than before the pandemic.
ONS data showed employment was down by 38,000 in the October-to-December period, the biggest fall since the three months to February last year when Britain under was under a tough coronavirus lockdown.
But a month-by-month breakdown, which the ONS cautions can be volatile, showed employment in December surged after falling in October and November, suggesting the Omicron wave of COVID-19 cases had not hurt the jobs market.

Britain's unemployment rate for the three months to the end of December held at 4.1%, as expected by most economists polled by Reuters. 
A preliminary estimate of the number of staff on businesses' payrolls in January rose by 108,000, suggesting the hiring momentum continued into 2022 although the figure was slower than December's increase of 131,000 which itself was revised down from an original reading of 184,000.

The euro zone's fifth largest economy expanded 4.8% over the whole of 2021, which made up for the unprecedented decline of 3.8% a year before when strict lockdowns crippled production and demand.
Growth last year was mainly fuelled by a boom in consumer spending as the country opened up gradually from April to October, when the rise of the Delta variant threatened to swamp hospitals again with COVID-19 cases.
Consumer spending, however, fell 0.1% in the final three months of 2021 as coronavirus restrictions were reintroduced, while business investments went up almost 3%. 

Bars and restaurants have been allowed to reopen again under strict conditions earlier this year, and the government last week said it intends to remove most coronavirus restrictions by the end of the month.
The Dutch economy is expected to grow 3.5% this year, government policy adviser CPB said in September.

JAKARTA (Reuters) - Indonesia's export growth slowed more than expected in January, after authorities in the world's top thermal coal exporter banned coal shipments, a move that shocked the global energy market.
The January trade surplus was bigger than expected at $930 million, however, official data showed on Tuesday, compared with a $190 million surplus seen in a Reuters poll, as imports rose more slowly than predicted.
Indonesia on Jan. 1 suspended coal exports due to low inventory at power plants. Shipments resumed gradually from Jan. 10 but the ban still applies to miners not compliant with domestic sales requirements.
The resource-rich country has recorded a trade surplus every month since May 2020 due to an upward trend in commodity prices as countries lift COVID-19 restrictions.
January's exports grew 25.31% annually, short of the 33.86% expected in a Reuters poll and the slowest increase in the past year. Total exports were valued at $19.16 billion, the smallest since June.
Exports of products classified as mineral fuel - much of which is coal - dropped by $2 billion from December, with shipments to China, India and the Philippines most affected. 
Tin exports fell $259 million in January from a month earlier, due to delays issuing export permits.
Meanwhile, imports increased 36.77% to $18.23 billion, compared to 51.38% expected in the poll.
""I see this as a good situation, that even without the support of coal in January we could still book a surplus. This means with the reopening of exports in February, we will see surplus soaring,"" said Trimegah Securities economist Fakhrul Fulvian.

Bank Danamon economist Wisnu Wardana said consumer goods imports were typically weaker early each year and vaccine purchase was low in January, but imports continue to rise, pressuring the trade surplus.
""Demand will accelerate more in 2H22, which will be followed by a widening current account deficit to 1.9% of GDP this year and a higher volatility of the rupiah,"" he said.

(Reuters) -U.S. consumers lowered their expectations for how much inflation will rise in the near-term and medium-term periods, signaling that inflation concerns may be easing, according to a survey released on Monday by the New York Federal Reserve.
One-year inflation expectations decreased for the first time since October 2020, dropping to a median of 5.8% in January from 6.0% in December, according to the New York Fed's monthly survey of consumer expectations. Inflation expectations three years out declined to 3.5% in January from 4.0% in December, showing the largest monthly drop since the survey was launched in 2013. 
Consumers also said they expect the cost of food, rent, gas, and medical care to rise more slowly in the year ahead, according to the survey. Despite the decrease in inflation expectations, both short-term and medium-term expectations remained above pre-pandemic levels, the survey found.
U.S. central bank officials are watching inflation expectations closely and are under more pressure to act after data released last week showed that prices increased 7.5% on a year-on-year basis in January, the fastest annual pace in 40 years.

However, new research released on Monday in a blog post co-authored by New York Fed President John Williams found that inflation surprises are having a smaller influence on medium-term and long-term inflation expectations now than they did before the COVID-19 pandemic.
""These findings indicate that consumers are taking less signal than before the pandemic from inflation news in updating their longer-term expectations, and that they do not view the current elevated inflation as very long-lasting,"" researchers wrote.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) -India's wholesale price index stayed in the double digits in January, for the 10th month in a row, as firms grapple with rising input costs and more pass on higher prices to consumers.
Wholesale prices in January rose 12.96% from a year earlier, less than the previous month's 13.56%, government data showed on Monday. It was higher than the 12.70% forecast in a Reuters poll of analysts, in part due to higher food prices - up 9.55% on the year, versus 9.24% in December.
Rising input costs for products such as fuel, metals and chemicals have pushed up wholesale prices, a proxy for producer prices. Headline retail inflation is hovering around 5.5%, still within the Reserve Bank of India's 2%-6% target.
Many economists have warned that despite RBI's estimates of inflationary pressures easing, rising oil and food prices pose a risk to inflation. 
""The continuous hardening in crude oil prices exacerbated by the ongoing geopolitical concerns, and its impact on the rupee, poses the biggest risk to the WPI inflation trajectory in the ongoing quarter,"" said Aditi Nayar, chief economist at rating agency ICRA, the Indian arm of Moody's (NYSE:MCO). 
RBI's monetary policy committee (MPC) left the benchmark repo rate unchanged at 4.0% last week, while sticking to its accommodative policy stance to help the economy recover from the pandemic. 
The central bank has slashed the repo rate by a total of 115 basis points (bps) since March 2020 to soften the blow from the coronavirus pandemic and tough containment measures. The rate is now 250 bps below the level at the beginning of 2019, when the easing cycle began.
Consumer price-based inflation, the main gauge monitored by the monetary policy committee of the RBI, was at a five-month high of 5.59% in December.

Wholesale fuel and power prices in January rose 32.27% on year versus 32.30% in December, while manufactured product prices rose 9.55%, against 10.62% in the prior month.
Wholesale prices of food accelerated at a 9.55% pace, versus 9.24% the previous month.

BOGOTA (Reuters) - Colombia's economic growth probably slowed in the final quarter of 2021, but is expected to have hit a new annual record after authorities lifted coronavirus curbs and adopted expansive policies, a Reuters poll showed on Friday.
According to the median forecast from 16 analysts, Colombia's fourth-quarter gross domestic product (GDP) is forecast to have grown 8.5% compared with the year earlier, slowing from 13.2% in the third quarter.
That would bring overall 2021 growth for Latin America's fourth-largest economy to a record 10% after it contracted 6.8% in 2020 during the worst of the pandemic's economic impact.
The Andean nation's growth was led by household consumption, with spending of savings accumulated during the pandemic, as well as strong fiscal spending and historically low interest rates, analysts said.
""A favorable external environment, the absence of restrictions on mobility ... and expansive macroeconomic policies on the fiscal and monetary front would've supported a significant recovery in GDP in 2021,"" said Itau bank analyst David Cubides.
The government's DANE statistics agency will publish the 2021 data on Feb. 15.
However, growth could slow to 4.1% this year, according to the poll's median forecast, with high inflation expected to prompt the central bank to further raise interest rates to rein in prices.
Additionally, the economy may also have to contend with lower fiscal spending and uncertainty ahead of presidential elections on May 29.
""Undoubtedly, politics will be key to economic performance this year and there is a non-negligible risk that it could affect recovery, as well as the medium-term outlook,"" Andres Pardo, the head of strategy for macroeconomics in Latin America for XP (NASDAQ:XP) Investments, said.

406,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 11, 2022 11:50AM ET</span>",U.S. consumer sentiment hit more than 10-year low; inflation fears mount,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) -U.S. consumer sentiment fell to its lowest level in more than a decade in early February amid expectations that inflation would continue to increase in the near term, but that was unlikely to derail spending against the backdrop of excess savings and a strengthening labor market recovery.
The decline in sentiment reported by the University of Michigan on Friday was entirely among households with incomes of $100,000 or more, which could reflect falling stock market prices.
It followed news on Thursday that consumer prices recorded their largest annual increase in 40 years in January, which prompted markets to price in a hefty 50 basis points interest rate hike from the Federal Reserve next month.
""But will this cool down consumer spending and crimp the recovery?"" said Robert Frick, corporate economist with Navy Federal Credit Union in Vienna, Virginia. ""That's doubtful, given spending and sentiment diverged when government stimulus put hundreds of billions into consumers' bank accounts and spending rose while sentiment dropped. Much of that money is still there, as is pent-up demand for services.""
The University of Michigan's preliminary consumer sentiment index dropped to 61.7 in the first half of this month, the lowest since October 2011, from a final reading of 67.2 in January. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the index edging up to 67.5. 
The index is sensitive to gasoline prices and the stock market. It is, however, much weaker than most other sentiment measures, including the Conference Board, which is comfortably above levels hit during the first mandatory COVID-19 lockdowns in the spring of 2020. The Conference Board survey puts more weight on the labor market, which is rapidly churning out jobs.
""The continuing relative weakness in this measure of confidence seems overdone relative to fundamentals,"" said Scott Hoyt, a senior director for Moody's (NYSE:MCO) Analytics in West Chester, Pennsylvania. ""A rebound is likely, and this index may rise more than some others. However, the timing is uncertain and likely depends on gasoline prices, infection rates, the stock market, broader inflation, and events in Washington and overseas.""
According to the University of Michigan sentiment among households with incomes of $100,000 or more dropped by 16.1% from last month. The impact of higher inflation on personal finances was spontaneously cited by one-third of all consumers, with nearly half of all consumers expecting declines in their inflation adjusted incomes during the year ahead, it said.
The survey's gauge of current economic conditions fell to a reading of 68.5, the lowest since August 2011 from 72.0 in January. Its measure of consumer expectations declined to 57.4, the lowest since November 2011, from 64.1 in January. 

The survey's one-year inflation expectations rose to 5.0%, highest since July 2008, from 4.9% in January. Its five-to-10-year inflation outlook held steady at an 11-year high of 3.1%.
""The Fed's view that inflation running slightly below 2% was a problem was one that consumers never saw as a problem, but consumers now see inflation as the problem,"" said Conrad DeQuadros, senior economic advisor at Brean Capital in New York.

LONDON (Reuters) -Britain suffered a smaller economic hit than feared in December as COVID-19 cases mounted, capping a historic two-year collapse and rebound for the world's fifth-biggest economy, but surging inflation is set to slow the recovery in 2022.
Gross domestic product (GDP) fell 0.2% in December - as many people worked from home and avoided Christmas socialising due to the Omicron coronavirus variant - following growth of 0.7% the month before, official data showed.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast a 0.6% monthly fall.
The quarterly pace of expansion held steady at 1.0%, helped by the public health service, couriers and employment agencies.
December GDP matched its level in February 2020, just before the pandemic struck. Output in the fourth quarter was slightly below that in the final three months of 2019.
The economy grew 7.5% in 2021 - the biggest annual rise since 1941, when Britain was rearming during World War Two - after a 9.4% collapse in 2020, the largest since the aftermath of World War One.
The slump and rebound are the biggest among the Group of Seven rich nations, in part reflecting Britain's high number of COVID-19 deaths and reliance on consumer-facing services but also different conventions for measuring public-sector output.
COVID-19 infections have fallen sharply since the turn of the year and the Bank of England expects output, measured on a quarterly basis, will return to its pre-pandemic size by the end of March.
The central bank sees much greater headwinds from fast-rising inflation, which it expects to peak at a 30-year high of around 7.25% in April when domestic power tariffs will leap.
""The UK economy is facing a materially weaker 2022 as the crippling burden of rising inflation, soaring energy bills and higher taxes on consumers and businesses dampens activity,"" Suren Thiru, head of economics at the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC), said.
The BoE has raised interest rates twice since December and investors are pricing in rates of 2% by the end of this year.
The BCC called on the government to scrap a planned rise in payroll taxes levied on workers and businesses - something finance minister Rishi Sunak has repeatedly ruled out.
SERVICES WITHOUT A SMILE
Services output fell 0.5% in December, driven by a 3.0% fall in consumer-facing services such as retail and hospitality. Output for consumer-facing services is still more than 8% below its pre-pandemic level.
Stripping out greater spending on healthcare, overall GDP would still be more than 1% below its pre-pandemic level.
Separate data showed Britain's trade deficit in goods and services widened to 28.8 billion pounds ($39.1 billion) last year from a 2.9 billion-pound surplus in 2020, although 2021's figure was broadly in line with deficits from 2015-2018.
Britain's goods trade deficit with the European Union fell to 70.2 billion pounds, its lowest since 2013, during the first year that new trading arrangements with the EU took effect.
British goods exports to the EU halved in January 2021, due to temporary disruptions from new customs arrangements and stockpiling in the months before. They are now broadly back at pre-Brexit levels, while imports are some way below.
Some economists warn that the drop in overall trade volumes with the EU is damaging and that British exporters are failing to keep up with a global boom in demand for manufactured goods, losing market share.

""While COVID has undoubtedly damaged trade, so too has the introduction of fresh trade barriers with the EU,"" said James Smith, research director at the Resolution Foundation think tank.

Prices rose by 0.2% from December as gas, hotel stays and used cars became more expensive, offsetting falling prices for private transport and for clothing and footwear amid seasonal sales, official statistics showed.
SNB Chairman Thomas Jordan said last month that central banks needed to take a global surge in inflation seriously, but that the SNB saw Swiss inflation near its peak.
He stuck to the SNB's forecast that Swiss inflation would be around 1% this year.
""Inflation was stronger than expected in Switzerland in January, although the upward surprise was not in the same league as that seen in the euro zone and Swiss inflation is still consistent with the SNB’s definition of price stability,"" Capital Economics analyst Michael Tran said in a note.
""In any case, January is likely to be the peak and we think that the headline rate will fall back below 1.0% over the coming months."" he added.

The SNB has used a -0.75% policy rate and currency intervention for years to curb the safe-haven Swiss franc's strength.
""While there isn’t much to trouble the SNB on the inflation front, the shift in the monetary backdrop has brought Swiss rate hikes onto the horizon,"" Tran said, forecasting the SNB could raise the policy rates back to zero by the end of 2023.

The ministry attributed the January growth to strong demand for tech exports such as electronic components as well as chips, a shortage of which has crippled car plants globally and is affecting consumer electronics.
Exports were also boosted by stockpiling ahead of the Lunar New Year holiday in the first week of February, it added.
Exports of electronics components rose 19.7% in January to reach $15.91 billion, with semiconductor exports growing 20.9% and telecommunication and audio-visual products gaining 14.3% from a year earlier.
Many companies expect chip shortages to last at least for the rest of the year, which will continue to fill Taiwanese semiconductor firms' order books.
Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd (TSMC) on Thursday reported a 35.8% on-year rise in net revenues for January to T$172.18 billion ($6.19 billion).
Firms such as TSMC are major suppliers to Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) and other global tech giants, as well as providers of chips for auto companies and lower-end consumer electronics.
The finance ministry warned of risks ahead, including uncertainty over the COVID-19 pandemic as well as supply chain bottlenecks and China-U.S. frictions.
But it said Taiwan's first quarter exports could maintain double-digit growth, thanks to sustained global demand for tech products like chips along with a steady improvement in global economic fundamentals.
January exports to China, Taiwan's largest trading partner, grew an annual 5.7% to $15.70 billion, compared with a 16.2% on-year rise in December, while exports to the United States jumped 34.2%, faster than the 29% rise recorded the previous month.
Imports leapt 24.9%, in line with economists' expectations of a 25% rise, after an increase of 28.1% in December.

Taiwan could see February exports increase in the range of 13% to 15% from a year earlier, the ministry said.

The survey of almost 28,000 firms across all sectors showed that 64% of companies saw rising energy and raw material prices as a business risk, the highest ever recorded in a DIHK survey, compared to 58% in the organization's previous poll.
The balance of companies' positive and negative expectations also dropped to five points from 10, compared to the long-term average of seven points, the data showed.
Only around 10% of companies expect supply bottlenecks to end by mid-2022 and 22% say they do not expect the situation to improve until 2023, DIHK said.
""We will probably not reach the pre-crisis level of our economic output until the middle of the year,"" DIHK Managing Director Martin Wansleben said, adding expected cost increases due to energy transformation may discourage some investors.
""Germany as a business location has the world's highest energy prices at the moment. The tax burden for companies is also well above the average for all OECD countries,"" Wansleben said.

Just under a third of companies intend to invest more in 2022, while just under a fifth intend to invest less, DIHK said.
""The economy is holding its breath. It is true there is still a cautiously optimistic sentiment among companies. However, there are major uncertainties and many do not know what the future holds,"" the director said.

411,By Bloomberg,"<span>Feb 11, 2022 02:27AM ET</span>",U.K. Economy Sees Best Annual Growth Since World War II in 2021,"(Bloomberg) -- The U.K. economy expanded at the fastest pace since World War II last year after suffering a milder hit than expected in December.
The 7.5% expansion was the largest since 1941 and made Britain the fastest-growing advanced economy in 2021. Gross domestic product fell 0.2% in December as the spread of the omicron variant kept consumers at home. 
The figures will be welcomed by Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who is grappling with a brutal cost of living crisis and facing calls to resign over alleged rule breaking parties when the country was in lockdown. They will also keep the Bank of England focused on efforts to curb surging inflation, with more interest-rate increases likely in coming months. 
After suffering a deeper pandemic recession than its major peers, contracting 9.4% in 2020, the U.K. has enjoyed a stronger recovery, aided by billions of pounds of government aid to support jobs and firms through the crisis. The economy is forecast to outperform other Group of Seven nations once again this year. 
Thanks to “our package of support and making the right calls at the right time, the economy has been remarkably resilient,” said Chancellor of the Exchequer Rishi Sunak.
However, Britain has yet to return to its pre-pandemic levels of output on a quarterly basis, a milestone already surpassed by the U.S. and France. 
The fall in GDP in December was entirely due to a 0.5% contraction in the services sector, where hospitality venues were hit by mass cancellations in the run-up to Christmas, and retailers saw a collapse in footfall, after the government imposed curbs to contain the spread of omicron. 
Businesses across the economy were also hampered by widespread absences linked to the virus and continued supply-chain disruptions. On the plus side, health-care output rose, driven by the rollout of vaccine booster shots.  
The loss of output in December limited growth in the fourth quarter to just 1%, leaving GDP 0.4% below its level at the end of 2019. With omicron restrictions extending into the new year, January is also expected to be weak.
BOE forecasts published Feb. 3 show the economy stagnating in the first quarter, but rebounding strongly in the following three months to return to its pre-Covid size. The bank has hiked rates at it two previous meetings, taking the benchmark to 0.5%, and markets are pricing in a rapid series of further moves this year.

KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - Malaysia's economy returned to growth in the fourth quarter last year with the central bank expecting the recovery to continue this year despite risks of further disruptions caused by the coronavirus pandemic.
Gross domestic product rose 3.6% in the October-December period, Bank Negara Malaysia (BNM) said on Friday, faster than the 3.3% rise forecast in a Reuters poll and up from a 4.5% decline in the previous quarter.
Malaysia's full-year economic performance expanded 3.1% in 2021, rebounding from the 5.6% drop in 2020, the country's worst annual performance since the 1998 Asian Financial Crisis.
BNM said Malaysia's economic recovery was expected to continue in line with improved global and domestic demand.
Risks remain to the downside, however, mainly due to concerns over ""severe and vaccine-resistant COVID-19 variants"" that could trigger new containment curbs ""globally and domestically,"" BNM Governor Nor Shamsiah Mohd Yunus told a news conference.
Malaysia has seen a resurgence in COVID-19 cases in recent weeks, mostly from the highly transmissible Omicron variant of the coronavirus.
However, the government has vowed not to reimpose lockdowns amid a ramped-up COVID-19 inoculation programme.
Nearly 80% of the country's 32 million population has received at least two doses of COVID-19 vaccine, while more than a third has received a booster.
Capital Economics analyst Alex Holmes said in a note the impact of new infections should be relatively mild and brief given high vaccination rates.
The economic recovery will also likely be boosted by the reopening of international borders, with Malaysia planning to end mandatory quarantine for inbound travellers on March 1, he said. 
Nor Shamsiah said headline inflation is expected to remain moderate this year and denied speculation Malaysia was experiencing signs of hyperinflation or stagflation.
She said the current monetary policy stance was considered appropriate and accommodative and that BNM was mindful of any premature withdrawal of policy support. 
Last month, the central bank left its key interest rate unchanged at a record low of 1.75% to support continued recovery.
Malaysia is projecting 2022 economic growth of between 5.5%-6.5%.
Any revisions to the official outlook will be announced on March 30, along with the central bank's decision on digital banking licenses, Nor Shamsiah said.

BNM has received 29 bids for the licenses so far, with only five expected to be issued.

The January surplus compared to a January 2021 deficit of $163 billion, a record for the month as direct payments to individuals from COVID-19 aid legislation enacted in December 2020 were distributed.
The surplus last month was the first since the $83 billion reported in September 2019 and the largest since the $160 billion in April 2019. April and September are traditionally months with high tax collections.
The January receipts grew by 21% to $465 billion, boosted by a 21% jump in individual withheld income and payroll taxes that reflected higher employment and earnings due to the economic recovery.
January outlays fell 37% to $346 billion, partly as they did not include $142 billion in individual stimulus payments sent in January 2021.

The surplus for the month also was helped by the recognition of $70 billion in proceeds from a wireless spectrum auction, a U.S. Treasury official said.
For the first four months of the 2022 fiscal year that started Oct. 1, the Treasury reported a deficit of $259 billion, a 65% decline from the year-earlier deficit of $736 billion. Year-to-date receipts grew 28% to $1.52 trillion, while outlays for the period fell 8% to $1.78 trillion.

416,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 10, 2022 02:15PM ET</span>",U.S. consumer prices post largest annual gain in 40 years; weekly jobless claims fall,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. consumer prices rose solidly in January, leading to the biggest annual increase in inflation in 40 years, fueling financial markets speculation for a 50 basis points interest rate hike from the Federal Reserve next month.
The broad increase in prices reported by the Labor Department on Thursday was led by soaring costs for rents, electricity and food, and could heap more political pressure on President Joe Biden, whose popularity has been declining amid anxiety over the rising cost of living. 
High inflation has overshadowed a strong economy, which grew at its fastest pace in 37 years in 2021 and a labor market that is rapidly churning out jobs.
""While this report, on its own, might not trigger a 50 basis points inaugural rate hike from the Fed, the pressure will continue to mount if inflation doesn't begin to rollover this spring as policymakers anticipate,"" said Sal Guatieri, a senior economist at BMO Capital Markets in Toronto.
The consumer price index gained 0.6% last month after a similar increase in December. The food index rose 0.9%, with the cost of food consumed at home increasing 1.0%. There strong increases in the prices of cereals and bakery products, dairy, fruits and vegetables. Meat prices rose moderately. 
Electricity prices jumped 4.2%, offsetting a 0.8% decline in the cost of gasoline and a 0.5% drop in natural gas.
In the 12 months through January, the CPI jumped 7.5%, the biggest year-on-year increase since February 1982. 
That followed a 7.0% advance in December and marked the fourth straight month of annual increases in excess of 6%. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the CPI rising 0.5% on month and accelerating 7.3% on a year-on-year basis.
Effective with the January report, the CPI was re-weighted based on consumer expenditure data from 2019-2020.
The economy is grappling with high inflation, caused by a shift in spending to goods from services during the COVID-19 pandemic. Trillions of dollars in pandemic relief fired up spending, which ran against capacity constraints as the coronavirus sidelined workers needed to produce and move goods to consumers.
U.S. stocks opened lower. The dollar rose against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices fell.

EYES ON THE FED
The Fed is expected to start raising rates in March to rein in inflation, which has overshot the U.S. central bank's 2% target. Financial markets are predicting nearly even odds of a 50 basis points increase, according to CME's FedWatch tool.
Market predictions are partly driven by the fact that price pressures are broadening, with several measures of wage inflation increasing strongly in recent months. 
Economists, however, believe it is unlikely that the Fed would move so aggressively. They expect the central bank to raise rates by 25 basis points at least seven times this year.
""Rather, the Fed would be more likely to guide to an accelerated pace of hikes at consecutive meetings to crack down on inflation,"" said Scott Ruesterholz, a portfolio manager at Insight Investment in New York.
Excluding the volatile food and energy components, the CPI increased 0.6% last month, matching December's rise. It was the seventh time in the last 10 months that the so-called core CPI has increased at least 0.5%. Underlying inflation last month was driven by a 0.5% increase in rents.
It was also boosted by strong gains in the prices for household furnishings and operations as well as used cars and trucks. Healthcare costs rose 0.7%, lifted by hospital services and prescription medication.
In the 12 months through January, the so-called core CPI jumped 6.0%. That was the largest year-on-year gain since August 1982 and followed a 5.5% advance in December.
Monthly inflation could slow in the coming months amid an easing in supply bottlenecks as coronavirus infections driven by the Omicron variant subside.
Government data this week showed goods imports increased to a record high in December as ships offloaded their cargo after months of delays because of labor shortages at ports. Wholesale motor vehicle inventories increased by the most in 10 years in December.
Still, inflation will remain high for a while, in part reflecting the delayed impact of rising wages. Employers are boosting compensation as they compete for scarce workers. There were 10.9 million job openings at the end of December.
""The factors that have driven inflation higher in 2021 are only expected to dissipate gradually and are likely to keep pushing inflation higher through the first half of 2022,"" said Kevin Cummins (NYSE:CMI), chief U.S. economist at NatWest Markets in Stamford, Connecticut. 
""We expect that there will be a shift from goods inflation, particularly motor vehicle and commodities prices to more persistent services inflation, such as wages and heavily weighted rents.""

A separate report from the Labor Department on Thursday showed initial claims for state unemployment benefits fell 16,000 to a seasonally adjusted 223,000 for the week ended Feb. 5. Economists had forecast 230,000 applications for the latest week. Claims increased from the beginning of January through the middle of the month as Omicron raged across the country. 
They have dropped from a record high of 6.149 million in early April of 2020.

(Reuters) -U.S. mortgage rates increased to a two-year high last week and could keep rising, a trend which may further squeeze first-time buyers struggling to overcome higher home prices and limited housing supply.
Rates for a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage averaged 3.69% for the week ending Feb. 10, up from 3.55% the previous week, according to a report https://freddiemac.gcs-web.com/news-releases/news-release-details/mortgage-rates-jump-5 released on Thursday by  Freddie Mac  (OTC:FMCC). Mortgage rates are now the highest they've been since January 2020, shortly before the start of the pandemic. 
""The normalization of the economy continues as mortgage rates jumped to the highest level since the emergence of the pandemic,"" Sam Khater, chief economist for Freddie Mac, said in a statement.
Mortgage rates are likely to continue rising in the coming months as the Federal Reserve raises interest rates to combat higher inflation. Investors increasingly expect the Fed to raise rates by half a percentage point next month after data released Thursday showed that annual inflation increased in January by the most in 40 years https://www.reuters.com/business/us-consumer-prices-rise-strongly-january-weekly-jobless-claims-fall-2022-02-10. 
The higher borrowing costs could weigh on would-be home buyers feeling pessimistic about the housing market.

Home prices continued to rise in the fourth quarter of 2021, but at a slower pace. The median price of a single-family home increased by 14.6% from the previous year, compared with an increase of 15.9% in the third quarter, according to a report released Thursday by the National Association of Realtors.

COMMENTS:
TOM PORCELLI, CHIEF US ECONOMIST, RBC CAPITAL MARKETS, NEW YORK
“Interestingly enough, and just something to note, they just changed the weighting, the CPI did, of goods.  Goods now have more of a weighting, which again makes sense, because it’s based on what spending happened last year. So the weight of goods prices are now very elevated relative to what we saw prior. So if I’m right that you’re going to have this transition from goods to services spending, and there’s a bigger weight now for goods, what’s going to happen to goods prices? It probably falls even more than what I originally thought. That’s a long way of saying I think you get some acceleration in the immediate term, but I do think by the end of the year we’ll be in a very different place from an inflation perspective, a better place. So much of it is contingent on that idea, you need this transition to take place between goods and services.”
“We all expected an acceleration here…is 7.5% to 7.3% the difference between a 25 and a 50 (basis point hike)? No. I sincerely hope that the Fed’s reaction function is not that sensitive to this kind of miss. Because the reality is we’ve had firm inflation now for months. This is the number that’s going to push them over the edge? I don’t think that they’re supposed to go 50 basis points. I think they are supposed to go 25 basis points and I think they are supposed to have a lot of patience between now and the balance of the year.”
JAMIE COX, MANAGING PARTNER, HARRIS FINANCIAL GROUP, RICHMOND, VIRGINIA
  “All eyes are on the Fed in March. Markets are starting to price in a 50 basis point hike as opposed to a gradual increase in the Fed funds rate starting in March.”
“Markets are definitely taking this data under consideration as a likelihood to increase that probability. At this point, everyone knew that the inflation data was going to be hot. That's not a surprise. But the clues that everybody's looking for is whether or not the data is hot enough to induce the Fed to raise rates quicker.”
“I think that they're (Fed) more likely to work off the balance sheet at a higher rate, sort of spin down. I don't think they're going to go fast on the Fed funds rate. They would preferentially choose to hike every meeting as opposed to doing larger fed fund rate increases.”
“Markets are going to continue to transition from growth to value and that rotation is going to be in play in earnest here for a while. The rotation that started in fits and starts last year is now going to be more of a permanent condition.”
JAI MALHI, GLOBAL MARKET STRATEGIST, JPMORGAN ASSET MANAGEMENT
“US inflation has consistently beaten expectations and today’s inflation release saw more of the same. This provides a significant challenge for the Fed as it aims to keep price increases under control while at the same time sustaining the economic expansion.
“High energy prices and supply issues are stoking inflation but these issues should eventually fade. Of greater concern is that wage pressures are building and the central bank will not want to risk a wage price spiral. Looking ahead though, real consumer spending on discretionary goods and services is likely to cool naturally, as higher energy costs begin to bite. 
“The bond market is currently suggesting that there is a good chance the Fed will hike rates more than 5 times by the end of the year. While today’s release will be uncomfortable reading for the Fed, the squeeze on real incomes suggests they can perhaps afford to be a little more patient than the market thinks.”
BRIAN BATTLE, DIRECTOR OF TRADING, PERFORMANCE TRUST CAPITAL PARTNERS, CHICAGO
    “These are the biggest numbers in decades. However economic statistics have no value right now because of the statistical noise due to the lockdowns ... The statistics are full off exceptions.”
    “The numbers came in about as expected. So it'll affect the market two ways. One, the Federal Reserve is going to raise rates. These numbers support their case for quantitative easing and to raise rates, so those two things are still on the table.""
    ""So what matters to us out here in the field is how much are they going to raise rates? At what speed we can't tell right now, but we know that their intentions will not be thwarted by these numbers.”
KATHY LIEN, MANAGING DIRECTOR, BK ASSET MANAGEMENT, NEW YORK
“Ultimately, this is a very dollar-positive number. It sent the dollar up pretty much across the board, particularly against the Japanese yen. Fifty basis points is going to be back on the table for March. I still think they’re going to go with 25, but you can see from the fed fund futures that 50 bps odds have jumped to about 45%. 
“The market is shifting its positioning, it’s something that investors can’t ignore.  We had a very quiet week for the most part, with the euro-dollar and dollar-yen, this is the number we've been waiting for. The confirmation that we've got hot inflation means that it's all-go on monetary tightening.”
BRIAN JACOBSEN, SENIOR INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, ALLSPRING GLOBAL INVESTMENTS, MENOMONEE FALLS, WISCONSIN
“With good jobless claims and hotter than expected inflation, the hawks are having a field day at the Fed. I’m not expecting monthly inflation relief until March. The Fed will likely accelerate its balance sheet runoff to May instead of risking a 50 bps hike. They have a couple levers to pull to remove accommodation. The optics around a faster or sooner balance sheet runoff are probably better than a bigger than typical hike.”
PAUL NOLTE, PORTFOLIO MANAGER, KINGSVIEW INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT, CHICAGO
    ""Where we're seeing it really play out is in the bond market. So we're seeing the spread between the 2/10s come in a little bit more. We're getting down to the 50 level, which for us is kind of the trigger point for a countdown to a recession. It is another data point that points to the fact the Fed will be in the market raising rates, and at some point during that rate hiking cycle you'll likely see something break in the economy. That's what we've seen historically from the Fed.""
SUBADRA RAJAPPA, HEAD OF US RATES STRATEGY, SOCIETE GENERALE, NEW YORK
“This number re-emphasizes the sense of urgency for the Fed to act.” 
“The market is starting to price in a much more aggressive path of rate hikes and this really starts to increase the odds of perhaps a 50-basis points rate hike at one of the meetings, but broadly speaking we’re pretty much fully priced in for a hike per meeting between now and July.”
JOE SALUZZI, CO-MANAGER, TRADING, THEMIS TRADING, NEW JERSEY
“That's more than expected. So now the market is going to be worrying - are we getting a 50 basis point hike instead of a 25? And the whole story of how many we're going to get, how often it's going to be and what's the pace of rate hikes.”
“The reason we don't know is if it's supply or demand driven still. Part of it is supply driven. And if that kind of works itself out, then it's more of a temporary thing and it will come down.”
“The hawkishness is built into the market at this point. It's in there. So that's why I'm kind of surprised that they sold off as much as they did. I wouldn't be surprised if we see a bounce back rally come mid-day today in the stock market.”
ART HOGAN, CHIEF MARKET STRATEGIST, NATIONAL SECURITIES, NEW YORK
""The data obviously came in a bit hotter-than-expected but people were expecting a hot number to begin with, so it was pretty well priced into the market because everyone has been talking about inflation.""
""So at this one point in time, it doesn't sway the market in terms of what the Fed is going to do in March.""
""We also have to look at the way the market was set up before the data, three in the last four days were positive and you are coming from a place where everyone put inflation worries in the back burner for a bit and focused more on better corporate earnings.""
""Markets have been very constructive leading up to this news, especially with the Nasdaq retracing about half its losses from January lows, so we are certainly at a place where the reaction function has a downside to it.""
PETER CARDILLO, CHIEF MARKET ECONOMIST, SPARTAN CAPITAL SECURITIES, NEW YORK
“CPI came in a bit on the high side, and it doesn’t suggest inflation is peaking anytime soon. It might mean the Fed could get more aggressive. The jury is still out whether we’ll have a 25-basis-point or 50-basis-point rate hike in March.” 
“Obviously, this means (10-year Treasury yields) will test the 2% pretty quickly, and the dollar is strengthening.”

“I would say inflation will peak in the beginning of the fourth quarter. There are still bottlenecks out there. The real test is wages. Last week’s employment data suggests salaries are taking off. That’s structural.” 
“We’ll see in February employment data to see if there’s another increase in wages. That could the key point as to whether the Fed gets more aggressive.”

Initial unemployment claims decreased by 16,000 to 223,000 in the week ended Feb. 5, Labor Department data showed Thursday. The median estimate called for 230,000 applications in a Bloomberg survey of economists.
Continuing claims for state benefits were unchanged at 1.62 million in the week ended Jan. 29.
Claims have been falling for the past few weeks as the labor market gets back on track from the spread of the omicron variant, which led to a surge in unemployment applications over the new year. More broadly, claims are trending toward pre-pandemic levels as companies struggle to retain and attract talent amid ongoing labor shortages, keeping layoffs at a record low.
On an unadjusted basis, initial claims decreased to 228,909 last week. 
Kentucky, Tennessee and Illinois were states registering the biggest decreases in unadjusted claims. Michigan had the largest increase.

The consumer index of the University of the Thai Chamber of Commerce fell 3% on a monthly basis to 44.8 in January.
Consumer spending is likely to remain sluggish in the first quarter, with political uncertainty adding to concerns, the university said, following signs of discord growing https://reut.rs/3BcTLjF in the coalition government https://reut.rs/3HILh6b.
Spending on Valentine's Day for instance is set to drop to a 15-year low of 2 billion baht ($61.12 million), university president Thanavath Phonvichai told a briefing.
""Goods are expensive, the outbreak is still there, and political stability is not that good,"" he said.
But he added the economy could still grow by 3.5% to 4.0% this year on expectations that coronavirus infections will ease by March and high goods prices will be temporary.
Inflation, which hit a nine-month high of 3.23% in January, has yet to impact the country's economic outlook and there is no pressure on the central bank to rush to raise rates, he added.

On Wednesday, the central bank kept its key interest rate at a record low of 0.50% again and ruled out an immediate need to adjust policy.

The quarter's growth was driven by a 10.8% rise in oil activities and a 5% increase in non-oil activities, the General Authority for Statistics said. Government services increased by 2.4%.
""The increase in oil production is being reflected in the 4Q GDP data, and is supporting real oil sector growth. We see this trend continuing in 2022 as oil output rises further,"" said Monica Malik, chief economist at Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank.
Quarter-on-quarter, seasonally adjusted real GDP grew by 1.6% in the fourth quarter, the authority said.
Saudi Arabia notched 7% growth in the third quarter, its fastest expansion in about a decade.
GDP growth for the full year was a marked turn from the 4.1% contraction in 2020, when oil crashed and economies across the world were hammered by the pandemic's impact.

The estimated 3.3% expansion came above the government's forecast of 2.9% growth for 2021. Riyadh expects the Saudi economy to grow 7.4% next year.
Economists polled by Reuters last month had forecast GDP growth of 2.8% this year and 5.7% next year.

424,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 09, 2022 10:10PM ET</span>","Japan's Jan consumer inflation slows, trade deficit biggest in 8 years - Reuters poll","TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's core consumer inflation likely slowed in January from the previous month, a Reuters poll showed, reinforcing expectations the country's central bank will lag well behind other economies in raising interest rates.
Separate data is also expected to show Japan likely ran the biggest trade deficit in eight years in January as persistent rises in fuel and raw material costs swelled imports, according to economists polled by Reuters.
The nationwide core consumer price index (CPI) likely rose 0.3% in January from a year earlier, slowing from a 0.5% gain in December, the poll of 16 economists showed on Friday.
The slowdown is largely due to one-off factors such as the base effect from a suspension of the government's travel discount campaign in late 2020.
When stripping away such temporary factors, consumer inflation is likely to be perking up, analysts say.
""Imported goods prices have been rising, and the effect is spreading to previously soft domestic prices,"" said Takeshi Minami, chief economist at Norinchukin Research Institute.
And yet, many analysts expect consumer inflation to remain distant from the Bank of Japan's 2% target for the time being, forcing the central bank to maintain ultra-loose policy.
Separate data will likely show Japan suffered a trade deficit of 1,607 billion yen ($13.91 billion) in January, the biggest shortfall since January 2014.
Imports likely jumped 37.1% in January on rising raw material and fuel costs, outpacing a 16.5% gain in exports, the poll showed.
Core machinery orders, also due next week, likely fell 1.8% month-on-month in December to mark the first decline in four months, the poll showed.

The government will release CPI data at 8:30 a.m. on Feb. 18 (2330GMT, Feb. 17). Trade data and machinery orders data are due at 8:50 a.m. on Feb. 17 (2350GMT, Feb. 16).

The Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (RICS) said a net balance of +74% of its members reported a rise in house prices in January, up from +70% in December and its highest since July. A Reuters poll of economists had pointed to a reading of +68%.
The report echoed other surveys that show Britain's housing market retained much of its momentum going into 2022, despite the phasing out of temporary tax breaks on property purchases in the second half of 2021.
But with household budgets being squeezed by high inflation and imminent tax rises, RICS cast doubt on whether the housing market can keep up its recent strength.
""There is an inevitable question mark over the impact of rising interest rates allied to the jump in the cost of living on homebuyer sentiment,"" RICS chief economist Simon Rubinsohn said, referring to the Bank of England's decision last week to raise borrowing costs for the second time in two months.

Earlier this week mortgage provider Halifax warned that house price growth - running at 10% year-on-year according to the latest official data - was likely to slow considerably, despite a limited number of houses coming to the market.
Rubinsohn said it was ""a little worrisome"" that RICS' gauges of house prices and rents for the next 12 months had both approached series highs, suggesting a peak was near.

426,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 09, 2022 12:01PM ET</span>",Strong U.S. wholesale inventories point to upward fourth quarter GDP growth revision,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) -U.S. wholesale inventories rose slightly more than initially estimated in December as motor vehicle stocks increased by the most in 10 years, offering hope that supply chain constraints could be easing.
The strong inventory build reported by the Commerce Department on Wednesday, including an upward revision to November's data, also suggested fourth quarter economic growth could be revised higher when its Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) publishes its second gross domestic product estimate later this month. The report followed news on Tuesday that the trade deficit widened less-than-expected in December.
""These upward revisions to the wholesale inventory data make what already had been a strong increase in wholesale inventories estimated by the BEA for the fourth quarter look even firmer,"" said Daniel Silver, an economist at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) in New York.
Wholesale inventories increased 2.2% in December, instead of 2.1% as estimated last month. Data for November was revised up to show at wholesalers advancing 1.7% instead of the previously reported 1.4%. Economists polled by Reuters had expected inventories would be unrevised.
Wholesale inventories jumped 18.5% in December from the year-earlier period. Inventories are a key part of gross domestic product. Goods imports hit a record high in December.
Strained global supply chains had been making it harder for businesses to replenish depleted inventories. Motor vehicle stocks remain very low because of a global shortage of semiconductors, which is constraining motor vehicle production.
In December, wholesale motor vehicle inventories accelerated 4.6%, the largest gain since December 2011, after rising 3.4% in November. Wholesale inventories, excluding autos, increased 2.0% in December. This component goes into the calculation of GDP.
Inventory investment surged at a seasonally adjusted annualized rate of $173.5 billion in the fourth quarter, the second-largest quarterly increase on record. 
Inventories contributed 4.90 percentage points to the fourth quarter's 6.9% annualized growth pace. With the latest inventory data in hand, JPMorgan's Silver estimates that inventory investment increased at a $182 billion rate last quarter, which would add 5.1% percentage points to GDP growth. 
Other economists agree and expect GDP growth could be raised to as high as a 7.2% pace.
Restocking, after three straight quarters during which inventories were drawn down, is supporting manufacturing. Most economists see further scope for inventories to rise, noting that inflation-adjusted inventories remain below their pre-pandemic level. Sales-to-inventory ratios are also low. 
The strong inventory build last quarter, however, suggest restocking will probably have a limited impact on GDP growth in the first quarter. 

""Inventories would need to increase more than that seen in the fourth quarter to add to first-quarter GDP growth,"" said Matt Colyar, an economist at Moody's (NYSE:MCO) Analytics in West Chester, Pennsylvania. ""That seems unlikely because of the Omicron variant and its impact on supply chains.""
Sales at wholesalers gained 0.2% in December after rising 1.7% in November. At December's sales pace it would take wholesalers 1.25 months to clear shelves, the most since February 2021, and up from 1.22 months in November.

ROME, Feb 9 (Reuters) - Italian industrial output was weaker than expected in December, falling 1.0% from the month before after a large, upwardly revised rise of 2.1% in November, data showed on Wednesday.
A Reuters survey of 19 analysts had pointed to a 0.7% monthly decline in December.
November's data was revised up from an originally reported 1.9% increase.
On a work-day adjusted year-on-year basis, industrial output was up 4.4% in December, ISTAT said, slowing from a 6.6% annual increase in November. 
In the three months to December, output was up 0.5% compared with the previous quarter, ISTAT said, slowing from a gain of 1.1% in the third quarter.
Over the whole of 2021 industrial output was up 11.8% from the year before, recovering all of the 11.4% drop in 2020 when the economy was crippled by coronavirus lockdowns.
December saw month-on-month declines in production of consumer goods, investment goods and intermediate goods, ISTAT said, while output of energy products increased marginally.
The Italian economy grew by a preliminary 6.5% in 2021, data showed last week, following a record contraction of 8.9% in 2020.
For this year, Mario Draghi's government officially forecasts a gross domestic product rise of 4.7%, but high energy prices and a recent surge in coronavirus cases and deaths have clouded the outlook.
Business and consumer confidence declined in January and most analysts and think tanks now view the government's full-year growth forecast as optimistic.

428,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 09, 2022 03:11AM ET</span>",German exports jump unexpectedly despite supply shortages,"BERLIN (Reuters) - German exports and imports rose unexpectedly in December, the statistics office said on Wednesday, as order books have remained full despite continued raw material bottlenecks.
""The shortage of supplies was a burden. Meanwhile, the export balance sheet looks surprisingly good,"" Thomas Gitzel, chief economist at VP Bank, said.
""The order books are full, so there is no shortage of commissions,"" the economist said, adding export growth should pick up sharply after the easing of supply problems.
At the same time, whether this happens in 2022 will also depend on how things develop in eastern Ukraine because Germany's export machinery can only function to a limited extent without oil, gas and metals from Russia, Gitzel said.
Seasonally adjusted exports rose 0.9% on the month to 117.0 billion euros ($133.58 billion), compared with a decline of 0.2% predicted by economists.
Imports jumped 4.7% to 110.0 billion euros, compared with an average forecast for a 1.5% decrease.
""The increase is the icing on the cake of a good export quarter. Full order books at industrial companies are also a good basis for further export growth,"" Alexander Krueger at Hauck Aufhaeuser Lampe Privatbank said.

On Friday, data showed German industrial orders grew more than expected in December thanks to a boost from stronger domestic demand.

429,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 08, 2022 06:46PM ET</span>",Australian consumer sentiment slips in Feb as inflation bites,"SYDNEY (Reuters) - A measure of Australian consumer sentiment fell for a third month in February as higher living costs from petrol to rent undermined finances and overshadowed an easing in coronavirus cases.
The Westpac-Melbourne Institute index of consumer sentiment released on Wednesday slipped 1.3% in February from January, when it dropped 2.0%.
The index was down 7.6% from February last year at 100.8, meaning optimists only just outnumbered pessimists.
""The most likely explanations for these elevated pressures on finances relate to: Omicron-related disruptions to activity and earnings at the start of the year; the rising cost of living; and the prospect of rising interest rates,"" said Westpac chief economist Bill Evans.
The cost of petrol alone has climbed 15% over the past two months, while supply bottlenecks have pushed up goods prices and the cost of building new homes. Rents have also been on the rise, leading to a sharp fall in sentiment among tenants.
The impact was clear in the survey's measure of family finances compared with a year ago which dived 9.3%, while the outlook for finances over the next 12 months fell 1.5%.
The survey's measure of whether it was a good time to buy a major household item eased 0.3%, while the 'time to buy a dwelling' index fell 2.4%.

That contrasted with a slight improvement in the economic outlook for the next 12 months which added 2.5% after a steep drop in January, while the outlook for the next five years rose 1.5%.
Media speculation about a rise in interest rates from the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) saw the proportion of respondents expecting an increase in mortgage rates over the next 12 months lift to 66% in February, from 55% the month before.

430,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 08, 2022 05:01PM ET</span>","U.S. household debt increased by $1 trillion in 2021, the most since 2007","By Jonnelle Marte
(Reuters) - U.S. consumer debt loads grew in 2021 by the largest amount in 14 years as people ramped up borrowing to afford homes, cars and other goods that are becoming more expensive, according to a report released on Tuesday by the New York Federal Reserve.
The higher borrowing was fueled in part by rising prices as consumers cope with the strongest inflation seen in nearly four decades. And households, supported by increased savings and higher incomes, seem to be handling the larger debt loads well so far, researchers said.
""The aggregate balances of newly opened mortgage and auto loans sharply increased in 2021, corresponding to increases in home and car prices,"" Wilbert Van Der Klaauw, senior vice president at the New York Fed, said in a statement. 
Total household debt grew by $1 trillion last year, marking the largest increase in overall debt since 2007, according to the New York Fed's quarterly report on household debt and credit. The total debt balance is now $1.4 trillion higher than it was at the end of 2019. 
Over $4.5 trillion in mortgages were originated in 2021, reaching a historic high for the database, which goes back to 1999. Mortgage balances increased by $258 billion in the fourth quarter to $10.93 trillion at the end of December. 
Auto loan originations returned to pre-pandemic trends but loan amounts increased in response to rising car prices, New York Fed researchers said. ""As car prices have soared, buyers have borrowed more to finance the additional cost,"" researchers wrote in a separate blog post published on Tuesday.
Some borrowers anticipating higher interest rates may also be taking advantage of lower borrowing costs, researchers said, noting an increase in mortgage refinancing. 
Fed officials are expected to start raising interest rates in March and to begin shrinking their balance sheet holdings later this year. Both actions could increase borrowing costs as the Fed works to tame inflation and remove the support offered during the pandemic. 
Graphic: Number of accounts by loan type - https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-FED/HOUSEHOLD-DEBT/lbpgnwzmrvq/chart_eikon.jpg 
MORE CAPACITY TO ADD DEBT
In a sign that consumers are returning to their pre-pandemic spending habits, credit card balances also increased by $52 billion in the fourth quarter. That marked the largest quarterly increase observed in the history of the data, but credit card balances are still $71 billion lower than they were at the end of 2019. 
Credit card use typically rises in the fourth quarter as people make holiday purchases, but the increase could also reflect higher prices for goods and services, researchers said. 
Households in aggregate have so far been able to absorb the higher debt loads and delinquencies remain low, thanks in part to savings accumulated earlier in the pandemic and forbearance programs, researchers said. 
""The economy is recovering, incomes are up and households have the capacity to add debt,"" said Tim Duy, a University of Oregon professor and the chief economist of SGH Macro Advisers. 
The share of disposable income that households spend on rent, loan payments, taxes and other bills is low by historical standards, Duy said. 

Still, some borrowers that haven't fared well during the pandemic could have a harder time keeping up with their debt payments later, New York Fed researchers said. 
It will be important to watch how some borrowers fare after they need to resume student loan debt payments in a few months, they said.

431,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 08, 2022 01:20PM ET</span>",Robust imports boost U.S. trade deficit to record high in 2021,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. trade deficit surged to a record high in 2021 as imports increased sharply amid the restocking of shelves by businesses to meet robust domestic demand.
The sharp widening in the trade gap reported by the Commerce Department on Tuesday mostly reflected a shift in spending toward goods from services during the COVID-19 pandemic. With businesses eager to rebuild depleted inventories against the backdrop of stretched global supply chains, the deficit is unlikely to shrink much this year, cutting into economic growth.
""The need to replenish inventory in the United States will keep imports strong even as domestic demand transitions back to services,"" said Tim Quinlan, a senior economist at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) in Charlotte, North Carolina. ""Eventually as domestic demand begins to slow and the global recovery continues, we expect trade to become more of a neutral force on growth next year.""
The trade deficit increased 27.0% last year to an all-time high of $859.1 billion. It was at $676.7 billion in 2020.
The trade gap represented 3.7% of gross domestic product, up from 3.2% in 2020. The deficit subtracted 1.39 percentage points from GDP growth last year. 
The economy grew 5.7% in 2021, the strongest since 1984, after the government provided nearly $6 trillion in pandemic relief, which fueled consumer spending on goods. 
The goods deficit shot up to a record $1.1 trillion last year from $922 billion in 2020. Imports of goods hit an all-time high of $2.9 trillion. 
They were driven by imports of industrial supplies and materials, which increased to their highest level since 2014.
Food imports were the highest on record as were those of capital, consumer and other goods. There were record imports from 70 countries in 2021, led by Mexico, Canada and Germany.
Robust import growth overshadowed a sharp rebound in exports. Goods exports surged 23.3% to a record $1.8 trillion. Exports of industrial supplies and materials, foods, consumer goods, other goods and petroleum were the highest on record.
EXPORTS REBOUND
The United States logged record exports to 57 countries last year, led by Mexico, where they increased to $276.5 billion. Shipments to China rose 21.4% to $151.1 billion. But with imports from China increasing 16.5% to $506.4 billion, the politically sensitive trade deficit with Beijing increased to $355.3 billion last year from $310.3 billion in 2020.
During the administration of former president Donald Trump, China pledged to buy more goods from the United States. However, it missed its targets under the ""Phase 1"" trade deal signed in January 2020 to halt escalation of a tariff war on Chinese goods launched by Trump in 2018. The purchases commitments expired at the end of 2021.
""The goods imported from China would create a lot of jobs if the country could produce it here, but with American wages soaring out of sight, it is unlikely that U.S. manufacturers will restart their factories here especially for consumer goods where margins are tight,"" said Christopher Rupkey, chief economist at FWDBONDS in New York.
In a final boost to the trade gap for the year, the shortfall in December increased 1.8% from the prior month to $80.7 billion. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast an $83.0 billion deficit in December. 
The smaller-than-expected widening in the deficit reflected a $1.4 billion increase in exports of services, which were boosted by travel and transportation. It suggested that the government could raise its fourth-quarter GDP growth estimate, when it publishes its first revision later this month.
Trade made no contribution to last quarter's 6.9% annualized GDP growth rate. It had subtracted from growth for five straight quarters.
The goods trade deficit rose 3.2% to $101.4 billion in December, marking a record high. December imports of goods surged 2.0% to an all-time high of $259.7 billion. There were record highs set for imports of capital and consumer goods.
Some of the rise in imports likely reflected goods being offloaded after being delayed for months aboard ships at U.S. ports because of worker shortages. Port backlogs remain high, which suggests goods imports could set another record high in January. Prior to the pandemic, imports tended to peak ahead of the holiday shopping season, tapering off by the first quarter.
""But growth of imports will slow over the rest of 2022,"" said Bill Adams, chief economist at Comerica (NYSE:CMA) Bank. 
""Businesses are making progress rebuilding inventories, and real consumer spending on durable goods is forecast to fall in 2022. That will mean less demand for imported consumer products as the year goes on.""

Goods exports rose 1.3% to $158.3 billion in December. In addition to the strong growth in services exports, shipments of consumer goods were the highest on record.
""The world economy is coming around, as Omicron starts to burn itself out and restrictions are eased,"" said Joel Naroff, chief economist at Naroff Economics in Holland, Pennsylvania. ""That is the good news. The bad news is that the U.S. continues to ship its recovery out to the rest of the world.""

OTTAWA (Reuters) -Canada posted a surprise trade deficit in December, as imports hit a new record high and exports fell from November, official data showed on Tuesday, but economists expect an export rebound in January on surging energy prices.
Canada's trade deficit was C$137 million ($108 million) in December, well below analyst forecasts of a surplus of C$2.50 billion. November's surplus was also revised down to C$2.47 billion from C$3.13 billion, still good for a 13-year record.
Imports rose 3.7% to hit an all-time record for the third consecutive month, driven by cellphones and other electronics, while exports fell 0.9%, mostly on lower energy prices.
""It's a pretty small deficit, I would look at it as more or less balanced. But it was a bit of a split month in December,"" said Stuart Bergman, deputy chief economist at Export Development Canada.
Bergman noted strong imports of motor vehicles and parts, which bodes well for cross border trade, along with strong exports of consumer goods. Energy weighed on exports as crude prices fell sharply, but oil prices have since rebounded.
""We expect exports should probably come back in January on stronger energy prices,"" said Bergman.
Still, the drop in exports in December will likely act as a drag on fourth quarter GDP, analysts said.
For full-year 2021, Canada's annual merchandise exports rose 22%, Statscan said, with the value hitting a record C$637 billion. With the effect of higher prices stripped out, 2021 exports were 5.4% down from 2019.
""The further upswing in energy prices bodes well for the trade balance in the early part of 2022,"" said Shelly Kaushik, economist at BMO Capital Markets, noting Canada's first annual surplus since 2014.

The National Federation of Independent Business said its Small Business Optimism Index dropped 1.8 points to 97.1 last month, the lowest reading since February 2021. 
Scarce workers and rising labor costs remain the main areas of worry for businesses.
Snarled supply chains as the global economy rebounds from the COVID-19 pandemic, fueled by massive stimulus from governments, have unleashed inflation. The pandemic, now in its third year, has also disrupted labor supply, making it difficult for goods to move from factories to consumers.
There were a near record 10.9 million job openings at the end of December. 
The NFIB survey showed half of the 1,504 small businesses who participated in the poll reporting raising compensation. That was the highest reading in 48 years and was up 2 points from December. That corroborates to a surge in measures of wage growth tracked by the government. 
About 27% of small businesses said they planned to increase compensation in the next three months, down 5 points from December, but still historically high.
Eleven percent said labor costs were their top business problem, down 2 points from December's 48-year record high reading. About 23% complained about labor quality.

Faced with rising labor costs, the share of small businesses raising average selling prices jumped 4 points to 61%, the highest reading since the fourth quarter of 1974. Price hikes were most frequent in wholesale, manufacturing, retail and construction industries. 
The Federal Reserve is expected to start raising interest rates next month by at least 25 basis points to tame high inflation. Economists anticipate as many as seven rate hikes this year.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan ran a current account deficit in December for the first time in one-and-half years due to the surging cost of fuel imports, data showed on Tuesday, in a sign of the rising toll global commodity inflation is inflicting on the economy.
The data underscores the shift in Japan's economic structure from a country that gained wealth from exports of goods to one that is vulnerable to swings in raw material costs due to its increasing reliance on energy and food imports.
The world's third-largest economy ran a current account deficit of 370.8 billion yen ($3.2 billion) in December, government data showed, confounding market forecasts for a 73.5 billion yen surplus. It was the first deficit since June 2020.
Rising fuel costs drove up the value of imports by 44.8% in December from a year earlier, outpacing a 18.7% rise in exports and pushing the trade balance into a 318.7-billion-yen deficit.
Japan's rising energy bill could heighten public complaints over a weak yen, which further inflates the cost of imports.
""The demerits of a weak yen is that it pushes up the import cost of energy and food, thereby increasing households' burden as well as material costs of corporates,"" Japan's top currency diplomat Masato Kanda recently told Reuters.
For the whole of 2021, Japan ran a current account surplus of 15.4 trillion yen, down 2.8% from the previous year due largely to rising energy costs, the data showed.

The decline in the trade surplus was offset somewhat by a steady rise in returns from overseas investment, which drove up Japan's income surplus by 1.2 trillion yen to 20.4 trillion yen.
""Japan used to earn surplus from goods exports. That structure has changed to one where Japan profits from investment flows,"" SMBC Nikko Securities wrote in a research note.

The survey of workers such as taxi drivers, hotel workers and restaurant staff, called ""economy watchers"" for their proximity to consumer and retail trends, showed their confidence about current economic conditions dropped 19.6 points to a five-month low of 37.9 in January.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - A measure of Australian business conditions took a turn for the worse in January as a surge in coronavirus cases hit consumer spending, though firms were optimistic the hit would be short-lived.
Tuesday's survey from National Australia Bank (OTC:NABZY) (NAB) showed its index of business conditions dropped 5 points to +3 in January, as sales halved to +7 and profitability slid 8 points to +2. Its measure of employment dipped 3 points to -1.
The index of confidence bounced to +3, having dived 24 points in December to -12.
""Confidence fell sharply in December as the Omicron variant began to spread, but rebounded in January, reflecting that the outbreak looks to have peaked quickly and lockdowns have been avoided,"" said NAB chief economist Alan Oster.
""Conditions have remained in positive territory and are nowhere near as bad as we saw during lockdowns imposed in 2020 and 2021.""
Inflation remained a problem as purchase costs rose at a record quarterly pace of 3.4% amid high commodity prices and supply bottlenecks. Labour costs held at a 1.9% pace, though retail price growth eased a touch to 1.3%.
""The economy is facing a period of elevated inflation while supply chain issues remain unresolved,"" added Oster.
A separate survey of consumers from ANZ out on Tuesday showed a drop of 1.9% last week, with media speculation about the risk of future rate rises apparently having an impact on heavily indebted households.
The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) last week conceded there were scenarios where interest rates could rise later this year should the economy keep surprising with its strength.

Also out Tuesday was CBA's latest measure of household spending intentions which showed a sharp 10% drop in January as a surge in coronavirus cases kept people at home.
Spending on bank cards, however, has stabilised in the last couple of weeks as cases decline and the overall economy looks to have weathered the outbreak well.

LONDON (Reuters) - British consumers slowed the pace of their spending last month as the Omicron COVID-19 wave hit fuel sales and kept people away from bars and restaurants, according to a survey which also pointed to the impact of rising inflation.
Consumer spending was 7.4% higher than in January 2020 - before the pandemic - the weakest increase since April last year, payments provider Barclaycard said.
It said nine in 10 people it surveyed felt their household finances and discretionary spending were being impacted by the recent jump in prices.
Britain's inflation rate hit a 30-year high of 5.4% in December and looks set to top 7% in April, according to the Bank of England which last week raised interest rates for the second time in two months and said further increases were likely.
Jose Carvalho, head of consumer products at Barclaycard, said there were some signs of relief for the hospitality industry with people saying they planned to spend more on eating and drinking out in the months ahead.
""The lifting of Plan B restrictions should also provide a welcome boost to many sectors, as workers travel back into the office and socialise over post-work drinks, while businesses will likely start to see the benefits of increased inbound tourism on retail sales too,"" he said.
Advice to work from home, along with rules on mask-wearing and vaccine passes, were lifted in England on Jan. 26, six weeks after they were introduced.
A separate survey published on Tuesday suggested a brighter picture for retailers - a narrower measure of consumer spending.
Sales increased by 11.9% in January compared with the same month last year, the biggest increase since May last year, the British Retail Consortium said.
Many non-essential retailers were closed in January 2021 - although this year's figure was still 7.5% higher than in January 2020 - and some of the increase in the sales figures was due to the jump in inflation, BRC said.
Furniture sales were particularly strong last month as transport delays eased.

Paul Martin, UK head of retail at KPMG which co-produces the BRC's figures, said retailers were hoping consumer confidence remains robust to help offset the rising cost challenges.
""We could see a challenging few months ahead if wider macroeconomic conditions start to squeeze household incomes to the point that they start cutting back on retail spending,"" Martin said.

Spending gained 0.1% from November’s level, the ministry of internal affairs reported Tuesday. Compared with the previous quarter, outlays rose 4.6%.
A separate report showed wages fell unexpectedly for the first time in 10 months, illustrating the difficult challenge for Prime Minister Fumio Kishida as he tries to make pay gains for workers a centerpiece of his economic agenda. 
 
 
Still, signs of stronger consumer spending to end the year suggest the recovery was building momentum before the omicron variant of the coronavirus triggered a record wave of infections in recent weeks.
The household spending figures are the last big data point the government will use to compile its fourth quarter growth report, due next Tuesday. 
Analysts had been forecasting Japan’s lagging economy would finally get on a more sustainable track in the final months of 2021 after shrinking in five of the prior nine quarters. Now, though, the growth projected for last quarter is at risk of being short-lived.
Japan’s Economy Seen at Risk of Shrinking Again Due to Omicron

Mexico's economy contracted for a second straight quarter in the last three-month period of 2021, putting it in a technical recession and confirming growth had lost momentum.
Overall the economy expanded 5.0% for full-year 2021 after shrinking 8.5% in 2020 in Mexico's worst recession since the Great Depression of the 1930s.

A January survey by the Federation of Thai Capital Market Organizations (FETCO) showed its investor confidence index tumbled to 93.91 from 129.53 the previous month.
Foreign investors' confidence plunged to the ""bearish zone"" from the ""bullish zone"", hurt also by international conflicts, the federation said.
However, foreign fund inflows are expected to continue on optimism over a tourism recovery, said federation chairman Paiboon Nalinthrangkurn.
""With global market volatility, the Thai market is seen as a 'safe haven',"" he told a news conference.
Foreign investors bought about 40 billion baht ($1.21 billion) net of Thai shares over the past two months after selling a net 49 billion baht during all of 2021.
The main index could reach 1,800 points in the second half, Paiboon said, from 1,675 points on Monday.

The Federal Statistics Office said the country's industrial output fell by 0.3% on the month after an upwardly revised increase of 0.3% in November. 
A Reuters poll had pointed to a rise of 0.4% in December.
Production in 2021 was 3.0% higher than in 2020 and 5.5% lower than in the pre-crisis year 2019, the office said.
The German economy expanded by 2.8% last year, compared with 7% in neighbouring France, exposing Germany's vulnerability to the supply chain bottlenecks holding back the manufacturing sector that forms its export-oriented backbone.
Germany is often referred to as the European Union's economic engine, but restrictions introduced in the autumn to fight a fourth COVID-19 wave as well as the supply chain disruptions translated into a contraction of 0.7% in the fourth quarter.
There have been some signs of a brighter start to 2022.
A survey last week showed that Germany's manufacturing sector grew for the first time in six months in January as easing bottlenecks allowed producers to crank up output in order to meet higher demand.
German business morale improved in January for the first time in seven months as easing supply bottlenecks brightened the outlook for manufacturers, promising a strong recovery from the coronavirus pandemic in the spring.

In another positive sign, the sales chief of luxury carmaker Porsche AG expects another record year for sales despite the global semiconductor chip shortage, he told industry magazine Automobilwoche.
The German government last month cut its economic growth forecast for 2022 to 3.6%. Economy Minister Robert Habeck said late last month he expected a slowdown to 2.3% in 2023.

House prices in January rose by 0.3% from December, Halifax said on Monday.
Russell Galley, managing director at Halifax, said ""it remains likely that the rate of house price growth will slow considerably over the next year"" even as the limited supply of houses for sale will provide some support to prices.
Affordability was still at historically low levels as house price rises outstripped earnings growth, and younger buyers faced challenging deposit requirements, he said.
""This situation is expected to become more acute in the short-term as household budgets face even greater pressure from an increase in the cost of living, and rises in interest rates begin to feed through to mortgage rates,"" Galley said. 
Last week, the Bank of England raised interest rates for the second time in two months - albeit to a level still below that before the pandemic struck - as it sought to head off inflation running at a 30-year high.

Workers also face higher tax payments from April. 
Compared with January last year, house prices were 9.7% higher than a year earlier, matching December's annual pace of increase, Halifax said.

JAKARTA (Reuters) -Indonesia's economic growth accelerated in the final quarter of last year as consumption perked up following the easing of anti-virus mobility restrictions and as stronger commodity prices pushed exports to record highs.
Southeast Asia's largest economy grew 5.02% on a yearly basis in the October-December quarter, compared with 3.51% growth in the previous quarter, data from Statistics Indonesia showed on Monday. That was roughly in line with the government's prediction and a touch faster than the 4.90% expected in a Reuters poll.
For the whole of 2021, gross domestic product expanded 3.69%, compared with a 2.07% contraction the year before, as the economy recovered from the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.
However, the outlook for this year is clouded by rising COVID-19 cases, potential financial market volatility due to a global monetary tightening and Indonesia's own rollback of monetary and fiscal stimulus.
""Indonesia's economy rebounded strongly in the final quarter of last year, but the recovery is now entering a more difficult phase,"" Capital Economics analyst Gareth Leather said in a note.
""Omicron will act as a small obstacle in the first quarter. But a bigger drag will come from falling commodity prices and policy tightening.""
The main stock index, which rose nearly 1% in early trading, pared gains after the data.
Indonesia was hit by a deadly wave of COVID-19 cases in July-August, but mobility curbs were eased towards the end of August as infections fell.
In the fourth quarter, household consumption, which accounts for over half of Indonesia's GDP, grew 3.6%, quickening from the 1% growth in the previous three months.
Investment and public spending also grew faster in the fourth quarter, which Statistics Indonesia head Margo Yuwono attributed to a resumption of government and private sector activities that were halted in the third quarter.
Export growth also picked up to 29.8% from 29.2% in the previous quarter as prices of export products like palm oil, coal and nickel stayed high.
COVID-19 cases are currently rising again in Indonesia due to the spread of the Omicron variant, with Sunday's 36,057 new cases the highest since August. However, authorities have not reimposed strict anti-virus measures.
Josua Pardede, an economist with Bank Permata in Jakarta, said he expects 2022 GDP growth to recover further to between 4.8% to 5%, as the government maintains healthcare and social protection spending.
Bank Indonesia will start unwinding easy monetary policy with hikes in banks' reserve requirement ratio starting in March.
The tightening is seen as preparation for U.S. rate hikes, which have in the past roiled Indonesian financial markets.
Meanwhile, the value added tax rate on most goods and services is set to rise in April, as part of the government's fiscal normalisation policy.

Export contribution to growth could also be curtailed by a ban on overseas shipments of coal in January and a newly implemented domestic sale requirement for some palm oil products.

Investing.com – China’s services activity saw its slowest pace of growth in five months in January, a private survey showed on Monday. Increasing numbers of local COVID-19 cases and the ensuing containment measures hit both new business and consumer sentiment, while employment also fell.
Data released earlier in the day showed that the Caixin services purchasing managers index was 51.4, the lowest since August 2021. The figure was lower than the 53.1 figure reported in December, but still above the 50-mark indicating growth.
The lower-than-expected growth could prompt the government to roll out more measures to support the economy. The People’s Bank of China has already started cutting interest rates and pumping more cash into the financial system, with more measures expected in the following weeks.
Slower growth was due to the COVID-19 outbreaks, according to some services providers, while the rising number of COVID-19 cases globally also slowed demand from overseas. This in turn led to a renewed fall in employment, marking the first decline in the data series since August 2021, according to the survey.
""In December and January, the resurgence of COVID-19 in several regions such as Xian and Beijing forced local governments to tighten epidemic control measures, which restricted production, transportation, and sales of goods,"" Caixin Insight Group senior economist Wang Zhe said in a statement accompanying the data release.
""This year, policymakers should make stability their focus. They should prioritize improvements to employment and optimize the structure of the economy.""
Inflation also remains a concern for Chinese service firms, the survey also showed. Input costs rose at a sharper rate in January 2022, while prices charged climbed to a three-month high as some companies passed on higher costs to consumers.
Confidence for the year ahead remained high, although the uncertainty surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic meant that levels were at a 16-month low."

Sales surged 8.2% in the fourth quarter, recovering from a sharp drop in the prior period when the nation’s two most populous states were in lockdown to combat a virus outbreak, Australian Bureau of Statistics data showed Monday. The gain outpaced economists’ expectations of a 7.8% increase.
“Consumers enthusiastically returned to discretionary spending following the end of delta related lockdowns,” Ben James, director of Quarterly Economy Wide Statistics at the ABS, said in a statement. 
“Well publicised concerns over product availability and delivery timeliness led to consumers bringing forward their end of year shopping, in conjunction with a re-opening spending splurge due to pent up consumer demand,” he said.
The result will boost policy makers’ confidence that the A$2.1 trillion ($1.5 trillion) economy is on track for a solid recovery from a pandemic-induced contraction in the third quarter. A surge in household spending is among reasons economists expect the Reserve Bank to raise interest rates in the second half of this year.
At the same time, trade data released last week showed a corresponding surge in imports in the final three months of 2021 -- also fueled by high household demand -- which is likely to take a cut out of GDP growth in the period.
The early part of this year is also likely to prove challenging for retailers as a surge in new cases of the omicron variant of coronavirus is prompting caution among consumers. This was reflected in a separate survey of job advertisements, showing a 0.3% fall in January

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. economy created far more jobs than expected in January but despite the disruption to consumer-facing businesses from a surge in COVID-19 cases, pointing to underlying strength that should sustain the expansion as the Federal Reserve starts to raise interest rates.
The Labor Department's closely watched employment report on Friday also showed a whopping 709,000 more jobs were added in November and December than previously estimated. Wage gains accelerated last month and the labor pool expanded.
The upbeat report ended days of anxiety among economists and White House officials who had frantically tried to prepare the nation for a disappointing payrolls number.
""This is a strong jobs report,"" said Chris Low, chief economist at FHN Financial in New York. ""The odds of quelling inflation without a recession look better today than yesterday.""
Nonfarm payrolls increased by 467,000 jobs last month, the survey of establishments showed. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast 150,000 jobs would be added in January. Estimates ranged from a decrease of 400,000 to a gain of 385,000 jobs.
Employment is 2.9 million jobs below its pre-pandemic peak.
Part of the broad increase in payrolls likely reflected low layoffs after the holiday hiring season, with 10.9 million job openings at the end of December. Though the drop in actual employment in January was in line with prior years, there were large differences at the industry level.
The government also reported that 374,000 more jobs were created in the 12 months through March 2021 than previously reported. January capped President Joe Biden's first year in office, which saw 6.6 million jobs added. Despite the strong economy, Biden's popularity is declining amid soaring inflation.
""We still have a lot of work to do,"" said Biden at the White House. ""Making sure every American has a job, it's a great start, but it's not the finish.""
The labor market resilience could alter expectations that economic growth would slow significantly in the first quarter, after consumer spending exited 2021 with a whimper. The economy grew at a 6.9% annualized rate in the fourth quarter. Growth estimates for the first quarter are below a 2% pace.
Strong employment gains, accompanied by the biggest annual increase in wages since May 2020, pave the way for the U.S. central bank to raise interest rates in March by at least 25 basis points to tame high inflation. Economists expect as many as seven rate hikes this year.
""The report is unequivocally good for the economy, but not for markets as the strength in the numbers presents another data point which supports more aggressively hawkish Fed action,"" said Cliff Hodge, chief investment officer at Cornerstone Wealth in Charlotte, North Carolina.
Stocks on Wall Street were higher. The dollar was steady versus a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices fell.

LABOR POOL EXPANDS
Economists had anticipated a weak jobs report as the government surveyed businesses for payrolls in mid-January, when Omicron infections were peaking. The Labor Department said a record 3.616 million people who had a job were absent during the survey week because of illness.
Workers who are out sick or in quarantine and do not get paid during the payrolls survey period are counted as unemployed in the establishment survey even if they still have a job. Lower-paid hourly workers in industries like healthcare as well as leisure and hospitality, who typically do not have paid sick leave, bore the brunt of the winter COVID-19 wave.
According to the latest government data, paid sick leave was available to 79% of civilian workers in March 2021.
The leisure and hospitality industry added 151,000 jobs in January. Healthcare employment increased by 18,000. There were gains in retail, professional and business services employment as well as transportation and warehousing, and wholesale trade.
Manufacturing payrolls rose by 13,000, but construction employment fell 5,000, likely because of freezing temperatures. Government payrolls increased by 23,000 jobs.
Employment could increase further as coronavirus infections continue to subside. First-time applications for unemployment benefits dropped for a second straight week last week.
The United States is reporting an average of 354,399 new COVID-19 infections a day, sharply down from the more than 700,000 in mid-January, according to a Reuters analysis of official data.
The government introduced new population estimates for the household survey, from which the unemployment rate is derived. The new assumptions had a negligible effect on the unemployment
rate, which rose to 4.0% from 3.9% in December.
But the labor force participation rate, or the proportion of working-age Americans who have a job or are looking for one, increased to 62.2% due to the changes in the composition of the population, from 61.9% in December.
The workforce increased by 1.393 million people. The employment-to-population ratio rose to 59.7% from 59.5% in December.
(Graphic: Unemployment rate, https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-ECONOMY/UNEMPLOYMENT/gdpzymqoqvw/chart.png)
 
Other details of the household survey were strong. Employment increased by 1.199 million jobs. The survey counts people who have a job as employed regardless of whether they got paid during the survey week if they were temporarily absent from their jobs because of illness or other reasons.
A broader measure of unemployment, which includes people who want to work but have given up searching and those working part-time because they cannot find full-time employment, dropped to 7.1%, the lowest since February 2020, from 7.3% in December.
With some lower hourly paid workers at home, wage growth accelerated. Average hourly earnings surged 0.7%, which raised the annual increase to 5.7%, the largest gain since May 2020.

But Omicron's surge cut the average workweek to 34.5 hours, the shortest since April 2020, from 34.7 hours in December.
""All in all, the U.S. economy appears to be on a strong footing,"" said Noah Williams, an adjunct fellow at the Manhattan Institute.

(Reuters) - The Canadian economy lost more jobs than expected in January, posting its first decline since May 2021 as the Omicron-driven COVID-19 wave peaked, data showed on Friday, but analysts expect a quick rebound in coming months.
Canada shed 200,100 jobs, roughly matching the losses in January and April 2021, and the jobless rate jumped to 6.5% from a revised 6.0% in December, Statistics Canada said. 
Analysts surveyed by Reuters had expected a loss of 117,500 jobs and the unemployment rate to rise to 6.2%.
""It's a little bit weaker than we expected perhaps, but it really lines up quite well with what we saw last spring,"" said Andrew Kelvin, chief Canada economist at TD Securities.
""I think it is something that we look through given that we can connect it quite directly to the lockdowns related to the Omicron variant.""
Canada's largest two provinces, Ontario and Quebec, tightened restrictions as the Omicron variant took hold. Ontario reopened gyms and indoor dining this week, while Quebec reopened restaurants and has allowed some sports activities.
Similar patterns in the previous two COVID-19 waves led to nearly identical job losses, followed by a full rebound within one to three months. Canada's health officials said last week Omicron infections had passed their peak https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/omicron-infections-have-peaked-nationally-canada-official-2022-01-28.
Additionally, Statscan said the jump in the unemployment rate last month was entirely due to temporary layoffs and people scheduled to start work soon, suggesting a looming rebound.
Still, the losses were harsh, particularly in high-contact services. Accommodation and food services shed 112,900 jobs, with another 48,400 net jobs lost in information, culture and recreation.
Despite the disappointing results, analysts said it was unlikely to change the calculus for the Bank of Canada, which is expected to start hiking interest rates in March.
""I don't think this will have a big impact on the Bank of Canada,"" said Doug Porter, chief economist at BMO Capital Markets. ""I think their view will be that this is entirely related to the temporary restrictions and that it won't last.""

Bank of Canada Governor Tiff Macklem reiterated this week that interest rates would soon rise https://www.reuters.com/business/bank-canada-head-says-unclear-how-quickly-inflation-will-drop-2022-02-02 and that Canadians should expect multiple increases.

(Reuters) - A record number of people, totaling more than 3.6 million, were unable to work due to illness during the week that officials gathered data for the benchmark U.S. monthly employment report, which coincided with the peak in infections from COVID-19.
Labor Department data released on Friday showed that figure was up from nearly 1.7 million in December.

Investing.com -- The U.S. labor market defied fears of a Covid-driven slowdown in January, adding 467,000 nonfarm jobs in the month, well ahead of estimates. 
The Labor Department also sharply revised up figures for the previous two months' payrolls gains, suggesting that jobs growth has been a lot stronger through the holiday season and the start of 2022 than previously thought. December's figures were revised upward to show a rise of 510,000 jobs rather than the 199,000 originally reported, while November's gain was revised up even more sharply, to 647,000 from the 249,000 previously estimated.
The figures illustrate the difficulties of compiling statistics at a time when the pandemic, and businesses' responses to it, are still dominating economic activity. Despite a rise in layoffs over the last two months as the Omicron wave swept the U.S., the economy appears to have added nearly 1 million jobs in that time. 
In addition, wages continued to rise at a rate that suggests a buildup of inflationary pressure, as workers use their growing leverage with employers in a market characterized by staff shortages. Average hourly earnings rose by 0.7% on the month, rather than the 0.5% expected and their strongest increase since April last year. That took the annual rate of earnings growth up to 5.7%.
Even so, the jobless rate rose to 4.0% of the workforce, from 3.9% in December, and average weekly hours worked fell to 34.5 from 34.7, hitting their lowest since July 2020.
The details of the report suggested that at least some of the distortions created by the pandemic over the last two years are easing, with more workers returning to the labor force. The participation rate, which tracks the proportion of working-age people actually in work, rose to 62.2% from 61.9%, its highest level since April 2020. 
Paul Donovan, chief economist with UBS Wealth Management, said via Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) that there was a  ""notable increase in the number of people taking part time jobs alongside full time"" ones, a development which he argued could be due to lower-income groups looking to booster their income, having spent their pandemic savings.
Financial markets responded by pricing in more monetary policy tightening from the Federal Reserve. Money market futures fell to imply a 33% chance that the Fed will hike rates by 50 basis points in March, despite a number of comments from Fed officials this week playing down such a dramatic scenario. The interest-rate sensitive 2-Year Treasury note yield leaped another 11 basis points to 1.30%, while the 10-Year Treasury yield rose 9 basis points to 1.91%. The last time the 10-year yield was that high, the coronavirus first identified in Wuhan, China, wasn't even known as Covid-19."

Orders for goods grew 2.8% on the month in seasonally adjusted terms after a revised increase of 3.6% in November, figures from the Federal Statistics Office showed.
A Reuters poll of analysts had pointed to a smaller increase of 0.5% on the month.
Domestic orders saw an increase of 11.7% on the month. Orders from the rest of the euro zone decreased 4.2% in December after an increase the previous month of 13.1%.
""Companies are clearly geared up for a recovery and are sitting in the starting blocks for an upswing,"" said LBBW analyst Jens-Oliver Niklasch. 
""What we need now, above all, is an end to coronavirus restrictions and security in the supply chains. Then we can hope for robust GDP growth this year,"" he added.
The economy ministry said the index level pointed to a dynamic economic development once the high order backlog can be worked off, with supply bottlenecks expected to gradually unwind.

""This is a nice growth rate, but it adds to the already high order backlog,"" said Alexander Krueger, an analyst with private bank Hauck Aufhaeuser Lampe. ""The key remains that orders can be processed to a greater extent in the near future.""
German industrial production unexpectedly fell in November, as supply bottlenecks for raw and preliminary materials have led to order backlogs for German manufacturers.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits fell more than expected last week as COVID-19 infections subsided, suggesting that an anticipated slowdown in job growth in January was likely temporary.
The second straight weekly decline reported by the Labor Department on Thursday partially unwound the recent surge, which had boosted initial claims to a three-month high in mid-January.
""The Omicron COVID-19 variant's grip on the U.S. labor market is loosening and job growth should reaccelerate,"" said Ryan Sweet, a senior economist at Moody's (NYSE:MCO) Analytics in West Chester, Pennsylvania.
Initial claims for state unemployment benefits dropped 23,000 to a seasonally adjusted 238,000 for the week ended Jan. 29. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast 245,000 applications for the latest week. Applications fell sharply in Ohio, Kentucky and Illinois, offseting notable rises in Michigan, California, Indiana and Pennsylvania.
Claims increased from the beginning of January through the middle of the month amid an onslaught of coronavirus infections, driven by the Omicron variant. Business activity, especially in the services sector, was impacted by the latest wave.
A separate survey from the Institute for Supply Management on Thursday showed its non-manufacturing activity index fell to 59.9 last month, the lowest reading since February 2021, from 62.3 in December. A reading above 50 indicates growth in the services sector, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity. 
The ISM said the spread of the Omicron variant ""has disrupted operations, especially through reduced staffing levels."" Services businesses also continued to grapple with erratic supplies of materials and higher input prices.
Labor supply constraints were highlighted by the ADP National Employment report https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-private-payrolls-decrease-unexpectedly-january-adp-2022-02-02 on Wednesday, which showed private payrolls declined in January for the first time in a year, raising a strong possibility that the overall economy shed jobs last month.
According to the U.S. Census Bureau's Household Pulse Survey published in mid-January, 8.8 million people reported not being at work because of coronavirus-related reasons between Dec. 29 and Jan. 10.
People who are out sick or in quarantine and do not get paid during the payrolls survey period are counted as unemployed in the Labor Department's survey of establishments even if they still have a job with their companies.
Stocks on Wall Street were lower. The dollar fell against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury yields rose.
WORST LIKELY OVER
The government is likely to report on Friday that nonfarm payrolls increased by 150,000 jobs last month after rising by 199,000 in December, according to a Reuters survey of economists. Estimates range from a decrease of 400,000 to a gain of 385,000. The unemployment rate is forecast to be unchanged at 3.9%, underscoring tightening labor market conditions.
There were 10.9 million job openings at the end of December. The workforce is about 2 million people smaller than before the pandemic. Claims have dropped from a record high of 6.149 million in early April of 2020.
The recent labor market disruptions are likely over and job growth will probably pick up. The United States is reporting an average of 433,601 new COVID-19 infections a day, sharply down from the more than 700,000 in mid-January, according to a Reuters analysis of official data.
The claims report also showed the number of people receiving benefits after an initial week of aid dropped 44,000 to 1.628 million in the week ending Jan. 22. 
A total of 2.068 million people were receiving unemployment checks under all programs in mid-January.
""The big drop in initial claims over the past two weeks and the ongoing decline in continued claims indicate that the job growth should bounce back in February,"" said Gus Faucher, chief economist at PNC Financial (NYSE:PNC) in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. 
""The biggest constraint on hiring in the spring of 2022 will be a worker shortage.""
Underlying strength in the labor market was underscored by a separate report on Thursday from global outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas showing job cuts announced by U.S.-based employers held steady at 19,064 in January. Layoffs were down 76% compared to January 2021.
A third report from the Labor Department showed nonfarm productivity, which measures hourly output per worker, rebounded at a 6.6% annualized rate last quarter after falling at a 5.0% rate in the third quarter. Economists had expected productivity would rebound at a 3.2% rate. Productivity has been volatile since the pandemic started in the United States two years ago. 

Compared to the fourth quarter of 2020, productivity grew at a 2.0% pace. Productivity increased 1.9% in 2021, slowing from 2.4% growth in 2020.
""We see productivity gains remaining positive as output continues to move higher with less workers,"" said Rubeela Farooqi, chief U.S. economist at High Frequency Economics in White Plains, New York. ""Adoption of new technologies during the pandemic will also likely provide a lift over time. But gains may slow as more and more low-productivity jobs are recovered.""

456,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 03, 2022 10:33AM ET</span>",U.S. factory orders fall in December; shipments rise further,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - New orders for U.S.-made goods fell slightly more than expected in December, but manufacturing remains supported by businesses replenishing inventories. 
The Commerce Department said on Thursday that factory orders decreased 0.4% in December. Data for November was revised higher to show orders increasing 1.8% instead of 1.6% as previously reported. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast factory orders slipping 0.2%. Orders increased 16.9% in 2021.
Manufacturing, which accounts for 11.9% of the economy, is being underpinned by businesses rebuilding inventories. 
Inventory investment surged at a seasonally adjusted annualized rate of $173.5 billion in the fourth quarter, the second-largest quarterly increase on record. 
Most economists see more scope for inventories to rise, noting that inflation-adjusted inventories remain below their pre-pandemic level. Sales-to-inventory ratios are also low.
Inventories contributed 4.90 percentage points to the fourth quarter's 6.9% annualized growth pace.
In December, there were decreases in orders for computers and electronic products as well as transportation equipment. But orders for machinery, primary metals and fabricated metal products increased as did those for electrical equipment, appliances and components.
Shipments of manufactured goods rose 0.4% in December after increasing 0.7% in November. Inventories at factories climbed 0.3%. Unfilled orders rose 0.5% after gaining 0.8% in the prior month.
The Commerce Department also reported that orders for non-defense capital goods, excluding aircraft, which are seen as a measure of business spending plans on equipment, rose 0.3% in December instead of being unchanged as reported last month. 

Shipments of these so-called core capital goods, which are used to calculate business equipment spending in the gross domestic product report, increased 1.3% in December as previously reported.
Business spending on equipment rebounded in the fourth quarter.

457,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 03, 2022 10:06AM ET</span>",U.S. service sector slows in January; input prices remain elevated - ISM survey,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A measure of U.S. services industry activity dropped to an 11-month low in January as a resurgence in COVID-19 infections hurt demand at high contact businesses and kept workers at home.
The Institute for Supply Management said on Thursday its non-manufacturing activity index fell to 59.9 last month, the lowest reading since February 2021, from 62.3 in December. 
A reading above 50 indicates growth in the services sector, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the index falling to 59.5. 
The slowdown in services industry activity was the latest indication that the economy lost considerable momentum in January as coronovarius infections, driven by the Omicron variant, lashed the nation. 
The ISM reported this week that its measure of national manufacturing activity dropped to a 14-month low in January. The ADP National Employment report on Wednesday showed private payrolls fell last month for the first time since December 2020. 
The economy grew at a 6.9% annualized rate in the fourth quarter, helping to boost overall growth in 2021 to 5.7%, the strongest performance since 1984. Growth estimates for the first quarter are mostly below a 2.0% rate.
But the disruption to businesses is probably over, with a rebound in activity anticipated as the Omicron wave subsides.
The United States is reporting an average of 433,601 new COVID-19 infections a day, sharply down from the more than 700,000 in mid-January, according to a Reuters analysis of official data. 
The ISM's measure of new orders received by services businesses dropped to a reading of 61.7, also the lowest in 11 months, from 62.1 in December. Its services industry employment gauge fell to a seven-month low of 52.3 from 54.7 in December.
The decline, which likely reflects absenteeisms as well as worker shortages, suggests job growth slowed in January.
According to a Reuters survey of economists, the government is likely to report on Friday that nonfarm payrolls increased by 150,000 jobs last month after rising 199,000 in December. Estimates range from a drop of 400,000 to a gain of 385,000. 
There were 10.9 million job openings at the end of December. 

With services industry hiring slowing, the improvement in supply chains experienced in December partially stalled. While backlog orders increased at a slower pace, the survey's measure of supplier deliveries rose to a reading of 65.7 from 63.9 in December. A reading above 50% indicates slower deliveries. 
That meant services inflation remained high. The ISM's measure of prices paid by services industries slipped to a still-high 82.3 reading from 83.9 in December.

458,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 03, 2022 05:46AM ET</span>",Euro zone producer prices in record surge in Dec due to energy,"BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Euro zone producer prices surged at a record rate in December, as expected, on soaring energy costs, data showed on Thursday, pointing to continued pressure on already record high consumer inflation.
The European Union's statistics office Eurostat said prices at factory gates in the 19 countries sharing the euro rose 2.9% month-on-month in December for a 26.2% year-on-year surge. The latter is the highest ever annual reading since measurements started in January 1996, Eurostat said.
Economists polled by Reuters had expected a 2.8% monthly increase and a 26.1% year-on-year jump.
The December readings were mainly influenced by the soaring prices of energy which increased 7.0% month-on-month and whopping 73.4% year-on-year.
Without the volatile energy component, producer prices went up only 0.5% on the month and 10% year-on-year.
Producer prices typically translate, with a delay, into higher prices for consumers as manufacturers pass on their rising costs.
Euro zone consumer inflation in January increased to 5.1% year-on-year while the European Central Bank wants to keep it at 2% over the medium term.

459,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 03, 2022 05:46AM ET</span>",UK services sector shows Omicron recovery in January,"By David Milliken
LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's services sector picked up sooner than expected last month after a big hit from the Omicron wave of COVID-19 cases, but record price rises are likely to alarm the Bank of England, which is expected to raise interest rates later on Thursday. 
The IHS Markit/CIPS Purchasing Manager's Index (PMI) rose to 54.1 in January from December's 10-month low of 53.6 - in contrast to an earlier flash estimate based on data from the further half of January which showed the index down at 53.3.
""Demand has started to recover from the impact of Omicron restrictions and most businesses expect only a temporary slowdown from cancelled bookings and staff absences at the turn of the year,"" IHS Markit economics director Tim Moore said.
Hospitality firms in particular suffered a slump in sales over the Christmas and New Year period.
The broader composite PMI, which includes Tuesday's stronger-than-expected manufacturing PMI, rose to 54.2 in January from 53.6.
Readings over 50 show a majority of firms reported growth, although many economists think Britain's economy as a whole is likely to have shrunk slightly in December and January due to reduced socialising and staff absence caused by COVID.
However, the PMI indicated that businesses were upbeat about 2022.
""Growth expectations for the next 12 months picked up in January and are now the highest since last spring, with staff recruitment difficulties often the only major source of anxiety,"" Moore said.
Official data showed a record number of job vacancies in the final quarter of 2021 with worker shortages more than 50% higher than before the pandemic.
Services businesses' costs rose at the second-fastest rate on record in January - reflecting higher wages, logistics costs, greater energy bills and pricier raw materials - and these expenses were all passed on to consumers. Prices charged rose by the most since the PMI series began in July 1996.
This will feed the BoE's concern that rising consumer price inflation, which hit its highest in nearly 30 years at 5.4% in December, will be slow to fall even once immediate drivers such as energy costs stop rising.

The BoE has seen signs in its own surveys that businesses might raise pay at rates that are inconsistent with its 2% inflation target this year.
But most pay settlements so far are well below the current rate of inflation - bringing real-terms pay cuts for workers which many economists think will slow growth and push down inflation. 
 
"
460,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 03, 2022 04:10AM ET</span>",Euro zone business growth lost more momentum in Jan as Omicron hit demand,"LONDON (Reuters) - Euro zone economic growth lost more momentum in January as the bloc's dominant services industry suffered from subdued demand amid tighter restrictions to contain the Omicron coronavirus variant, a survey showed.
Some governments in the currency union have been encouraging citizens to stay at home to try and stop the more virulent variant from spreading while steep price rises, caused in part by supply and labour issues, have also kept demand in check.
IHS Markit's final Composite Purchasing Managers' Index, seen as good guide to overall economic health, dropped to 52.3 in January from 53.3 in December, its lowest since February last year and just below the 52.4 preliminary estimate.
""The euro zone economy has slowed further in January after seeing growth weaken in the final quarter of 2021,"" said Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit.
""The slowdown coincides with virus-fighting containment measures having been tightened to the highest since last May across the euro zone amid the surge in COVID-19 cases linked to Omicron.""
Those measures had a particular impact on the services industry and its PMI fell to a nine-month low of 51.1 from December's 53.1.
Demand growth almost dried up, and the services new business index sank to 51.3 from 52.5, its lowest since April and not far above the 50 mark separating growth from contraction.
Consumers have seen prices rising sharply in recent months and January was no exception. With input costs rising, firms passed on some of that burden to customers and the composite output prices index rose to 61.9 from 60.6.
The index has only been higher once since IHS Markit began collecting the data in late 2002 - and that was in November.
""A key concern is that inflationary pressures continue to build, with soaring energy prices likely to add further to upward price pressures in coming months,"" Williamson said.

Euro zone inflation is set to rise faster throughout 2022 than previously expected, according to economists polled by Reuters last month, potentially pressuring the European Central Bank to tighten policy.
The ECB, which meets later on Thursday, has so far resisted calls for tighter policy and stuck to its view price pressures would ease this year.

461,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 02, 2022 11:50AM ET</span>",Omicron depresses U.S. private payrolls in temporary setback to labor market,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. private payrolls fell for the first time in a year in January as soaring COVID-19 infections disrupted business operations, raising the risk of a sharp decline in employment that would deal a temporary setback to the labor market.
The surprise drop in payrolls in the ADP National Employment report on Wednesday was across all industries and business sizes. It added to a slowdown in manufacturing activity last month in suggesting that the economy lost significant momentum at the start of 2022 as coronavirus cases, driven by the Omicron variant, raged across the nation.
""The good news is that the job market should quickly bounce back as the Omicron variant fades,"" said Gus Faucher, chief economist at PNC Financial (NYSE:PNC) in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.
""Underlying demand in the economy is still strong, and businesses are still trying to hire. But the January drop in employment is another reminder that the economy will not fully return to normal until the pandemic is over.""
Private payrolls decreased by 301,000 jobs last month, the first drop since December 2020, after increasing by 776,000 in December. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast private payrolls would increase by 207,000 jobs.
The broad decline in private payrolls was led by the leisure and hospitality sector, with 154,000 job losses. Trade, transportation and utilities shed 62,000 jobs. Manufacturing employment decreased by 21,000 jobs. Freezing temperatures last month were also a factor, with construction losing 10,000 jobs. 
Employment at small businesses dropped by 144,000 jobs, while medium enterprises laid off 59,000 workers and large companies reduced payrolls by 98,000.
The ADP report is jointly developed with Moody's (NYSE:MCO) Analytics and was published ahead of the release on Friday of the Labor Department's more comprehensive and closely watched employment report for January. It has, however, a poor record predicting the private payrolls count in the department's Bureau of Labor Statistics employment report because of methodology differences.
The ADP report counts all active workers as employed regardless of whether they are paid or not during the survey week. In contrast, people who are out sick or in quarantine and do not get paid during the payrolls survey period are counted as unemployed in the BLS survey of establishments even if they still have a job with their companies.
The decline in private payrolls in the ADP report suggests that some workers were laid off because of reduced demand. Businesses were also probably unable to find workers, with so many people at home because of soaring infections.
Stocks on Wall Street were trading higher. The dollar fell against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices rose.

MILLIONS AT HOME
Economic growth slowed in January, with an Institute for Supply Management survey on Tuesday showing its measure of national factory activity falling to a 14-month low.
The economy grew at a 6.9% annualized rate in the fourth quarter, helping to boost overall growth in 2021 to 5.7%, the strongest performance since 1984. Growth estimates for the first quarter are mostly below a 2.0% rate. 
According to the U.S. Census Bureau's Household Pulse Survey published in mid-January, 8.8 million people reported not being at work because of coronavirus-related reasons between Dec. 29 and Jan. 10. This has left some economists bracing for a decline on Friday in the nonfarm payrolls count for January.
According to a Reuters survey of economists, nonfarm payrolls likely increased by 150,000 jobs last month. Estimates range from a decrease of 400,000 to an increase of 385,000. The economy created 199,000 jobs in December, the fewest in a year.
The White House has been frantically trying to prepare the nation for a disappointing payrolls number, with several officials offering a preview of the report.
""I think the key point, from our perspective, is the underlying strength of the economy,"" Jared Bernstein, a member of the White House's Council of Economic Advisers, told CNN this week. ""The underlying strength of the job market is ongoing because, as we have seen, the caseloads are turning over.""
The United States is reporting an average of 433,601 new COVID-19 infections a day, sharply down from the more than 700,000 in mid-January, according to a Reuters analysis of official data. 
Demand for labor is strong, with fewer workers available. There were 10.9 million job openings at the end of December.
Economists expect the Federal Reserve will view a decline in payrolls in January as a blip, given the near-record vacancies. 
The Fed last week said it was likely to raise interest rates in March. Economists expect as many as seven hikes this year to tame inflation. 

The labor market is already rebounding as the Omicron wave subsides. First-time applications for unemployment benefits have retreated from a three-month high. 
""The labor market is still in very good shape, regardless of what numbers print, and that points to continued solid wage increases as well,"" said Joel Naroff, chief economist at Naroff Economics in Holland, Pennsylvania.

The central bank is expected to raise its key interest rate by a hefty 100 basis points to 9.5% on Feb. 11 as inflation, which it targets at 4%, shows little signs of slowing.

463,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 02, 2022 10:27AM ET</span>",Record euro zone inflation piles pressure on ECB,"FRANKFURT (Reuters) -Euro zone inflation rose to a new record high last month, defying expectations for a big drop and piling pressure on the European Central Bank to finally admit that price growth is not as temporary and benign as it has long predicted. 
Inflation across the 19 countries that share the euro picked up to 5.1% in January from 5% in December, far outpacing expectations in a Reuters poll of analysts for a drop to 4.4%, data from Eurostat showed on Wednesday. 
The reading reflected soaring energy prices as expected but unprocessed food inflation also jumped more than 5%, a potential source of political pressure on the ECB as fuel and food prices impact ordinary voters quickly.
Inflation is now more than twice the ECB's 2% target. 
The central bank, which will hold a policy meeting on Thursday, has for months shrugged off data showing prices climbing, arguing that temporary factors are behind the rise and inflation will abate soon on its own. 
But the ECB's track record in forecasting inflation is patchy. It predicted a peak first in November then December, and was forced several times last year to sharply raise its projections.
""They have to recognise there are upside risks and the (inflation) path they laid out in December looks too benign,"" said Dirk Schumacher, euro zone economist at French investment bank Natixis. ""Underlying price pressures remain high and put the ECB in an awkward position."" 
While the U.S. Federal Reserve has abandoned the narrative that inflation is ""transitory,"" the ECB has stuck with this assessment, arguing that wage growth, a precondition of durable inflation, is still muted and underlying price growth is weak. 
Although core inflation slowed, it remained above the ECB's target and also beat market expectations by a wide margin.
Inflation excluding food and fuel prices, closely watched by the ECB, slowed to 2.5% from 2.7% while a narrower measure that also excludes alcohol and tobacco products slowed to 2.3% from 2.6%. Both figures were well above expectations.
High inflation is why markets see 30 basis points of interest rates hikes by the end of the year, despite the ECB's insistence that any rate change is ""very unlikely"". 
""Euro area headline inflation is on track to exceed ECB staff projections by more than 100 basis points in the first quarter"" Pictet Wealth Management strategist Frederik Ducrozet said. ""We now expect the ECB to bring its deposit rate back to zero in two 25 bp rises in March and June 2023."" 
Analysts polled last month https://www.reuters.com/business/euro-zone-inflation-burn-hotter-ecb-rates-stay-ice-2022-01-19 expected the first ECB rate hike only in the second half of 2023 but a growing number see earlier moves as inflation remains high.
The euro rose 0.3% to $1.13050, touching a one-week high to the dollar, as investors assessed the chances that the ECB might signal a faster path for policy tightening on Thursday.
QUESTIONS
The ECB expects inflation to fall back under 2% by the end of this year, partly because of weak wage growth. A long list of influential policymakers have questioned this narrative, however, warning that risks are skewed towards higher figures.
While wage growth is indeed weak so far, unemployment fell to 7% in December, an all-time-low for the euro zone, and is already well below the ECB's own forecasts, suggesting that wage pressures could also exceed projections. 

ECB policymakers meeting on Thursday are almost certain to keep policy unchanged after extending stimulus through a complex package in December.
While ECB President Christine Lagarde may acknowledge that inflation is at risk of exceeding projections, she is also expected to push back on mounting rate hike expectations, repeating that any rate changes this year are unlikely.

464,By Bloomberg,"<span>Feb 02, 2022 08:36AM ET</span>","U.S. Private Jobs Plunged Last Month on Omicron, ADP Data Show","(Bloomberg) -- Employment at U.S. companies declined in January by the most since the early days of the pandemic as the omicron variant of the coronavirus registered a swift yet likely temporary blow to the nation’s labor market.
Businesses’ payrolls fell by 301,000 last month in a broad-based decline, according to ADP Research Institute data released Wednesday. The median forecast in a Bloomberg survey of economists called for a 180,000 rise.
The decrease in employment, due to a surge in Covid-19 infections that led to some business closures and restrained activity, exacerbates tightness in the job market. A near-record number of unfilled positions and increased employee turnover are contributing to capacity constraints. Still, employment growth is seen picking up as the spread of the omicron variant wanes.
U.S. stock futures pared gains following the data while 10-year Treasury yields remained slightly lower. 
The data precede Friday’s monthly employment report from the Labor Department, which is currently forecast to show that private payrolls increased by 113,000 in January. The ADP figures don’t always follow the same pattern as the Labor Department’s data.
Broad-Based Decline
Service-provider employment fell by 274,000 in January, the biggest drop since April 2020, led by leisure and hospitality. Trade, transportation and utilities also posted a sizable decline. 
Payrolls at goods producers decreased by 27,000, reflecting declines in both construction and manufacturing.
“The labor market recovery took a step back at the start of 2022 due to the effect of the Omicron variant and its significant, though likely temporary, impact to job growth,” Nela Richardson, ADP’s chief economist, said in a statement.
Payrolls at companies with fewer than 50 employees dropped 144,000 in the month, while large businesses shed 98,000 jobs.
ADP’s payroll data represent firms employing nearly 26 million workers in the U.S.

Just over 31 million tourists visited in 2021, up from 19 million in 2020, the National Statistics Institute (INE) said, but that was a far cry from the 83.5 million who came in 2019.
Overall, tourists spent 34.82 billion euros ($39.30 billion) in Spain last year, compared with 19.79 billion in 2020 and 91.91 billion in 2019.
Even though Spain loosened entry restrictions in the spring in the hope of salvaging its summer season, an ever-changing patchwork of restrictions and guidelines across Europe kept a lid on foreign travel.
A sluggish start to international vaccine campaigns at the beginning of the year and the delayed launch of the European Union COVID passport also took their toll.
But arrivals data for December beat expectations despite the advance of the highly contagious Omicron variant.
Some 2.95 million tourists visited the country in December, the data showed compared to just 649,000 the previous year, driving a 76% increase in expenditure.
""December has turned out better than we expected and that helps us meet the end of year forecasts"", Minister of Industry, Commerce and Tourism Reyes Maroto said in a statement.

She said she was optimistic that 2022 would bring ""close to a full recovery of the sector"".

The number of people registering as jobless rose 0.55% in January from December, or by 17,173 people, to leave some 3.12 million out of work, the data showed.
Still, the increase was the slowest reported in 25 years for the month of January, when unemployment usually rises sharply as many temporary agricultural, hospitality and retail contracts end.
Joblessness rose 1.8% in agriculture and 1.5% in services but declined 2.8% in the construction industry, the data showed.
On an annual basis, the number of people registering as jobless fell 21% from the previous January, when Spain had yet to ramp up its COVID-19 vaccination programme and had imposed restrictions on travel and socialising to rein in cases.
Despite the uptick in unemployment, Spain added 71,948 net jobs over the month, with the bulk in services, separate data from the Social Security Ministry showed.

The number of people supported by a state-backed furlough scheme edged 2.4% higher to 105,043.
Data released last week showed overall unemployment reached its lowest level since before the 2008 financial crisis in the fourth quarter of 2021.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A measure of U.S. manufacturing activity fell to a 14-month low in January amid an outbreak of COVID-19 cases, supporting the view that economic growth lost steam at the start of the year.
But the survey from the Institute for Supply Management (ISM) on Tuesday marked the third straight month of signs of improvements in labor and supplier delivery performance. Unfinished work increased at its slowest pace in 15 months and manufacturers remained upbeat on demand.
Still, Timothy Fiore, chair of the ISM manufacturing business survey committee, noted ""shortages of critical intermediate materials, difficulties in transporting products and lack of direct labor on factory floors due to the COVID-19 Omicron variant.""
""While off to a somewhat rocky start, 2022 will be a good year for U.S. manufacturing,"" said Oren Klachkin, lead U.S. economist at Oxford Economics in New York.
The ISM's index of national factory activity dropped to a reading of 57.6 last month, the lowest since November 2020, from 58.8 in December. A reading above 50 indicates expansion in manufacturing, which accounts for 11.9% of the U.S. economy.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the index would drop to 57.5. All of the six biggest manufacturing industries - machinery, food, transportation equipment, computer and electronic products, chemical products, and petroleum and coal products reported moderate to strong growth. 
(Graphic: ISM PMI, https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-STOCKS/mypmnjkgevr/ism.png) 
The economy hit a soft patch in December which appeared to have persisted in early 2022 as coronavirus infections, driven by the Omicron variant, surged across the country. The ensuing disruptions at businesses and schools have led economists to anticipate a sharp slowdown in job growth in January.
Makers of chemical products reported ""massive interruptions to our production due to supplier COVID-19 problems limiting their manufacturing of key raw materials like steel cans and chemicals."" Similar sentiments were echoed by their counterparts in the fabricated metal products industry.
Transportation equipment manufacturers complained that ""transportation, labor and inflation issues continue to hamper our supply chain and ability to service our customers."" Machinery manufacturers said they were constrained by ""transportation restrictions and a lack of supplier manpower."" 
But makers of nonmetallic mineral products are seeing light at the end of the tunnel, reporting that ""the supply chain crunch may be loosening a bit."" 
Stocks on Wall Street were trading largely flat. The dollar slipped versus a basket of currencies. Prices of longer-dated U.S. Treasuries fell.
PRICES MARCH HIGHER
The economy grew at a 6.9% annualized rate in the fourth quarter, helping to boost overall growth in 2021 to 5.7%, the strongest performance since 1984. Economists at Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) on Monday slashed their first-quarter gross domestic product growth estimate to a 0.5% rate from a 2.0% pace, citing Omicron and reduced government payments to households.
The ISM survey's forward-looking new orders sub-index fell to 57.9 last month, the lowest reading since June 2020, from 61.0 in December. It was the second straight monthly slowdown in new orders. But customer inventories remain depressed, which could limit the pace of moderation in orders growth.
The replenishing of inventories will likely underpin manufacturing and sustain the economic expansion. 
A measure of order backlogs tumbled to 56.4%, the lowest since October 2020, from 62.8% in December, pointing to some easing in supply bottlenecks. That was reinforced by a gauge of supplier deliveries, which was little changed at 64.6. A reading above 50% indicates slower deliveries to factories. 
Still, prices at the factory gate marched higher. The survey's measure of prices paid by manufacturers increased to a reading of 76.1 from 68.2 in December, suggesting that inflation could remain uncomfortably high for a while. 
The Federal Reserve last week said it was likely to raise interest rates in March, with economists expecting as many as seven hikes this year to tame inflation. 
Despite Omicron's spread, factories hired more workers last month, with the ISM survey's measure of manufacturing employment increasing to a 10-month high, though turnover remained high.
The rise in factory employment is welcome amid fears of a possible decline in nonfarm payrolls in January.
According to a Reuters survey of economists, nonfarm payrolls likely increased by 150,000 jobs last month after rising by 199,000 in December. Estimates range from a drop of 400,000 jobs to an increase of 385,000. The Labor Department is scheduled to publish January's employment report on Friday.
But worker shortages remain an obstacle. A separate report from the Labor Department on Tuesday showed job openings increased 150,000 to 10.9 million at the end of December, close to the all-time high of 11.098 million reached in July. 
(Graphic: JOLTS, https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-STOCKS/gkplgjdxnvb/jolts.png) 

The nearly broad rise was led by accommodation and food services, which reported an additional 133,000 job openings. Layoffs hit a record low.
""It seems clear from these data that the labor market got even tighter at the end of December than was apparent in the December payroll data,"" said Conrad DeQuadros, senior economic advisor at Brean Capital in New York. ""These data suggest that any signs of weakness in job growth in January would not represent a weakening in labor demand.""

Job openings, a measure of labor demand, rose 150,000 to 10.9 million on the last day of December, not too far from an all-time high of 11.098 million reached in July, the Labor Department said on Tuesday in its monthly Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey, or JOLTS report. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast 10.3 million vacancies. 
The nearly broad rise was led by accommodation and food services, which reported an additional 133,000 job openings. There were also notable increases in vacancies in information, nondurable goods manufacturing as well as state and local government education.
But job openings decreased in finance and insurance, and wholesale trade.
The job openings rate was unchanged at 6.8%. Hiring fell 333,000 to 6.3 million. The decline was most pronounced in professional and business services, where hiring fell by 159,000 jobs. The hiring rate was little changed at 4.2%.
The government reported last month that nonfarm payrolls increased by 199,000 jobs in December, the fewest in a year.

The JOLTS report also showed the number of people voluntarily quitting their jobs decreased by 161,000 to a still-high 4.3 million in December. Fewer workers quit in healthcare and social assistance, accommodation and food services industries as well as construction.
But there were more resignations in the nondurable goods manufacturing industry. The quits rate was little changed at 2.9%. The number of quits decreased in the South.

The IHS Markit Mexico Manufacturing Purchasing Managers'Index tumbled to 46.1 in January from 49.4 in December, taking it well below the 50 threshold that separates growth from contraction.
The weakest reading in the index since last March is a setback for Mexico after a marked slowdown in the economy at the end of 2021 left it battling recession. 
The index has remained below 50 every month since March 2020, and reached a trough of 35.0 in April 2020 during the initial lockdown phase of the coronavirus pandemic. 

""The new wave of COVID-19 contamination exacerbated the already tough challenges facing Mexican manufacturers. Companies have struggled to see a monthly increase in new orders for a while, and the contraction gained speed in January,"" said Pollyanna De Lima, Economics Associate Director at IHS Markit. 
Sales and production contracted, and labor shortages intensified as staff absences increased due to rising levels of infection among workers, the survey said.

The Commerce Department said on Tuesday that construction spending rose 0.2% after advancing 0.6% in November. 
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast construction spending gaining 0.6%. Construction spending increased 9.0% on a year-on-year basis in December. It rose 8.2% in 2021.
Spending on private construction projects rose 0.7% in December. Outlays on residential construction surged 1.1%.
Single-family homebuilding spending accelerated 2.1%, while outlays on multi-family housing projects rose 0.4%. 
Homebuilding remains constrained by higher prices for building materials, especially framing lumber. The United States last November nearly doubled the duties on imported Canadian softwood lumber to 17.9% from 9% after a review of its anti-dumping and countervailing duty orders. Residential investment contracted for a third straight quarter in the fourth quarter.

Investment in private non-residential structures like gas and oil well drilling was unchanged in December. Spending on structures also dropped for a third straight quarter in the October-December period.
Spending on public construction projects dropped 1.6% in December. Outlays on state and local government construction projects declined 1.3%, while federal government spending tumbled 5.4%.

CAIRO (Reuters) - Egypt is considering replacing a popular bread subsidy with cash payments for the poor to protect the budget from soaring global wheat prices, but domestic inflation and a history of protests could make the government opt for a less ambitious reform.
Under the existing program, more than 60 million Egyptians, or nearly two thirds of the population, get 5 loaves of round bread daily for 50 cents a month, little changed since countrywide ""bread riots"" prevented a price hike in the 1970s.
The handout is a lifeline to the poor, but is widely criticized as wasteful. High global prices for wheat, which Egypt imports on a vast scale, led President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi to say last year that it was time to tackle the bread subsidy.
Ali Moselhy, the minister in charge of subsidies, told Reuters that inflation, which has climbed in recent months to 6% from 4% earlier in 2021, made it harder to replace the support for bread and other food with cash handouts.
""When inflation is stable, then you can introduce cash,"" he said. 
Moselhy has said he personally favours giving people money specifically to buy bread. Eligible Egyptians already get a monthly $3.20 voucher for other subsidised food.
However, he said a broader idea to introduce unconditional payments, favoured by many economists as the most efficient welfare system, risked driving up prices by putting more cash into circulation at a time of rising inflation. 
The government aims to draw up a plan for reformed food subsidies in time for March budget preparations, officials have recently said.
Moselhy said that for now, the government had not taken a decision on what to do, and was focused on improving the database of recipients, with the intention of ""finding out who needs what.""
That could mean that any changes are more limited in nature, perhaps trimming the program through means testing, restricting how many people in a household are eligible, or increasing the price of subsidized bread. 
Bassant Ibrahim, 36, a housewife living in Beheira, north-west of Cairo, said any such restrictions should not hurt families like hers, which relies on the subsidies to bolster her husband's $180-a-month teaching salary and feed four children. 
""There are rich people with cards who you can sift out, but the poor shouldn't have to pay the price,"" said Ibrahim, who said the family daily ate the ten loaves of bread they received, sometimes finishing them by lunchtime. 
BREAD RIOTS
Sisi previously oversaw reforms to fuel and power subsidies. In recent months his government raised the price of subsidised vegetable oils and sugar, following increases in commodity and shipping costs.
The food subsidy programme currently costs the government about $5.5 billion, with higher wheat prices expected to add $763 million to the 2021/2022 budget, according to finance ministry data.
Officials have tinkered with the bread scheme over the years, trying to restrict eligibility as Egypt's population has grown, repeatedly shrinking the weight of a subsidised loaf, and offering people credit for bread they did not collect. 
But the price of a subsidised basic loaf has remained constant at 5 piastres ($0.003) since the 1980s. 
To make a dent in the food commodity import bill would require deeper changes to the bread allowance, something governments have been wary of since an attempt scrap subsidies in 1977 set off the riots, which continued for days until the decision was reversed.
Sisi's adjustments to subsidies so far and his announcement that it was time to tackle bread have triggered grumblings, but street protests are banned and extremely rare.
Ahmed Mohamed, 24, a married gardener in Cairo with two children, said he could live without the government paying for his daily bread. 
""There are other people who need it more than I do,"" he said.

However, Ahmed Darwish, a former minister who oversaw a transition to a smart subsidy card system in the early 2000s, said authorities would have to step carefully to reassure people that any changes will not leave them overly exposed. 
""Until the government says that this subsidy would be increased with inflation, they have to comfort people,"" Darwish said.

The IHS Markit Canada Manufacturing Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) fell to a seasonally adjusted 56.2 in January from 56.5 in December, matching July last year as the lowest reading since February 2021. A reading above 50 shows growth in the sector.
""COVID-19 yet again hit performance with output growth slowing notably,"" Shreeya Patel, an economist at IHS Markit, said in a statement.
The output index fell to its lowest level since June 2020 at 51.5 from 53.3 in December as a lack of materials and the pandemic weighed on growth.
Canadian provincial governments have only just started to ease restrictions rolled out to slow the spread of the Omicron variant.
The restrictions as well as port congestions and adverse weather contributed to a deterioration in vendor performance.
The suppliers' delivery times index was at the fifth lowest in the 11-year history of the series, falling to 27.8 from 28.7 in December.
More encouragingly, there were signs of easing inflationary pressures, with the measure of input prices dropping to the lowest level in 11 months, and stronger demand.

""Fortunately, Canada boasts a high vaccination rate, which has allowed for growth to continue in the manufacturing sector despite a resurgence in cases,"" Patel said.

OTTAWA (Reuters) -Canada's economy climbed to above pre-pandemic levels for the first time in November, bolstering a strong fourth quarter even as activity stagnated in December with the emergence of the Omicron variant, official data showed on Tuesday. 
The economy grew 0.6% in November from the previous month, beating expectations for a gain of 0.3%, but growth in December was likely flat, Statistics Canada said. The agency said annualized gross domestic product in the fourth quarter was likely up 6.3%, beating the Bank of Canada's forecast of 5.8%.
""While not far from the Bank of Canada's latest estimate, it is a bit higher yet, and is simply another turn of the screw, all but ensuring a rate hike at their next meeting on March 2,"" said Doug Porter, chief economist at BMO Capital Markets, in a note.
The central bank held its key interest rate unchanged last week, but said hikes were coming as Canada's economy no longer needed extraordinary support to deal with the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Money markets are betting on a first increase in March, with a total of six rate hikes this year. The Canadian dollar was trading 0.1% higher at 1.2689 to the greenback, or 78.81 U.S. cents. [BOCWATCH]
The December and fourth-quarter GDP numbers are preliminary estimates, with official data coming next month. Economic activity is now 0.2% above February 2020 levels, Statscan said.
Canada's goods-producing sector expanded 0.5% in November, while the service-producing sector grew 0.6%. Services were bolstered by higher attendance at major league sporting events, including World Cup men's soccer qualifying matches.

Still, the economic momentum of November slowed in December as the Omicron variant took hold and provinces tightened restrictions. While analysts expect a hit in January, they see the economy bouncing back again relatively quickly.
""Economic data is expected to look weaker in January with Omicron spread,"" said Nathan Janzen, senior economist at RBC Economics, in a note. ""But with restrictions already starting to ease, that softening is expected to be short-lived.""

BERLIN (Reuters) -A big fall in German retail sales as COVID-19 curbs kept people out of shops over the usually busy Christmas period underlined its flagging economic recovery, but signs that jobs and production are picking up suggested a brighter start to 2022. 
Data on Tuesday showed retail sales tumbled 5.5% in December in real terms, a much steeper decline than the 1.4% forecast by a Reuters poll of economists.
Sales of textiles, clothing, shoes and leather goods were hit especially hard by a requirement that customers in non-essential shops show proof of COVID-19 vaccination or recovery, part of measures imposed to halt the Omicron wave of the virus.
""The usual end-of-year fireworks clearly backfired this time,"" said Alexander Krueger, an economist at Hauck Aufhaeuser Lampe Privatbank. ""The new restrictions are a big part of this. Many people are probably also cutting back on spending as they are afraid of high energy costs."" 
Surveys of Germany's labour market and manufacturing sector struck a more positive note, suggesting that producers were starting to crank up output as supply shortages ease. 
COVID measures and supply chain problems that have affected Germany's large auto industry contributed to a final quarter contraction of 0.7% in Europe's biggest economy compared to Q3 and kept growth to 2.8% in all of 2021. 
The German economy underperformed the wider euro zone, and notably its second-biggest economy, France, which grew 7% last year, the most since 1969, data on Friday and Monday showed.
France largely lifted pandemic-related restrictions towards mid-year. It has reported 3,489 infections per 100,000 people over the last seven days, compared with 1,285 in Germany. 
Worries about rising prices, especially for energy, among inflation-wary Germans are likely to hit retailers further in 2022, industry association HDE said, warning that almost 16,000 shops could disappear this year.
It said online shopping was likely to drive growth in the sector this year, expanding 13.5% compared to 1.2% for physical shops, and called for the bar to be lifted on non-essential shopping by unvaccinated people to help smaller retailers.
""This measure, which is useless in the fight against the pandemic, must finally be dropped nationwide,"" HDE Chief Executive Stefan Genth said in a statement. 
About a quarter of the German population is not vaccinated against COVID-19. 
SALES STABLE ON YEAR
Retail sales is a volatile indicator and often subject to revisions.
The Federal Statistics Office said sales figures adjusted for prices remained stable on the year, compared with an average Reuters poll forecast for an increase of 1.1% compared with December 2020. 
""The December decline is probably related to the fact many retail outlets have started asking for proof of COVID-19 vaccination or recovery, and the impact of seasonal adjustment due to Christmas,"" it said in a statement.

Compared with February 2020, the month before the coronavirus crisis hit Germany, retail sales in December 2021 were up 0.7%.
Recent surveys have suggested morale is improving among German businesses as supply bottlenecks ease.

LONDON (Reuters) - British manufacturing output grew at the fastest pace in six months in January as global supply chain pressures began to ease and factories largely shrugged off a wave of cases caused by the Omicron variant of coronavirus, a survey showed on Tuesday.
The IHS Markit/CIPS Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) showed the output index rose to 54.5 in January - its highest since July 2021 - from 53.6 in December, stronger than an initial flash estimate of 53.8.
Factories hired workers at the second-fastest rate in 11 years, and they reported some easing of inflation pressures.
""Although supply chain constraints continued to stymie growth, there were signs that these were past their peak, a factor contributing to a slight easing in purchase price inflation,"" IHS Markit said.
Softening price pressures will be welcomed by the Bank of England, which is widely expected to raise interest rates on Thursday for the second time in less than two months due to concern that high inflation could prove persistent.
The headline PMI edged down to a four-month low of 57.3 in January from 57.9 in December, which reflected the weakest growth of new orders since February 2021 as well as faster deliveries from suppliers - a factor that depresses the index as in normal times it is a sign of spare capacity.
Britain's economy only regained its pre-crisis size in November, and many economists reckon it shrank by around 0.5% over December and January when a surge of COVID-19 cases hit hospitality and office staff were advised to work from home where possible.
On Sunday, the Confederation of British Industry said its members estimated private-sector growth in the three months to January was the weakest since the three months to April, when many businesses were still operating under lockdown.

However, Tuesday's PMI data pointed to some relief in the supply-chain disruption that has contributed to consumer price inflation rising to its highest in nearly 30 years.
The PMI showed manufacturers' input prices rose at the slowest pace since April 2021 while output prices rose at the slowest pace since May - although in outright terms both price increases are far above their long-run average.

The BoE said 71,015 mortgages were approved in December, up from 67,859 in November and above all forecasts in a Reuters poll that had pointed to 66,000 approvals.
Britain's housing market has been robust through most of the pandemic, and there were surges in mortgage lending ahead of the expiration of temporary tax breaks in June and September 2021.
Tuesday's BoE data - alongside robust house price growth figures for January from mortgage lender Nationwide - pointed to continued momentum, despite rising BoE interest rates and a squeeze on incomes from fast-rising consumer price inflation.
""Though the market isn't as frenetic as it was last year, there is no shortage of demand from both purchasers and those looking to remortgage before the Bank of England raises the base rate again,"" said Simon Gammon, managing partner at mortgage broker Knight Frank Finance.
Nationwide's data showed house prices in January were 11.2% higher than a year earlier, the biggest annual increase since June 2020.
Britain was hit by a wave of cases of the Omicron variant of coronavirus in December, which hurt consumer spending as many people chose to stay at home and avoid socialising.
Net consumer lending rose by 831 million pounds ($1.12 billion) in December, broadly as expected and down from November's 999 million pound increase.
""Consumers exercised a touch more caution as Omicron COVID-19 cases surged at the end of last year, but it still suggests the economy didn't collapse,"" Adam Hoyes, economist at consultancy Capital Economics, said.
Lending has been picking up after a slump during the pandemic when many richer households built up savings due to reduced opportunities to spend on travel and socialising.

Consumer credit rose by 5.5% on an annualised basis in the final quarter of 2021, the biggest rise since the three months to the end of February 2020, before the start of pandemic restrictions in Britain.

IHS Markit's final manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) rose to a five-month high of 58.7 in January from December's 58.0, below an initial ""flash"" estimate of 59.0 but comfortably above the 50 mark separating growth from contraction.
An index measuring output, which feeds into a composite PMI due on Thursday and seen as a good gauge of economic health, jumped to 55.4 from 53.8.
""Euro zone manufacturers appear to be weathering the Omicron storm better than prior COVID-19 waves so far, with firms reporting the largest production and order book improvements for four months in January,"" said Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit.
""The improvement is by no means evenly spread across the euro zone, however, with resurgent growth in Germany, the Netherlands and Austria contrasting with slowdowns in Italy, Spain and Greece and near-stalled production in France.""
Raw material prices continued to soar, albeit at a slower pace than in December, and factories passed more of that burden on to consumers. The output prices index climbed to 72.7 from 70.2 - the second-highest reading in almost two decades.

Euro zone inflation is set to burn hotter throughout 2022 than previously expected, according to economists polled by Reuters last month, which could pressure the European Central Bank to tighten policy once the Omicron wave of the pandemic passes.
The ECB, which meets on Thursday, has resisted calls for tighter policy, sticking to the view price pressures will ease this year.

LONDON (Reuters) - British grocery inflation rose to 3.8% in the four weeks to Jan. 23, with the prices of savoury snacks, crisps and beef rising the most, market researcher Kantar said on Tuesday, underlining the growing cost-of-living squeeze facing many households.
The outcome represented a 0.3 percentage point increase from Kantar's report for December and taken over the course of a 12-month period adds an extra 180 pounds ($242) to the average household's annual grocery bill.
""We're now likely to see shoppers striving to keep costs down by searching for cheaper products and promotions,"" said Fraser McKevitt, Kantar's head of retail and consumer insight.
With official UK data showing overall consumer prices rose in annual terms by 5.4% in December, the highest rate in almost 30 years, inflation is a hot political topic.
Kantar said supermarket sales fell by 3.8% over the 12 weeks to Jan. 23 year-on-year, though sales were 8.0% higher than the same period in 2020, before the COVID-19 pandemic impacted trading.
Market leader Tesco (OTC:TSCDY) again outperformed its big four rivals with a year-on-year sales decline of 1.9% over the 12 weeks.
Sainsbury's, Asda and Morrisons saw sales fall 4.8%, 5.3% and 8.5% respectively.
While Tesco's market share moved up 0.6 percentage points to 27.9%, marking a full year of gains, its three biggest rivals all lost share.
Kantar also noted there was evidence of people scrubbing up as work from home directives ended and socialising increased.
It said razor blade sales rose by 14% and spend on deodorant increased by 20% as Britons strived to make themselves presentable.

House prices jumped by 0.8% in January, following a 1.1% increase in December. A Reuters poll of economists had pointed to a 0.6% increase last month.
House prices stood 11.2% higher than their level in January 2021, the fastest annual growth since June and again outstripping the consensus forecast for a rise of 10.8%.
Other surveys have also pointed to strong house price growth, even after the expiry of temporary tax breaks on property purchases during the pandemic.
As in other countries, British house prices surged during the pandemic as people rushed to move to bigger homes with gardens. Nationwide said demand was likely to cool this year. 
""Reduced affordability is likely to exert a dampening impact on market activity and house price growth, especially since household finances are also coming under pressure from sharp increases in the cost of living,"" said Robert Gardner, Nationwide chief economist.
Consumer price inflation hit an almost 30-year high of 5.4% in December and looks set to peak at around 6% in April, according to the Bank of England, which is due to publish mortgage lending data at 0930 GMT on Tuesday.

""We expect households' real disposable income to fall by around 1.5% this year as inflation surges and taxes rise,"" said Samuel Tombs, economist at consultancy Pantheon Macroeconomics.
""All told, then, we think house price growth will fail to maintain its recent momentum, with month-to-month gains averaging just 0.2% in the first half of this year.""

The INSEE statistics agency said consumer prices rose 0.1% in January, giving a 12-month inflation rate of 3.3%, down from 3.4% in December. Economists polled by Reuters had on average forecast a rate of 3.0%.
While prices for manufactured goods fell, nearly all other prices were higher and energy prices were up 19.7% over one year following increases on global oil markets.

Not using the EU-agreed methodology to calculate inflation, INSEE said its consumer price index rose slightly to 2.9% from 2.8% in December, reaching its highest level since September 2008.
The national index is more closely followed in France, while the EU-harmonised index is used outside France in order to compare inflation rates among countries using the euro.

The Markit Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) rose to 51.8 in January from 51.6 in the previous month, above the 50.0 mark that separates expansion from contraction for the fourth month in a row.
""Russian manufacturing firms signalled an encouraging start to 2022 as domestic and foreign client demand conditions improved,"" said Sian Jones, a senior economist at IHS Markit, which compiles the survey.
Companies linked a rise in new sales to more robust business and consumer spending.
The pace of job creation in the manufacturing sector was the fastest since November 2018 as the degree of optimism increased to its highest since April, the monthly survey showed.
But inflation accelerated further. Output charge inflation reached a five-month high, while input price growth, or cost inflation, hit a six-month peak. 

""As headwinds from higher costs do not look likely to dissipate in the near-term, pressure on margins is expected to persist across the Russian manufacturing sector in 2022,"" Jones said.
The Russian central bank is expected to raise rates further as soon as in February to rein in stubbornly high inflation.

New home prices in 100 cities fell 0.01% in January from a month earlier, after a 0.02% drop in December, according to data from China Index Academy, one of the country's largest independent real estate research firms.
The sector is facing headwinds as regulatory borrowing curbs imposed in 2020 led to some developers defaulting on offshore debt obligations, and there has been a selloff in developers' bonds and stocks, and cuts in their credit ratings.

In recent months, Beijing took steps to restore stability in the sector by lowering mortgage rates, offering subsidies and urging banks to provide appropriate lending to developers.
China is now drafting rules to make it easier for property developers to access much-needed funds from prepayments placed in escrow, and there are plans to exempt credit used for distressed acquisitions from regulatory debt caps.

The supply chain disruptions forced businesses to build up safety stocks, with the survey showing holdings of raw materials increased at the strongest rate in nearly eight years.
The final au Jibun Bank Japan Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) in January rose to 55.4 on a seasonally adjusted basis, up from a 54.6 flash reading and the previous month's final of 54.3.
That marked the fastest growth since February 2014 and the 12th straight month of expansion in manufacturing activity.
""Japanese manufacturers entered the new year in strong spirits,"" said Usamah Bhatti, economist IHS Markit, which compiles the survey.
""Supply chain disruption remained widespread at the start of 2022, however, with a further sharp lengthening of delivery times.""
Output also saw the fastest growth since February 2014, while the expansion rate of overall orders hit its highest since April last year, the survey showed.
But it also highlighted continuing cost pressures from supply problems remained a drag, as the rate of growth in input prices remained much more elevated than that of output prices. 
Output prices among manufacturers, however, still grew at the strongest pace since July 2008 as firms were seen passing on the extra costs to their customers.

MEXICO CITY (Reuters) -Mexico's economy contracted for a second straight quarter in the last three-month period of 2021, according to official data published on Monday, putting it in a technical recession and joining regional powerhouse Brazil, whose economy fell back into negative territory last year.
Gross domestic product (GDP) in Latin America's second largest economy shrank in the fourth quarter by 0.1% from the previous three-month period in seasonally adjusted terms, preliminary data published by Mexico's INEGI national statistics agency showed.
That beat out expectations in a Reuters poll https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/mexicos-economy-likely-entered-recession-fourth-quarter-2022-01-28 for GDP to contract in the fourth quarter by 0.3%, after the economy declined by 0.4% in the third quarter.
Mexico's Deputy Finance Minister Gabriel Yorio said Friday that talk of a ""technical recession,"" https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/mexicos-finance-ministry-says-talk-technical-recession-imprecise-2022-01-28 defined as two consecutive quarters of contraction, does not take into account coronavirus-related economic volatility and global supply chain issues.
Yorio said that global supply bottlenecks, increased prices for raw materials, and higher costs for ground transportation and sea shipping are weighing on the economy.
""With its weak Q4 outturn, Mexico has joined Brazil in technical recession, an extremely disappointing result that leaves real GDP in Mexico a whopping 4% below its mid-2019 pre-COVID peak,"" said Fiona Mackie, regional director for Latin America and the Caribbean at Economist Intelligence Unit.
Brazil's weakened economy is in danger of sinking deeper into recession this year ahead of October's presidential election, as anxiety over the vote and steep interest rate rises continue to hurt growth, according to a Reuters poll https://www.reuters.com/article/latam-economy-poll-idUSL1N2U00P3.
Jonathan Heath, a board member of Mexico's central bank and one of its most outspoken, jumped into the fray over where the Mexican economy stood at the end of last year.
""The idea that the economy is in a recession because there were two consecutive quarters with a negative GDP rate is a simplification of what a recession is,"" said Heath on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR).
""If there are two quarters in a row with negative GDP, it increases the possibility that there is a recession, but that is not enough by itself. A recession has to comply with three requirements: depth, duration, and spread. For now, we comply only with duration.""
RECOVERY TO REMAIN SLUGGISH
Moody's (NYSE:MCO) Investors Service analyst Renzo Merino predicted that economic growth in 2022 would be lower than Mexican authorities are aiming for, bearing in mind persistent negative momentum in investment.
""This situation may be repeated in the coming years, generating additional pressure on fiscal accounts in the remainder of (President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador's) six-year term, given the possibility of a lower performance of revenues and a growing rigidity in public spending,"" Merino said. 
Nikhil Sanghani, emerging markets economist at Capital Economics, took a more cautiously optimistic view.
""We doubt that Mexico will remain mired in recession for much longer. Supply shortages appear to be easing which should allow auto production to strengthen while the drag to output from the outsourcing law will soon begin to fade,"" said Sanghani.
Sanghani forecast the recovery will remain sluggish over coming quarters, however, weighed down by a recent tightening of COVID restrictions and austere fiscal policy.
INEGI's figures showed that tertiary activities, which comprise the service economy, contracted by 0.7% in the fourth quarter from the previous three-month period in seasonally adjusted terms.
The decline of ""the labor intensive tertiary sector (is) a reflection of the impact of the recently approved outsourcing law which led to a large decline in services rendered to corporates, businesses,"" Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) economist Alberto Ramos said in a research note.
Primary activities, which encompass farming, fishing and mining, rose by 0.3%, while secondary activities, which include manufacturing, increased by 0.4%.
The economy expanded by 5.0% for full-year 2021, the data showed, after shrinking by 8.5% in 2020 in what was Mexico's worst recession since the Great Depression of the 1930s.
""The strong growth in 2021 is more the result of the arithmetic effect generated by the low base of comparison in 2020 and less due to genuine growth derived from productive capacity,"" said Alfredo Coutino, head of Latin America analysis at Moody's Analytics.

GDP grew by 1.0% in the fourth quarter versus the same period a year earlier, data showed.
INEGI will publish final GDP data for the fourth quarter on Feb. 25.

Consumer prices, harmonised to make them comparable with inflation data from other European Union countries (HICP), rose 5.1% year on year compared with 5.7% in December, the Federal Statistics Office said.
The national consumer price index (CPI) rose by 4.9% on an annual basis, easing from 5.3% in December.
A Reuters poll of analysts had forecast the CPI rate at 4.3% and the HICP figure at 4.7%.
""The decline in the inflation rate is only due to the fact that the effect of the temporary reduction in VAT in 2020 no longer distorts the year-on-year comparison upwards as in the previous months,"" Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) economist Marco Wagner said.
At the same time, supply bottlenecks and high energy prices significantly reduced the expected positive effect, analysts said.
As surveys of German and foreign companies have so far shown no significant easing of supply chain disruption, the year-on-year CPI rates are likely to stay ​​above 4.5% for a few more months, said Michael Heise, chief economist at HQ Trust.
""In view of the serious geopolitical tensions with Russia, betting on a desired drop in energy prices in the near future appears to be wishful thinking,"" Heise added.
Euro zone inflation hit 5% last month, the highest on record for the 19-country currency bloc, but the ECB expects it back under its 2% target in both 2023 and 2024, even without policy tightening, as one-off pressures ease.
ECB chief economist Philip Lane told a Lithuanian newspaper last week the central bank would tighten policy if inflation was seen holding above its target, but such a scenario appears less likely for now.
The ECB meets next on Thursday but no policy move is expected as the bank unveiled a complex package of measures in December.

Contrary to earlier projections, the German Economy Ministry said last week it expects consumer price inflation to rise further this year.
The head of Germany's IG Metall union said on Thursday that higher real wages would be a key goal in upcoming collective bargaining rounds in the iron and steel, as well as the metal and electrical, industries.

The European Union's statistics office estimated on Monday that gross domestic product in the 19 countries sharing the euro expanded a quarterly 0.3% in October-December 2021, slowing sharply from 2.3% growth in the previous three months. The flash reading was as expected in a Reuters poll of economists. 
Year-on-year growth was still a respectable 4.6%, roughly in line with economists' expectations.
""The (coronavirus) wave in autumn left clear traces in the euro economy,"" said Christoph Weil, economist at Commerzbank (DE:CBKG).
""There were significant differences between the euro countries due to the pandemic. In spring the Omicron wave should have subsided and the economy should grow more strongly again.""
A surge in infections caused by the Omicron variant of the coronavirus caused COVID-19 measures to be reimposed in many European countries at the end of last year. 
Germany, the euro zone's biggest economy, was the weakest performer, contracting 0.7% quarter-on-quarter and growing just 1.4% year-on-year.
France, the bloc's second biggest economy, saw quarterly growth of 0.7% and a 5.4% year-on-year expansion, while third-biggest Italy grew 0.6% on the quarter and 6.4% on the year. 
""The recent lifting of COVID restrictions in many European countries should help to get economic and business growth back on track,"" said Rachel Barton, economist at Accenture (NYSE:ACN).

A survey by the German Ifo economic institute on Monday gave grounds for optimism, showing that the number of German manufacturing companies reporting bottlenecks and problems with intermediate products and raw materials was falling.

497,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 31, 2022 01:16AM ET</span>",Japan's factory output dips more than expected as risks emerge,"By Daniel Leussink
TOKYO (Reuters) -Japan's factory output shrank for the first time in three months in December as a decline in machinery production outweighed a small rise in autos, casting a cloud over the strength of the economic recovery.
Retail sales posted their third straight month of year-on-year gains in December as low coronavirus cases encouraged shoppers. Record infections this month driven by the Omicron variant, however, are expected to have hit consumer sentiment.
Factory output lost 1.0% in December from the previous month, official data showed on Monday, pulled down by a decline in output of general-purpose and production machinery, including chip-making equipment and engines used in manufacturing.
That meant that output, which fell faster than the 0.8% decline forecast in a Reuters poll of economists, dropped for the first time in three months.
""Output especially fell among capital goods makers, probably due to the strong impact from the chip shortages,"" said Takeshi Minami, chief economist at Norinchukin Research Institute.
""It suggests its impact is widening even though the focus has been on the car industry.""
Automakers have been forced to curb production even as demand in key markets such as China rebounds, while they also have had to contend with soaring semiconductor demand at consumer electronic companies.
 Toyota  Motor (NYSE:TM) Co, the world's biggest car seller, said this month it expected production to fall short of an annual target of 9 million vehicles for its current business year that runs until end-March due to the drag from the chip shortage.
Last week, motor maker Nidec Corp's third-quarter operating profit dipped as rising material prices and a shortage of semiconductors squeezed margins.
The data showed output growth of cars and other vehicles slowed to 1.5% from the previous month in December, much weaker than the 43.7% surge in November and a 15.9% jump in October.
Some companies in the car industry had weathered the competition for chip supply better than others, a government official said.
""Procurement is increasing, but the situation is different from firm to firm,"" the official said.
Manufacturers surveyed by the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) expected output to grow 5.2% in January and 2.2% in February.
The forecasts did not include production cuts made after the Jan. 10 survey deadline, the official said.
OUTLOOK RISKS
The world's third-largest economy is projected to expand an annualised 4.5% in the current quarter, a Reuters poll showed this month, but some economists warned of downside risks to the rosy projections.
First-quarter growth faces a hit to private spending from the coronavirus spread and declines in car output, said Yoshiki Shinke, chief economist at Dai-ichi Life Research Institute.
""There's a possibility growth will be negative in the January-March period, though it will depend on the infection situation,"" Shinke wrote in a report.
Separate data showed retail sales rose 1.4% in December from a year earlier, smaller than the expected 2.7% rise.
That marked the third straight month of increase for sales, which were lifted by stronger demand for general merchandise and food and beverages, though year-on-year growth slowed.

Japan has seen a surge in COVID-19 cases caused by the Omicron variant in recent weeks, forcing the government to roll out tighter curbs that now cover 70% of the country.
An index gauging consumer confidence fell 2.4 points in January to its lowest since August, a government survey showed, in a sign the record infections due to the Omicron variant were hurting sentiment.

Investing.com – China’s economy continued its slowdown in January 2022, with manufacturing output falling and the latest COVID-19 outbreaks limiting consumer spending. Smaller businesses bore much of the pain, with a private survey focused on smaller, export-oriented firms falling below the 50-mark indicating growth.
Data released by the National Bureau of Statistics on Sunday showed that the manufacturing purchasing managers index (PMI) was 50.1. Forecasts prepared by Investing.com predicted a 50 figure, and the index was at 50.3 in December 2021.
The non-manufacturing PMI was 51.1, lower than the previous month’s reading of 52.7.
The slowdown added to other tailwinds that the Chinese economy faces, including falling home sales and the latest COVID-19 outbreaks that led to travel restrictions and lockdowns in some cities. Authorities are aiming to stabilize the economy ahead of a key political leadership meeting later in the year, with the People’s Bank of China cutting interest rates and officials pledging more fiscal support earlier in the month.
“The weak PMI indicates the policy easing measures from the government have not yet been passed to the real economy,” Pinpoint Asset Management Ltd. chief economist Zhiwei Zhang said in a note.
“We expect the government will step up policy support in coming months, particularly through more fiscal spending.”
Meanwhile, the Caixin manufacturing PMI, also released on Sunday, was at 49.1. Forecasts prepared by Investing.com had predicted a 50.4 reading, while December’s figure was 50.9.
January and February are normally slow production periods due to the Lunar New Year holidays. In 2022, activity was also impacted by the government’s orders for steel plants to reduce output, aimed at reducing air pollution ahead of the Beijing Winter Olympics starting on Feb. 4.
Manufacturers also continued to see higher costs in January, with input prices rising at the fastest rate in three months. “That could drive the producer price index up and narrow the room for monetary policy,” China Renaissance Securities Hong Kong’s Bruce Pang told Bloomberg.
The downward pressure on the economy could continue in the near term, with restricted Lunar New Year holiday celebrations impacting consumption, while production also remains low, according to Bloomberg chief Asia economist Chang Shu.
“The authorities have made a sharp pivot to increase policy support. This should cushion the slowdown, but the impact may not be discernible until late in the first quarter after holiday-related distortions in activity have subsided.”"
500,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jan 30, 2022 07:45PM ET</span>",Japan Factory Production Falls in December After Record Jump,"(Bloomberg) -- Japan’s industrial production fell in December, following record gains a month earlier but an overall solid quarter for manufacturing likely helped restore economic growth at the end of 2021. 
Declines in production of general machinery and chip-making devices pushed overall factory output down 1% from the level in November, when it surged a record 7%, the economy ministry reported Monday. Analysts had expected a 0.6% drop. 
A separate report showed retail sales also dropped 1% in December, slipping on a month-on-month basis for the first time since August even before the omicron variant began its rapid spread.
 
Despite December’s drop in production, a solid quarter for manufacturing suggests Japan’s economy was getting back on track at the end of last year after shrinking in five of the previous nine quarters. For the quarter, production increased 1% on a seasonally-adjusted basis.
Record cases of the virus at home and abroad, driven by the fast-spreading omicron variant, have clouded the outlook in recent weeks. Supply-chain disruptions that have bedeviled manufacturers everywhere spurred the International Monetary Fund last week to predict slower global growth this year.

“We expect production to pick up in January, driven by strong exports to the U.S. with a tailwind from a weak yen. Even so, supply chain problems caused by outbreaks of the omicron variant as well as China’s slowdown remain downside risks.”

Manufacturers surveyed by the economy ministry said they planned to raise output by 5.2% this month and another 2.2% in February, results that suggest continued recovery in the factory sector.
Still, supply chain problems persist. Over the past few weeks,  Toyota  Motor (NYSE:TM) Corp., Japan’s biggest company by sales, was forced to announce several cuts to its January production due in part to component shortages stemming from a Covid outbreak at a Japanese factory operated by a seatbelt and airbag maker.
Covid Outbreak at Seat Belt Supplier Behind Toyota Output Cuts
In the U.S., the Biden administration last week warned that the global semiconductor shortage will persist until at least the second half of this year, promising long-term strain on a range of including automakers and the consumer electronics industry. 
Factory output will be key to keeping Japanese growth going this quarter, given surging omicron cases that have triggered renewed restrictions across the country that are likely to deter shopping and eating out. With the 7-day average of infections now topping 70,000 nationally, quasi-emergencies were declared for Tokyo and most other major business centers this month.
A purchasing manager’s index of manufacturing activity released last week showed the sector holding up in January, with the gauge climbing to its highest level in at least three years. The survey showed new order growth quickening at the fastest pace in nine months. 
Prime Minister Fumio Kishida’s stimulus package is also expected to start supporting the economy this year with a range of measures including subsidies to ease the impact of rising gasoline prices on consumers.

The figures from a monthly Lloyds (LON:LLOY) Bank survey will give mixed signals to the Bank of England on the persistence of inflation pressures - and the extent to which they will hamper growth - as it considers a widely expected rate rise this week.
A record 49% of the 1,200 businesses surveyed between Jan. 4 and Jan. 18 said they expected to raise prices, up from 45% in December. 
But the proportion expecting to raise pay by 2% - well below the current 5.4% rate of inflation - fell to a five-month low of 41% from 48% in December.
The number planning pay rises of 3% fell to 21% from 26% and those share of those planning 4% pay rises dropped to 12% from 14%.
""Businesses remain cautious about the pandemic and are facing into challenges from rising cost pressures although many are raising their prices in response,"" Lloyds Bank economist Hann-Ju Ho said.

Overall confidence slipped from December and hiring intentions were the lowest since August - although 46% of firms still plan to increase their headcount over the next 12 months.
A monthly survey from the Confederation of British Industry on Sunday showed that private-sector growth in the three months to January was the weakest since April, reflecting a big hit to many firms from a wave of Omicron cases in December and January.

502,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jan 30, 2022 06:09PM ET</span>",China’s Economic Woes Mount as Manufacturing Slips in January,"(Bloomberg) -- China’s economy continued to slow at the start of the year, with manufacturing output slipping and Covid-19 outbreaks curbing consumer spending.
The official purchasing managers’ surveys released on Sunday showed a moderation in factory production and services in January. Small businesses bore the brunt of the pain, with a separate private index dropping to its lowest in almost two years.
The disruptions add to the woes facing the Chinese economy, with home sales falling and consumption sluggish due to tightened restrictions to contain the spread of the highly-contagious omicron virus variant. Beijing is seeking to stabilize the economy ahead of a key political leadership meeting later this year, with the central bank already cutting interest rates and officials pledging more fiscal support. 
“The weak PMI indicates the policy easing measures from the government have not yet been passed to the real economy,” Zhiwei Zhang, chief economist at Pinpoint Asset Management Ltd., wrote in a note. “We expect the government will step up policy support in coming months, particularly through more fiscal spending.”
The official manufacturing purchasing managers’ index declined to 50.1, the National Bureau of Statistics said Sunday, remaining slightly above the 50-mark that separates expansion from contraction. The non-manufacturing gauge, which measures activity in the construction and services sectors, fell to 51.1.
What Bloomberg Economics Says...
Looking ahead, we expect downward pressures on the economy to persist in the near term, with restrained celebrations around the Lunar New Year holiday dragging on consumption, while production remains in low gear. The authorities have made a sharp pivot to increase policy support. This should cushion the slowdown but the impact may not be discernible until late in the first quarter, after LNY-related distortions in activity have subsided.
Chang Shu, chief Asia economist

The PMI gauge of small companies dropped to 46 this month, the lowest since February 2020 and taking a contracting streak to a ninth month. 
That was echoed by the Caixin Manufacturing Purchasing Managers’ Index, also released on Sunday, which fell to 49.1, the worst in almost two years. The private survey focuses on smaller, export-oriented firms compared with the official manufacturing PMI.
Chinese factories often see a production lull in January and February as workers head home for the Lunar New Year holidays. Activity has also been affected this year by the government’s orders for steel plants to trim output to reduce air pollution ahead of the Winter Olympics in Beijing which begin Friday.
Travel restrictions and lockdowns in some places are curbing spending on services, with the PMI sub-index for the sector dropping sharply to 50.3, the lowest since August. Residents in places where there have been recent Covid-19 outbreaks, including Beijing, Shanghai and the northern port city of Tianjin, have been urged to not leave the cities unless necessary.
Chinese Holiday Travel Makes a Slow Recovery as Omicron Spreads
Manufacturers were also squeezed by higher costs in January, with input prices rising at the fastest rate in three months, according to the official PMI data. 
“That could drive the producer price index up and narrow the room for monetary policy,” said Bruce Pang of China Renaissance Securities Hong Kong.
Construction activity continued to cool this month, with the sub-index falling to 55.4, NBS figures show, suggesting sentiment remained subdued given the property downturn and the limited effect that government spending on infrastructure is having so far. The approaching holiday and cold winter may have also had some impact on building.

503,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 30, 2022 02:20AM ET</span>","China Jan factory activity growth slows, demand wanes as COVID surges","BEIJING (Reuters) - Growth in China's factory activity slowed in January as a resurgence of COVID-19 cases and tough lockdowns hit production and demand, but the slight expansion offered some signs of resilience as the world's second-largest economy enters a likely bumpy new year. 
The official manufacturing Purchasing Manager's Index (PMI) registered 50.1 in January, remaining above the 50-point mark that separates growth from contraction, but slowing from 50.3 in December, data from the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) showed on Sunday.
Analysts had expected the PMI to fall to 50. 
The official results contrasted with those in a private survey https://www.reuters.com/markets/europe/chinas-jan-factory-activity-contracts-covid-lockdowns-bite-caixin-pmi-2022-01-30 of mostly small manufacturers in coastal regions, which showed activity fell at the fastest rate in 23 months. 
China's economy started last year strong, reviving from a sharp pandemic-induced slump, but it started losing momentum in the summer, weighed down by debt problems in the property market and strict anti-virus measures that hit consumer confidence and spending. 
Rising raw material costs and soft demand have also eroded corporate profit margins. Profits at industrial firms rose at their slowest pace in December for more than a year and a half.
With the real estate slump expected to drag on through at least the first half of this year and the emergence of more infectious COVID-19 variants, China's central bank has started cutting interest rates and pumping more cash into the financial system to lower borrowing costs. Further modest easing steps are expected in coming weeks. 
Stability will trump everything ahead of a once-in-five-years Communist Party congress this year, with policymakers looking to ward off a sharper slowdown that could undermine job creation.
RISKS OF EASING, COVID CURBS
But such easing carries risks, as other global central banks like the U.S. Federal Reserve are preparing to raise interest rates, which could spur potentially destabilising capital outflows from emerging markets like China. 
The International Monetary Fund on Wednesday cut its China 2022 growth forecast to 4.8%, from 5.6% previously, reflecting the property woes and the hit to consumption from strict COVID-19 curbs.
""Industrial activity slowed due to weak domestic demand,"" said Zhang Zhiwei, chief economist at Pinpoint Asset Management. ""The service sector is also affected adversely by the outbreaks in many cities.""
""The weak PMI indicates the policy easing measures from the government have not yet been passed to the real economy... We expect the government will step up policy supports in coming months, particularly through more fiscal spending.""
A sub-index in the official PMI for production stood at 50.9, down from 51.4 in December, while new orders fell to 49.3 from 49.7.
While China's new COVID-19 cases have been low compared with many other countries, a surge of infections since late December in the manufacturing hub of Xian forced many auto and chip makers to shut operations. Production has gradually returned to normal as the city emerged from a lockdown.
Samsung Electronics (OTC:SSNLF) Co Ltd last month temporarily adjusted operations at its Xian manufacturing facilities for NAND flash memory chips, but it said on Wednesday that production has returned to normal. 
Output in Tianjin, which battled an outbreak of the highly transmissible Omicron variant, was also affected.
At the same time, the government is trying to limit industrial air pollution levels ahead of the Beijing Winter Olympics, starting on Friday. China has told steel mills in northern regions to cut production until mid-March.
A survey on China's sprawling services sector also showed growth slowing in January, as virus containment measures hit consumer sentiment. 

China's official composite PMI, which combined manufacturing and services, stood at 50.1 in January compared with 52.2 in December.
China's economy grew 4.0% in the fourth quarter from a year earlier, its weakest expansion in one and a half years.

504,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 29, 2022 09:00PM ET</span>",China's Jan factory activity contracts as COVID lockdowns bite - Caixin PMI,"BEIJING (Reuters) - China's factory activity contracted at the sharpest rate in 23 months in January, underscoring the huge economic costs from the country's zero-COVID approach as surging cases and tough containment measures weighed on output and demand, a private survey showed on Sunday.
The Caixin/Markit Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) fell to 49.1 in January - its lowest level since February 2020, when the economy was still suffering from country-wide COVID-19 lockdowns in the early days of the pandemic. 
Economists in a Reuters poll had expected the index to ease to 50.4 from December's 50.9 but still point to some growth. The 50 mark separates growth from contraction on a monthly basis.
The unexpectedly weak reading is likely to reinforce market expectations that policymakers need to roll out more support measures to stabilise the faltering economy. China's central bank has already started cutting interest rates and pumping more cash into the financial system to bring borrowing costs down, and further modest easing steps are expected in coming weeks.
A sub-index for factory output stood at 48.4, down from 52.7 in December, with firms surveyed reporting reduced intakes of new business and as a recent surge in COVID-19 cases and tough anti-virus measures impacted production, the survey showed.
Demand also took a dive, as new orders fell at the fastest clip since August this year and export orders shrank the most since May 2020. Exports were one of the few bright spots for China's economy in the second half of last year.
That led to renewed pressure on the job market, with a gauge for employment dropping to the lowest in almost two years. 
""From December to January, the resurgence of Covid-19 in several regions including Xian and Beijing forced local governments to tighten epidemic control measures, which restricted production, transportation and sales of manufactured goods,"" said Wang Zhe, senior economist at Caixin Insight Group said.
""It became more evident that China's economy is straining under the triple pressures of contracting demand, supply shocks and weakening expectations.""
A surge of COVID-19 cases since late December in the manufacturing hub of Xian forced many auto and chip makers to shut operations, although production has gradually returned to normal as the city emerged from a lockdown.
Inflationary pressures also edged higher in January, while manufacturers' confidence towards the year ahead picked up as firms remain convinced China would be able to get COVID-19 under control. 
The world's second-largest economy got off to a strong start in 2021, rebounding from 2020's pandemic-induced slump, but it began losing steam in the early summer, weighed down by growing debt problems in the property market and COVID-19 outbreaks that hit consumer spending. 

The International Monetary Fund on Wednesday cut its forecst for China's 2022 growth to 4.8%, from 5.6% previously, reflecting the property downturn and the hit to consumption from strict coronavirus curbs.
The economy grew 4.0% in the fourth quarter from a year earlier, its weakest expansion in one-and-a-half years.

LONDON (Reuters) - British businesses grew at the slowest pace since April 2021 during the past three months, after demand for face-to-face services slumped due to the Omicron variant of coronavirus, the Confederation of British Industry said on Sunday.
Britain's economy only recovered to its pre-pandemic size in November, before being hit by the highly infectious Omicron variant which led to government advice to work from home and restrictions on hospitality in Scotland and Wales. 
""Consumer services have borne the brunt of 'Plan B' restrictions and general Omicron caution, with activity here shrinking sharply,"" CBI economist Alpesh Paleja said.
The CBI's monthly growth index - which is based on quarterly growth rates from its previously published surveys of manufacturers, retailers and other services businesses - fell to +12 in January from +21 in December.
That was the lowest reading since April's, which covered a three-month period when pubs, restaurants and non-essential retailers were largely closed due to a previous COVID wave.
COVID-19 cases in Britain have fallen sharply since a peak in early January, and most economists think output will soon recover.
But there are headwinds for many businesses from sharply rising inflation, which hit its highest in nearly 30 years in December and is forecast to exceed 6% in April when regulated household energy bills rise.
""Consumer-facing firms will also have to contend with a deepening squeeze on household budgets,"" Paleja said.

The Bank of England is expected to raise interest rates on Thursday to 0.5% from 0.25%, the second increase in less than two months.
The CBI survey was based on responses from 477 firms between Dec. 20 and Jan. 17.

The April to November shortfall was C$73.70 billion ($57.75 billion) compared with a C$232.02 billion deficit over the same eight months in 2020/21, the data showed.
""As expected, the government's 2021–22 financial results show a marked improvement compared to the peak of the COVID-19 crisis,"" the finance ministry said. ""That said, they continue to reflect challenging economic conditions.""
April-November revenues grew by 34.3%, led by higher tax revenues and other revenues. Program expenses fell 25.1%, largely on lower emergency transfers to individuals and businesses.

507,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 28, 2022 12:32PM ET</span>","Weaker U.S consumer spending, rising inflation pose dilemma for Fed","By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. consumer spending fell in December, suggesting the economy lost speed heading into the new year amid snarled supply chains and raging COVID-19 infections, while annual inflation increased at a pace last seen nearly 40 years ago.
Wage inflation is also building up amid an acute shortage of workers. Private industry wages rose strongly in the fourth quarter, posting their largest annual gain since the mid-1980s, other data showed on Friday. Mounting inflation pressures could force the Federal Reserve to aggressively hike interest rates, stifling growth, economists warned.
""No one wants to go back to the 80s, but the economy is. Can stagflation from an overly aggressive Fed be next?"" said Christopher Rupkey, chief economist at FWDBONDS in New York. ""The Fed let its guard down and now they risk it all by saying they might have to move faster and higher on interest rates.""
Consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, dropped 0.6% last month after gaining 0.4% in November, the Commerce Department said. The decline was in line with economists' expectations.
The data was included in the advance gross domestic product report for the fourth quarter published on Thursday. The economy grew at a 6.9% annualized rate last quarter, accelerating from the July-September quarter's 2.3% pace. That helped to boost growth in 2021 to 5.7%, the strongest since 1984. The economy contracted 3.4% in 2020.
Consumer spending dropped in December likely as the result of Americans starting their holiday shopping in October for fear of empty shelves at stores because of rampant shortages of goods, including motor vehicles. Spending on goods fell 2.6%, led by automobiles.
Outlays on services gained 0.5%, lifted by healthcare.
Sky-rocketing coronavirus infections driven by the Omicron variant slowed the improvement in supply chains, with workers calling in sick. Worsening shortages kept inflation elevated last month.
The personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index excluding the volatile food and energy components, rose 0.5% after a similar gain in November. The so-called core PCE price index accelerated 4.9% year-on-year in December, the biggest rise since September 1983. The core PCE price index increased 4.7% in the 12 months through November.
Stocks on Wall Street were lower. The dollar was steady against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices rose.
WAGE PRESSURES GROWING
Inflation is running way above the Fed's flexible 2% target. The U.S. central bank on Wednesday said it was likely to raise interest rates in March.
Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) Securities is predicting seven rate hikes this year. JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) on Friday raised its forecast to five rate increases from four.
""The challenge now is to tamp down inflation without allowing the flame on the overall economy to go out,"" said Diane Swonk, chief economist at Grant Thornton in Chicago. ""There is no road map for doing this after inflation has surged.""
Signs that inflation could remain stubbornly high were reinforced by a separate report from the Labor Department on Friday showing the Employment Cost Index, the broadest measure of labor costs, rose 1.0% in the fourth quarter after increasing 1.3% in the July-September period.
Labor costs surged 4.0% on a year-on-year basis, the largest rise since the fourth quarter of 2001, after increasing 3.7% in the third quarter.
The ECI is widely viewed by policymakers as one of the better measures of labor market slack and a predictor of core inflation as it adjusts for composition and job quality changes.
The labor market is viewed as being at or near maximum employment. There were 10.6 million job openings at the end of November.
Wages and salaries rose 1.1% last quarter after increasing 1.5% in the third quarter. They were up 4.5% year-on-year, the largest increase since the second quarter of 1990. Private industry wages rose 1.2% and shot up 5.0% year-on-year, the most since the first quarter of 1984. Benefits for all workers rose 0.9% after a similar gain in the July-September quarter.
But high inflation is cutting into wage gains, eroding consumers' purchasing power. The rising cost of living and pandemic fatigue pushed consumer sentiment back to a 10-year low in January.
The report from the Commerce Department showed consumer spending adjusted for inflation dropped 1.0% in December after slipping 0.2% in November.
The decline in the so-called real consumer spending set consumption on a slower growth trajectory heading into the first quarter, which could pull overall economic growth lower.
Consumer spending rose at a 3.3% rate last quarter. Growth forecasts for the first quarter are so far below a 2% rate, with some economists predicting an outright decline in output.
Still, growth is expected to rebound by the second quarter as the current Omicron wave of infections subsides and supply constraints ease. Consumers are sitting on more than $2 trillion in excess savings accumulated during the pandemic.

It is, however, unclear when and how much of these savings will be spent. Economists also note that the bulk of the savings are by higher income households, who tend to be savers and some of the money could go towards retirement.
""To our minds, despite the strength of price and wage inflation, it is disappointingly weak real economic growth that will prevent the Fed from delivering a full-blown Ratemaggedon this year,"" said Paul Ashworth, chief U.S. economist at Capital Economics in Toronto.

The European Commission's monthly economic sentiment index fell to 112.7 points in January from a revised 113.8 in December. Economists polled by Reuters had expected a reading of 114.5 points.

The decline of the overall index was mainly a result of less optimism in industry, where the index eased to 13.9 from 14.6 and in services, where it fell to 9.1 from 10.9.

MADRID (Reuters) - Spain's economy expanded at its fastest pace in two decades last year but slowed down in the fourth quarter as public and private spending slipped amid soaring inflation.
Gross domestic product grew 5% from a historic 10.8% slump the previous year, preliminary data from the National Statistics Institute (INE) showed on Friday.
That marked the fastest growth since 2000 but missed the government's 6.5% target.
In September, the INE made an unprecedentedly sharp cut to its first and second quarter growth readings that threw out all forecasts and triggered a wave of downward revisions, but the government stuck to its bullish forecast.
While Spain has so far lagged behind neighbouring France, which posted 7% annual growth after a milder contraction in 2020, it fared better in the fourth quarter, likely due to its light touch approach to the spread of Omicron.
Despite lower spending, an 8.5% jump in investment drove 2% quarter-on-quarter growth in the October-December period, slowing from the 2.6% during the previous three months but comfortably beating a 1.4% forecast from analysts polled by Reuters.
France's economy grew by just 1.7% over the same period.
Agriculture was Spain's fastest expanding sector over the quarter, growing by some 9% as the economically vital autumn grape and olive harvests got underway.
In annual terms, the economy grew 5.2% from the fourth-quarter of 2020, led by a 19.4% leap in the hospitality sector, which has benefited from the widespread rollout of coronavirus vaccines and the lifting of restrictions on socialising.
Social Security Minister Jose Luis Escriva said a delayed recovery in tourism, which accounted for some 12% of GDP before the pandemic, was still holding back growth but he pointed to solid jobs data as a reason for optimism.

Unemployment is at its lowest level since before the financial crisis while job creation was at its fastest since 2005 last year, helping drive record tax collection.
Bolstered by the arrival of more European Union recovery funds and an expansive budget, the government expects 7% growth this year, although the central bank forecasts a more modest 5.4% expansion.

PARIS (Reuters) -France posted its strongest growth in over five decades last year, hitting 7% as the euro zone's second-biggest economy bounced back from the COVID-19 crisis faster than expected, data showed on Friday.
Despite a resurgence of COVID-19 underway, the strongest boom in a generation bolsters President Emmanuel Macron's economic credentials less than three months from an April election in which he is widely expected to run for a second term.
The economy grew 0.7% in the final three months of the year after a particular strong third quarter when it grew 3.1%, the INSEE statistics agency said in a preliminary report.
Economists polled by Reuters had on average forecast fourth quarter growth of 0.5%.
The better-than-expected end to the year meant the economy grew 7% in 2021 as a whole, the strongest since 1969, after an 8% contraction in 2020 when strict coronavirus lockdowns were in force.
""The French economy has rebounded spectacularly and that's erased the economic crisis,"" Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said on France 2 television.
""There are still some sectors that are still having trouble, like tourism and hotels, but most are recovering very strongly and that's creating jobs.""
Businesses and consumers are once again having to contend with tighter health restrictions as France faces its fifth wave of COVID-19, which has pushed new infection levels to record levels.
While the economy is starting 2022 on a softer footing, the central bank has said the economic impact of the current wave should be minimal as the economy has largely adapted to living with a pandemic.
""All told, the economic stage is set for April’s presidential election. Emmanuel Macron will clearly be pleased with the 2021 GDP numbers,"" Capital Economics senior Europe economist Jessica Hinds said.
""But whether Macron can convince the French electorate to give him another five years is still not a done deal,"" she added.
Macron currently has a comfortable lead over the closest contenders from the conservatives and far right who are trying to push identity politics and security to the fore in the election where Macron is much less at ease. 
INSEE said that the economy had recovered to pre-crisis levels of activity in the third quarter as a vaccination campaign gained momentum and the government eased COVID-19 restrictions.
In the fourth quarter, growth was driven by consumer spending rising 0.4% even though it slowed from an exceptionally strong 5.6% jump the previous quarter as the economy re-opened after a lockdown.

Business investment rose 0.8% in the fourth quarter after gaining only 0.1% in the previous three months.
Growth was also boosted by companies replenishing depleted inventories, with stock-building adding 0.4 percentage points in the fourth quarter after representing a 0.7% drag in the third quarter.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. economy notched its strongest growth in nearly four decades in 2021 after the government pumped trillions of dollars in COVID-19 relief, and is seen forging ahead despite headwinds from the pandemic, strained supply chains as well as inflation.
A surge in gross domestic product in the fourth quarter as businesses replenished depleted inventories to meet strong demand for goods was the final push. Last year's robust growth reported by the Commerce Department on Thursday supports the Federal Reserve's pivot towards raising interest rates in March.
Fed Chair Jerome Powell told reporters on Wednesday after a two-day policy meeting that ""the economy no longer needs sustained high levels of monetary policy support,"" and that ""it will soon be appropriate to raise"" rates.
""While Omicron will lead to weaker growth in the first quarter, activity is expected to rebound nicely once the latest pandemic wave abates and supply-chain glitches ease,"" said Sal Guatieri, a senior economist at BMO Capital Markets in Toronto.
""The Fed will need to be 'humble and nimble' as it navigates underlying economic strength, worsening labor shortages, and stubbornly high inflation.""
The economy grew 5.7% in 2021, the strongest since 1984, as the government provided nearly $6 trillion in pandemic relief. It contracted 3.4% in 2020, the biggest drop in 74 years. 
President Joe Biden quickly took credit for the stunning performance, which he said was ""no accident."" 
Biden's popularity is falling amid a stalled domestic economic agenda after Congress failed to pass his signature $1.75 trillion Build Back Better legislation. 
""We are finally building an American economy for the 21st Century, and I urge Congress to continue this momentum by passing legislation to make America more competitive, bolster our supply chains, strengthen our manufacturing and innovation, invest in our families and clean energy, and lower kitchen table costs,"" Biden said in a statement.
Gross domestic product increased at a 6.9% annualized rate in the fourth quarter, the government said in its advance GDP estimate. That followed a 2.3% growth pace in the third quarter. 
Growth is 3.1% above its pre-pandemic level.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast GDP growth rising at a 5.5% rate. 
The momentum, however, faded by December amid an onslaught of COVID-19 infections, fueled by the Omicron variant, which contributed to undercutting spending as well as disrupting activity at factories and services businesses. But there are, signs that infections have peaked, which could lead to increased demand for services by spring. 
Inventory investment increased at a $173.5 billion rate, contributing 4.90 percentage points to GDP growth, the most since the third quarter of 2020. Businesses had been drawing down inventories since the first quarter of 2021. 
Spending shifted during the pandemic to goods from services, a demand boom that pressured supply chains. Excluding inventories, GDP grew at a moderate 1.9% rate.
Stocks on Wall Street were trading higher. The dollar gained versus a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury yields fell.
BALANCING ACT
Some economists viewed the modest growth in the so-called final sales as a sign that the economy was set to slow down significantly, especially if not all the inventory accumulation was planned. They also worried that rate hikes as well as reduced government aid, especially the loss of the childcare tax credit, could hurt demand. 
So far inventory-to-sales ratios remain low by historical standards. 
""Fed policymakers will have to be extremely careful at threading the needle when they raise interest rates as every other Federal Reserve in history has raised interest rates too high and brought the economy crashing back down,"" said Christopher Rupkey, chief economist at FWDBONDS in New York.  
Growth last quarter was also lifted by a jump in consumer spending in October before retreating considerably as Omicron raged. Consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of economic activity, grew at a 3.3% rate after rising at a 2.0% pace in the third quarter.
A decrease in purchases of motor vehicles, which are scarce because of a global chip shortage, was offset by increases in spending on healthcare as well as at membership clubs, sports centers, parks, theaters and museums.
Inflation increased at a 6.9% rate, the fastest since the second quarter of 1981, way above the Fed's 2% target. That resulted in income at the disposal of households dropping at a 5.8% rate, which also limited consumer spending. 
Still, households remained cushioned by huge savings, which were at $1.34 trillion. Wages surged at an 8.9% rate before adjustment for inflation, reflecting a labor market that is experiencing an acute shortage of workers, with 10.6 million job openings at the end of November. 
Though the labor market took a step back in early January as Omicron surged, it is at or near maximum employment. A separate report from the Labor Department on Thursday showed initial claims for jobless benefits dropped 30,000 to a seasonally adjusted 260,000 during the week ended Jan. 22. 
There were sharp declines in claims in Illinois, Kentucky, Texas, New Jersey, New York as well as Pennsylvania. 
Support to GDP growth last quarter also came from a rebound in business spending on equipment. But government spending fell at both the federal and state and local levels. 
Trade made no contribution after being a drag on GDP growth for five straight quarters, while investment in homebuilding contracted for a third consecutive quarter. The sector is being constrained by expensive building materials, which has resulted in a record backlog of homes yet to be built. 

Despite the economy's struggles at the start of the year, most economists believe the run of good fortunes will prevail. Growth estimates for this year top 4%.
""This year may well be an even better year for the economy,"" said Scott Hoyt, a senior economist at Moody's (NYSE:MCO) Analytics in West Chester, Pennsylvania. ""Growth will slow and monthly job gains will lag last year's lofty rates. Nonetheless, the economy should be near full employment and inflation near the Fed's target by year's end.""

The rate fell to 13.33% from 14.57% in the previous quarter, a decline that Economy Minister Nadia Calvino called ""spectacular"" and comfortably below the 14.20% forecast by economists polled by Reuters.
The highly seasonal National Statistics Institute (INE) reading was the lowest since the third quarter of 2008, when it stood at 11.23%, and the lowest for a fourth quarter since 2007's 8.57%.
Private-sector hiring accounted for all of the 153,900 jobs added over the period, with agriculture leading the gains as farms took on extra workers to help with the autumn olive and grape harvests.
But it was the tourism-reliant Canary Islands that added the most jobs among Spain's regions, reporting a 7% jump as the Atlantic archipelago attracted crowds of winter sunseekers from northern Europe.
Foreign tourism to Spain accelerated in the last quarter of 2021 but remains roughly 40% below pre-pandemic levels.
Over 2021, Spain added more than 840,000 new jobs - the biggest jump since 2005 - largely due to increased hiring in the services industries.
Since peaking at 16.26% in the third quarter of 2020, when Spain was reeling from the impact of COVID-19's devastating first wave, unemployment has dropped for five straight quarters.
The arrival of the highly infectious but less virulent Omicron variant pushed up cases to record highs in December, leading to a spike in sick-leave absences.

But a light-touch response from the government, which declined to reintroduce curbs on movement and business activity, meant that any structural impact on employment was limited.
Thursday's INE reading did not include the roughly 100,000 workers still enrolled in the government furlough scheme at the end of last year.

TAIPEI (Reuters) -Taiwan's economy grew last year at its fastest pace in more than a decade, driven by strong tech exports during the COVID-19 pandemic to support people working and studying from home, as well as demand for chips and recovering consumer confidence.
For 2021, initial gross domestic product (GDP) growth was put at 6.28%, compared with 3.11% the previous year, preliminary data from the statistics agency showed on Thursday. 
That was the fastest pace since an expansion of 10.25% in 2010.
GDP grew a preliminary 4.88% in the fourth quarter of 2021 from a year earlier after a rise of 3.7% in the period from July to September. That was well above the increase of 3.8% forecast in a Reuters poll.
However, it lagged growth of 7.43% in the second quarter and 8.92% in the first quarter.
As a key hub in the global technology supply chain for giants such as Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), Taiwan's economy has outperformed many regional peers during the pandemic as it benefited from robust demand for tech exports as more people turned to working and studying from home.
A global shortage of semiconductors has also filled Taiwan chip makers' order books, and driven them to expand production at home.
Taiwan's exports rose 29.4% in 2021 to a record high, and the economy continues to benefit from strong global demand for its high-tech goods and chips.
Total fourth-quarter exports soared 26.01% on the year in U.S. dollar terms, the agency said.
Statistics official Wu Pei-hsuan said domestic consumption had recovered in the fourth quarter after being affected by government controls to curb a short-lived domestic COVID-19 outbreak that began in May.
However Capital Economics said exports were unlikely to grow at such a rapid pace this year.
""With high inflation and fading fiscal support dragging on retail spending in many key exports markets, we expect exports to level off this year,"" it said in a note.
Another risk is a slowdown in the economy of China, Taiwan's top trading partner. 

China's economy grew 8.1% in 2021 and 4.0% in the final quarter, faster than expected but still its weakest pace since the second quarter of 2020, off the back of weak consumption and a property downturn.
Taiwan will release on Feb. 24 its revised GDP figures, including growth estimates for the full year.

BEIJING (Reuters) -China's industrial firms saw December profits grow at their slowest pace in more than a year and a half, pointing to cooling demand amid mounting economic challenges for the world's second-largest economy.
The downbeat data adds to expectations of strong supportive measures from the People's Bank of China in the coming months to stabilise a faltering economy. COVID-19 outbreaks have hit consumer spending, a property market downturn is deepening and exports look set to slow. 
Hobbled by an easing in factory-gate inflation, industrial profits rose 4.2% year-on-year, the slowest rate since April 2020, according to the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS). That compares with a 9% increase in November and a 24.6% gain in October.
Figures for the whole of last year, however, showed a stellar rebound, with industrial profits surging 34.3% to 8.7 trillion yuan ($1.37 trillion) after just 4.1% growth in 2020 when COVID-19 shutdowns pummelled the economy. It was the biggest jump since 2011 when the NBS began to disclose data more regularly.
The December figures point to a weak year this year and industrial profits could even decline in some months due to a high base of comparison in 2021, said Wang Jun, an economist at Zhongyuan Bank.
He also noted that a huge number of struggling small firms were not captured by official data, which only looks at companies with annual revenue of over 20 million yuan from their main operations. 
""Constraining factors are building for China's central bank. With the U.S. Federal Reserve set to raise interest rates in March, time is running out for the PBOC to further ease policy,"" said Wang. 
The PBOC, which has flagged more measures are in store, has sprung into action over the past few weeks, unexpectedly cutting the borrowing costs of its medium-term loans for the first time since April 2020 and lowering benchmark lending rates.
Zhu Hong, a senior NBS statistician, noted the steep slowdown in industrial profit growth over November and December and said operational pressures facing manufacturers and a high number of loss-making companies were cause for concern. 
""In the next step, we will...implement tax and fee cuts as well as measures to ensure supply and stabilise prices, in addition to vigorously helping firms to tackle difficulties,"" he said.

China's economy grew 4.0% in the fourth quarter from a year earlier, marking its weakest expansion in one-and-a-half years. The economy is set to expand by 5.5% this year, an adviser to the government's cabinet said last week.

521,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 26, 2022 11:51AM ET</span>",U.S. goods trade deficit hits record high; retail inventories surge,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. trade deficit in goods widened to a record high in December as imports increased for a fifth straight month amid strong domestic demand, suggesting that trade likely remained a drag on economic growth in the fourth quarter.
But imports are helping to replenish depleted inventories, with the report from the Commerce Department on Wednesday showing strong restocking at retailers and wholesalers last month. Solid inventory accumulation likely offset the impact on gross domestic product from the larger trade gap, prompting some economists to raise their growth estimates for the last quarter.
""Strong demand and shifting consumer preferences during the pandemic led to a surge in imports that continues to outstrip exports and is contributing to all-time highs in the deficit,"" said Rubeela Farooqi, chief U.S. economist at High Frequency Economics in White Plains, New York.
The goods trade deficit rose 3.0% to an all-time high of $101.0 billion last month. It was also the first time that the deficit breached the $100 billion threshold. The rebuilding for inventories could keep the goods trade deficit wide at least through the first half of this year.
Goods imports increased 2.0% to $258.3 billion, likely as the backlog at ports continued to be cleared. The increase in imports was driven by capital goods, motor vehicles and consumer goods. But imports of food and industrial supplies declined.
Goods exports rose 1.4% to $157.3 billion. There were increases in exports of consumer goods, industrial supplies and motor vehicles. Capital goods exports also rose, but food exports tumbled. 
The report was published ahead of Thursday's advance fourth-quarter GDP data. Trade has subtracted from GDP growth for five straight quarters. According to a Reuters survey of economists, the economy likely grew at a 5.5% annualized rate last quarter, an acceleration from the third quarter's 2.3% pace. 
Inventory investment likely accounted for much of the anticipated acceleration in GDP growth last quarter. Growth last year is expected to have been the strongest since 1984.
The Commerce Department report showed retail inventories shot up 4.4% in December after increasing 2.0% in November. Inventories of motor vehicles and parts jumped 6.8% after rising 4.3% in November. They had been hampered by a global semi-conductor shortage, which has undercut motor vehicle production.
Retail inventories excluding motor vehicles accelerated 3.6% after rising 1.2% in November. This component goes into the calculation of GDP growth. 
GROWTH ESTIMATES RAISED
Economists at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) raised their fourth-quarter GDP growth estimate to a 7.5% rate from a 7.0% pace. IHS Markit lifted its forecast 1.3 percentage points to a 7.4% rate. 
The data published on Wednesday is unadjusted for inflation, which presents a bit of uncertainty about the inventory investment estimate in Thursday's snapshot of fourth-quarter GDP.
""But the data in hand signal that the real inventory buildup in the fourth quarter was substantial,"" said Daniel Silver, an economist at JPMorgan in New York. ""While inventories should be very supportive for GDP growth in the fourth quarter, we think this buildup presents a downside risk to our first quarter real GDP forecast of a 1.5% rate.""
Inventories at wholesalers increased 2.1% last month after advancing 1.7% in November. There were increases in stocks of both durable and nondurable goods.
Inventory accumulation had been constrained by COVID-19-related global shortages, and the solid increases over the last two months offer hope that the worst of the supply chain disruptions was behind.
""It will likely take time for the supply-chain issues to ease, which could keep U.S. goods inflation elevated,"" said Ryan Sweet, a senior economist at Moody's (NYSE:MCO) Analytics in West Chester, Pennsylvania. 
There was also some encouraging news on the housing market, with another report from the Commerce Department showing new home sales soaring 11.9% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 811,000 units in December, the highest level since March.

The outlook for the housing market is, however, uncertain amid expensive building materials, labor shortages and rising mortgage rates.
""Demand should remain strong, but supply is expected to increase only gradually and the runup in prices prior to December along with the more recent rise in mortgage rates will sideline many prospective buyers,"" said Nancy Vanden Houten, a U.S. economist at Oxford Economics in New York.

Power and LMC Automotive said.
Retail sales of new vehicles could fall 8.3% to 828,900 units from a year earlier, according to a report released by the consultants on Wednesday.
""The volume of new vehicles being delivered to dealerships in January has been insufficient to meet strong consumer demand, resulting in a significantly diminished sales pace,"" said Thomas King, president of the data and analytics division at J.D. Powers. 
The COVID-19 pandemic has caused bottlenecks in supply chains, driving up costs for everything from labor to raw materials.
The average new-vehicle retail transaction price in January is expected to reach $44,905, the previous high was in December 2021 at $45,283. 
U.S. business activity grew at its slowest pace in 18 months in January as a winter surge in COVID-19 infections worsened worker shortages at factories, though demand remained strong.
Total new-vehicle sales for January 2022, including retail and non-retail transactions, are projected to reach 932,099 units, a 15.6% decrease from last year.
The seasonally adjusted annualized rate for total new-vehicle sales is expected to be 14.1 million units, down 2.6 million units from 2021.
Separately, research firm Cox Automotive said on Wednesday new-vehicle sales in January were expected to reach 1.01 million units, a drop of 8.9% compared to January 2021. 

Cox Automotive expects seasonally adjusted annual rate to finish near 15.3 million, up from 12.4 million in December, the slowest pace since May 2020. 
Despite the added risk, J.D. Power and LMC Automotive expect 2022 global light vehicle sales to improve by 6% to 86.2 million units.

New home sales increased 11.9% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 811,000 units last month, the highest level since March, the Commerce Department said on Wednesday. November's sales pace was revised down to 725,000 units from the previously reported 744,000 units.
Sales soared in the densely populated South as well as in the Midwest. They also rose in the West, but tumbled in the Northeast.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast new home sales, which account for more than 10% of U.S. home sales, rising to a rate of 760,000 units. New home sales are a leading indicator of the housing market, but can be volatile on a monthly basis.
Sales dropped 14.0% on a year-on-year basis in December. They peaked at a rate of 993,000 units in January, which was the highest since the end of 2006. About 762,000 new homes were sold in 2021, down 7.3% from 2020.
The new housing market is being underpinned by a record-low inventory of previously owned homes. Demand for housing is expected to remain strong even as mortgage rates increase, which together with high prices will further erode affordability. 
The median new house price in December rose 3.4% from a year ago to $377,700. There were 403,000 new homes on the market, up from 397,000 units in November.
Houses under construction made up 65.3% of the inventory, with homes yet to be built accounting for about 25%.

The government last week reported the housing construction backlog surged to a record high in December while completions tumbled as well. Builders are being hamstrung by sky-high prices for building materials, a situation that could worsen after the government nearly doubled duties on imported Canadian softwood lumber last November.
At December's sales pace it would take 6.0 months to clear the supply of houses on the market, down from 6.6 months in November.

Year-ahead inflation expectations in the monthly Citi/YouGov survey, published on Wednesday, surged to 4.8% in January from 4.0% in December, the highest since this series began in 2006 and almost double their long-run average.
The official rate of consumer price inflation hit 5.4% in December, its highest since March 1992, and the BoE is widely expected to raise rates on Feb. 3, which would be its second rate rise in less than two months.
Longer-term public inflation expectations for the next five to 10 years - which some economists think give a better guide on whether price pressures are becoming entrenched - held at 3.8%, their joint-highest level since 2013.
""Today's data, especially the level of long-term expectations, suggest elevated risk inflation expectations could become de-anchored to the upside as inflation accelerates in the months ahead,"" Citi economist Benjamin Nabarro said.
""However, for now, we think expectations remain anchored overall.""

BoE official Catherine Mann said last week that the central bank needed to lean against inflation pressures, to stop expectations of higher inflation among businesses and workers from becoming self-fulfilling.
The sharp rise in the cost of living is also becoming a major political challenge for Prime Minister Boris Johnson's government, with a sharp rise in regulated energy prices and higher taxes on workers due to take effect in April.

Commitments for investments in fixed assets such as facilities, machinery and other equipment shrank to S$11.8 billion ($8.78 billion) in 2021, but remained above a medium-to- long-term goal of S$8 billion to S$10 billion, according to the Economic Development Board (EDB).
""2021 was an unusual year, (there were) many disruptions as a result of COVID...the numbers in 2020 were actually quite exceptional. And we did not expect to repeat that in 2021,"" Beh Swan Gin, chairman of the EDB, said.
Commitments on total business expenditure, which includes wages and rental, fell about 24% to S$5.2 billion.
Most of the 2021 commitments came from the bio- and medical technology fields, and EDB is ""very optimistic"" about further growth this year, Jacqueline Poh, managing director EDB, said.
Biotechnology and pharmaceutical firms like BioNTech and  Sanofi  (NASDAQ:SNY) have announced plans to invest in production sites in Singapore. 
Commitments in 2021 are projected to directly contribute S$ 16.8 billion annually to the economy with biomedical manufacturing and electronics, which includes semiconductor and Biotech firms, forming more than a half.
While 2021 was a challenging year due to COVID-19 travel curbs, Singapore saw some large investments by semiconductor companies to meet demand from a global chip shortage.
Semiconductors will still be a strong contributor to investment commitments in the next few years, Poh said.
Singapore's economy grew 7.2% in 2021, its fastest pace in over a decade, rebounding from a record 5.4% contraction in 2020. 

Labour shortages, partly caused by COVID-19 travel curbs, as well as rising energy costs and geopolitics, were some of the risk factors going forward, Beh said.

Gross domestic product (GDP) likely grew 3.8% in October-December versus a year earlier, the poll of 25 economists shows, after it rose 3.7% year-on-year in the third quarter.
But that would still lag the 7.43% growth in the second quarter and 8.92% in the first quarter.
Policymakers have said they expect full-year 2021 growth to slightly exceed 6%, which would be the fastest pace in over a decade, since a 10.25% expansion in 2010.
Economists' forecasts for preliminary GDP data due on Thursday varied widely from growth of 2.7% to as high as 4.9%.
As a key hub in the global technology supply chain for giants such as Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), Taiwan's economy has outperformed many of its regional peers during the COVID-19 pandemic as it benefited from robust demand for its tech exports during the work-and-study-from-home trend.
But domestic consumption was hit by a rare rise in community COVID-19 transmissions starting mid-May and imposition of strict restrictions on gatherings and other curbs. 
While that outbreak has now ended, the government is on alert for a smattering of local Omicron variant infections that began earlier in January, though curbs on people's activities have been limited so far.
Fitch Solutions last week noted retail sales growth between September and November, pointing to a recovery in consumer spending.
""However, the emergence of highly infectious variants, such as Omicron, and the implementation of strict COVID-19 measures are a downside risk to our outlook,"" it said.
Firms like Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd (TSMC) have also seen demand soar due to a global shortage of chips that has shuttered some auto production lines and affected consumer electronics.

The services producer price index rose 1.1% in December from a year earlier, marking the 10th straight month of increases, Bank of Japan data showed on Wednesday. The level of the index, at 106.0, was the highest since July 2001.
The increase was driven by rising transportation costs with ocean freight fees spiking 38.6% in December from a year ago, the data showed, underscoring the impact global supply chain disruptions are having on Japan's service costs.
In a sign the economy's re-opening from COVID-19 curbs propped up demand, advertisement fees were up 6.4% in December.
Japan has not been immune to global commodity inflation with wholesale prices spiking 8.5% in December from a year earlier, marking the second fastest pace on record.
But core consumer inflation stood at just 0.5% in December, well below the BOJ's 2% target, as weak consumption discourages firms from passing on higher costs to households.
Policymakers say stronger wage growth would be crucial for inflation to sustainably accelerate toward the BOJ's target.

Higher wages would put further upward pressure on services prices, though many analysts doubt companies will increase pay aggressively when rising raw material costs and a resurgence in COVID-19 cases cloud the outlook.
A record wave of COVID-19 cases caused by the Omicron variant has forced Japan to expand regions subject to tighter curbs, threatening the country's fragile economic recovery.

Firms signed up for $11.8 billion in new loans, leases and lines of credit last month, compared with $12.1 billion a year earlier. Borrowings, however, rose 49% from November.
""The outlook for the industry, and indeed overall economy, is somewhat cloudy, with unabated inflation, the Fed poised to increase interest rates, equities markets in a recent tailspin,"" ELFA Chief Executive Officer Ralph Petta said in a statement, adding that the Omicron coronavirus variant remains a concern in the United States.
ELFA, which reports economic activity for the nearly $1-trillion equipment finance sector, said credit approvals totaled 78.6%, down from 77.2% in November.
The Washington-based body's leasing and finance index measures the volume of commercial equipment financed in the United States.

The index is based on a survey of 25 members, including Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC), CIT Group (NYSE:CIT) Inc and financing affiliates or units of  Caterpillar  Inc (NYSE:CAT), Dell Technologies (NYSE:DELL) Inc, Siemens AG (OTC:SIEGY), Canon Inc and Volvo AB (OTC:VLVLY).
The Equipment Leasing & Finance Foundation, ELFA's non-profit affiliate, said its confidence index for January was at 63.9%, unchanged from December. A reading above 50 indicates a positive business outlook.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. consumer confidence ebbed slightly in January, with more consumers planning to purchase homes, automobiles and other big- ticket items even as they grew less optimistic about business and labor market conditions in the short term. 
The survey from the Conference Board on Tuesday also showed consumers' inflation expectations moderating for a second straight month, though still high. Labor market views softened a bit, likely reflecting the disruptions on businesses caused by the winter wave of COVID-19, fueled by the Omicron variant. 
""While consumer confidence dipped this month, consumers generally have faith in the strength of this recovery,"" said Robert Frick, corporate economist with Navy Federal Credit Union in Vienna, Virginia.
The Conference Board said its consumer confidence index slipped to a reading of 113.8 this month from 115.2 in December. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the index falling to 111.8. Despite the first decline in four months, the index is well above pandemic lows.
The survey places more emphasis on the labor market, which is tightening amid worker shortages. The cutoff date for the survey was Jan. 19. The University of Michigan's consumer sentiment index fell moderately in mid-January. 
The Conference Board survey's measure of current conditions rose, a sign that the economy entered 2022 on strong footing. Its gauge of expectations for growth in the short term eased in line with views that Omicron will slow economic growth this quarter.

The United States is reporting an average of 696,541 new coronavirus infections a day, according to a Reuters analysis of official data. Infections, however, appear to be subsiding in some regions, including the hardest-hit New York.
Against the backdrop of a stock market rout, some economists viewed the decline in short-term expectations as a warning sign.
Wall Street has come under intense selling pressure as investors fear aggressive interest rates increases by the Federal Reserve to tame inflation, as well as a possible Russian invasion of Ukraine. 
U.S. stocks were lower, with the S&P 500 index flirting with a correction for the second time this year. The dollar gained versus a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices fell.
""We don't remember consumer confidence remaining high for long historically when Wall Street is in a tailspin, said Christopher Rupkey, chief economist at FWDBONDS in New York. ""Consumers already think business conditions will not be as positive six months from now before the stock market tumbled.""
INFLATION EXPECTATIONS EASE 
The Conference Board's so-called labor market differential, derived from data on respondents' views on whether jobs are plentiful or hard to get, fell to a still-high reading of 43.8 this month from 44.2 in December. 
This measure correlates to the unemployment rate from the Labor Department. There were 10.6 million jobs openings at the end of November. The unemployment rate is at a 22-month low of 3.9%.
Consumers' inflation expectations over the next 12 months slipped to 6.8% from 6.9% last month. The retreat in inflation expectations from a 13-year high of 7.3% last November is likely to be welcomed by Fed officials who started a two-day policy meeting on Tuesday. The U.S. central bank is expected to start raising rates in March. 
Despite high inflation, more consumer expected to buy homes, cars and other big-ticket items over the next six months. 
The share of consumers planning to buy a motor vehicle was the largest in six months. Buying intentions for household appliances like television sets and refrigerators also rose, but plans to purchase washing machines and clothes dryers fell.
Consumers were more keen to buy a house over the next six months, with the share the largest in the current series. There was a break in the series in November 2010. 
With housing supply continuing to lag demand, that suggests home prices will likely remain elevated this year. A second report on Tuesday showed the S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller's 20 metropolitan area home price index rose 18.3% on a year-on-year basis in November after accelerating 18.5% in October.
(Graphic: Case Shiller, https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-STOCKS/lgvdwjrjkpo/caseshiller.png) 
More than half of the 20 markets, including Florida as well as other metropolitan areas in the Southeast and Southwest regions reported strong price growth in November.
""Additionally, higher-tier price ranges have remained relatively more resistant to economic forces, mortgage rates and COVID-19-related demand changes and continue to be magnet markets for many buyers,"" said Selma Hepp, deputy chief economist at CoreLogic. ""Given that these areas have also had the relatively largest gains in in-migration, pressure on prices has persisted and will likely remain over the coming year.""
A survey from real estate brokerage  Redfin  (NASDAQ:RDFN).com showed 31.2% of the platform's users looked to move to a different metropolitan area in the fourth quarter. The popular destinations were Miami, Phoenix, Las Vegas, Sacramento and Tampa, viewed as affordable areas.

Strong house price inflation was mirrored by a fourth report from the Federal Housing Finance Agency showing house prices increased 17.5% in the 12 months through November after rising 17.4% in October. 
There was big annual price growth in the Mountain, West South Central, East South Central and South Atlantic states.

532,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 25, 2022 07:46AM ET</span>",UK manufacturers plan biggest price rises since 1977 - CBI,"By David Milliken
LONDON (Reuters) -British manufacturers expect to raise prices by the most since 1977 over the next three months, as they wrestle with serious labour shortages and the biggest increase in costs since 1980, a quarterly survey showed on Tuesday.
The Confederation of British Industry (CBI) data look set to reinforce the Bank of England's fears that high inflation is getting baked into businesses' pricing plans, bolstering the chances it will hike interest rates again next week.
The CBI survey showed a rise in factory orders, greater investment and the strongest export demand growth since July 2018, but overall optimism fell as businesses struggled with sharply rising costs for raw materials and some workers.
""Global supply chain challenges are continuing to impact UK firms, with our survey showing intense and escalating cost and price pressures,"" CBI chief economist Rain Newton-Smith said.
British consumer price inflation hit its highest in almost 30 years in December at 5.4%, though there had been some signs in other surveys that the pace of cost growth for businesses was beginning to slow.
Previously released data showed annual producer price inflation slowed in December for the first time since May 2020 and input costs fell on the month for the first time since August 2020. January's IHS Markit Purchasing Managers' Index showed the smallest factory input costs rise since April 2021.
BACK TO THE 1970S?
However, Tuesday's CBI survey showed that the proportion of manufacturers expecting domestic prices to rise over the next three months was its highest since April 1977. The export prices expectations balance was the highest since January 1980.
Costs for manufacturers in the three months to January rose by the most since April 1980, and the percentage of firms reporting limited capacity due to a lack of skilled workers was the highest since October 1973 at 42%.
Central bankers have generally rejected comparisons with the wage-price spirals that plagued most Western economies in the 1970s, but last week one BoE official said it was possible there was a shift away from the more benign patterns of the 2010s.
Manufacturers' optimism about the current business situation and prospects for the year ahead both fell to their lowest since January 2021, when the economy was still in lockdown.

However, new orders picked up over the past three months and January's monthly gauge of new orders held unchanged at +24, just below November's record reading of +26. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast a drop to +22.
Investment plans also strengthened, with plant and machinery investment intentions at their highest since April 1988 - possibly reflecting temporary tax incentives for this type of investment as well as strong underlying demand.

The seasonally adjusted growth reported by national statistics agency INEGI was marginally higher than the figure of 0.2% forecast in a Reuters poll of analysts, and compared to a month-on-month contraction of 0.2% in October.
Meanwhile, preliminary data for December showed the economy had slipped by 0.2% https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/mexico-economy-slips-december-hinting-weak-close-2021-2022-01-18 compared to the same month a year earlier.

Mexican gross domestic product (GDP) contracted in the third quarter of 2021. Two consecutive quarters of negative growth would mean the country had entered a technical recession.

BERLIN (Reuters) -German business morale improved in January for the first time in seven months as easing supply bottlenecks brightened the outlook for manufacturers in Europe's largest economy, promising a strong recovery from the coronavirus pandemic in spring.
The Ifo institute said on Tuesday its business climate index rose to 95.7 from an upwardly revised 94.8 in December. A Reuters poll of analysts had pointed to a January reading of 94.7.
""The German economy is starting the new year with a glimmer of hope,"" Ifo President Clemens Fuest said.
Company executives were considerably more upbeat about their business outlook while their assessment of the current situation was a bit less optimistic, Fuest added.
In manufacturing, supply bottlenecks in intermediate products and raw materials eased a little which helped to lift both assessments of the current business situation and business expectations for the next six months, Ifo said.
Business morale also improved in the services sector with the tourism industry looking forward to a promising summer holiday season, the survey showed.
Still, service providers were less satisfied with their current situation due to COVID-19 restrictions for unvaccinated citizens who still account for roughly a quarter of the German population.
INFLATION
Ifo economist Klaus Wohlrabe told Reuters the improvement in business sentiment was encouraging, but it was still too early to talk about an economic turnaround.
Wohlrabe also warned that inflation was unlikely to ease in coming months as every second company across industry, trade and retail suggested in the survey it was planning further price increases.
The Ifo figures chimed with Markit's purchasing manager index https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/easing-supply-shortages-sustains-german-manufacturing-recovery-pmi-2022-01-24 (PMI) from Monday that also showed a relaxation in supply chains which helped push up activity in the manufacturing sector to a five-month high in January.
""The German economy seems to be coming out of the winter slump,"" VP Bank analyst Thomas Gitzel said.
Gitzel cautioned, however, an escalation in the conflict with Russia over Ukraine could weigh on German business morale.
The DIHK Chamber of Industry and Commerce https://www.reuters.com/markets/europe/german-firms-fear-supply-chain-pain-chinas-battle-with-omicron-2022-01-25 also pointed to the risk that the Omicron coronavirus variant could trigger more strict lockdown measures in China and result in more supply bottlenecks.

Most analysts expect the economy to stagnate or even shrink in the first three months of the year, following a drop of up to 1.0% in the final three months of 2021, according to a preliminary estimate of the federal statistics office.
The German cabinet is expected to approve its annual economic report https://www.reuters.com/article/germany-economy-gdp-idUSKBN2JV1IY on Wednesday in which Berlin will cut its GDP growth forecast for this year to 3.6% from its October estimate of 4.1%, according to a draft seen by Reuters on Friday.

535,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 25, 2022 04:11AM ET</span>",Surging UK inflation erodes room for budget manoeuvres,"By Andy Bruce and William Schomberg
LONDON (Reuters) -Britain's government looks firmly on track to borrow less this tax year than forecast but surging inflation will soon curb any leeway for finance minister Rishi Sunak who is under pressure to ease a cost-of-living squeeze.
Borrowing for the 2021/22 financial year so far - April to December - is so far running almost 13 billion pounds below the forecasts used by Sunak in his budget planning at 146.8 billion pounds, official date showed.
While on the face of it that presents Sunak with room for manoeuvre ahead of his March 23 budget update, the figures also showed rising costs from a surge in inflation.
Debt interest payments hit 8.1 billion pounds last month - the second highest on record and reflecting a jump in retail price inflation, the peg for inflation-linked British government bonds which account for about a third of the total.
""Surging inflation is making (Sunak's) task of returning the public finances to a sustainable footing much more difficult,"" Samuel Tombs, an economist with Pantheon Macroeconomics, said.
Retail price inflation hit a 30-year high of 7.5% in December, according to data published by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) last week.
The Resolution Foundation think tank said Sunak should use the leeway he has now to address the growing strain on household budgets from surging energy bills.
In response to Tuesday's data, Sunak stressed the importance of bringing down the deficit as interest costs rise.
""Risks to the public finances, including from inflation, make it even more important that we avoid burdening future generations with high debt repayments,"" he said.
Sunak is under pressure, including from some lawmakers in his own Conservative Party, to drop a planned increase in social security contributions for workers and employers - known as National Insurance - which is due to start in April.
The opposition Labour Party has pointed to mismanagement of government spending during the pandemic.
Public sector net borrowing, excluding state banks, totalled 16.848 billion pounds ($22.71 billion) in December alone, the ONS said, less than the average forecast of 18.5 billion pounds in a Reuters poll of economists.
Borrowing figures for the 2021/22 financial year so far included a 6 billion-pound downward revision to borrowing up until November, the ONS said.
The data showed a strong recovery in tax receipts.

Corporate tax revenues hit a all-time high of 5.5 billion pounds in December, the ONS said - with the caveats that it reflected large companies paying tax bills on a quarterly basis, and that the record is in current prices.

Gross domestic product (GDP) expanded 8.1% in 2021, the fastest in a decade due partly to the low base from 2020 when COVID-19 jolted the economy, comfortably beating an official target of ""above 6%"".
""Steady GDP growth laid a good foundation for fiscal revenue growth,"" Xu told a news conference.
2021 revenues totalled 20.25 trillion yuan ($3.20 trillion), trailing expenditures of 24.63 trillion yuan, which grew 0.3%, Xu said.
China cut taxes and fees by over 1 trillion yuan last year, Xu said. 
The government is making its 2022 budget plans by analyzing the economic situation and many uncertain factors, Xu said without elaborating, though there are concerns over a recent rise in COVID-19 infections.
China will reasonably set the annual quota on local government bonds this year to boost infrastructure investment, focusing on projects under construction and major projects, while preventing debt risks, Xu said.
The finance ministry has issued 1.46 trillion yuan in the 2022 advance quota for local special bonds.
The government will unveil greater tax and fee cuts in 2022 in response to the downward pressure on the economy, Xu said.
The central government will boost its transfer payments to local governments to help ease their fiscal strains and deliver the planned tax and fee cuts, he said.
China will be able to achieve economic growth of around 5.5% in 2022, an adviser to the government's cabinet said last week, though some independent analysts became less optimistic after recent data pointed to slowing momentum.

SEOUL (Reuters) -South Korea's economy expanded at the fastest pace in 11 years in 2021 helped by a jump in exports and construction activity, tempering declines in capital investment and a slow recovery in the coronavirus-hit service sectors.
Record exports drove the rebound but swathes of the economy have fallen behind. Jobs are still vanishing across manufacturing and service sectors, a reminder that liberal President Moon Jae-in's promises to boost employment have not materialised. 
Hours after Bank of Korea data showed the economy expanded 4.0% last year, hundreds of small business owners plan to gather near the National Assembly in Seoul to shave their heads in protest against social distancing rules that have hammered retail and service sector sales. 
Sentiment remains pessimistic as South Koreans head to the polls for the 2022 Presidential election slated for March 9. 
The main candidates from the ruling and opposition parties have seized on the discontent, making an equitable society a centerpiece of their policy visions. 
The BOK expects GDP to grow 3.0% this year as Asia's fourth-largest economy benefits from strength in semiconductor exports and increased public spending, though record domestic COVID-19 cases this week are a threat to consumption.
""Global demand for our chips is resilient and strong exports will keep (South Korea's) growth momentum solid,"" said Hwang Sang-pil, head of BOK's Economics Statistics department. 
""People are getting used to social distancing curbs. Activity was slower in December but the hit is smaller than before.""
The economy expanded a seasonally adjusted 1.1% in the October-December period from three months earlier, beating the 0.9% expansion tipped in a Reuters poll and up from a 0.3% rise in the third quarter.
From a year earlier, the economy expanded 4.1% in the fourth quarter, also beating a median forecast of 3.7% in the poll.
The BOK on Jan. 14 raised its benchmark interest rate to pre-pandemic levels and signalled it may tighten further as growth and inflationary pressures remain strong.
South Korea's economy has had a sharp albeit uneven bounce from the coronavirus slump in 2020, when it contracted 0.9%, with exports expanding at their fastest annual pace in 11 years last year while the consumption recovery has been patchy due to social distancing curbs.
A recent Reuters poll of 20 economists forecast the economy will grow 2.9% this year, below the 3.0% projected by the BOK.
Tuesday's data showed exports were the main driver of growth in the fourth quarter, jumping 4.3% on-quarter.
Growth was also helped by private consumption and construction investment, which expanded 1.7% and 2.9%, respectively.

The service sector grew 1.3% in the fourth quarter, stronger than the third quarter but slower than the second.
Capital investment declined 0.6% on-quarter, following a 2.4% drop in the preceding three months.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia's core inflation flew to its fastest annual pace since 2014 in the December quarter as fuel and housing costs led broad-based price pressures, a shock that will stoke market speculation of an early hike in interest rates.
Data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics out on Tuesday showed the headline consumer price index (CPI) rose 1.3% in the fourth quarter and 3.5% for the year, topping forecasts.
The trimmed mean measure of core inflation favoured by the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) jumped 1.0% in the quarter, the largest increase since 2008.
The annual pace picked up to 2.6%, above both the 2.3% forecast and the middle of the RBA's 2% to 3% target range.
That will be a surprise to the RBA, which had expected core inflation would not reach 2.5% until the end of 2023, a major reason it did not expect to hike rates this year.
That outlook will now be sorely challenged when the RBA Board meets on Feb.1. Analysts generally assume it will keep rates at 0.1% but could well call an end to bond buying, part of its quantitative easing campaign.
""The RBA is all but certain to end its asset purchase scheme at its meeting next week,"" said Ben Udy, an economist at Capital Economics. ""Our expectation for wage growth to firm up over the course of this year means the Bank should have enough evidence to hike rates by November.""
The rising cost of living, coupled with sky-high housing prices, is also shaping up to be a bone of political contention in a national election due by May.
The ABS noted a boom in home building combined with shortages of materials and labour to drive the largest increase in new dwelling prices in two decades.
Tuesday's data emboldened markets, which have long wagered the RBA was behind the curve on inflation and would have to tighten early, perhaps even by May this year.
A rise to 0.25% is fully priced in by June along with three more moves to 1.0% by year end.
WATCHING WAGES 
The RBA had argued that inflation was not yet a problem for Australia, still being less than half the levels seen in the United States or UK. 
Surging prices for energy and used cars have been a major contributor to U.S. inflation, but electricity costs have actually been falling in Australia while the ABS does not include used cars in its CPI.
Wages have also been more restrained in Australia with annual growth running at just 2.2%, less than half the pace of the U.S. and UK.
Still, unemployment has fallen much more quickly than expected to reach its lowest since 2008 at 4.2%, near lows that have lifted wages in the past.
A recent explosion of coronavirus cases has complicated the picture, throttling consumer spending but also causing supply bottlenecks that could add to inflationary pressures.

A survey of businesses from NAB on Tuesday showed confidence crumbled in December, even as sales held up reasonably well, while costs were rising at the fastest pace in years.
""With significant disruption to supply chains and labour markets, price pressures are to be expected and the key question will be how quickly, if at all, these pressures abate over coming months,"" said NAB chief economist Alan Oster. 
 
"
539,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 24, 2022 07:40PM ET</span>",Australian business confidence bruised by coronavirus surge,"SYDNEY (Reuters) - A measure of Australian business confidence has swung into the red as a surge in coronavirus cases hit consumer spending and played havoc with staffing, though sales overall were proving resilient so far.
Tuesday's survey from National Australia Bank (OTC:NABZY) (NAB) showed its index of business confidence slid 24 points to -12 in December, below the trough during the Delta wave last year.
Business conditions eased a more modest 3 points to +8, as sales held firm at +14 and profitability actually edged up a point to +10. The drag came from its measure of employment, which dropped 9 points to +2.
""It fell despite strong jobs growth reported in official data, reflecting the complexity of the labour market situation as businesses faced growing worker shortages and the prospect of a 'shadow lockdown' through the summer,"" said NAB chief economist Alan Oster.
There were more signs of inflation in the survey as purchase costs jumped to 2.8% in quarterly terms, the highest since 2008, while growth in final product prices firmed to 1.5% and retail prices advanced 2% in quarterly terms.

Official data out on Tuesday is expected to show core inflation rose at its fastest annual pace since 2014 in the December quarter, adding to speculation the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) might hike interest rates as early as May.
""With significant disruption to supply chains and labour markets, price pressures are to be expected and the key question will be how quickly, if at all, these pressures abate over coming months,"" said Oster.

Data firm IHS Markit said on Monday its flash U.S. Composite PMI Output Index, which tracks the manufacturing and services sectors, fell to a reading of 50.8 this month from 57.0 in December. That was the lowest level since July 2020. A reading above 50 indicates growth in the private sector.
The flash composite orders index slipped to a still-high reading of 55.0 from 56.6 in December.
""Output has been affected by Omicron much more than demand, with robust growth of new business inflows hinting that growth will pick up again once restrictions are relaxed,"" said Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit. 
The United States is reporting an average of 738,047 new coronavirus infections a day, according to a Reuters analysis of official data. Infections are mostly driven by the highly contagious Omicron variant. 
Government data this week showed 8.8 million people reporting not being at work because of coronavirus-related reasons between Dec. 29 and Jan. 10. There has also been an increase in businesses saying they suffered large impacts from the pandemic. 
That has lifted first-time applications for unemployment benefits to a three-month high. But there are signs that the Omicron wave is cresting, which could see business activity picking up. 
The slowdown in activity this month was across the board. 
The IHS Markit survey's flash services sector PMI dropped to a reading of 50.9, also the lowest since July 2020, from 57.6 in December. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast a reading of 55.0 this month for the services sector, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity.
Services industry businesses reported that labor shortages, employee absences and Omicron held back growth. Still, demand for services remained strong and companies managed to hire more workers, reducing the backlog of unfinished work. 
Price growth for inputs at services businesses slowed somewhat, though the pace remained very strong. This supports views that inflation has or is close to peaking. 
Worsening supply chain problems because of Omicron restrained manufacturing activity this month. The survey's flash manufacturing PMI fell to a 15-month low of 55.0 from 57.7 in December. Economists had forecast the index for the sector, which accounts for 11.9% of the economy, dipping to 56.7. 

The survey's measure of manufacturing employment contracted for the first time in 18 months, with IHS Markit noting ""a high turnover of staff and reports of the non-replacement of voluntary leavers.""
Orders for factory goods increased at their slowest rate since July 2020. Manufacturers also reported that the cost of inputs had eased a bit though prices still remained very high.

LONDON (Reuters) - The euro zone economic recovery weakened this month, despite an upturn in Germany where factories benefited from an easing in supply chain bottlenecks, as renewed restrictions put a dent in the bloc's dominant services industry, a survey showed.
With the Omicron coronavirus variant sweeping across Europe governments have been encouraging citizens to stay home and avoid socialising while soaring prices have discouraged consumers from spending.
IHS Markit's Flash Composite Purchasing Managers' Index, seen as good gauge of overall economic health, dropped to 52.4 in January from 53.3 in December, its lowest since February and below the 52.6 predicted in a Reuters poll.
That headline number was affected by the services PMI, which dropped to a nine-month low, although it remained in growth territory.
With customers staying home, growth in demand for services almost dried up. The new business index sank to its lowest reading since April last year just before parts of the economy reopened after a stricter lockdown.
""The small decline in the flash Composite PMI in January shows that Omicron has taken a toll on the services sector, although the German economy performed surprisingly well,"" said Bert Colijn at ING.
Businesses in Germany, Europe's largest economy, expanded at their fastest pace in four months, earlier data showed, as factories enjoyed an easing in supply chain bottlenecks. 
But in France, the only other euro zone country to report preliminary numbers, business growth dipped more than forecast as the impact of COVID-19 and inflationary pressures weighed on activity.
That suggests the bloc would have stumbled further without Germany's strength.
In Britain, outside the euro zone and the European Union, activity cooled unexpectedly to an 11-month low but cost pressures stayed high, leaving the Bank of England on track to raise interest rates next week.
Further afield, factory activity in Japan grew at the fastest pace in four years although activity in the private sector as a whole slipped into contraction for the first time in four months as the services industry suffered amid a surge in coronavirus cases.
PRICE PRESSURES
Consumers were also hit by rocketing prices. The euro zone composite output prices index matched November's survey high, and comes after inflation hit a record last month, likely adding pressure on the European Central Bank to tighten policy.
Factories, however, are less affected by restrictions and have largely remained open. The bloc's manufacturing PMI rose to a five-month high of 59.0 from 58.0, well ahead of the 57.5 Reuters poll estimate.
An index measuring output jumped to 55.8 from 53.8. The output measure feeds into the composite PMI and its big increase shows how much impact the services decline had on overall activity.
""The major news out of the release is that manufacturers are again noticing some abatement in supply chain problems. After cautious signs of improvements in December, things have materially improved in January,"" Colijn said.
To meet buoyant demand factories increased headcount at a rapid pace. The employment index soared to 57.5 from 55.3, its highest since July.
A Reuters poll last week found more than two-thirds of economists saying the Omicron variant would have a milder economic impact than Delta, and with the vaccine programme in the region continuing, optimism improved.
The composite future output index nudged up to its highest since the Omicron wave began.

""With the number of new COVID-19 cases having peaked in some countries and some governments having already outlined plans to ease restrictions, euro zone economic activity should pick up a bit in February and March,"" said Andrew Kenningham at Capital Economics.

LONDON (Reuters) - British business activity cooled unexpectedly this month to an 11-month low but cost pressures stayed high, according to a survey that leaves the Bank of England on track to raise interest rates next week.
The IHS Markit/CIPS Composite Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) slipped in January to 53.4 from 53.6. While remaining above the 50 dividing line between growth and contraction, a Reuters poll of economists had pointed to a reading of 55.0.
The spread of the Omicron variant of coronavirus again hit consumer-facing companies and manufacturers said orders grew at the weakest pace for a year - although business and financial services companies saw a quicker rate of expansion.
The flash PMIs suggested a similar level of economic performance for Britain, Germany and France, the three largest European economies.
""All told, this PMI survey suggests that the (UK) economy is suffering a hangover from the surge in Omicron cases. Even so, we still think GDP will recover fairly swiftly over the rest of Q1,"" said Adam Hoyes, economist from consultancy Capital Economics.
Sterling and British government bond prices showed no reaction to the data.
Gauges of costs paid and prices charged by services companies - watched closely by the BoE - increased in January, after easing back in December from recent all-time highs.
""With inflationary pressures remaining elevated at near-record levels, this all adds to the likelihood of the Bank of England hiking interest rates again at its upcoming meeting,"" Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit, said.
Twenty-nine of 45 economists in a Reuters poll published on Friday said the BoE would raise rates to 0.5% from 0.25% on Feb. 3 after its next scheduled meeting. [ECILT/GB]
British consumer price inflation hit a nearly 30-year high of 5.4% in the 12 months to December and many economists think it will go higher than the BoE's most recent estimate of a peak of around 6% in April.
The PMI for the services sector fell in January to 53.3 from 53.6 in December - its lowest level since February last year.
While the manufacturing PMI slipped to 56.9 from 57.9 in December, the decline reflected the way the survey measures supply chain delays, which eased further last month. 
""There have been signs that some stubborn supply chain pressures have started to ease,"" Rhys Herbert, senior economist at Lloyds (LON:LLOY) Bank, said. 

""However, the energy crisis and reports of new checks causing delays at ports are challenging many firms in the sector,"" he said, referring to the latest customs rules introduced on trade between Britain and the European Union.
Unlike in the much larger services sector, price pressures in manufacturing cooled in January.

IHS Markit's flash Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) showed that activity in the manufacturing sector rose to 60.5 from 57.4 in December.
Activity in the services sector rose to a two-month high of 52.2 after shrinking in December, confounding a forecast that had pointed to a decline and pointing to a positive mood among consumers and business despite the impact of the Omicron coronavirus variant.
As a result, the flash composite PMI, which tracks the manufacturing and services sectors that together account for more than two-thirds of the German economy, rose to a four-month high reading of 54.3 from 49.9 the previous month.
The results showcased the resilience of the German economy whose recovery from the pandemic was held back last year by supply shortages and fears that the Omicron variant could result in crippling lockdowns.

""Manufacturing is expected to stage a recovery in 2022 as supply bottlenecks ease, but seeing growth of this speed already is a welcome development,"" said Phil Smith, Economics Associate Director at IHS Markit.
""All in all, the data mark a positive start to the year and go some way to allaying fears about Omicron's impact on the German economy in the first quarter,"" he added. ""Still, rising costs remain a concern for businesses, with the survey data showing that input prices are continuing to rise sharply and on multiple fronts.""

Data compiler IHS Markit said its flash purchasing managers' index (PMI) for France's dominant services sector fell to 53.1 points in January from 57.0 in December - below a forecast for a January reading of 55.3 points.
The reading for the services sector, however, remained above the 50-point threshold which marks an expansion in activity.
The January flash PMI reading for French manufacturing dipped to 55.5 points from 55.6, albeit in line with forecasts.
The January composite flash PMI, which includes both the services and manufacturing sectors, fell to 52.7 points from 55.8 in December - coming below a forecast for 54.5 points.
IHS Markit said the figures highlighted the hits to business caused by the fifth wave of the COVID virus currently hitting the country, and inflationary pressures caused by rising energy prices.

""Given the surging number of daily COVID-19 cases we've seen in France, it's no surprise to see softer PMI numbers in January,"" said IHS Markit senior economist Joe Hayes.
""Supply chain issues continue to impact the economy, particularly manufacturers, but we do appear to have seen the worst as delivery times lengthened to a far weaker extent than seen during much of 2021. That being said, the inflationary side effects remain in play and are being exacerbated by rising staff costs and energy prices,"" added Hayes.

The IHS Markit Flash Australia Composite Output Index tumbled to 45.3 in January from 54.9 in December, bringing to an end three consecutive months of expansion. Business confidence fell to the lowest level since April 2020.
“The Australian economy had slipped from a state of strong recovery in end-2021 to being affected by the surge in Covid-19 infections,” said Jingyi Pan, economics associate director at IHS Markit. “Supply issues meanwhile remained prevalent, with lengthening of lead times, reports of supply shortages and labor constraints persisting.”
The result highlights the impact of an omicron outbreak that erupted just as Australia moved to trying to live with Covid, throwing up a hurdle to the $1.5 trillion economy’s recovery. The consensus view is there’s likely to be a mild slowdown in growth in the first quarter of this year, followed by a rebound as cases subside, underpinned by strong demand from cashed-up households. 
Today’s report also showed input-price inflation accelerated to a record due to worsening supply-chain snarls. 
The price pressure is significant for Australian policy makers who have been trying to revive inflation that in recent years has barely reached the lower end of the Reserve Bank’s 2-3% target. If supply-chain disruptions and a labor squeeze persist, the RBA could be forced to tighten policy earlier than its current indication of late 2023.
Australia reports inflation data for the final three months of 2021 on Tuesday and the RBA board meets a week later, with policy makers due to decide the fate of a bond-buying program.

BERLIN (Reuters) -The German government will cut its economic growth forecast for this year to 3.6% from its October estimate of 4.1%, according to a draft of the annual economic report seen by Reuters on Friday. 
The coalition government of Social Democrats, Greens and Liberals, in power since December, expects the pandemic to further strain businesses and supply bottlenecks for products such as semiconductors to persist, further limiting companies' growth, according to the draft. 
Magazine Der Spiegel was first to report the new growth forecast.
The new government predicts inflation to reach 3.3% on average this year, after it soared to 3.1% in 2021 from 0.5% a year earlier and is still forecasting core inflation, excluding food and energy prices, to run at 2.5% in 2022, the draft said.

Most economists expect Europe's largest economy to shrink again in the first three months of 2022 after a fourth-quarter contraction, driving it into another technical recession, defined as two consecutive quarters of declining output.
Germany's BDI industry association said earlier this month it expected the nation's economy to grow 3.5% this year, showing more caution than the government as it warned that companies could face another year of ""stop-and-go"" business due to the pandemic.

OTTAWA (Reuters) - Canadian retail sales most likely fell by 2.1% in December as authorities imposed restrictions to fight the Omicron variant of the coronavirus and retailers faced challenges, Statistics Canada predicted on Friday.
Statscan also said retail sales rose 0.7% in November, which was less than the 1.2% gain forecast by analysts.
The flash estimate for December was based on responses from 50.6% of companies surveyed. The average response rate is 90.0%.
Statscan also said some shoppers decided to pull forward their purchases to November to avoid shortages caused by endemic supply chain issues.
Andrew Grantham, senior economist at CIBC Capital Markets, said the December dip was a little larger than he had expected.
""Bricks-and-mortar retailers will have likely continued to struggle in January due to Omicron-related restrictions and staff shortages,"" he said in a note.
This weakness, he suggested, might ""tip the scales slightly"" in terms of persuading the Bank of Canada to hold steady when it makes a rate announcement on Jan 26. Money markets see about a 70% chance that the central bank will lift its key overnight rate from the current record low 0.25%. {BOCWATCH]
The bank has previously said it could raise rates as early as soon as April.
Stephen Brown, senior Canada economist at Capital Economics, said the December decrease in sales was likely to be more than 2.1%, given the rapid spread of Omicron that month.
November's gain was fueled by higher sales at gasoline stations, and at building materials and gardening equipment and supplies dealers.

Sales rose in six of 11 subsectors, representing 63.8% of retail trade. In volume terms, retail sales edged up 0.2%.
The Canadian dollar was trading 0.1% lower at 1.2520 to the greenback, or 79.87 U.S. cents.

LONDON (Reuters) -British retail sales slumped in December after consumers did much of their Christmas shopping earlier than usual in November and many people stayed at home due to the spread of the Omicron coronavirus variant.
Economists said the scale of the hit bolstered their expectations that the world's fifth-biggest economy shrank last month under the strain of Omicron and new government restrictions to slow its spread. 
Sales volumes fell by 3.7% from November, a far bigger hit than the 0.6% decline forecast in a Reuters poll of economists and the biggest fall since January of last year when the country was under a coronavirus lockdown.
Compared with December 2020, sales volumes were down by 0.9%, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said on Friday.
The Reuters poll had pointed to a 3.4% rise in sales in annual terms.
""After strong pre-Christmas trading in November, retail sales fell across the board in December, with feedback from retailers suggesting Omicron impacted on footfall,"" ONS Deputy Director for Surveys Heather Bovill said.
""As Plan B restrictions in England meant more people working from home, there was a notable fall for fuel sales,"" she added, referring to government measures to tackle the pandemic.
But retail sales remained stronger than before the pandemic, with over a quarter of sales now made online, she said.
Bethany Beckett, an economist at Capital Economics, said the data backed her view that the surge in Omicron cases in the run-up to Christmas may have caused the economy to shrink by 0.5% in December or possibly more.
Retail sales would probably recoup the hit between January and March as the government lifts its COVID restrictions but ""with the UK’s cost of living crisis looming, we expect a weakening in the consumer recovery to dampen retail sales further ahead,"" she said.
However, the Bank of England was still likely to raise interest rates for a second time in two months in February, Beckett said.
British consumer price inflation hit a nearly 30-year high of 5.4% in the 12 months to December. Average earnings in the three months to November, excluding bonuses, rose by 3.8% compared with the same period of 2020.
A survey published earlier on Friday showed consumer confidence fell in January to its lowest since February 2021 when the country was under lockdown.
The ONS data showed non-food sales slumped by 7.1% in December from November, also the biggest fall since January last year.

British retail sales recovered quickly from their 2020 pandemic slump when restrictions were first lifted.
But the rise in inflation led by surging energy prices, the prospect of higher interest rates and a tax hike in April will test the appetite of consumers to keep on spending in 2022, retail executives have warned.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's core consumer prices rose 0.5% in December from a year earlier, increasing for a second month in a row at the fastest pace in nearly two years in a sign of broadening inflationary pressure from rising fuel and raw material costs.
The recent inflation pick-up drew the attention of Bank of Japan (BOJ) policymakers, some of whom said firms might be starting to be more aggressive in passing on higher costs to consumers, minutes of their December interest rate-setting meeting showed on Friday.
""It's unlikely Japan will see wages rise as sharply as in the United States. But there's a significant chance both economic growth and inflation could overshoot expectations,"" one BOJ board member was quoted as saying in the meeting.
The rise in the core consumer price index (CPI), which excludes volatile fresh food but includes energy costs, was slightly below market forecasts for a 0.6% gain. It was in line with a 0.5% increase in November, which was the fastest gain since February 2020, government data showed on Friday.
Still, the increase is not likely to trigger an immediate withdrawal of monetary stimulus by the BOJ, with inflation still well below its 2% target and driven mostly by external factors rather than strong domestic demand.
But the central bank will face the challenge of taming market speculation of an early exit from ultra-easy policy, as some analysts expect consumer inflation to approach 2% when drag from cellphone fee cuts ends in April.
Creeping inflation may also hurt consumption at a time when a surge in cases of the Omicron new coronavirus variant and more people staying at home to stay safe cloud the outlook of Japan's fragile economic recovery.
Electricity bills surged 13.4% in December from a year earlier, the fastest pace since 1981, on top of a 22.4% spike in gasoline costs, the CPI data showed.
""We're seeing signs of change in the price-setting behaviour of Japanese firms, which had been said to be cautious about raising prices for fear of seeing sales volume fall,"" the BOJ minutes quoted a board member as saying at the December meeting.
Japan has not been immune to the impact of global commodity inflation with wholesale prices rising at a record pace, prodding more firms to raise prices and already shifting public perception that deflation will persist.
The BOJ raised its price forecasts on Tuesday but said it was in no rush to change its ultra-loose policy on the view the recent cost-push inflation will provide transitory.
BOJ Governor Haruhiko Kuroda has said the bank's focus would be to scrutinise whether wages will rise enough to increase households' purchasing power, allow firms to hike prices and help sustainably accelerate inflation.
There is uncertainty, however, on whether companies will heed requests by Prime Minister Fumio Kishida to raise wages as stubbornly high input costs squeeze their profit.
Some analysts remain doubtful on whether inflation will broaden beyond goods sensitive to fuel and commodity prices.

An index stripping away the effect of energy and volatile fresh food prices fell 0.7% in December from a year earlier, dropping for the ninth consecutive month, the CPI data showed.
""There are goods for which prices can be raised with relative ease, such as fuel and energy. But for other products it's difficult,"" said Taro Saito, executive research fellow at NLI Research Institute. ""I don't think there will as much price growth as in the United States and Europe.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits jumped to a three-month high last week, likely as a winter wave of COVID-19 infections disrupted business activity, which could constrain job growth this month.
The third straight weekly increase in jobless claims reported by the Labor Department on Thursday was also influenced by unfavorable seasonal factors after the holidays. Coronavirus cases, driven by the Omicron variant, are subsiding and the seasonal factors, the model used by the government to iron out seasonal fluctuations from data, are seen normalizing soon, suggesting the recent surge in claims is a blip.
""The Omicron variant of COVID-19 is hurting the U.S. labor market, but the good news is that this will be temporary,"" said Ryan Sweet, a senior economist at Moody's (NYSE:MCO) Analytics in West Chester, Pennsylvania.
Initial claims for state unemployment benefits surged 55,000 to a seasonally adjusted 286,000 for the week ended Jan. 15, the highest level since mid-October. The increase was the largest since last July. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast 220,000 applications for the latest week.
Unadjusted claims fell 83,418 to 337,417 last week. The decline was, however, less than the 138,773 decrease that had been anticipated by the seasonal factors. 
Claims rose 6,075 in California. But they plunged 14,011 in New York. There were also big drops in Missouri and Texas.
The United States is reporting an average of 752,698 new coronavirus infections a day, according to a Reuters analysis of official data. 
Latest data from the Census Bureau's Household Pulse Survey showed more than 8 million people reported not being at work because of coronavirus-related reasons between Dec. 29 and Jan. 10. That was up from the 3 million from Dec. 1 to Dec. 13.
With signs that the Omicron wave has crested in some regions, including hard-hit New York, the setback to the labor market is unlikely to stop the Federal Reserve from raising interest rates in March to tackle high inflation.
Claims have plunged from a record high of 6.149 million in early April 2020. Employers are desperate for workers, with 10.6 million job openings at the end of November. The unemployment rate is at a 22-month low of 3.9%, a sign the labor market is at or close to maximum employment.
""The underlying strength in the labor market suggests this is a temporary blip due to Omicron,"" said John Lynch, chief investment officer at Comerica (NYSE:CMA) Wealth Management in Charlotte, North Carolina. ""We look for job growth to continue to firm as global cyclical recovery persists.""
Stocks on Wall Street were trading higher. The dollar was steady against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices rose.
BAD OMEN?
But some economists worried that the jump in claims, which followed a plunge in retail sales in December as well as manufacturing production, could be signaling a faster slowdown in economic activity than currently anticipated. 
""The higher layoffs are a cautionary tale for the economy where despite inflation pressures, the Fed will have to proceed with their interest rate hikes at a measured pace,"" said Christopher Rupkey, chief economist at FWDBONDS in New York. ""The economy may be slowing down more than previously believed.""
There are, however, indications that manufacturing is picking up, though shortages and higher prices remain a headache. 
The Philadelphia Fed said on Thursday its business activity index rose to a reading of 23.2 in January from 15.4 in December. Any reading above zero indicates expansion in the region's manufacturing sector, which covers eastern Pennsylvania, southern New Jersey and Delaware.
News on the housing market was discouraging. A report from the National Association of Realtors showed existing home sales dropped 4.6% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 6.18 million units in December as higher prices amid record low inventory continued to shut out some first-time buyers.
Economists expect demand for housing to remain strong even as mortgage rates increase.
""Unless job and income growth slow sharply, owner-occupied housing demand is likely to remain solid, keeping upward pressure on house prices,"" said David Berson, chief economist at Nationwide in Columbus, Ohio.
Worker shortages are boosting wages and households are sitting on a pile of savings accumulated during the pandemic.
The claims data covered the period during which the government surveyed businesses for the nonfarm payrolls component of January's employment report. 
Claims are significantly higher than their level in mid-December, suggesting moderate job growth this month. 
The economy added 199,000 jobs in December, the fewest in a year. The workforce is about 2.2 million people smaller than before the pandemic.
The recent softening in the labor market trend was also highlighted by the claims report, which showed the number of people receiving benefits after an initial week of aid increased 84,000 to 1.635 million in the week ended Jan. 8. 

Still, these so-called continuing claims stayed below 2 million for the eighth straight week.
""The pandemic continues to displace workers from the labor force,"" said Van Hesser, chief strategist at Kroll Bond Rating Agency in new York. ""We need the labor force to grow to sustain healthy economic growth.""

Existing home sales dropped 4.6% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 6.18 million units last month, the National Association of Realtors said on Thursday. Sales fell across all regions. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast sales would fall to a rate of 6.44 million units. 
Home resales, which account for the bulk of U.S. home sales, declined 7.1% on a year-on-year basis. A total of 6.12 million homes were sold in 2021, the most since 2006. That was up 8.5% from 2020. Sales remained concentrated in the upper price-end of the market.
Demand for housing is being fueled by individuals as well as investors who renovate and then resell homes to take advantage of the hot housing market. But rising mortgage rates, supply constraints and higher house prices could make home purchases less affordable this year. 
There is a record backlog of houses authorized for construction but not yet started, according to government data published on Wednesday. Builders said this week that higher material costs and shortages were adding weeks to typical single-family construction times. 
The U.S. government in November nearly doubled the duties on imported Canadian softwood lumber to 17.9% from 9% after a review of its anti-dumping and countervailing duty orders.
The median existing house price increased 15.8% from a year earlier to $358,000 in December. House prices averaged a record $346,900 in 2021, up 16.9% from the prior year.
There were a record low of 910,000 previously owned homes on the market last month, down 18.0% from November and 14.2% from a year ago. At December's sales pace, it would take 1.8 months to exhaust the current inventory, down from 1.9 months a year ago.
A six-to-seven-month supply is viewed as a healthy balance between supply and demand.

Properties typically remained on the market for 19 days last month, down from 21 days from a year ago. Seventy-nine percent of homes sold in December were on the market for less than a month. 
First-time buyers accounted for 30% of sales last month, compared to 31% a year ago.

Initial unemployment claims increased by 55,000 to 286,000 in the week ended Jan. 15, Labor Department data showed Thursday. The figure exceeded all estimates in a Bloomberg survey of economists. The report reflects the reference week for January employment data due early next month.
Continuing claims for state benefits rose to 1.64 million in the week ended Jan. 8.
The increase in applications may point to employers laying off staff during the most recent surge in Covid cases. Even so, the fallout should be short-lived as companies are desperate to retain and attract talent amid ongoing labor shortages.
Claims figures have been choppy in the last few weeks, reflecting challenges adjusting for seasonal effects during the holiday period.
In fact, claims fell 83,418 to 337,417 last week on an unadjusted basis. New York, Missouri and Texas were states with the biggest decreases in unadjusted claims. California registered the largest increase in applications.

Taiwan's export orders, a bellwether of global technology demand, rose 12.1% from a year earlier to $67.9 billion last month, the highest monthly figure on record, data from the Ministry of Economic Affairs showed on Thursday.
That marked the 22nd straight month of expansion, with the pace much faster than the median forecast for a rise of 8% in a Reuters poll.
The ministry said supply chain problems continued to ease and there was solid consumer demand for technologies such as notebook computers and 5G.
Orders for telecommunications and electronic products both hit record highs in December, normally the start of the low season with Christmas out the way, with the ministry reporting ""brisk"" demand.
The ministry said export orders for all of 2021 rose 26.3% versus 2020, reaching $674.13 billion, also a record high. Growth has been supported by the work-from-home-trend during the pandemic as well as a global semiconductor shortage.
However, while the ministry said demand would continue to be supported by tech demand, it warned supply chain issues were still present along with COVID-19 worries, and noted the first quarter was generally the low season for technology goods.
Kevin Wang, an economist at Taishin Securities Investment, said resurgent COVID-19 in the United States and China could affect the outlook, and coming off a high base last year export order growth in the first quarter was likely to stall. 
Taiwanese companies such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd (TSMC) are major suppliers to Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) Inc and other global tech firms.
In November, export orders rose 13.4% from a year earlier to $65.5 billion, far better than economist forecasts.
The ministry said it expects an increase in export orders in January to be in a range of between +11% and +13.8% from a year earlier.

Orders from the United States rose 16.9% in December from a year earlier, a much faster rate of expansion compared with the 10.8% logged in November, while orders from China increased 4.5%, versus a gain of 25.3% the previous month.
Orders from Europe rose 8.2%, while those from Japan dropped 5.8%.

The jump from the previous December was the largest year-on-year increase for any month since the Federal Statistics Office began compiling the producer price numbers in 1949, the office said.
December's figures marked the third consecutive month of very high numbers after October and November showed increases of 18.4% and 19.2% respectively.
The average expectation among analysts polled by Reuters was an annual increase of 19.4%.
Producer prices also registered a record jump of 5% month on month, against 0.8% in November.

Energy prices were up 69% compared with December 2020, the Federal Statistics Office said. Stripping out energy prices, producer prices rose 10.4% on the year.
Producer prices are considered a leading indicator for inflation. They are recorded at the factory gate - before products are processed further or go on sale - and can provide an early indication of consumer price trends.

558,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 19, 2022 09:35PM ET</span>","Japan's Dec exports, imports hit record high by value as supply bottlenecks ease","By Kantaro Komiya
TOKYO (Reuters) -Japan's exports and imports in December hit record highs in terms of their value in yen, data showed on Thursday, as supply bottlenecks eased at the end of 2021 amid rising prices.
However, a persistent semiconductor shortage remained a headache for Japanese firms such as automaker Toyota, which slashed its near-term output target this week, in addition to uncertainties around the Omicron variant.
""There're considerable uncertainties"" from Omicron, Takeshi Minami, chief economist at Norinchukin Research Institute said, adding it could derail various aspects of Japan's economy from firms' overseas supply chains to domestic consumption.
Exports in December rose 17.5% from a year earlier, Ministry of Finance data showed, outstripping a 16.0% gain expected by economists in a Reuters poll but below a 20.5% rise in November.
Yen-denominated exports and imports hit records of 7,881.4 billion yen ($69 billion) and 8,463.8 billion yen, respectively, biggest since comparable data became available in January 1979, largely as rising inflation affected both flows.
Steel exports rose 75.1% year-on-year by value, but the gain in export volume was 10.2%, suggesting soaring commodity prices pushed up values of made-in-Japan goods sold overseas.
Exports to the United States rose 22.1%, with car shipments marking their first year-on-year rise in five months at 11.9% as Japan's factory output rebounded.
Shipments to China, Japan's biggest trade partner, grew 10.8% in December from a year earlier.
ANNUAL TRADE DEFICIT
Imports by the world's No.3 economy surged 41.1% in December on higher raw material costs and a weak yen, versus expectations of a rise of 42.8% and growth of 43.8% in the previous month.
The led to a trade deficit of 582.4 billion yen ($5.09 billion) in December, versus expectations of 784.1 billion yen.
For the full year 2021, Japan reported a trade deficit of 1,472.2 billion yen, the first in two years and following a 388.3 billion surplus in 2020, amid higher fuel import costs.
""The rise of import costs is common among advanced economies, but (Japan's) problem is weak pass-through of import costs to domestic prices,"" Norinchukin's Minami said.
""The recent combination of a weak yen and high fuel costs has brought considerable damage to Japan's economy.""
The Bank of Japan has said a weak yen is likely to continue to positively impact Japan's economy, even though rising import good prices hurt households.
Japan is expected to have grown by an annualised 6.5% in the last quarter of 2021 thanks to a strong rebound in consumption, the latest Reuters poll shows.

But policymakers have been wary of risks from the rapidly spreading Omicron variant, as Japan recorded its largest daily COVID-19 infections this week.

559,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 19, 2022 08:20PM ET</span>",Australia jobless number dives to lowest since 2008 as case builds for rate rise,"By Wayne Cole
SYDNEY (Reuters) -Australian employment raced ahead in December as the jobless rate fell to its lowest point since 2008, showing strength that should help the economy weather the current surge in coronavirus cases across the country.
Data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics on Thursday showed employment jumped 64,800 in December, topping market forecasts of a 43,300 rise and adding to November's record jump of 366,000.
The unemployment rate fell to 4.2%, from 4.6% in November, the lowest reading since August 2008, when the jobless rate bottomed out at 4%. The ABS noted that to find a result under 4% you needed to go back to the 1970s.
Investors reacted by nudging the local dollar up to $0.7228 on wagers of an early rate increase from the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA), which has been seeking to drive unemployment to 4% or lower to lift wage growth after years of sub-par gains.
The blistering growth in jobs hit a speed bump this month, however, as a surge in new Omicron cases spooked consumers away from shops and restaurants and played havoc with distribution systems as workers fell ill or isolated.
So far most of the hit has been to hours worked rather than to employment, with analysts estimating hours might drop 3-4% over January, though layoffs could come if the outbreak lingers through February.
Encouragingly, demand for labour remains strong with job advertisements easing only modestly in December after a run of stellar gains to leave them 33% higher on the year.
PUSHING FOR A RATE RISE
Such is the need for workers that the government on Wednesday waived the cost of visas for students and backpackers wanting to come to Australia and work part time.
Analysts hope that demand is finally stoking wage growth, though evidence so far is largely anecdotal.
Official data on wages for the fourth quarter are not out until Feb. 23 and may not show much of a pick-up given the inertia baked into the pay system in Australia.
The last measure of wages showed growth of just 2.2% a year, compared to 4.8% in the United States and 4.9% in the UK.
This is a key reason the RBA has argued that interest rates will not need to rise from their record low of 0.1% until 2023, even as the U.S. Federal Reserve seems ready to raise rates in March.
Markets are wagering a tightening will come a lot sooner, perhaps as early as May given the persistence of global inflationary pressures.
Data on Australian consumer prices for the December quarter is due next week and some economists are predicting core inflation could jump to its highest since 2009 at 2.5%, adding greatly to the case for an early rise in rates.

Bill Evans, chief economist at Westpac, on Thursday forecast an increase would now come in August, a major shift from his previous call of a first move in February next year.
""Our forecast revisions reflect a much faster lift in inflation and wages growth than envisaged,"" said Evans. ""We now expect one hike of 15 basis points in August to be followed by a further hike of 25 basis points in October.""

560,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 19, 2022 12:20PM ET</span>","UK sees highest inflation since 1992, pressuring BoE and households","By David Milliken and Andy Bruce
LONDON (Reuters) -Inflation in Britain rose faster than expected to its highest in nearly 30 years in December, intensifying a squeeze on living standards and putting pressure on the Bank of England to raise interest rates again.
The annual rate of consumer price inflation increased to 5.4% from November's 5.1%, the highest since March 1992, the Office for National Statistics said. Economists polled by Reuters had expected a rise to 5.2%.
Financial markets now price in a more than 90% chance that the BoE will raise its main interest rate to 0.5% on Feb. 3. Last month it became the world's first major central bank to tighten policy since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic.
""The Bank of England was already feeling uncomfortable about its monetary policy stance. Today's upside surprises to both the headline and core inflation readings will certainly not have helped,"" said Ambrose Crofton, global market strategist at J.P. Morgan Asset Management.
Two-year British government bond yields, which are sensitive to financial markets' interest rate expectations, came within a whisker of their highest level since 2011.
Inflation has risen sharply across most advanced economies, reflecting a global rise in energy prices and supply chain difficulties. 
But the BoE appears more concerned than the U.S. Federal Reserve or the European Central Bank that labour shortages and wage pressures will cause inflation to be slow to fall back once immediate price pressures have passed.
Speaking to lawmakers on Wednesday, Governor Andrew Bailey said financial markets expected energy prices would take longer to fall than had been the case two months ago, while BoE staff had found tentative signs inflation was pushing up pay settlements.
""Please don't think we don't think these are serious pressures. They are,"" Bailey said, when challenged over whether the central bank had been complacent about price risks.
A surge in cases of the Omicron coronavirus variant had negligible impact on inflation, ONS statisticians said. 
Instead, prices for food, hospitality and household goods were the main factors pushing up inflation in December while fuel prices - the main driver in previous months - remained at recent highs.
""Not only does this provide additional evidence that inflation is becoming endemic rather than transitory, it also bodes ill for households facing multiple rises in the cost of living this spring,"" said Kitty Ussher, chief economist at the Institute of Directors.
APRIL PEAK?
British inflation is widely expected to peak in April when regulated household energy bills look set to increase by around 50%. Last month the BoE forecast a peak of around 6%, but now some economists see 7% as more likely.
Inflation was just 0.6% in December 2020, and the BoE repeatedly had to revise up its forecast last year. A new inflation forecast is due on Feb. 3. The last one in November showed inflation staying above its 2% target until mid-2024.
Rising inflation is also turning into a political problem for Prime Minister Boris Johnson's government, which faces calls from the opposition and charities to offset the rise in energy bills, which comes at the same time as a tax increase on wages to fund higher health and social care spending.
""I understand the pressures people are facing with the cost of living, and we will continue to listen to people's concerns,"" finance minister Rishi Sunak said after the inflation data.
Wednesday's figures showed that core CPI - which excludes more volatile food, energy, alcohol and tobacco prices - rose to a record 4.2% from November's 3.9%.

Retail price inflation - an older measure that the ONS says is no longer accurate, but which is still widely used by government and businesses - rose to a 30-year high of 7.5% from 7.1%.
Factory price inflation showed tentative signs that cost pressures may have peaked, cooling to 9.3% from 9.4% in November. Inflation for costs paid by producers for material and energy also decreased, to 13.5% from 15.2%.

561,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 19, 2022 12:15PM ET</span>",Multi-family housing boosts U.S. homebuilding; supply constraints seen unrelenting,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. homebuilding rose to a nine-month high in December amid a surge in multi-family housing projects, but soaring prices for materials after the government nearly doubled duties on imported Canadian softwood lumber could hamper activity later this year.
The report from the Commerce Department on Wednesday also showed the housing construction backlog surged to a record high last month, underscoring the challenges builders are facing from supply strains, including labor shortages. Completions tumbled as well. Rising mortgage rates could also restrain homebuilding.
""Builders are gladly trying to meet demand, but supply problems and labor shortages are slowing them down,"" said Jennifer Lee, a senior economist at BMO Capital Markets in Toronto. ""Softwood lumber duties are going to hurt this spring.""
Housing starts rose 1.4% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.702 million units last month, the highest level since March. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast starts falling to a rate of 1.650 million units. 
The volatile multi-family housing segment accounted for the rise in homebuilding last month, with starts for buildings with five units or more surging 13.7% to a rate of 524,000 units. There is strong demand to rental housing.
Single-family housing starts, which account for the largest share of the housing market, dropped 2.3% to a rate of 1.172 million units last month. Single-family homebuilding soared in the Northeast and Midwest, likely boosted by unseasonably mild temperatures. December 2021 was the warmest December on record, according to the National Centers for Environmental Information.
The densely populated South, where the bulk of homebuilding occurs, reported an 8.2% decrease in single-family starts. Homebuilding also fell in the West.
Housing starts totaled 1.595 million in 2021, up 15.6% from 2020. But the outlook for home building this year is uncertain. The United States last November nearly doubled the duties on imported Canadian softwood lumber to 17.9% from 9% after a review of its anti-dumping and countervailing duty orders.
According to the National Association of Homebuilders on Tuesday, the aggregate cost of residential construction materials had increased almost 19% since December 2021. The NAHB said higher material costs and shortages were adding weeks to typical single-family home construction times. 
Prices for softwood lumber, used for framing, soared 24.4% in December after rising 6.9% in November, according to the latest producer price data. Lumber futures have also surged.
Stocks on Wall Street were lower. The dollar slipped against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices rose.
HUGE BACKLOG
The backlog of houses authorized for construction but not yet started shot up 1.1% to a rate of 270,000 last month, the highest on record. Permits for future homebuilding jumped 9.1% to a rate of 1.873 million units in December, an 11-month high. They accelerated 17.2% in 2021. 
Permits are now running ahead of starts, which should underpin homebuilding in the coming months. Permits for buildings with five units or more soared 19.9% to a rate of 675,000 units. Single-family building permits rose 2.0% to a rate of 1.128 million units.
An acute shortage of previously owned homes available for sale is supporting homebuilding, but rising mortgage rates, supply constraints together with higher house prices could make home purchasing less affordable. 
Housing completions tumbled 8.7% to a rate of 1.295 million units, reflecting a 34.3% plunge in multi-family housing units. Single-family home completions increased 3.9% to a rate of 990,000 units.
The inventory of single-family housing under construction rose 2.3% to a rate of 769,000 units last month, the highest since February 2007. Multi-family homes under construction advanced 2.4% to a rate of 737,000 units.
""As long as supply chains remain stressed, builders will struggle to complete projects, slowing sales and likely limiting growth in the supply of new homes,"" said Ben Ayers, senior economist at Nationwide in Columbus, Ohio.
The 30-year fixed-rate mortgage averaged 3.45% during the week ending Jan. 13, the highest since March 2020 and up from 3.22% in the prior week, according to data from mortgage finance agency  Freddie Mac  (OTC:FMCC). 
An analysis by another mortgage finance agency Fannie Mae on Wednesday showed housing affordability was increasingly becoming constrained, which could limit home sales this year.
""We observe an early indication of this in recent increases in debt-to-income measures associated with incoming mortgage originations,"" said Doug Duncan, chief economist at Fannie Mae in Washington. 
Mortgage rates have risen as financial markets price in an interest rate increase from the Federal Reserve in March amid high inflation and a labor market that is at or near maximum employment. 
Expectations that mortgage rates will keep rising are drawing buyers into the market. 

A report from the Mortgage Bankers Association on Wednesday showed applications for loans to buy a home increased 8% last week.
""This year is likely to be sideways at best for residential home builders,"" said Christopher Rupkey, chief economist at FWDBONDS in New York. ""It will be interesting to see if higher mortgage rates cool the housing bubble in prices because the lack of new supply will likely remain the dominant trend for another year.""

OTTAWA (Reuters) -Canada's annual inflation rate accelerated in December to hit a 30-year high, data showed on Wednesday, bolstering expectations the central bank could hike interest rates as soon as next week.
Inflation rose to 4.8%, in line with analyst expectations and the highest print since it reached 5.5% in September 1991, Statistics Canada said. It was the ninth consecutive month in which headline inflation topped the Bank of Canada's 1% to 3% control range.
Core inflation measures all rose, with the closely watched CPI common measure near a 10-year high at 2.1%.
That could fuel bets the central bank will start hiking interest rates next week, despite uncertainty around the impact of the Omicron coronavirus variant. 
""We have core inflation getting to the upper end of the (Bank of Canada) target range and I think that's going to spook them,"" said Derek Holt, vice president of capital markets economics at Scotiabank.
""The worst thing they can do during the pandemic is to show they are not serious about containing cost of living pressures.""
The Bank of Canada's benchmark rate has been at a record low 0.25% since the pandemic took hold in March 2020. It previously signaled it could tighten as early as April, but money markets see a roughly 70% chance of a hike on Jan. 26. [BOCWATCH] 
Consumer price gains in December were driven by higher prices for shelter, food and vehicles. Shelter, which includes the cost of maintaining and replacing a home, posted its largest gain since July 2008, Statscan said.
Separately, Canadian home price gains accelerated in December, as buyers scrambled to act before anticipated rate hikes and re-sale supply remained constrained, Teranet data showed on Wednesday. 
Analysts said inflation could increase in the coming months, before starting to decelerate later in the year.

""A re-acceleration in energy prices, transportation issues impacting food costs and a strengthening once again in monthly house price gains suggest that we could grind a little higher still,"" Andrew Grantham, a senior economist at CIBC Capital Markets, said in a note.
The Canadian dollar was trading 0.3% higher at 1.2477 to the greenback, or 80.15 U.S. cents, after touching its strongest level in nearly one week at 1.2451.

COMMENTARY
ANDREW GRANTHAM, SENIOR ECONOMIST, CIBC CAPITAL MARKETS
""A few weeks ago we may have been tempted to call a peak in inflation at this point. However, a reacceleration in energy prices, transportation issues impacting food costs and a strengthening once again in monthly house price gains suggest that we could grind a little higher still, before seeing a deceleration starting around spring time.""
""For the Bank of Canada, headline inflation in Q4 as a whole was slightly below its October MPR forecasts, although there may be increasing concern regarding the length of time it will remain elevated for and a broadening of price pressures outside of food, energy and supply constrained items.""
ANDREW KELVIN, CHIEF CANADA STRATEGIST AT TD SECURITIES
""The increase in the core metrics does catch my eye insofar as that speaks to pay increasing underlying inflationary pressures. And I think on balance between that and the on-consensus headline print, you'd have to put this in the hawkish camp, in the sense that this probably does incrementally ratchet up pressure on the BOC to start lifting rates sooner rather than later.""
""I think (the rate increase) will be in January. I think that makes the most sense. I have a lot of time for the argument that they should wait until March to get through this current wave of public health measures. But I think ultimately, given the risk of inflation expectations starting to become untethered, it makes more sense and is more prudent for them to go in January. So I look for a rate hike of 25 basis points in January.""
""I think they (the BoC) did do a reasonable job of signaling (a rate hike) in December in some of the speeches. ... The markets price more than a 50% chance of a rate hike next week now. So you know, they (the BoC) can plausibly look at market pricing and say, we are reacting to the data the same way the market was, which was a line you did hear from (former) governor (Stephen) Poloz from time to time as well.""
DEREK HOLT, VICE PRESIDENT OF CAPITAL MARKETS ECONOMICS, SCOTIABANK

""Some people who secured advantageous interest rates have probably brought forward transactions,"" said Daren King, an economist with National Bank of Canada (OTC:NTIOF), in a note. 
""In addition, the lack of supply on the market is certainly putting upward pressure on prices, which should continue in the short term,"" he said.
Investors are raising bets the Bank of Canada will start hiking rates next week, despite worries that stricter restrictions to tackle surging COVID-19 cases will slice into economic growth. 
Home sales inched up 0.2% in December from November, while active listings fell to very low levels, Canada's realtors said on Monday.
Housing starts, meanwhile, fell 22% in December, but remain high in historic terms, official data showed on Tuesday. BMO Capital Markets economist Shelly Kaushik said the 6-month average was comparable to building booms in the 1970s and 1980s.
""Canada's housing market remains extremely strong, and price strength is largely driven by sky-high demand rather than lack of supply,"" she said, in a note.

The Teranet gains were led by Victoria, British Columbia at 2.1% and Halifax, Nova Scotia at 1.9%. Prices fell in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Ottawa-Gatineau, and Edmonton, Alberta.

565,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 19, 2022 07:05AM ET</span>",U.S. mortgage interest rates climb for 4th straight week,"(Reuters) - The interest rate on the most popular U.S. home loan rose for a fourth straight week last week, with residential real estate borrowing costs now the highest in nearly two years as financial markets anticipate that the Federal Reserve will raise rates sooner and faster than previously expected to combat inflation.
The Mortgage Bankers Association on Wednesday said its weekly measure of the average contract rate on a 30-year, fixed-rate mortgage climbed to 3.64% in the week ended Jan. 14 from 3.52% a week earlier. That was the highest since March 2020 when the pandemic triggered a recession and drove borrowing costs to historic lows as the Fed cut its benchmark interest rate to near zero.
With inflation running at the highest rate in a generation and the job market near full employment, the Fed is now seen rapidly reining in the accommodation it put in place in the spring of 2020, and financial markets are frantically repricing for an initial rate hike by the central bank by mid-March. 
That reset has driven up the yields on the Treasury securities that influence mortgage rates, and home financing costs have followed suit: MBA's 30-year contract rate has climbed from 3.27% in mid-December.

The rate rise is crimping application volumes for mortgage refinancings, but appears to be helping to lift applications for home-purchase loans, which saw the largest increase in six months last week as prospective buyers looked to lock in rates that, while rising, are still historically low.
Overall loan application volumes rose 2.3% last week on the back of a 7.9% increase in loans to buy a home, while refinancing applications dropped 3.1% to their lowest level in more than two years.

568,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jan 18, 2022 06:54PM ET</span>",Australia Consumer Sentiment Slips in January on Omicron Surge,"(Bloomberg) -- Australian household sentiment dropped this month in response to a surge of coronavirus cases that exacerbated existing supply chain problems and prompted shoppers to turn more cautious.
The consumer confidence index fell 2% to 102.2 points in January,  Westpac Banking  (NYSE:WBK) Corp. said in a statement Wednesday. Optimists still outnumbered pessimists, with 100 points the dividing line between the two.
Westpac Chief Economist Bill Evans said the result was much better than the 17.7% collapse when the pandemic first hit in early 2020. Moreover, consumers in Australia’s two most populous states, which endured protracted lockdowns around mid-2021, seemed “less unsettled by the rapid spread of the omicron variant than those in states experiencing their first major wave of Covid infections,” he said.
The omicron outbreak is forcing supermarkets to impose purchase limits on products and  leaving firms struggling for staff as infected workers are forced to isolate. That’s likely to slow a recovery in the $1.5 trillion economy in the short-term at least, with a slew of growth forecast downgrades from economists. 
“The component detail shows increased concerns about the outlook for both the economy and family finances,” Evans said. “Consumers’ near-term expectations for the economy showed the biggest fall.” 
High frequency data from Australian banks have shown omicron variant kept shoppers at home during the Christmas holiday period.
Westpac’s survey showed consumers reported a significant improvement in their finances from a year ago, with the sub-index lifting 7.5% to a nine-month high of 95.6. That likely reflects a solid rebound in employment, wealth gains from a resurgent housing market and the accumulation of significant reserves due to high savings rates during lockdowns, according to the report.

The figures from national statistics agency INEGI showed that secondary activities, which include manufacturing, rose by 0.4% on the year in December, whereas tertiary activities, which comprise the service economy, contracted by 1.3%.
Mexican gross domestic product (GDP) contracted in the third quarter https://www.reuters.com/markets/us/mexican-economy-shrinks-more-than-expected-third-quarter-2021-11-25 of 2021, and the latest figures gave rise to estimates that the economy may have done the same in the October-December period, although the data are still incomplete.
The economy shrank in October from September and a preliminary estimate for November showed the economy barely grew in comparison to the same month in 2020. Complete data for November are due to be published by INEGI on Jan. 25.
Jonathan Heath, a board member of Mexico's central bank, said on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) that if the data already published are not revised, the Mexican economy may have contracted by 0.5% quarter-on-quarter during the final three months of last year.
Two consecutive quarters of contraction would mean that Mexico had entered a technical recession as 2021 closed out.

Mexico's recovery from the economic impact of the coronavirus pandemic has been significantly undermined by bottlenecks in global supply chains.
INEGI is due to publish a preliminary estimate for gross domestic product (GDP) in the fourth quarter on Jan. 31.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -Confidence among U.S. single-family homebuilders slipped in January after four straight monthly increases, and builders called for a new softwood lumber agreement with Canada to ease shortages and lower prices, a survey showed on Tuesday.
Other data showed factory activity in New York state slumped this month amid surging COVID-19 infections, but manufacturers remained upbeat about business conditions over the next six months. The reports supported views that the economy started the year on a soft note because of high inflation, shortages and raging coronavirus cases, driven by the Omicron variant.
""This is a reminder that COVID still holds sway over the recovery,"" said Oren Klachkin, lead U.S. economist at Oxford Economics in New York. ""U.S. supply chain dynamics didn't improve at the end of 2021, and early data suggest they've only worsened in 2022.""
The National Association of Home Builders/Wells Fargo Housing Market index dipped one point to 83 this month. A reading above 50 indicates that more builders view conditions as good than poor.
""NAHB analysis indicates the aggregate cost of residential construction materials has increased almost 19% since December 2021,"" NAHB Chairman Chuck Fowke said in a statement. ""Policymakers need to take action to fix supply chains. Obtaining a new softwood lumber agreement with Canada and reducing tariffs is an excellent place to start.""
According to the NAHB, higher material costs and shortages were adding weeks to typical single-family home construction times. The economy is struggling with high inflation, mostly the result of the pandemic, which has snarled supply chains.
The United States last November nearly doubled the duties on imported Canadian softwood lumber to 17.9% after a review of its anti-dumping and countervailing duty orders.
The Trump administration initially imposed 20% duties on Canadian softwood lumber in 2018 after the collapse of talks on a new quota arrangement, but reduced the level in December 2020 to 9%. President Joe Biden's administration had stuck to those duties until the Commerce Department's November review.
The NAHB survey was conducted during the first two weeks of January and does not fully reflect the recent jump in mortgage interest rates. The 30-year fixed-rate mortgage averaged 3.45% during the week ending Jan. 13, up from 3.22% in the prior week, according to data from mortgage finance agency  Freddie Mac  (OTC:FMCC).
More expensive building materials and higher mortgage rates could make housing less affordable, especially for lower-income groups and first-time home buyers.
The dollar was trading higher against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury yields rose, weighing on Wall Street stocks.
THE OMICRON EFFECT
The NAHB survey's measure of current sales conditions was steady at 90, but its gauge of sales expectations over the next six months dropped two points to 83. The component measuring traffic of prospective buyers also fell two points to 69.
A separate report from the New York Federal Reserve on Tuesday showed its ""Empire State"" index of current business conditions plunged 32.6 points to a reading of -0.7 this month. This was the first negative reading since June 2020.
A reading below zero signals a contraction in the New York manufacturing sector. New York has been slammed by a vicious winter wave of coronavirus infections which has severely disrupted business activity. The survey offered an early read of Omicron's impact on the economy. There are signs that infections have peaked in some regions, including New York.
""It is possible that the recent weakening is related to the surge in virus spread over the past several weeks and/or persisting supply issues and price pressures,"" said Daniel Silver, an economist at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) in New York. ""We will see if other January manufacturing surveys released this week and beyond reinforce the downbeat message from the Empire State survey.""
Manufacturers reported a sharp decline in orders. The survey's new orders index tumbled 32 points to a reading of -5.0. There were also decreases in shipments and unfilled orders measures, though not of the same magnitude as the plunge in new orders. Factories continued to wait long periods for supplies to be delivered, keeping prices elevated.

But manufacturers were generally optimistic about the outlook for the next six months. The index for future business conditions dipped 1.3 points to a reading of 35.1 this month. 
The capital expenditures index climbed two points to 39.7, a multi-year high, suggesting that firms plan significant increases in capital spending in the months ahead.

The Federal Reserve Bank of New York’s general business conditions index plummeted to minus 0.7 from 31.9 a month earlier, a report showed Monday. Figures below zero indicate contraction, and the reading was weaker than all estimates in a Bloomberg survey of economists.
The median projection called for a reading of 25. Responses were collected between Jan. 3 and Jan. 10, when infection rates were picking up.
The 32.6-point plunge in overall business conditions was the largest since April 2020 in the immediate aftermath of the pandemic. An index of new orders dropped 32.1 points in January to minus 5, while the shipments gauge slumped 26.1 points to 1. The average workweek and employment also showed a slower rate of expansion.
At the same time, the report showed manufacturers in the state remained upbeat about the outlook. The Fed’s measure of business conditions six months from now only eased 1.3 points to 35.1, reflecting a pickup in expected orders growth.
Capital Investment
The Fed’s capital expenditures index rose to the highest since 2006 and technology spending improved slightly, indicating firms plan large increases in investment in coming months.
The price outlook also firmed, with indexes of future prices paid and received climbing the highest in data back to 2001.
Meantime, the Fed bank’s gauge of current prices paid for materials eased to a still-elevated 76.7, while an index of prices received slipped 7.5 points to 37.1. A measure of delivery times also cooled.

573,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 18, 2022 08:06AM ET</span>",UK sees record job creation but inflation squeezes wages,"By David Milliken
LONDON (Reuters) -British employers hired a record number of staff last month and labour shortages deepened - increasing the chance that the Bank of England will raise interest rates again next month - but pay was squeezed by rapidly rising inflation.
Tuesday's data suggests the surge in cases of the Omicron variant of coronavirus in December did little to dent the resilience of Britain's job market. 
The figures are also unlikely to ease the BoE's concern that a rising inflation tide will be slow to ebb. Concern about possible labour shortages and pay pressures over the medium term was a major reason why the BoE raised interest rates last month for the first time since the start of the pandemic.
Financial markets see an 85% chance that the BoE will raise rates again on Feb. 3 after its next meeting, and 10-year government borrowing costs rose to a three-month high after the data. 
""Alongside rising headline inflation rates and growing evidence that Omicron's impact has been modest, a February rate rise from the Bank of England looks increasingly likely,"" ING economist James Smith said.
Employers added a record 184,000 staff to their payrolls in December, while the headline unemployment rate for the three months to November - which includes both self-employed and employed workers - dropped to 4.1%, its lowest since June 2020.
That said, some economists had doubts about the payrolls data, which often see big downward revisions. November's record reading of 257,000 was revised to 162,000 new hires on Tuesday.
Separate data showed that overall 600,000 fewer people were in employment in the three months to November compared with before the pandemic, mostly reflecting fewer over-50s in work.
More positively, the end of the government's furlough programme in September, when more than a million employees were still receiving some support, led to very few job losses. Redundancies in the three months to the end of November were the lowest on record, the Office for National Statistics said.
Job vacancies in the three months to December hit a record high of 1.247 million, more than double their level a year before.
PAY SAGS
However, pay growth slowed to its weakest in real terms since July 2020. After adjusting for inflation, average earnings excluding bonuses in the three months to November were no higher than the year before, a trend likely to intensify in 2022.
Prime Minister Boris Johnson's government is under pressure to address the cost-of-living squeeze and is considering ways of softening a possible 50% leap in domestic energy bills in April.
Finance minister Rishi Sunak, speaking to reporters after the data, said high inflation was a global problem driven by energy prices and problems with supply chains, but an increase to the minimum wage would help many employees.
Looking at November alone - which many economists prefer as it gives timelier data but which the ONS discourages due to volatility in the figures - inflation-adjusted pay dropped by 1.0%. 
""While some are seeing wage rises in sectors facing shortages, many workers are stuck on low wages at a time when we are seeing cost of living pressures increase significantly,"" said Ben Harrison, director of the Work Foundation think tank.
Inflation hit a 10-year high of 5.1% in November and cost-of-living concerns look set to dominate 2022. The BoE forecasts inflation will peak at a 30-year high of around 6% in April, when regulated household energy bills are due to jump by 50%.

The weakness in real earnings comes despite headline average earnings in the three months to November being 4.2% higher than a year earlier. That is a high rate compared with before the pandemic when pay growth was mostly in the 2-3% range, and it is a pace which makes the BoE uncomfortable, given weak underlying productivity growth.
Moreover, the ONS said factors which earlier in the year distorted headline pay growth, causing it to appear artificially high, had now largely dissipated.

BERLIN (Reuters) -German investor sentiment hit its highest in six months in January on expectations the incidence of COVID-19 cases will fall by early summer, allowing growth in Europe's largest economy to pick up in the coming six months, a survey showed.
The ZEW economic research institute said on Tuesday its economic sentiment index rose to 51.7 from 29.9 points in December. A Reuters poll had pointed to a rise to 32.0.
""The economic outlook has improved considerably with the start of the new year. The majority of financial market experts assume that economic growth will pick up in the coming six months,"" ZEW President Achim Wambach said in a statement.
""It is likely that the phase of economic weakness from the fourth quarter of 2021 will soon be overcome. The main reason for this is the assumption that the incidence of COVID-19 cases will fall significantly by early summer.""
The German economy failed to return to its pre-pandemic size in 2021 as microchip shortages hit production in the car industry, and further COVID-19 restrictions slowed the recovery in the final months of the year.
Last week, Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) Group posted its lowest annual sales figures in 10 years at 8.9 million deliveries, and said it expected supply chain conditions to remain volatile in the first half of this year. [nL8N2TS1OZ]
Thomas Gitzel, economist at VP Bank, said there was reason to hope the economy would pick up. ""Once raw materials and supplies are available again in sufficient quantities and the infection situation recedes, the German economy will pull up strongly,"" he said
Health officials say the coronavirus remains a serious threat, however.
Germany has a relatively low vaccination rate compared to neighbouring countries, with 47.6% of the population having had a booster shot.
Germany's BDI industry association said last Thursday it expected the economy to grow 3.5% this year, warning companies could face another ""stop-and-go year"" due to the pandemic.
The government, in estimates published in October, predicted growth of 4.1%, up from 2.7% in 2021.

The BDI said the Omicron coronavirus variant was clouding the outlook, with Germany in particular being exposed to the risk of China, its biggest trading partner, becoming paralysed again if authorities stuck to a ""zero COVID"" lockdown response to a rise in cases.
A ZEW index for current conditions fell to -10.2 points from -7.4. The consensus forecast was for a reading of -8.5.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australian consumer confidence took a battering last week as an explosion in coronavirus cases triggered self-imposed lockdowns, squashing spending and blowing holes in supply chains.
A survey from ANZ out on Tuesday showed its measure of consumer sentiment slid 7.6% last week to its lowest since October 2020, lower even than during the Delta variant surge when much of the country was officially locked down.
This time, the government has vowed to keep restrictions light, arguing that over-90% vaccination rates can ensure the economy remains open.
However, record numbers of new cases and rising deaths have seen households sharply limit their movements and spending on services, while the need for isolation has taken many thousands of workers out of essential jobs.
""We don't think the economy is as weak as these data might suggest, with the shock of the Omicron surge and strains on testing capability the key drivers of the fall rather than underlying economic conditions,"" said David Plank, ANZ's head of Australian economics.
""But the result highlights that concerns about COVID have the potential to significantly impact the economy if they linger.""
The survey made for grim reading with measures for respondents' current financial conditions diving 11.3% and for economic conditions down 7.6%. In a gloomy omen for retailers, the index of whether it was a good time to buy a major household item sank 11.4% to its lowest since August 2020.
Gareth Aird, CBA's head of Australian economics, estimated the outbreak could shave more than 1% off gross domestic product growth, and cut his forecast for the March quarter to 1.0% from 2.3% previously.

""The next few months are without a shred of doubt going to be difficult and testing for the economy,"" said Aird.
""But the rapid spread of COVID now may see us reach herd immunity by the middle of the year, and economic activity and hours worked should snap back in the June quarter.""

A net 28.0% of firms surveyed expected general business conditions to deteriorate compared with 11% pessimism in the previous quarter, the New Zealand Institute of Economic Research's (NZIER) quarterly survey of business opinion (QSBO) showed.
On a seasonally adjusted basis, 34.0% expected business conditions to worsen, versus 11.0% pessimism recorded in the previous period. The survey's measure of capacity utilisation dipped to 89.5%, from the previous quarter's 96.1%.
Acute labour shortages triggered by pandemic restrictions are underpinning a lift in wage growth and this is contributing to higher costs for business, NZIER said in its report. 
A net 61% reported increased costs in the December quarter, the highest level since June 2008, it said.

Inflation pressures are accelerating, the report said, suggesting a continued tightening of monetary policy by the central bank.
New Zealand's central bank raised interest rates for the second straight month in November to keep surging consumer prices in check and warned of more hikes.

GENEVA (Reuters) -The global job market will take longer to recover than previously thought, with unemployment set to remain above pre-COVID-19 levels until at least 2023 due to uncertainty about the pandemic's course and duration, the International Labour Organization said in a report on Monday.
The U.N. agency estimates the equivalent of around 52 million fewer jobs in 2022 versus pre-COVID levels, which amounts to about double its previous estimate from June 2021.
Disruptions are set to continue into 2023 when there will still be around 27 million fewer jobs, it said, warning of a ""slow and uncertain"" recovery in its World Employment and Social Outlook report for 2022.
""The global labour market outlook has deteriorated since the ILO's last projections; a return to pre-pandemic performance is likely to remain elusive for much of the world over the coming years,"" the report said.
Director-General Guy Ryder told journalists that there were numerous factors behind its revision, saying the ""primary one is the continuing pandemic and its variants, notably Omicron.""
The speed of recovery varies across regions, with the European and North American regions showing the most encouraging signs and Southeast Asia and South America lagging behind, according to the report. 
Still, the projected deficit in working hours this year represents an improvement over the past two years. In 2021, the ILO estimates there were some 125 million fewer jobs than pre-pandemic levels and in 2020, 258 million fewer.
Overall, around 207 million people are estimated to be unemployed in 2022. However, the report said that the impact would be significantly greater since many people have left the labour force and have yet to return.
Among those are a high number of women https://www.reuters.com/markets/funds/gender-equality-takes-one-step-forward-three-back-during-covid-2021-12-02, often because they have been drawn into unpaid work at home such as teaching children during school closures or caring for sick family members. 
The report predicted that the disproportionate impact of the pandemic on women's employment would narrow in the coming years but that a ""sizeable gap"" would remain.
""There are some anecdotal indications that they are not coming back in the same numbers and in the same portions as men are doing which would lead to concerns that a 'Long COVID' effect on gender at work would be a negative one,"" said Ryder.

Others who have left the workforce have done so voluntarily as part of a phenomenon some economists call ""the great resignation"". Ryder said this appeared to be more prominent in areas of the economy such as health and care giving.
""We do need to look again and to invest further in those areas of economic activity,"" he said.

JAKARTA (Reuters) - Indonesia's trade surplus narrowed more than expected in December to $1.02 billion, the lowest in 20 months, as a surge in exports driven by commodities slowed and imports hit a record high, official data showed on Monday.
Southeast Asia's largest economy has been reporting a trade surplus every month since May, 2020, as the coronavirus pandemic supressed local demand while exports rode a boom in prices of commodities like coal, palm oil, copper, tin, steel and rubber.
The December surplus was about a third of the $3.13 billion forecast by economists polled by Reuters and was also much smaller than the $3.51 billion recorded in November.
December imports hit a record high of $21.36 billion, up 47.93% on a yearly basis and beating the poll's forecast for 39.40% growth, as overseas purchases of everything from consumer goods to raw materials for the manufacturing industry jumped.
""This shows that economic activity is improving ... including consumption,"" Margo Yuwono, the head of Statistics Indonesia, told a news conference. 
Meanwhile, export growth was 35.30% on a yearly basis compared with the poll's expectation of 40.40% growth, with shipments of coal to China slowing as Beijing ramped up domestic output of the fuel.
The resource-rich country's total shipments in December were worth $22.38 billion, the second highest on record for monthly data after November's $22.84 billion.
Economists have warned that a ban on coal exports, implemented since Jan. 1 to avoid widespread domestic power outages, could shift Indonesia's trade balance to a deficit. Coal exports make up about 14% of Indonesia's overall exports.
The ban has been eased for big miners that have met domestic sales requirements, but is still affecting smaller miners whose output accounts for up to 40% of Indonesia's total.

For the whole of 2021, Indonesia's exports reached a record high of $231.54 billion, while imports totalled $196.2 billion.
The 2021 trade surplus of $35.34 billion was the biggest since 2007.

Data released earlier in the day showed that the GDP grew 4% year-on-year in the fourth quarter. Forecasts prepared by Investing.com predicted a growth of 3.6% while a growth of 4.9% was recorded in the third quarter.
The GDP also grew 1.6% quarter-on-quarter. Forecasts prepared by Investing.com predicted a growth of 1.1% while a growth of 0.2% was recorded in the third quarter.
The world’s second-largest economy is facing headwinds in 2022 as outbreaks involving the omicron COVID-19 variant continue to pop up throughout the country. Electricity shortages and property sector default also contributed to the slower economy.
“Growth will continue to be weighed down by the property sector and of course, the zero-Covid policy that China is going to continue with,” Oxford Economics lead Asia economist Sian Fenner told Bloomberg.
Meanwhile, industrial production grew 4.3% year-on-year in December, compared to the growth of 3.6% in forecasts prepared by Investing.com and November‘s growth of 3.8%.
Industrial output sped up in December but is set to weaken in January, with restrictive measures still in place in many cities ahead of the Lunar New Year holiday. Production curbs on heavy industries in China ahead of the Beijing Winter Olympic Games could also contribute to the weakening.
Retail sales grew 1.7% year-on-year in December, compared to a growth of 3.7% predicted by Investing.com, and the growth of 3.9% recorded in November. Consumer spending fell in December as the government tightened measures in several parts of the country, including the cities of Xi’an and Tianjin.
“Retail sales numbers are still quite telling that the zero-Covid policy is still wearing on consumers, and we haven’t seen the recovery that we’ve been seeing in the industrial sector,” said Oxford Economics’ Fenner.
The unemployment rate was at 5.1% while the 5.0% was recorded in November.
Meanwhile, PBOC lowered the rate on its one-year policy loans by 10 basis points to 2.85%, the first cut since April 2020, as the property market slump and COVID-19 outbreaks dampened economic growth.

China’s Economic Growth Slowed, Prompting Interest Rate Cut (10 a.m. HK)
China’s economic growth weakened last quarter in the face of slow private spending, a property market crisis and virus outbreaks.

China lowered a key interest rate for the first time since the peak of the pandemic in 2020 as a property-market slump and repeated virus outbreaks dampened the nation’s growth outlook.
The People’s Bank of China cut the rate on its one-year policy loans by 10 basis points to 2.85%. That’s the first reduction since April 2020. It also slashed the rate on the seven-day reverse repurchase agreements by the same magnitude to 2.1%.
Goldman Favors Macau Gaming in Asia HY, Advises Diversification (9:25 a.m. HK)
Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) prefers Macau gaming and “non-China property B rated corporates” in Asia high-yield credit, recommending that investors stay cautious and diversified among better quality developers.   
Increasing stress levels in China’s high yield property sector suggest policy easing measures have so far been “insufficient to stabilize credit flow to developers,” analysts Kenneth Ho and Chakki Ting wrote in a report dated Friday. 
China’s Property Crisis Reaches Biggest Builder Country Garden (7:47 a.m. HK)
Country Garden’s shares and bonds were hammered last week on concerns about confidence. The company is one of the few remaining large, better-quality private developers that had been largely unscathed by the liquidity crunch, even as peers such as Shimao Group Holdings Ltd. saw dramatic reversals in their credit ratings.
 
The firm is viewed as a bellwether for contagion risk, as unprecedented levels of stress in the offshore credit market threaten to drag good credits down with bad. With more than 3,000 housing projects located in almost every province in China, Country Garden’s financial health has immense economic and social consequences. 
If Country Garden starts showing signs of stress, it will severely damage already fragile investor and homebuyer confidence, posing threats to China’s economy and even social stability.

For Chinese developers, a turn of the calendar page hasn’t turned around their fortunes. Their dollar bonds have declined to new lows. It’s only mid-January, and Goldman Sachs has already raised its default forecasts for the year. 
Strategists Kenneth Ho and Chakki Ting say stresses are piling up after the pick-up in proposals for bond exchanges or maturity extensions. They now expect a 19% default rate for high-yield developers, up from a previous estimate of 11.5%.
China Home Market Slump Deepens as Prices Fall for Fourth Month (7 a.m. HK) 
New home prices in 70 cities, excluding state-subsidized housing, slid 0.28% last month from November, when they dropped 0.33%, National Bureau of Statistics figures showed Saturday. Falling prices may dissuade homebuyers concerned about the value of their assets, making it harder for developers to sell properties and generate much needed cash. 
Recent moves by authorities to ease some of the restrictions on real-estate funding have done little to boost the market. Home loan demand stayed weak in December, with households’ mid- and long-term loans, a proxy for mortgages, increasing the least since February 2020. Year-end sales campaigns by developers added to downward pressure on prices.

581,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 16, 2022 08:25PM ET</span>","Japan machinery orders rise more than expected, govt welcomes pick-up signs","By Daniel Leussink
TOKYO (Reuters) -Japan's core machinery orders rose for a second straight month in November, government data showed on Monday, a sign that corporate appetite for capital spending remained resilient despite pressure from soaring raw material prices.
The gain in core orders, a key indicator of capital expenditure, could be a relief to policymakers hoping for corporate investment to trigger a private demand-led recovery in the world's third-largest economy.
Core orders, a highly volatile data series regarded as an indicator of capital spending in the coming six to nine months, grew 3.4% in November from October, rising for the second straight month, the Cabinet Office data showed.
It beat economists' median estimate of a 1.4% rise and followed a 3.8% jump in the previous month.
However, Japanese firms could be cautious about boosting spending due to higher raw material, fuel and transportation costs that are sending wholesale inflation soaring and squeezing corporate margins.
""Firms may postpone capital spending from this quarter into the next fiscal year from April as uncertainty in the global economy has risen,"" said Takeshi Minami, chief economist at Norinchukin Research Institute.
""Due to a decline in coronavirus cases and an easing of the (global) chip shortage, orders from manufacturers recovered up to November, but the outlook is unclear.""
A government official confirmed firms' appetite for capital spending faced risks from rising raw material prices, though he added companies were still likely to spend on investments to strengthen their businesses for the future.
Compared with a year earlier, core orders, which exclude volatile numbers from shipping and electric power utilities, jumped 11.6% in November, the Cabinet office data found.
By sector, orders from manufacturers rose 12.9% month-on-month, offsetting a 0.8% drop in those from non-manufacturers, the data showed.
The government raised its assessment on machinery orders for the first time in six months, saying they showed signs of picking up. Previously, it said a pick-up in orders was showing signs of stalling.

After contracting in the third quarter of last year, Japan's economy is expected to return to growth in the October-December quarter.
The economy is forecast to show growth of an annualised 6.5% in that quarter, thanks largely to a projected pick-up in private consumption, which makes up more than half the economy, after an easing of coronavirus curbs.

Only 2% of the companies which took part in a MakeUK survey have frozen pay this year, way down from around a third of them a year ago. 
Most pay increases ranged between 2% and 3%, below the recent pace of inflation, but went as high as 14% in some cases.
However, around 45% of companies said they had yet to agree a pay deal, up from about 30% this time last year.
The Bank of England is keeping a close eye on the impact of rising inflation on pay deals, something it fears could lead to longer-term inflationary pressures. The BoE thinks inflation will hit a 30-year high of 6% in April when higher social security contributions are due to kick in.
Verity Davidge, the association's director of policy, said the outlook for pay among manufacturers compared starkly with a year earlier, when many companies froze or deferred deals as the country headed back into lockdown due to the pandemic.
Some companies felt the need to reward staff and others were trying to attract and retain key skills, Davidge said.

""As a result, the picture this year for manufacturers agreeing pay settlements is far more complex,"" she said.
The survey of 152 firms was carried out in December.

Property website Rightmove (OTC:RTMVY) said on Monday that the average price of property put up for sale rose by 0.3% in January, taking the 12-month increase to 7.6%, the highest annual rate of price growth since May 2016.
The number of buyers enquiring about homes was 15% higher than at the same time last year but the number of available homes for sale per estate agency branch sank to a new record low of just 12, Rightmove said.
There were signs of more properties hitting the market as the first working week of 2022 was the busiest start of a year on record for people asking agents to value their homes.
Britain's housing market boomed after the lifting of the first coronavirus lockdown in 2020, helped by a now-expired tax break offered by finance minister Rishi Sunak and longer-lasting demand for bigger properties among people working from home.

Tim Bannister, Rightmove's director of property data, said asking prices were within 1% of last October's record high and were the highest ever recorded for homes typically sought by first-time buyers.
""All of the signs suggest that prices are likely to continue to rise until more choice is available,"" Bannister said.

In November of 2020, the economy of the world's second largest copper producer fell by 2.08%, when Peru was still feeling the ravages of a coronavirus lockdown.
In 2021, some mining operations were severely disrupted by protests by citizens who claimed that the communities near the mines were suffering environmental damages while not benefiting sufficiently from the sector.
The official INEI statistics agency said in a statement that the economy grew 14.68% in the first 11 months of 2021.

The mining and hydrocarbons sector, key to Peru's economy because it represents 60% of its exports, fell by 5.29% year-on-year in November, basically due to lower production of copper, zinc, iron and lead, the statistics agency said.
Peru's economy sank 11.1% in 2020, one of the worst contractions in Latin America due to tight restrictions aimed at combating the pandemic. In full-year 2021, the economy grew 13.2%, according to official estimates.

Average new home prices in China's 70 major cities declined 0.2% in December from a month earlier, slower than a 0.3% drop in November, according to Reuters calculations from data released by the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS).
China's property market has slowed since June 2021 as regulators stepped up their deleveraging campaign against the bloated sector, triggering defaults at some heavily indebted companies.
But the decline moderated as authorities and property developers in multiple cities introduced measures in December to boost home sales, with local governments providing subsidies for buyers and real estate firms offering discounts.
Monthly prices picked up in 15 of 70 cities, up from nine cities that reported price gains in November.
""The property market is gradually bottoming out with the period of tightest credit over,"" said Zhang Dawei, chief analyst at property agency Centaline. First- and second-tier cities will be the first to emerge from the downturn, he said. 
New home prices rose 2.6% year-on-year in December, slower than the 3.0% growth recorded in November.
In a recent note, Oxford Economics analysts said they expect central and local authorities to take steps to contain risks from defaults by property developers, such as increasing credit to the sector and tweaking the strict ""three red lines"" policy introduced to curb borrowing by developers.
A payment extension granted by bondholders to beleaguered developer China Evergrande Group came as authorities increasingly emphasise the need to maintain economic stability.

Yan Yuejin, research director of Shanghai-based E-house China Research and Development Institute said he expects property policies to continue to ease in the first quarter given the large economic impact of the real estate market.
""The December data is a positive sign, pointing to home prices not falling further.""

The National Retail Federation (NRF) said holiday sales, including e-commerce, jumped 14.1% during November and December, exceeding its latest forecast of a rise of as much as 11.5%.
""Despite supply chain problems, rising inflation, labor shortages and the Omicron variant, retailers delivered a positive holiday experience to pandemic-fatigued consumers and their families,"" NRF Chief Executive Officer Matthew Shay said in a statement.
With higher wages, and better household savings from stimulus checks and reduced spending on outdoor activities, U.S shoppers opened up their wallets to everything from apparel and sporting goods to furniture and electronics.
E-commerce and non-store sales jumped 11.3% over the holiday season, NRF data showed.
The make-or-break shopping season was marked by pandemic-induced shipping delays and product shortages. Some retailers such as Walmart (NYSE:WMT) and  Target  (NYSE:TGT) re-rerouted goods to less congested ports and even chartered their own vessels for deliveries.
Retailers' efforts to stock up early on helped drive 2021 holiday sales ""because even though Omicron impacted consumers' mobility in December, they had started shopping well before,"" RSM US analyst Mike Graziano said.
The Omicron-led surge in coronavirus cases at the end of the year led to a 2.7% decline in retail sales in December, which excludes automobile dealers, gas stations and restaurants, according to NRF data.

Some apparel retailers including Abercrombie & Fitch and  Lululemon Athletica  (NASDAQ:LULU) have already flagged dull holiday-quarter businesses, hit by Omicron-driven staffing shortages and a decline in store traffic.
Even though inflation and COVID-19 did not dampen holiday sales last year, the NRF said retailers should be prepared for challenges in the coming months due to pandemic-led uncertainty.

588,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 14, 2022 12:56PM ET</span>",Early holiday shopping hammers U.S. retail sales; Omicron drag anticipated in January,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. retail sales dropped by the most in 10 months in December, likely the result of Americans starting their holiday shopping in October to avoid empty shelves at stores.
Economists cautioned against reading the unexpected plunge in retail sales last month reported by the Commerce Department on Friday as a sign of weakness. Consumer spending remains underpinned by huge savings, rising wages as companies scramble for scarce workers as well as soaring household wealth.
Still, the report and news of an unexpected decline in production at factories in December suggested the economy lost momentum at the end of 2021. That trend likely persisted into January amid spiraling COVID-19 infections, driven by the Omicron variant, which have disrupted businesses and schooling.
""It is clear that most shoppers heeded the advice to get holiday shopping done early and that, combined with a massive surge in goods spending earlier in the year, conspired to pull sales sharply lower to end the year,"" said Tim Quinlan, a senior economist at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) in Charlotte, North Carolina. 
Retail sales fell 1.9% last month, the largest decline since February 2021, after rising 0.2% in November. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast retail sales unchanged. Estimates ranged from as low as a drop of 2.0% to as high as a 0.8% increase.
Retail sales, which are mostly goods, increased 16.9% year-on-year in December. Unadjusted sales rose 10.0% last month. 
Sales could weaken further in January as Omicron limits consumer traffic to places like restaurants and bars, though some economists expect goods spending to increase as people stay at home. Retail sales are 19.2% above their pre-pandemic level. Holiday sales surged 14.1% to a record $886.7 billion in 2021, according to the National Retail Federation. 
Bottlenecks in the supply chains caused by the pandemic have led to shortages of goods. The pulling forward of sales from December also likely impacted the so-called seasonal factor, the model that the government uses to strip out seasonal fluctuations from the data. 
""We do not, therefore, believe that December was a weakening demand story or more cautious behavior by consumers,"" said Conrad DeQuadros, senior economic advisor at Brean Capital in New York. 
The online sales category was hardest hit by the drag from the seasonal factor, plunging 8.7%. Receipts at auto dealerships slipped 0.4%. Automobiles remain scarce because of a global semiconductor shortage. 
Motor vehicles could remain in short supply for while. A separate report from the Federal Reserve on Friday showed a 1.3% drop in production at motor vehicle plants helped to pull down manufacturing output 0.3% in December. 
Production at factories increased 0.6% in November. Economists had expected output to rise 0.5%.
The Fed is still expected to start raising interest rates in March, against the backdrop of high inflation.
""We do not think today's reading will have a significant impact on the Fed's decision to liftoff rates, likely in March, which will depend more heavily on inflation than activity data,"" said Andrew Hollenhorst, chief economist at  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) in New York. ""The seasonal adjustment factor turns highly positive in January suggesting that online sales and overall retail sales will bounce back strongly.""

Sales at electronics and appliance stores dropped 2.9%. Receipts at service stations fell 0.7% as gasoline prices retreated from higher levels seen in the prior months. Sales at food and beverage stores fell 0.5%. Sales at clothing stores declined 3.1%. There were also decreases is sales at sporting goods, hobby, musical instrument and book stores. 
Furniture store sales tumbled 5.5%, while receipts at electronics and appliance stores plunged 2.9%. But sales at building material and garden equipment suppliers rose 0.9%. 
Receipts at restaurants and bars decreased 0.8%. Restaurants and bars are the only services category in the retail sales report. These sales were up 41.3% from last December.
Excluding automobiles, gasoline, building materials and food services, retail sales plunged 3.1%. That was also the biggest drop since last February. Data for November was revised lower to show these so-called core retail sales falling 0.5% instead of dipping 0.1% as previously reported.
Core retail sales correspond most closely with the consumer spending component of gross domestic product. Economists lowered their fourth-quarter consumer spending forecasts after the data.
December's weakness puts consumer spending on a lower growth trajectory heading into the first quarter. Concerns about inflation could also restrain spending. Consumer sentiment fell to the second-lowest level in a decade in early January, a survey from the University of Michigan showed. 
GDP growth estimates for the fourth quarter remained bullish, thanks to rising inventory accumulation. A fourth report from the Commerce Department showed business inventories increased a strong 1.3% in November.

Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) trimmed its growth estimate by half-a-percentage point to a 6.5% annualized rate. The economy grew at a 2.3% pace in the third quarter. Growth last year is expected to have been the strongest since 1984.
""Consumer spending will remain the cornerstone of economic growth this year but the near-term path will be choppy amid surging Omicron cases and elevated inflation,"" said Lydia Boussour, lead U.S. economist at Oxford Economics in New York. ""Overall, the combination of strong labor income growth, elevated excess savings and healthy balance sheets will support above-trend consumption growth this year of 4%.""

Business inventories rose 1.3% after a similar gain in October, the Commerce Department said on Friday. Inventories are a key component of gross domestic product. November's increase was in line with economists' expectations.
Inventories increased 8.7% on a year-on-year basis in November.
Retail inventories accelerated 2.0% in November as estimated in an advance report published last month. That followed a 0.3% rise in October. Motor vehicle inventories rebounded 4.2% instead of 4.1% as estimated last month.
That surge suggested the global shortage of semiconductors, which has constrained motor vehicle production, was abating.
An Institute for Supply Management survey last week showed improved supplier deliveries to factories in December. But there are worries that a global surge in COVID-19 cases, driven by the Omicron variant, could slow the untangling of supply chains. 
Retail inventories excluding autos, which go into the calculation of GDP, shot up 1.3% as estimated last month.
A slower pace of inventory drawdown in the third quarter accounted for the bulk of the 2.3% pace of increase in GDP growth for that period. Inventories were depleted through much of 2021, and coronavirus pandemic-related shortages are making it harder to replenish stocks. Restocking is keeping manufacturing humming and supporting the overall economy. 

Wholesale inventories increased 1.4% in November. Stocks at manufacturers rose 0.7%.
Business sales increased 0.7% in November after rising 2.2% in October. At November's sales pace, it would take 1.25 months for businesses to clear shelves, up from 1.24 months in October.

The University of Michigan said its preliminary consumer sentiment index fell to 68.8 in the first half of this month from a final reading of 70.6 in December.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the index would decline to 70.0.
Americans have been buffeted by various headwinds despite an overall strong economy, with inflation topping the list of concerns. 
At a current annual rate of 7.0%, inflation is near a 40-year-high, outstripping wage gains. Consumer price increases have broadened from a handful of pandemic-sensitive categories while supply chain disruptions have continued.
The current inflation readings have bolstered expectations that the Federal Reserve will start raising interest rates in March as it seeks to bring down the rate of price increases closer to its 2% flexible target.
The last few weeks have also seen a surge in COVID-19 cases due to the highly transmissible Omicron variant, which has exacerbated labor shortages as the United States nears maximum employment.
""While the Delta and Omicron variants certainly contributed to this downward shift, the decline was also due to an escalating inflation rate,"" Richard Curtin, the survey director, said in a statement. 

""Three-quarters of consumers in early January ranked inflation, compared with unemployment, as the more serious problem facing the nation,"" he added.
Economic growth is still expected to have grown last year at its fastest pace in almost four decades after falling into a brief recession in 2020 caused by the coronavirus pandemic.

Manufacturing output dropped 0.3% last month after increasing 0.6% in November, the Federal Reserve said on Friday. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast factory production rising 0.5%. Output increased 3.5% compared to December 2020.
Manufacturing, which accounts for 11.9% of the U.S. economy, remains supported by lean inventories at businesses as demand for goods remains strong. But COVID-19 and the recovery from the pandemic have overstretched supply chains, igniting inflation. 
Manufacturing production increased at a 4.9% annualized rate in the fourth quarter after rising at a 4.0% rate in the July-September quarter.
Production at auto plants dropped 1.3% last month after rising 1.7% in November. Motor vehicle output is about 6% below its year-earlier level. 
Last month's decline in manufacturing output combined with a 1.5% decline in utilities to push industrial production down 0.1%. That followed a 0.7% gain in November. Utilities were undercut by unseasonably warm weather in December, which lessened demand for heating.
Mining production rose 2.0%. Industrial production grew at a 4.0% rate in the fourth quarter. That followed a 3.5% pace of increase in the third quarter.

Capacity utilization for the manufacturing sector, a measure of how fully firms are using their resources, decreased 0.2 percentage point to 77.0% in December. Overall capacity use for the industrial sector slipped 0.1 percentage point to 76.5% last month. It is 3.1 percentage points below its 1972-2020 average.
Officials at the Fed tend to look at capacity use measures for signals of how much ""slack"" remains in the economy — how far growth has room to run before it becomes inflationary.

BERLIN (Reuters) -The German economy failed to return to its pre-pandemic size in 2021 as microchip shortages hit production in the car industry and further COVID-19 restrictions slowed down the recovery of Europe's largest economy in the final months of the year.
Gross domestic product grew 2.7% in 2021 after plunging 4.6% in the first coronavirus crisis year 2020, preliminary figures from the Federal Statistics Office showed on Friday.
The figures, which were in line with analysts' forecasts in a Reuters poll, mean that Germany's economic output was still some 2% below the pre-crisis 2019 level, the office said.
The world's fourth-biggest economy shrank in the final three months of 2021 after growing in the previous two quarters as resurgent coronavirus infections led to renewed restrictions in retail and hospitality, the office said.
An early estimate pointed to a fourth-quarter contraction between 0.5% and 1.0% quarter-on-quarter, a spokesperson added.
The main growth drivers in 2021 were a jump in exports and massive public spending to cushion the impact of the pandemic, the office said.
However, the development and domestic production of a groundbreaking COVID-19 vaccine by German start-up BioNTech also boosted growth considerably, a statistics office spokesman said, without quantifying the impact.
Economic institutes have estimated that BioNTech alone added 0.5% to Germany's economic output last year, which would account for nearly a fifth of the overall expansion.
""I can't think of another single German company that has ever contributed so much to overall economic growth,"" said Sebastian Dullien from the macroeconomic policy institute IMK.
Germany increased net new borrowing to a record 215 billion euros ($245.87 billion) last year following an unprecedented sum of 130 billion euros in 2020 to fund the fight against COVID.
The public sector deficit of all state levels rose to 153.9 billion euros or 4.3% of economic output.
The economy ministry said in its monthly report that ongoing supply bottlenecks for important primary products in manufacturing were likely to persist for a while.

Most economists expect the German economy to shrink again in the first three months of 2022, driving it into another technical recession, defined as two consecutive quarters of contraction, after the economy shrank in the first two quarters of 2020.

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's economy grew strongly in November to finally surpass its size just before the country went into its first COVID-19 lockdown, official data showed on Friday.
The world's fifth-biggest economy expanded by a much faster than expected 0.9% in November - before the latest wave of COVID-19 infections and restrictions for many firms - leaving it 0.7% bigger than it was in February 2020, the ONS said.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast monthly gross domestic product growth of 0.4% for November.
""It's amazing to see the size of the economy back to pre-pandemic levels in November – a testament to the grit and determination of the British people,"" finance minister Rishi Sunak said.
Other economies have already recovered their pre-COVID size, chief among them the United States.
Britain's economy shrank by more than 9% in 2020, one of the biggest pandemic slumps among the world's rich nations.
Despite November's growth acceleration, GDP probably took a fresh hit in December when the Omicron coronavirus variant swept Europe, and the loss of momentum is likely to have stretched into January with many firms reporting severe staff absences and consumers still wary of going out.
On Thursday, data showed record levels of staff absence due to COVID-19 around the turn of the year.
But health officials think the Omicron infections wave has now peaked in Britain and analysts say the blow to the economy is likely to be short-lived, allowing the Bank of England to continue raising interest rates this year.
The ONS said, data revisions aside, GDP in quarterly terms would reach or surpass its pre-coronavirus level in the October-December period of 2021, as long as economic output does not fall by more than 0.2% in December.
The BoE's current forecasts show GDP returning to its size at the end of 2019 in the first quarter of 2022.
EARLY CHRISTMAS SHOPPERS, MASS JABS
The ONS said retailers had a strong November - when many consumers bought Christmas presents earlier than usual - while architects, couriers and accountants also had a bumper month.
Construction recovered from several weak months as raw materials became easier to source after problems in global supply chains.
The country's rush to give booster vaccinations against COVID-19 and its test-and-trace programme provided extra momentum to the GDP figures.
Britain's economy will still face challenges in the months ahead, even once coronavirus restrictions known as ""plan B"" are relaxed.
Consumers are facing an inflation rate that is expected to reach a 30-year high of 6% or more in April - when energy tariffs will leap by an estimated 50% - and an increase in social security contributions also starting that month.
""While the UK economy should rebound once Plan B measures are lifted, surging inflation and persistent supply chain disruption may mean that the UK's economic growth prospects remain under pressure for much of 2022,"" Suren Thiru, head of economics at the British Chambers of Commerce, said.
Sterling edged up against the U.S. dollar and the euro after the GDP data.
Separately, the ONS released trade data showing that Britain's goods trade deficit narrowed slightly to 11.3 billion pounds in November from 11.8 billion pounds in October.

Imports from non-European Union countries were higher than from EU countries for the 11th consecutive month, and the gap was at its widest point of the year, the ONS said.
Britain's trading relationship with the EU has been hit by the introduction of new post-Brexit rules after the country left the bloc's single market at the start of 2021.

Economists polled by Reuters had forecast import prices, which exclude tariffs, gaining 0.3%.
The government reported on Thursday that producer prices rose just 0.2% in December, the smallest increase since November 2020. Hopes that inflation has peaked or is close to doing so where boosted by a moderation in China's producer prices in December. Economists expect slower Chinese PPI will eventually show up in the U.S. prices. Supply chains are also improving.

The value of overall purchases decreased 1.9%, after a revised 0.2% gain a month earlier, Commerce Department figures showed Friday. The figures aren’t adjusted for inflation, suggesting price-adjusted receipts were even weaker than the headline number.
The median estimate in a Bloomberg survey called for a 0.1% drop in overall retail sales from the prior month.
The year-end slide in retail purchases sets up for a tepid handoff to the first quarter. Combined with the impact from the omicron variant, which is denting outlays for services such as travel and dining out, the figures help explain why economists project household spending to soften.
Furthermore, falling price-adjusted wages, dwindling savings and the end of the government’s pandemic-related financial programs suggest a more moderate pace of spending.

The seasonally adjusted monthly increase of 0.6% in November from October beat the median forecast of a 0.2% decline in a Reuters poll of economists. 
Government statistics agency IBGE also revised October's indicator to a 0.2% rise from a previously reported 0.1% drop. 
IBGE said month-on-month sales plunged in five of the eight categories surveyed in November. The general result, however, was lifted by growth in sales of hypermarkets, supermarkets, food products, beverages and tobacco, up 0.9% from the previous month.
On a year-on-year basis, the 4.2% fall in November was smaller than the 6.5% slump forecast in the poll.
Retail sales were up 1.9% from the January-November period last year, posting the same growth in the 12 months through November, and slowing down from the 2.6% advance in the 12 months through October, which indicates a weaker pace of sales, IBGE said.
On a wider basis, including cars and building materials, retail sales in November rose 0.5% from the previous month, marking the first rise after three consecutive drops, said IBGE. So far this year, the increase on the same basis was of 5.3%. 

Brazil's annual inflation hit a six-year high of over 10% in 2021, pushing the central bank into one of the most aggressive rate hike cycles in the world last year. In December, the monetary authority lifted its benchmark interest rate to 9.25% from 2% in March and signaled more tightening for this year.
Analysts have said higher prices and borrowing costs will chill consumer spending, helping to slow down Latin America's biggest economy in 2022.

The trade surplus rose to $94.46 billion in December, the highest since records started in August 1994. That was up sharply from a $71.72 billion surplus in November and above a forecast for a $74.50 billion surplus in a Reuters poll.
China's hefty trade surplus with the United States, a key source of contention between the world's two biggest economies, hit $39.23 billion in December, widening from $36.95 billion the month before, but below this year's high of $42 billion in September.
China's commerce ministry said on Thursday that it hopes the United States can create conditions to expand trade cooperation, after Chinese purchases of U.S. goods in the past two years fell well short of the targets in a Trump-era trade deal.
China's exports outperformed expectations for much of 2021, but shipments have been slowing as an overseas surge in demand for goods eases and high costs pressure exporters. It was unclear how the Omicron coronavirus variant would affect that trend.
Exports increased 20.9% year-on-year last month, beating expectations for a 20% rise, but down from a 22% gain in November.
The trade data provided some support to the yuan, which looked set for the biggest weekly gain in two months.
""Exports remained strong last month but may soften in the coming months amid growing disruptions at ports,"" said Julian Evans-Pritchard, senior China economist at Capital Economics, in a note.
China reported a total of 143 local confirmed COVID-19 cases for Jan. 13, its health authority said on Friday, including in the key northern port city of Tianjin.
But Zhang Zhiwei, chief economist at Pinpoint Asset Management, said exports may already be benefiting from Omicron's disruption to other countries' supply chains.
""We expect China's exports to remain strong in Q1 because of resilient global demand and worsening pandemic in many developing countries. Currently the strong exports may be the only driver helping China's economy,"" said Zhang.
IMPORT GROWTH
The world's second-largest economy staged an impressive recovery from the pandemic, with exports helping to buoy growth as several other sectors were faltering, but there are signs the momentum is flagging. 
A property downturn and strict COVID-19 curbs could hurt the 2022 outlook, with some analysts pointing to the slowdown in import growth as evidence that this is already happening.
Imports rose 19.5% year-on-year in December, the customs data showed, missing a forecast for a 26.3% rise and down sharply from a 31.7% gain in November.
""Imports dropped back sharply, consistent with continued domestic weakness, especially in the property sector,"" said Evans-Pritchard.
Customs data showed China's imports of the key steelmaking ingredient iron ore slipped from the month before on steel production curbs and slowing property construction.
""We expect import growth to remain muted in H1 this year as China's domestic demand will continue to be dampened by the property slowdown and weak consumption,"" said Louis Kuijs, head of Asia economics at Oxford Economics, in a note.
China's economic growth is likely to slow to 5.2% in 2022, before steadying in 2023, a Reuters poll showed, as the central bank steadily ramps up policy easing to ward off a sharper downturn.

China releases fourth quarter gross domestic product data on Monday.
For all of 2021, total exports rose 29.9%, compared to a 3.6% gain in 2020. Imports for the year gained 30.1% percent, after falling 1.1 percent in 2020.

Spanish consumer prices rose 6.5% year-on-year in December, revised slightly from an initial 6.7% flash estimate, but accelerating the upward trend to hit the fastest inflation rate since May 1992, the data showed.
Prices of housing and utilities jumped 23.3% year-on-year, mainly driven by soaring electricity prices, the INE said in its more detailed second reading. Electricity prices had risen 72% from a year ago.
Despite the broad-based rise, December transport costs fell 10.9% from November, pulled down by a drop in fuel prices.
Core inflation, which strips out volatile food and energy prices, was 2.1% year on year, up from 1.7% a month earlier, the National Statistics Institute data showed.

European Central Bank Vice President Luis de Guindos said on Thursday that a spike in euro zone inflation was not proving as transitory as earlier thought and that price growth this year was at risk of exceeding projections.
Inflation is likely to drop below the bank's 2% target in 2023 and 2024, he said.

Investing.com – Growth in China’s exports and imports slowed down in December, with signs of a slowdown in the world’s second-largest economy. However, solid demand continued to buoy Chinese exports.
Exports grew 20.9% year-on-year in December, higher than the 20% in forecasts prepared by Investing.com but lower than November’s 22% growth. Exports outperformed expectations for much of 2021, but shipments have slowed as an overseas surge in demand for goods decreases and high costs hit exporters.
Imports grew 19.5% year-on-year, below both the 26.3% in forecasts prepared by Investing.com and November's 31.7% growth. The trade balance was $94.46 billion in December, higher than the $74.50 billion forecasts prepared by Investing.com and November’s $71.72 billion figure.
Total exports rose 29.9% in 2021, compared to a 3.6% gain the year before. Imports for the year gained 30.1% percent, after falling 1.1 percent in 2020.
Strict restrictive measures to curb the continuous COVID-19 outbreaks and a property downturn are two of the challenges China faces in 2022 after it saw an initial economic recovery.
The country will roll out more policies to help exporters and ease the pressure of international logistics problems, Xinhua news agency said in late December 2021, citing a meeting of the State Council chaired by Premier Li Keqiang.
China will also face an unprecedented degree of difficulty in stabilizing foreign trade in 2022, as other exporters ramp up production and amid a less-favorable base of comparison, vice-minister of the commerce ministry Ren Hongbin said on Dec. 30.
The government also vowed to focus on stabilizing the economy and keeping growth within a reasonable range in 2022 at the annual Central Economic Work Conference that took place from Dec. 8 to 10, 2021."

BUENOS AIRES (Reuters) - Argentina inflation rose back up to 3.8% in December, the government said on Thursday, above forecasts and to its highest level since last April, driven by consumers splurging on festive feasts and holidays in the last month of the year.
The result, higher than the median forecast from analysts polled by Reuters of 3.6%, also saw running 12-month inflation clocked at 50.9% in the month. The Consumer Price Index (CPI) had risen 2.5% in November.
""The acceleration of inflation versus November is explained by the collection of bonuses and vacations, people spending pesos faster to buy items for parties and holidays,"" said Natalia Motyl, economist at the Fundacion Libertad y Progreso.
Argentina's government has been battling to tamp down rampant inflation, which is running at an annual rate of over 50%, with caps on exports of some meat cuts and grains as well as price freezes on many consumer goods.
The country's central bank recently hiked the benchmark interest rate to 40%, its first raise in over a year.

""Despite the freezes of some 1,400 products, the initial impact that was seen in November was offset by price increases outside the agreement,"" said Isaias Marini, economist at consultancy Econviews, adding meat prices had made a big impact.
""It's now a challenging start for 2022 in terms of prices, with inflation in 2021 appearing to set a floor for things. With tariffs and exchange rate adjustments, we project that inflation in 2022 will end at 58%.""

The World Economic Situation and Prospects 2022 report said 2021 growth momentum - following a contraction of 3.4% in 2020 - began to slow by the end of the year, including in big economies like China, the European Union and the United States, as the effects of fiscal and monetary stimuli faded and major supply-chain disruptions surfaced.
Along with the ongoing pandemic, ""rising inflationary pressures in major developed economies and a number of large developing countries present additional risks to recovery,"" according to report by the U.N. Department of Economic and Social Affairs.
""Global headline inflation rose to an estimated 5.2 percent in 2021, more than 2 percentage points above its trend rate in the past 10 years,"" it said.
The report also warned that an emerging longer-term consequence of the coronavirus pandemic was higher levels of inequality within and between countries. 

""For the vast majority of developing countries, a full recovery of GDP per capita will remain elusive. The gap between what they will achieve and what they would have achieved without the pandemic will persist well into 2023,"" the report projected.
""In contrast, GDP per capita in the developed economies is expected to almost fully recover by 2023 relative to pre-pandemic projections,"" it added.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits increased to an eight-week high in the first week of January amid raging COVID-19 infections, but remained at a level consistent with a rapidly tightening labor market.
The weekly jobless claims report from the Labor Department on Thursday also offered more evidence that the jobs market was at or near maximum employment. State unemployment benefit rolls at the start of the year were the smallest since 1973. There are signs the worst of high inflation is likely over, with producer prices posting their smallest gain in 13 months in December.
Shrinking labor market slack and strong price pressures have left economists anticipating that the Federal Reserve would increase interest rates in March.
""The rise in claims likely reflects an increase in layoffs due to the surge in COVID cases,"" said Nancy Vanden Houten, lead U.S. economist at Oxford Economics in New York. ""Claims may remain elevated in the near term, but we expect they will gravitate back to the 200,000 level once the Omicron wave passes."" 
Initial claims for state unemployment benefits increased 23,000 to a seasonally adjusted 230,000 for the week ended Jan. 8, the highest reading since mid-November. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast 200,000 applications for the latest week.
A surge in coronavirus cases, driven by the Omicron variant, has disrupted activity from airlines to schools as workers call in sick. Unadjusted claims jumped 103,693 to 419,446 last week.
They were driven by surges in New York, which has seen sky-rocketing cases. There were also big increases in filings in California, Florida, Kentucky, Missouri, Tennessee, Texas, Utah and Indiana. But applications fell significantly in Connecticut, Massachusetts and Michigan.
Omicron infections are starting to trend lower in New York and other metropolitan areas. Claims have declined from a record high of 6.149 million in early April 2020 and remain close to their pre-pandemic levels.
Employers are hanging on to their workers, with 10.6 million job openings at the end of November.
The Fed's Beige Book report on Wednesday of anecdotal information on business activity, collected from contacts nationwide on or before Jan. 3, showed many were allowing part-time work or adjusting qualifications ""to attract more applicants and retain existing workforces.""
With more workers getting off unemployment benefits rolls, the labor pool could expand. The claims report showed the number of people receiving benefits after an initial week of aid dropped 194,000 to 1.559 million in the week ended Jan. 1. This was the lowest reading for these so-called continuing claims since the week ending June 2 in 1973.
The government reported last Friday that the unemployment rate fell to a 22-month low of 3.9% in December. The workforce is about 2.2 million people smaller than before the pandemic.
Stocks on Wall Street were trading mostly higher. The dollar fell against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices rose.
RAYS OF HOPE
In another report on Thursday, the Labor Department said the producer price index for final demand increased 0.2% last month. That was the smallest gain in the PPI since November 2020 and followed a 1.0% jump in November. 
The PPI was restrained by a 0.4% drop in goods prices, the first decline since April 2020. That reflected decreases in food and energy prices. Goods prices advanced 1.1% in November. Excluding food and energy, goods prices rose 0.5% after increasing 0.8% in November.
Services prices rose 0.5% after accelerating 0.9% in November. In the 12 months through December, the PPI increased 9.7% after shooting up 9.8% in November.
Excluding the volatile food, energy and trade services components, producer prices rose 0.4% in December. The so-called core PPI vaulted 0.8% in November. In the 12 months through December, the core PPI rose 6.9%, matching November's increase. 
""Monthly price increases are slowing but still high, and the Fed won't veer off its path to finish tapering in March and start hiking rates this year,"" said Will Compernolle, a senior economist at FHN Financial in New York.
The government reported on Wednesday that consumer prices soared 7% year-on-year in December, the largest gain since June 1982.
With the PPI and CPI data in hand, economists are forecasting that the core personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index rose about 0.5% in December, which would lift the year-on-year increase to 4.9% from 4.7% in November. 
The core PCE price index is one of the measures watched by the Fed for its 2% inflation target.
Inflation is surging as COVID-19 and the recovery from the pandemic have caused bottlenecks in the supply chain. There are hopeful signs that the supply logjam could be breaking up. 

An Institute for Supply Management survey last week showed manufacturers reporting improved supplier deliveries in December, though soaring Omicron infections pose a risk to supply chains. Data on Tuesday showed China's factory-gate prices rose more slowly than expected in December. 
""Some softening in China's PPI will have implications for U.S. inflation by taking some of the edge off core goods prices,"" said Bernard Yaros, an economist at Moody's (NYSE:MCO) Analytics in West Chester, Pennsylvania. ""Odds are the first place weaker growth in China's PPI will show up in the U.S. is in import prices, then producer prices, and finally consumer prices.""

604,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 13, 2022 10:42AM ET</span>",Spain's tourist sector seen reaching 88% of pre-pandemic size in 2022,"MADRID (Reuters) - Spain's huge tourism sector will come close to reaching its pre-pandemic size in 2022, an industry association said, although the surge in the Omicron variant and supply issues will prevent a full recovery this year.
Spain was the world's second most visited country before the pandemic. Holidaymakers flocked to its beaches and historic buildings while trendy cities like Barcelona and Madrid were popular for short breaks. 
Industry association Exceltur expects Spain's tourism gross domestic product to be worth 135 billion euros ($155 billion) in 2022, 88% of pre-pandemic levels, versus 57% in 2021, when a partial recovery of domestic tourism didn't offset a contraction in international travellers.
Activity would return to levels prior to the pandemic only in 2023, the group said.
With infections breaking records almost daily as the Omicron variant sweeps across Europe, Exceltur warned that a recovery in tourism was unlikely to start in earnest before April.
""Most business people are again postponing the full recovery of revenues to pre-pandemic levels to 2023, as a result of the triple impact of the Omicron, the energy and supply crisis at the end of 2021,"" Exceltur said.
Beaches and the countryside are expected to see a strong recovery while urban destinations, which are more dependent on international demand and business travel, expect a less intense recovery, it said.
If the forecasts are accurate, tourism will contribute to 10.5% of Spain's overall GDP, versus 5.5% in 2020 and the 7.4% Exceltur expects for 2021.

Spain's COVID-19 infection rate as measured over the past 14 days hit a new record of 3,128 cases per 100,000 people on Wednesday, a more than tenfold increase since the start of December.

The producer price index for final demand increased 0.2% last month after surging 1.0% in November. Wholesale services prices rose 0.5%, accounting for the increase in the PPI. That followed a 0.9% jump in November. 
Goods prices fell 0.4% after advancing 1.1% in the prior month. They were held down by decreases in wholesale food and energy prices. Excluding food and energy, goods prices rose
0.5% after increasing 0.8% in November. 
In the 12 months through December, the PPI increased 9.7% after accelerating 9.8% in November.
The government revised PPI data from last August through November because of the late submission of data as well as to account for corrections by respondents.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the PPI gaining 0.4% on a monthly basis and surging 9.8% year-on-year.
The Fed has a 2% inflation target. Inflation is surging as COVID-19 and the recovery from the pandemic have caused bottlenecks in the supply chain. Consumer prices jumped 7% year-on-year in December, the largest gain since June 1982, the government said on Wednesday.

But there is cautious optimism that price pressures are close to peaking. An Institute for Supply Management survey last week showed manufacturers reporting improved supplier deliveries in December.

606,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jan 13, 2022 08:54AM ET</span>",Smaller Gain in U.S. PPI Hints of Cooler Inflation,"(Bloomberg) -- Prices paid to U.S. producers rose in December by less than expected as two key drivers of inflation in 2021 -- food and energy -- declined from a month earlier, suggesting cost pressures may be starting to ease.  
The producer price index for final demand increased 0.2% from the prior month and 9.7% from a year earlier, Labor Department data showed Thursday. The annual advance was the second-largest in figures back to 2010.
The median projections in a Bloomberg survey of economists called for a 0.4% increase from a month earlier and a 9.8% annual jump. 
Excluding the volatile food and energy components, the PPI climbed 0.5% in December and was up 8.3% from a year earlier. 
The December pullback reflected declines in the costs of gasoline and food. The prices of services increased from a month earlier, though more moderately. The figures suggest rapid inflation is poised to cool after a combination of materials shortages, limited labor and transportation bottlenecks sent prices soaring last year. 
However, the omicron variant presents an upside risk over the short term to goods prices in the months ahead, as quarantines and illness prevent many from working. 
A closely watched inflation gauge, the consumer price index, rose 7% last year, the most in nearly four decades, according to data out Wednesday. The monthly advance exceeded projections, setting the stage for the Federal Reserve to begin hiking interest rates as soon as March. Economists expect consumer inflation to moderate over 2022.
Producer prices excluding food, energy, and trade services -- a measure often preferred by economists because it strips out the most volatile components -- rose 0.4% from the prior month. Compared with a year earlier, the gauge increased 6.9%.
Latest Fed Beige Book Assessment:
“Wholesale and materials prices contributed to pricing pressures across a wide range of industries, spanning service providers and goods producers. Many contacts attributed the high cost of inputs to ongoing supply chain disruptions. Some Districts reported that transportation bottlenecks had stabilized in recent weeks, though procurement costs remained elevated.”
Costs of processed goods for intermediate demand, which reflect prices earlier in the production pipeline, declined 0.3% in December, the first decrease since April 2020. Compared with a year earlier, the measure jumped 24.4%.

Initial unemployment claims totaled 230,000 in the week ended Jan. 8, up 23,000 from the prior period, Labor Department data showed Thursday. The median estimate in a Bloomberg survey of economists called for 200,000 applications.
Continuing claims for state benefits dropped to 1.6 million in the week ended Jan. 1.
The increase in unemployment claims could suggest that businesses are laying off employees as a result of the most recent surge in coronavirus infections. That said, the uptick should be short-lived as the latest Covid-19 wave ebbs and as employers continue to push to retain staff amid an ongoing labor shortage.
The jump may also reflect difficulties adjusting for seasonal effects over the holidays, which have made claims figures in recent weeks hard to interpret.

608,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 13, 2022 05:06AM ET</span>",German industry expects economy to grow by 3.5% in 2022,"BERLIN (Reuters) - Germany's BDI industry association said on Thursday it expected Europe's largest economy to grow 3.5% this year, giving a more cautious forecast than the government as it warned companies could face another ""stop-and-go year"" due to the pandemic.
""The order books are full, but production is not keeping pace with demand. Pandemic restrictions and supply bottlenecks affect large parts of the economy,"" BDI President Siegfried Russwurm said.
The BDI forecast is less optimistic than the government's estimates, published in October, in which Berlin predicted gross domestic product growth to accelerate to 4.1% this year from an estimated 2.6% in 2021.
The industry lobby group said it expected export growth to halve to some 4% this year, pointing to supply problems with microchips and other important components which have hit production in Germany's large automobile sector badly.
Russwurm said the Omicron coronavirus variant was clouding the growth outlook around the world, with Germany in particular being exposed to the risk of China, its biggest trading partner, becoming paralysed again if authorities there reacted to a renewed spread with its strict ""zero COVID"" lockdown measures.
The BDI president backed calls from Chancellor Olaf Scholz to improve Germany's relatively low inoculation rate by introducing a controversial coronavirus vaccination mandate.
Some 72% of Germany's population is double vaccinated against the virus and around 43.5% have received a booster shot.

""It's definitely not an option now to somehow continue to navigate until the warmer season, then enjoy the lower incidence rates over the summer ​- and realize in autumn again that the vaccination rate is too low,"" Russwurm said.
Germany on Thursday morning reported a record 81,417 new infections over the past 24 hours due to the highly contagious Omicron variant. Its seven-day incidence rate per 100,000 people jumped to 427.7, quickly approaching the country's all-time high of 452 reached late November.

Exports in December were expected to have risen 20.0% from a year earlier, according to the median forecast of 29 economists in the poll, still robust but moderating from a 22.0% expansion in November. 
Imports were forecast to have risen 26.3% from a year earlier, the poll showed, compared with 31.7% in November.
The customs authority will release the data on Jan. 14.
China's booming exports outperformed expectations for much of 2021 and buoyed growth in the world's second-largest economy as several other sectors were faltering, but analysts expect shipments to slow eventually as an overseas surge in demand for goods eases and high costs pressure exporters.
China has also seen a handful of Omicron cases as it battles small-scale outbreaks in several regions, adding uncertainty to the outlook.
""Even Hong Kong and mainland China, shielded by some of the world's toughest external quarantine measures, have seen Omicron slip through their defences,"" said Frederic Neumann, co-head of Asian Economics Research at HSBC, in a note.
Omicron could cause ""hugely disruptive"" supply chain stumbles in Asia if it leads to large numbers of sick factory workers or tough lockdown measures, said Neumann. 
The port city of Tianjin reported an increase in COVID-19 infections on Thursday as it stepped up efforts to rein in an outbreak that has spread the highly transmissible Omicron variant to another Chinese city.
China's vice commerce minister said on Dec. 30 that the country will face an unprecedented degree of difficulty in stabilising foreign trade in 2022, as other exporters ramp up production and amid a less-favourable base of comparison.
China staged an impressive rebound from the pandemic but there are signs the recovery is losing steam amid regulatory crackdowns and debt troubles in the property sector.
Factory activity grew at its fastest pace in six months in December, driven by production hikes and easing price pressures, but a weaker job market and business confidence added uncertainty, a private survey showed.
The central bank has said it will keep monetary policy flexible as it seeks to stabilise growth and lower financing costs for businesses amid growing economic headwinds.

China would not necessarily gain export market share from Omicron-related disruptions hurting competitors, as it did during previous waves of the pandemic, said analysts at  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) in a note.
""Supply chains in other Asian exporters may have turned more robust and could better withstand disruptions from Omicron.""

The Mortgage Bankers Association on Wednesday said its weekly measure of the average contract rate on a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage jumped to 3.52% in the week ended Jan. 7 from 3.33% a week earlier. That was the largest weekly increase since March 2020 and pushed the prevailing rate to around where it was just before the pandemic triggered a recession and drove borrowing costs to historic lows when the Fed cut its benchmark rate to near zero.
That era now appears to have passed, however. Mortgage rates had been edging higher for the past several months, but the large jump in rates last week followed the release of the minutes of the Fed's December meeting. That readout showed the policymakers were prepared to combat surging inflation with higher interest rates and a likely reduction in the Fed's holdings of more than $8 trillion of Treasuries and mortgage-backed securities.
That is crimping mortgage application volumes, especially for loan refinancings, with rates now around half a percentage point higher than where they were three months ago.

""Rates at these levels are quickly closing the door on refinance opportunities for many borrowers. Although refinance activity changed little over the week, applications remained at their lowest level in over a month, and conventional refinance applications were at their lowest level since January 2020,"" said Joel Kan, MBA’s Associate Vice President of Economic and Industry Forecasting.
Overall loan application volumes rose 1.4% last week on the back of a 2.2% increase in loans to buy a home, while refinancing applications edged down by 0.1%.

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's financial services grew for the third quarter in a row in the last three months of 2021 and at their fastest pace since mid-2017, even though COVID-19 dampened optimism, a survey of 105 firms in the sector showed.
A year since the Brexit transition period ended, the health of British financial services is being closely monitored after the City of London was largely cut off from the European Union.
""While volumes and profitability growth across the financial services sector remain buoyant, the softening in optimism is something to watch closely, due to increased COVID-19 uncertainty clouding the near-term economic outlook,"" CBI Chief Economist Rain Newton-Smith said in statement.
The survey of 105 financial firms by the CBI employers group and consultants PwC was completed just before fresh restrictions were introduced in Britain last month to tackle spiralling cases of the Omicron variant of coronavirus.
In the first three months of 2022, firms expect activity to remain robust and at a strong pace, the survey found.
Profitability growth is expected to ease somewhat in the coming months, with numbers employed predicted to grow solidly and retaining talent the top workforce priority, it said.

Looking just beyond the first quarter, Britain has said that large companies must disclose climate-related financial data from April 2022 using a globally-agreed set of guidance.

613,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 12, 2022 03:41PM ET</span>","U.S. companies saw modest growth in late 2021, Fed survey shows","By Lindsay (NYSE:LNN) Dunsmuir and Jonnelle Marte
(Reuters) - The U.S. economy expanded at a modest pace through the end of last year, with American firms noting that growth continues to be constrained by supply chain disruptions and labor shortages while prices exhibited ""solid growth,"" a survey conducted by the Federal Reserve showed on Wednesday.
The Fed's latest ""Beige Book"" collection of anecdotes about the state of the economy from businesses, labor groups and others across the central bank's 12 regions nationwide also signaled that the fast-spreading Omicron variant of COVID-19 was exacerbating conditions on several fronts as 2022 approached.
Omicron, which drew 44 references in the report, was seen adding to existing challenges around hiring and inflation, in particular, and was a set back for a travel and leisure sector that had only just begun to get back on its feet around the middle of last year. 
Employment grew ""modestly"" and most districts said demand for workers remains strong, with some businesses struggling to retain employees. One manufacturer in the Dallas Fed district, for example, reported extreme turnover among new hires, ""saying three to five hires were needed for even one to stay on.""
""Although optimism remained high generally, several districts cited reports from businesses that expectations for growth over the next several months cooled somewhat during the last few weeks,"" the report said.
THE FED SHIFTS GEARS
With inflation now persistently running at more than twice its flexible 2% annual target, the Fed is already taking measures to rein it in. It has signaled that the era of ultra-easy monetary policy, in place since the onset of the coronavirus pandemic, is effectively over even as the Omicron variant spurs a record wave of infections across the country and around the world.
On Tuesday, Fed Chair Jerome Powell told the U.S. Senate Banking Committee during his confirmation hearing for a second term as central bank chief that the economy should weather the current COVID-19 surge with only ""short-lived"" impacts and was ready for the start of tighter monetary policy.
The Fed began reducing its monthly purchases of Treasuries and mortgage-backed securities, introduced to help nurse the economy through the COVID-19 pandemic, in November. It is now set to taper that program completely by mid-March, clearing the way for it to begin hiking interest rates at its March 15-16 policy meeting.
Data from the U.S. Labor Department earlier on Wednesday showed prices at the consumer level rising by 7% on a year-over-year basis in December, the fastest pace of increase since 1982, although officials and private economists see it near the cresting point.
OMICRON HEADWINDS
While the report's headline characterization of the economy seeing ""modest"" growth was a slight downgrade from the ""modest to moderate"" description applied in the two preceding reports, the tone throughout the report still was more upbeat than down. Conditions were described as ""positive"" at twice the rate of ""negative,"" and ""improvement"" or ""improved"" appeared about seven times more than ""deteriorated.""
That said, Omicron's arrival late last year was a clear restraint, perhaps most notably in the leisure and hospitality sector. In the report, contacts nationwide noted ""a sharp pull back in leisure travel, hotel occupancy and patronage at restaurants as the number of new coronavirus cases rose in recent weeks.""
More broadly it upended daily operations for all manner of businesses as greater numbers of workers fell sick or had to isolate after contact with someone who was infected.
For instance, Omicron ""contributed to labor shortages and sparked some concern about the short-term outlook in the hospitality, transportation, and retail sectors,"" the St. Louis Fed reported.
Meanwhile, the Atlanta Fed said: ""In late December, some employers noted an uptick in absenteeism related to Omicron which resulted in curtailed operations.""
And, while for manufacturers in the Kansas City Fed's district COVID was ""not a top concern for most businesses...most contacts said they would see some disruption"" from the virus, it said.

Disruptions aside, though, businesses reported ending the year with strong sales and profits. 
In the Philadelphia district, the report said that in that region ""overall many firms, especially larger ones, noted strong profits – ""the best year ever"" for some.""

The December deficit was 85% lower than the year-ago deficit of $144 billion, and was the smallest since a December 2019 deficit of $13 billion, just before the COVID-19 pandemic threw the global economy into a tailspin.
December receipts grew 41% to a monthly record of $487 billion, while outlays grew 4% to a record $508 billion.
For the first three months of the 2022 fiscal year started Oct. 1 the federal deficit fell 34% from the prior year period to $378 billion, with receipts up 31% to a record $1.052 trillion and outlays up 4% to a record $1.430 trillion.

December's results were driven by a 44% increase in individual withheld income and payroll taxes, while other individual tax payments rose 13% for the month.
A number of outlay categories were lower in December than a year ago, with Labor Department outlays -- principally unemployment benefits -- down 81% to $6 billion.

615,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 12, 2022 08:46AM ET</span>",U.S. consumer prices increase strongly in December,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. consumer prices rose solidly in December, with the annual increase in inflation the largest in nearly four decades, which could bolster expectations that the Federal Reserve will start raising interest rates as early as March.
The consumer price index increased 0.5% last month after advancing 0.8% in November, the Labor Department said on Wednesday. In the 12 months through December, the CPI surged 7.0%. That was the biggest year-on-year increase since June 1982 and followed a 6.8% rise in November.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the CPI gaining 0.4% and shooting up 7.0% on a year-on-year basis. 
The economy is experiencing high inflation as the COVID-19 pandemic snarls supply chains. The high cost of living is weighing on President Joe Biden's approval rating. 
Inflation is well above the Fed's 2% target and is also being lifted by budding wage pressures. The government reported last Friday that the unemployment rate dropped to a 22-month low of 3.9% in December, suggesting that the labor market is at or near maximum employment.
Fed Chair Jerome Powell on Tuesday said the U.S. central bank stood ready to do what was necessary to keep high inflation from becoming ""entrenched,"" in testimony during his nomination hearing before the Senate Banking Committee for a second four-year term as head of the bank.
""The laundry list of reasons for the Fed to begin removing monetary policy accommodation is growing,"" said Ryan Sweet, a senior economist at Moody's (NYSE:MCO) Analytics in West Chester, Pennsylvania. ""Inflation would need to decelerate rapidly to take some of the pressure off the Fed and this is unlikely to occur.""
Money markets currently price about 85% odds of an interest rate hike by March, and a total of at least three quarter-point hikes by year-end. [FEDWATCH]
Economists believe the year-on-year CPI rate probably peaked in December or will likely do so by March. There are signs that supply bottlenecks are starting to ease, with an Institute for Supply Management survey last week showing manufacturers reporting improved supplier deliveries in December.
But soaring COVID-19 cases, driven by the Omicron variant, could slow progress towards normalization of supply chains.
Excluding the volatile food and energy components, the CPI increased 0.6% last month after rising 0.5% in November. In the 
12 months through December, the so-called core CPI accelerated 5.5%. That was the largest year-on-year gain since February 1991 and followed a 4.9% advance in November.

Core inflation is being driven by rising prices for services such as rentals, as well scarce goods like motor vehicles. The year-on-year core CPI rate is seen peaking in February.
""The first quarter should see inflation peaking, with lower energy prices and a decline in food and auto inflation allowing for a slower increase in prices for the rest of the year,"" said David Kelly, chief global strategist at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) Funds in New York.

Consumers spent a record $204.5 billion online over the 2021 holiday season, an increase of 8.6% from a year earlier, Adobe Analytics said in a report on Wednesday.
But the figure was lower than the $207 billion expected by Adobe and marked the smallest rise since the company started tracking holiday spending data in 2014.
Congested ports, coronavirus-related factory closures in Asia and shortages of shipping containers and truck drivers shrank both global and U.S. holiday inventory by 2%, according to data from Salesforce (NYSE:CRM).
Adobe, which covers more than one trillion visits to U.S. retail websites in its analysis, said shoppers saw over 6 billion out-of-stock messages online, a more than threefold increase from pre-pandemic levels.
The holiday rush was also softened by early promotions that encouraged shoppers to splurge on everything from toys and video games to electronics outside of the biggest shopping days.
For instance, during the Cyber Week - the period between Thanksgiving and Cyber Monday - consumer spending dropped 1.4%.
""This holiday shopping season was the first time where big promotional moments like Cyber Monday and Black Friday took on less of the spotlight,"" said Taylor Schreiner, senior director, Adobe Digital Insights.
Adobe's data showed online prices rose 3.1% in December, marking the 19th consecutive month of increase, with discounts narrowing on categories like electronics and sporting goods during the full season.

The rise in holiday sales was mostly due to the inflation-driven jump in costs and lower discounts, said Rob Garf, vice president and general manager of retail for Salesforce.
""Consumers were buying fewer items at higher prices at fewer retailers,"" Garf said.

The number of workers on short-time work schemes, also known as Kurzarbeit, rose by nearly a quarter to 879,000 from 712,000 in November, Ifo estimates based on its monthly business sentiment survey showed.
""The jump in coronavirus cases increased short-time work in the hospitality and retail sectors in particular,"" Ifo researcher Sebastian Link said.
The number of short-time workers increased to 126,000 from 75,000 in hospitality, and to 53,000 from 23,000 in retail. 
In manufacturing, it rose to 390,000 from 381,000 as factories continue to struggle with supply shortages in microchips.
High infection rates during the fourth coronavirus wave in Germany, triggered by the Delta variant, resulted in restrictions for retailers and service providers in December.
Germany banned unvaccinated people from entering non-essential establishments. The so-called 2G rule, which allows access only for vaccinated or recovered people, hit Christmas business. In addition, the rapid spread of the Omicron variant is clouding the outlook for retailers.
The Labour Office has cautioned the jump in COVID-19 cases and renewed restrictions to contain the spread of the disease increased uncertainties for the labour market. 

In a sign of this, more companies signalled they could soon put more workers on furlough again.
In October, the latest month for which reliable data was available, the number of employees on Kurzarbeit schemes fell to 710,000. That was down sharply from a peak of around 6 million in April 2020.

619,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 12, 2022 03:30AM ET</span>",China's annual auto sales climb for first time since 2017,"By Sophie Yu and Brenda Goh
BEIJING (Reuters) -China's auto sales last year grew for the first time since 2017, industry data showed on Wednesday, boosted partly by a jump of 1.5 times in sales of new energy vehicles (NEVs).
Overall sales in the world's biggest car market rose 3.8% year-on-year, after monthly sales of 2.79 million vehicles in December brought total sales for 2021 to 26.28 million，data from the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers (CAAM) showed.
Production and sales are expected to be better in 2022 than last year on the prospect that issues such as chip shortage and high prices of raw materials ease, CAAM said in a statement.
After decades of upbeat growth, China's car market started contracting in 2018 under pressure from the phasing out of some tax cuts, a trade war between Washington and Beijing and amid the fallout of the COVID-19 pandemic.
The market had started to bounce back by mid-2020, but was pulled down by a global shortage of semiconductors, used in everything from brake sensors to power steering to entertainment systems, which led automakers around the world to cut or suspend production.
China's auto sales in December fell 1.6% from a year-ago period, the eight consecutive monthly drop, CAAM data showed.
But the sales of NEVs were a bright spot, including battery-powered electric vehicles, plug-in petrol-electric hybrids and hydrogen fuel-cell vehicles, showing strong momentum with a growth of 157.5% to 3.52 million units in 2021.
In December alone, 531,000 NEVs were sold, representing a surge of 114% year-on-year. China has in recent years heavily promoted NEVs as part of its efforts to curb air pollution.
Last month, CAAM said it expects automobile sales to rise 5.4% to 27.5 million this year, and for NEV sales to grow 47% to five million.
China will cut subsidies on NEVs, such as electric cars, by 30% in 2022 and withdraw them altogether at the end of the year, deeming that the market has matured enough in terms of demand to grow without the aid of government help. 
But while China's EV market is seeing a very strong growth, most foreign automakers have lagged their Chinese counterparts in designing smart cars that appeal. Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) is the only foreign brand among the top ten.

On Tuesday, data from another Chinese auto association showed that U.S. electric vehicle maker Tesla Inc sold a record 70,847 China-made vehicles in December.
Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) said it missed its goal of selling 80,000 to 100,000 units from its ID battery electric series last year, having sold 70,625 vehicles, but that it would likely double sales this year.

Investing.com – China’s consumer and factory-gate inflation cooled in December as the government intervened to retain materials prices.
Data released earlier in the day showed that the consumer price index (CPI) grew 1.5% year-on-year, lower than the 1.8% growth predicted in forecasts prepared by Investing.com and November’s 2.3% growth. It contracted 0.3% month-on-month in 2021, down from the 0.2% growth in forecasts prepared by Investing.com and the previous month’s 0.4% growth.
The data also showed that the producer price index (PPI) grew 10.3%, lower than the growth of 11.1% in forecasts prepared by Investing.com and November’s 12.9% growth.
Slower growth in both indexes indicated easing inflationary pressure as the government stepped in to curb soaring high raw material prices and tackle power shortages.
However, the world’s second-largest economy still faces challenges in 2022 such as property woes, slowing manufacturing, and COVID-19 outbreaks. For some investors, softer inflation could lead to further monetary easing.
“The probability of a rate cut in the first quarter is high, and the closest window is this month,” China Renaissance Securities Hong Kong Ltd. head of macro and strategy research Bruce Pang told Bloomberg.
Consumer inflation “will not be a concern in 2022” and the core measure without counting volatile food and energy costs, will stay below 1.5%, he added.
Meanwhile, measures to tackle COVID-19 outbreaks are expected to weigh on the economic outlook. Several places are reporting an increasing number of COVID-19, including the city Shenzhen as well as Henan and Shanxi provinces. The city of Tianjin, where cases involving the omicron COVID-19 variant were discovered, is advising citizens to stay put for Chinese New Year, a peak travel period."

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia's most populous state, New South Wales, suffered its deadliest day of the pandemic on Wednesday, with surging Omicron infections leading to staff shortages that have disrupted supply chains and hampered the economy's recovery.
Australian businesses are grappling with the growing toll of workers out sick or ordered to isolate for being close contacts. But the virus is also scaring customers away from airlines, entertainment and hospitality sectors, already battered by several lockdowns over the past two years. 
""Essentially (small businesses) are in a lockdown ... there is little support out there to help them keep their doors open,"" Alexi Boyd, head of the Council of Small Business Organisations, told broadcaster ABC on Wednesday.
Australia's daily infections on Wednesday lingered near records with around 100,000 reported so far. Forty-two new deaths were registered, with New South Wales suffering its worst day of the pandemic with 21 deaths. 
Labour shortages and caution about being in public places have stifled household spending, ANZ said in a research note, with spending in early January resembling lockdown conditions in Sydney and Melbourne, Australia's largest cities. 
Before the Omicron outbreak erupted during the Christmas period, the economy had been making a surprisingly strong recovery. In November, employment levels rose far faster than expected as coronavirus lockdowns were lifted, and retail sales also surged for a second consecutive month.
Amid pressure on supply chains, supermarket chain  Coles Group  (OTC:CLEGF) reintroduced purchase limits on toilet paper, some meat products and medicines. 
Fielding criticism at the beginning of an election year over his handling of the Omicron outbreak, Prime Minister Scott Morrison has proposed to ease isolation rules for asymptomatic workers ahead of a national cabinet meeting on Thursday.
The head of Melbourne's Chapel Street Precinct, a local marketing body representing around 2,200 commercial entities, said the controversy over tennis superstar Novak Djokovic has ""created the perfect distraction"" for Victoria Premier Daniel Andrews and Morrison.

""(The Djokovic case) means nowhere near enough attention is being focussed on the absolute decimation of small businesses,"" General Manager Chrissie Maus said.
An Australian court on Monday quashed the government's decision to cancel Djokovic's visa over questions of his medical exemption status but he still faces the threat of deportation.

The producer price index (PPI) climbed 10.3% from a year earlier, the data showed. Economists in a Reuters poll had expected the PPI index to gain 11.1% after a 12.9% rise in November.
Factory inflation has moderated in recent months from a 26-year high in October as Beijing intervened to stabilise high raw material prices and ease an energy power crunch.
""Factory gate inflation will probably trend down further over the coming months,"" said Sheana Yue, China economist at Capital Economics, in a note.
""With coal supply improving and property construction slowing, we see further downside to the price of industrial metals and energy.""
China's consumer price index (CPI) grew 1.5% year-on-year in December. Economists in a Reuters poll had expected a 1.8% uptick, after a 2.3% increase in November. 
Food prices fell 1.2% year-on-year, with Yue pointing to a recovery in the supply of pork and vegetables after disruptions caused by bad weather in October and November.
The CPI rose 0.9% year-on-year in 2021, down from a 2.5% gain in 2020.
""Lower inflation opens room for the government to loosen monetary policies further. The probability of (an) interest rate cut is rising, in our view,"" said Zhiwei Zhang, chief economist at Pinpoint Asset Management, in a note. 
The world's second-largest economy is facing a series of headwinds in 2022, including property woes, a slowing manufacturing sector and COVID-19 outbreaks as the world battles the Omicron coronavirus variant.

The government took a number of measures recently to curb sharply rising energy and raw materials prices, with signs they could be having a desired effect. However, the emergence of omicron-variant virus cases is likely to be a defining factor in coming weeks, given that China is the world’s biggest producer and consumer of raw materials. If the outbreak continues to spread, some supply-side disruptions could ensue. 
What Bloomberg Economics Says...
The takeaway from the December retreat in China’s factory-gate and consumer price inflation: the central bank can rest easy if -- as we expect -- it adds more stimulus to support the economy. Producer price inflation eased for a second consecutive month, while consumer price inflation dropped back below 2%.

Consumer inflation remained subdued as virus control measures impeded consumption and weighed on demand, especially for prices of services. Core CPI rose 1.2%, the same as in November.
“The favorable inflation trend provides the time window for monetary easing. We expect the People’s Bank of China to cut the medium-term lending facility rate in the coming months,” said Zhaopeng Xing, an economist at Australia & New Zealand Banking Group (OTC:ANZBY) Ltd.
China’s tech-heavy ChiNext Index rose as much as 2.2% after the inflation data was released, it’s steepest gain since Nov. 22. The gauge had been falling every day since the new year.
Food prices fell in December, with pork prices dropping almost 37% and vegetable price gains slowing. The spread of the more transmissible omicron variant threatens to temporarily drive prices up again if strict mobility restrictions are widened. The upcoming Lunar New Year holidays will also see a surge in demand for staple foods and thus higher prices.

The unemployment rate rose to 3.8% in December from 3.1% the previous month, above economists’ forecast for a reading of 3.2%. 
The figures come just days before the Bank of Korea meets to decide on policy, having raised interest rates twice since the summer. 
The strength of the country’s labor market in the face of a worsening virus situation will number among the factors the bank considers, with economists split on whether it will hike rates again at the meeting.
The Korean government tightened virus restrictions twice in December just after easing them the previous month, as Covid infections surged to record levels amid the spread of the variant. 
Governor Lee Ju-yeol has said that omicron is the biggest threat to the economy’s recovery. 
Still, a majority of economists expect the BOK to raise rates sooner or later this quarter as it seeks to limit the risk of financial imbalances and stem inflationary pressure.
With the BOK moving away from its pandemic stimulus settings, the renewed curbs and concern over the latest infection wave have prompted calls for an extra budget to keep the recovery on track by helping businesses and households.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japanese manufacturers turned less positive about their business conditions in January, in a sign the economy faces pressure from the Omicron variant as well as rising energy and raw material costs, the Reuters Tankan poll showed.
Manufacturers and service sector firms were more optimistic about the coming three months, the monthly poll, which tracks the Bank of Japan's closely watched ""tankan"" quarterly survey, showed.
Some firms in the poll of 502 big and mid-sized companies, of which 254 responded, said their bottom lines were being pressured by commodity inflation, while others were more optimistic as they benefited from strong global demand.
""There's a demand rush before prices are raised,"" a manager at a metal products maker said in the Dec. 22-Jan. 7 poll.
The Reuters Tankan sentiment index for manufacturers fell to 17 in January from 22 in December, slipping from the previous survey's four-month high, while the service index rose to a 23-month high of 8 from 6 in the prior month. (For a detailed table of the results, click)
The poll showed profit margins at some firms in the world's third-largest economy were taking a hit from higher raw material and energy prices, after the BOJ's latest ""tankan"" business survey showed a recovery among manufacturers had stalled.
""While demand conditions are good, soaring raw material and fuel prices are squeezing our profits,"" a manager at a glass and ceramics maker wrote in the survey.
""Margins are decreasing due to soaring raw material prices,"" a steel maker manager said.
The BOJ's tankan survey for October-December released last month showed the service-sector mood had improved to a two-year high, while the index gauging big manufacturers' sentiment was steady on the prior quarter.
Despite the impact from higher raw material prices, manufacturers' business confidence was expected to rise to 29 in April, in part due to strong forecasts for the metal products/machinery and carmaker sub-sectors, the Reuters Tankan poll showed.
The mood among service sector firms was expected to rise to 14, also up from its January level, though firms in the sector said they continued to feel the impact of the coronavirus pandemic, including the highly infectious Omicron variant.

Private-sector economists expect Japan's economy to grow in the current quarter and the final three months of last year, although the spread of the Omicron variant at home and globally as well as raw material inflation are clouding the outlook.
The Reuters Tankan index readings are calculated by subtracting the percentage of respondents who say conditions are poor from those who say they are good. A positive reading means optimists outnumber pessimists.

By law, central bank chief Roberto Campos Neto was obliged to write an open letter explaining why annual inflation had missed the official target range. It was the sixth such letter since the current inflation-targeting regime was created in 1999. The last time was in 2017. 
Campos Neto said steps have been taken to ensure inflation targets are met for 2022, 2023 and 2024, reaffirming the need to keep raising rates ""significantly into restrictive territory.""
The surge in inflation pushed Brazil's central bank into one of the most aggressive rate hike cycles in the world last year, raising its benchmark interest rate to 9.25% in December from 2% in March. 
Policymakers have already signaled another 150-basis-point increase in February and said the country's monetary tightening may last longer until inflation expectations are back on track, a message Campos Neto repeated in his letter.
Higher borrowing costs helped to tip Brazil into a recession last year, helping to cool inflation pressures in recent months.
The country's 12-month inflation rate eased in December from 10.74% in November, the first decline since May 2020.
Still, the full 2021 print missed both the central bank's annual target of 3.75% and the 5.25% top of its tolerance band.
The index rose 0.73% in December alone, IBGE said, above the 0.65% forecast in a Reuters poll, mostly driven by clothing prices, which rose 2.06%. 
Transport was mainly responsible for the sharp price increase in Latin America's largest economy last year, with annual gains of 21%. That was driven by a 49% annual spike in fuel prices. Housing costs had an annual rise of 13% with a 21% jump for electricity.
Campos Neto said inflation missed the target mostly due to rising prices of imports, especially oil, along with other commodities. A weaker currency also contributed to the impact, he said in his letter, due to fiscal concerns in the second half of the year.
Campos Neto also cited a spike in energy prices and global supply chain bottlenecks as inflation causes.

Analysts expect inflation and higher interest rates to drag on the economy in 2022, hurting household demand and discouraging corporate investments. 
The central bank's latest weekly survey of economists showed they lowered their forecasts for economic growth this year to just 0.28%, with expected inflation of 5.03% - again above the upper limit of the official inflation target of 3.50% for 2022, with a 1.5 percentage point margin of error on either side.

The prices hit a record high of $47,077 last month as new-vehicle inventory remained tight following healthy consumer demand, the report said. 
Sales of luxury vehicles, which comprised 18.4% of total sales in December, normally increase during the last two months of the year, pushing the average prices higher, according to the report.
The U.S. auto industry has been hit hard by the global semiconductor shortage and supply chain snarls, causing low inventory levels and skyrocketing prices amid strong consumer demand. 

For each of the last six months, the average price paid by consumers was above the manufacturer's suggested retail price (MSRP) as dealers continue to hold prices at or above MSRP, according to the auto consultant. 
Meanwhile, the average price for a new non-luxury vehicle was $43,072, slightly lower than the record high set in November.

The National Federation of Independent Business said its Small Business Optimism Index rose 0.5 point to 98.9 last month. Twenty-two percent of owners said inflation was the single most important problem for operations, up from 18% in November. 
The economy is experiencing a period of high inflation as the COVID-19 pandemic snarls supply chains. 
But there are tentative signs that supply bottlenecks are starting to ease, with an Institute for Supply Management survey last week showing manufacturers reporting improved supplier deliveries in December. Economists and Federal Reserve officials expect inflation will start subsiding this year.
Even as inflation concerns mounted last month, the NFIB survey showed the share of owners raising average selling prices decreased two points to 57%. Price hikes were the most frequent in wholesale, construction and retail industries.
The proportion of businesses planing to raise prices fell five points to 49%.

According to the NFIB survey, 49% of owners reported job openings that could not be filled, up a point from November. It said 48% reported raising compensation. That was the highest in 48 years and was up four points from November. About a third planned to raise compensation in the next three months. 
The government reported last month that there were 10.6 million job openings at the end of November.

Payment card provider Barclaycard said stronger supermarket shopping led a 12.2% rise in consumer spending over its pre-pandemic level in December 2019. 
By contrast, spending at hotels and restaurants dropped, the latter down by 14.1%.
A separate survey from the British Retail Consortium (BRC) showed retail sales values were 2.1% higher than a year earlier with food sales building on an already strong performance in December 2020. 
""More Brits were either isolating or choosing to stay at home due to the new variant, which hampered face-to-face retailers as well as hospitality and leisure outlets,"" said Jose Carvalho, head of consumer products at Barclaycard.
""However, there were some bright spots. Spending on essential items grew strongly as shoppers filled their trolleys with food and drink and celebrated the festive period with family and friends."" 
The BRC ranked clothes stores as the best performing category in December. Last week fashion chain Next raised its full-year profit outlook on the back of a strong Christmas period.
While retailers fared well in 2021 overall, the BRC warned that consumer spending was likely to be squeezed by fast-rising inflation, surging energy bills and tax increases. 

The Bank of England thinks consumer price inflation will hit about 6% in April, its highest in 30 years, and in the same month workers are due to see their social security contributions go up.
""It will take continued agility and resilience if (retailers) are to battle the storm ahead, while also tackling issues from labour shortages to rising transport and logistics costs,"" said Helen Dickinson, BRC chief executive.

633,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 11, 2022 02:31AM ET</span>",Japan households' inflation expectations hit more than 2-year high - BOJ,"By Leika Kihara
TOKYO (Reuters) -Japanese households' inflation expectations have risen to a more than two-year high, a quarterly survey showed on Tuesday, a sign the rising cost of living was starting to change public perceptions about future price moves.
The result offers some hope for the Bank of Japan's effort to push inflation to its 2% target, partly by changing perceptions about persistent deflation, with aggressive monetary easing.
But analysts doubt whether recent increases in inflation, driven largely by rising fuel and raw material costs, could be sustained unless accompanied by higher wages.
The percentage of households that expect prices to be higher a year from now stood at 78.8%, up from 68.2% in September and hitting the highest level since September 2019, according to the BOJ survey conducted between Nov. 5 and Dec. 1.
Of the total, 80.8% said they expected prices to be higher five years from now, up from 78.1% in the previous survey and marking the highest level since December 2019.
The survey is among the data the BOJ will likely scrutinise at next week's policy meeting to judge whether rising input costs have affected households' inflation expectations.
Nearly nine years of ultra-easy policy have failed to fire up inflation to the BOJ's target as sluggish wage growth weighed on consumption, discouraging firms from increasing prices.
The hope among BOJ policymakers had been to shock the public out of a deflationary mindset with a massive dose of monetary stimulus.
While wholesale inflation hit a record 9.0% in November due to rising global commodity costs, core consumer inflation stood at just 0.5% due partly to the hit to consumption from the coronavirus pandemic.
Some analysts expect core consumer inflation to exceed 1.5% around April, as the drag from cellphone fee cuts last year tapers off and past rises in oil costs push up electricity bills.
Many BOJ policymakers view any such rise in inflation as unsustainable unless accompanied by steady wage gains, pointing to Japan's sticky deflationary sentiment.

Wage growth remains slow partly because Japanese firms do not need to lure back workers with higher pay, after having stuck to their tradition of keeping job cuts at a minimum even during last year's pandemic-induced economic slump.
BOJ Governor Haruhiko Kuroda has said the central bank would keep monetary policy ultra-loose until 2% inflation is achieved, even as its counterparts such as the U.S. Federal Reserve eye an exit from crisis-mode stimulus measures.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australian retail sales surged past forecasts for a second month in November as consumers splashed out their pent up savings, a reminder of how well the economy was doing before an explosion of coronavirus cases cast a pall over Christmas.
Figures from the Australian Bureau of Statistics out on Tuesday showed retail sales jumped 7.9% in November, adding to an already stellar 4.9% rise in October as much of the country emerged from a tough pandemic lockdown.
It blew away expectations of a 3.9% gain and left sales 5.8% up on November last year at a record A$33.41 billion ($24.00 billion), a major boost to economic growth in the quarter.
Pent-up demand combined with an extended November sales period to drive record sales in clothing, footwear and personal accessory retailing, household goods and department stores.
""Consumers brought forward Christmas spending to take advantage of sales and minimise delivery and stock availability concerns ahead of the festive season,"" noted Ben James, the ABS' director of quarterly economy wide statistics.
Some slowdown had always been expected in December as increasingly popular Black Friday sales pulled spending forward into November, but the sudden emergence of the Omicron strain has proved a whole new burden for the sector.
Shops and restaurants have seen a self-imposed lockdown from consumers as cases ballooned to over 100,000 a day, while isolation rules for contacts has blown a hole in supply chains and emptied supermarket shelves.
Analysts at ANZ say spending on the banks' cards in the first week of January sank to its lowest since the Delta lockdowns, with Sydney and Melbourne particularly badly hit.
ANZ's latest survey of consumer sentiment out on Tuesday duly showed a 2.2% drop for last week as confidence in the economy slammed into reverse.
""The good news is that people are still relatively happy about their own financial circumstances,"" said ANZ's head of Australian economics David Plank. 
""This potentially sets things up for a rapid rebound once people are more confident about health outcomes.""
Households still have a huge buffer of savings amassed during the long lockdowns, while a strong labour market has kept people on jobs and earning a wage.
This is a major reason the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) had been optimistic the economy could weather the Omicron wage, though the speed of it spread has still surprised.
Australia is also benefiting from high prices for its major resource exports which has provided a timely windfall to company profits and government tax receipts.
Data from the ABS on Tuesday showed the country's trade surplus narrowed to A$9.4 billion in November, but only because the splurge in domestic spending sucked in more imports.

While exports rose 2% in the month, imports jumped 6% on gains in consumption and capital goods.

That will ease living difficulties for 13 million young people, Pan Wei, an official from the Ministry of Housing and Urban-Rural Development said at a news briefing in Beijing, according to an official transcript. 
China has stepped up efforts to address housing issues faced by young people particularly, amid soaring home prices in large cities, under President Xi Jinping's ""common prosperity"" plan.
The development push for affordable rental housing is focusing on cities with large population inflows and high home prices, Pan said.
Tier-one cities like Beijing and Shanghai will supply a total of 1.87 million units of low-cost rental housing in 2021-2025, according to Reuters' calculations based on plans published by cities.
In 2021, 936,000 units were offered in 40 cities, housing 2 million young people, said Pan.

China's property downturn is expected to continue in 2022, with monthly new home prices declining and a liquidity crisis that has engulfed some major property developers.
Chinese regulators are marginally easing curbs on the property sector to prevent a hard landing and to meet the demand from non-speculative home buyers.

The projected emissions increase shows the U.S. is now further off the target set by the Biden administration under the Paris climate agreement to slash emissions 50-52% below 2005 levels by 2030. U.S. greenhouse gas emissions were 17.4% below 2005 levels in 2021, up from 22.2% below 2005 levels in 2020, according to the Rhodium Group, a research organization.
The group analyzed preliminary U.S. emissions data for 2021, a year that was supposed to be marked by recovery after the pandemic-related upheaval of the economy. It found that emissions growth outpaced the rate of economic recovery, using estimates that GDP grew by 5.7% year-on-year.
Driving the emissions growth were the transportation and electric power sectors, whose greenhouse gas emissions rose 10% and 6.6%, respectively in 2021, both rebounding around 2/3 of the drop from 2019 levels. 

In the power sector, high natural gas prices led to a 17% rise in coal generation - the first increase since 2014 - which drove up emissions.
The U.S. transportation sector, which accounts for nearly a third of net US emissions, saw the largest spike in emissions in 2021, a year after experiencing a 15% decline in 2020 from 2019 levels - the largest decline in greenhouse gas emissions led by a drastic drop in road travel due to the coronavirus.

Retail sales soared 7.3% in the month after advancing 4.9% in October, easily outpacing economists’ expectations of a 3.6% gain, Australian Bureau of Statistics data showed Tuesday. Sales soared a record 20% in Victoria, with the state’s lockdown having ended in late October, while New South Wales advanced 5.1% and the Australian Capital Territory jumped 19.2%, the report showed.
“Further easing of Covid-19 restrictions in the southeastern states and territories has seen the retail industry recover all lost momentum caused by the delta outbreak,” Ben James, director of Quarterly Economy Wide Statistics at the ABS, said in a statement. 
Economists expect spending to remain strong in the run up to the Christmas holiday period with median forecast for a brisk expansion in the the final quarter of 2021 for the $1.5 trillion economy. However, the outlook for early 2022 looks rocky as a surge in new coronavirus cases from the omicron variant is prompting caution among shoppers.
The ABS also released trade data Tuesday showing another solid surplus in November of A$9.4 billion ($6.8 billion), though narrower than the A$10.6 billion predicted by economists as a 6% increase in imports exceeded a 2% gain in exports. 
Today’s retail report  showed:
While the November increase in retail spending was the fourth largest in the series’ history, the Reserve Bank of Australia is likely to discount it somewhat given soaring coronavirus cases in Australia in recent weeks. The RBA holds its first meeting of 2022 on Feb. 1, when it’s due to decide on the future of its bond-buying program.
“For policy makers, this data would have been viewed favorably in the absence of the omicron spread,” said Callam Pickering, an economist at global jobs website Indeed Inc. “The economic environment though is moving too rapidly to put much weight on backwards looking measures of economic activity -- November feels like a lifetime ago.”

(Reuters) -Short-term inflation expectations held steady in December after rising steadily for more than a year and consumers became more optimistic about their job prospects, according to a survey released by the New York Federal Reserve on Monday. 
Median expectations for what inflation will be in one year were unchanged at 6.0% after 13 straight months of increases, according to the New York Fed's monthly survey of consumer expectations. Consumers' expectations of what inflation could be in three years also stayed steady at 4.0%, the survey showed. 
Consumers lowered their expectations for how much the prices of essential items will rise in the year ahead. They said they expect the price of gas to rise by 5.7% in a year, down from 9.2% in November, and for food prices to rise by 7.8%, down from 9.2%. 
Fed officials are considering whether they need to raise interest rates sooner than expected and may begin reducing their bond holdings later this year to respond to high inflation and a ""tight"" labor market, according to minutes from the Fed's Dec. 14-15 meeting released last week.

The New York Fed survey, which is based on a rotating panel of approximately 1,300 households, showed consumers are also more optimistic about the labor market. 
The perceived odds of losing a job over the next 12 months fell to an average 11.6% in December from 12.9% in November. And the average perceived chance of being able to find a new job after becoming unemployed rose to 57.5% in December from 55.9% in November – reaching the highest level since the pre-pandemic level of 58.7% in February 2020.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -U.S. wholesale inventories increased more than initially thought in November, suggesting that the restocking of warehouses likely contributed strongly to economic growth last quarter.
The almost broad increase in inventories reported by the Commerce Department on Monday also offered more hope that supply bottlenecks were easing. It followed in the wake of an Institute for Supply Management survey last week that showed improved supplier deliveries to factories in December.
""The fourth-quarter inventory build is shaping up to again be a strong contributor to topline GDP growth,"" said Matt Colyar, an economist at Moody’s Analytics in West Chester, Pennsylvania. ""Indications that the worst of the global supply-chain problems are behind us have mounted in recent weeks.""
Wholesale inventories rose 1.4% in November, instead of 1.2% as estimated last month. Stocks at wholesalers increased 2.5% in October. Inventories are a key part of gross domestic product. 
There were big gains in motor vehicle, furniture, computer equipment, electrical and hardware stocks. Inventories of farm products, petroleum and alcohol fell. 
Economists polled by Reuters had expected inventories would be unrevised. Wholesale inventories surged 15.9% in November from the year-earlier period. 
Motor vehicle inventories advanced 2.7% after rising 2.8% in October. The back-to-back increases suggested that the global shortage of semiconductors, which has constrained motor vehicle production, was abating. There are, however, worries that a global surge in COVID-19 cases, driven by the Omicron variant, could slow the untangling of supply chains.
Wholesale inventories, excluding autos, increased 1.2% in November. This component goes into the calculation of GDP. Economists at Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) left their fourth-quarter GDP growth estimate unchanged at a 7.0% annualized rate. 
A slower pace of inventory drawdown in the third quarter accounted for the bulk of the 2.3% pace of increase in GDP growth for that period. Inventories were depleted through much of 2021, and coronavirus pandemic-related shortages are making it harder to replenish stocks.
The urgent need to restock is keeping manufacturing humming, but there are concerns among some economists that businesses wary of delays getting stock could order too much and end up with excess inventory, which could hurt the economic expansion.
""We've seen 16 consecutive inventory gains after 14 straight months without an increase,"" said Mike Englund, chief economist at Action Economics in Boulder, Colorado. ""We expect huge inventory additions of $136 billion in the fourth quarter and $99 billion in the first quarter.""

Sales at wholesalers increased 1.3% in November after accelerating by 2.5% in October. 
At November's sales pace it would take wholesalers 1.22 months to clear shelves, unchanged from October.

Trade body Make UK and accountants PwC said 73% of manufacturers believed conditions for the sector would improve and 78% foresaw at least a moderate increase in productivity in 2022.
But two thirds of companies said Brexit had hampered their business in the nearly two years since Britain left the EU, while retaining staff and rising input costs linked to inflation also presented a challenge.
""It's testament to the strength of manufacturers that they have emerged from the turbulence of the last couple of years in such a relatively strong position,"" said Stephen Phipson, chief executive of Make UK. 
""To build on this we now need to see a government fully committed to supporting the sector,"" he said, adding that the government needed a longer-term vision for the economy.
Amid supply chain shortages linked to Brexit and the pandemic last year, more than a third of those surveyed said they would reshore some operations within the next two years, while just over half said they did not intend to move any of their production back to the United Kingdom.
The number of British manufacturers raising prices hit its highest in at least two decades last month, according to a similar survey, as the Bank of England raised interest rates to 0.25% to help head off inflationary pressure.
Official data showed British manufacturing output in October remained more than 2% below pre-pandemic levels.

CARACAS (Reuters) - Venezuela's annual inflation rate hit 686.4% in 2021, demonstrating a deceleration of consumer price growth versus the previous year when inflation was 2,959.8%, the country's central bank said on Saturday. 
Monthly inflation in December rose 7.6% and, since September, the inflation rate has remained in the single digits.
The deceleration in prices follows government measures which include the restriction of credit and lower spending in bolivars to maintain the stability of the exchange rate.
As a result of this strategy, government entities and state-owned oil company PDVSA now pay suppliers in cash with foreign currency.
During an interview broadcast on state television at the start of this month, Venezuela's President Nicolas Maduro said hyperinflation - which ran for four years - had been left behind.
Despite measures to improve supplies and control inflation, prices remain high and continue to hit the earnings of Venezuelan families, limiting their ability to buy goods like food and medicine. A minimum monthly salary is equivalent to $1.50. 

In 2019, amid hyperinflation and economic collapse, Venezuela's government relaxed economic controls, allowing greater quantities of foreign currency to circulate, which provided some sectors with breathing space. 
The central bank has yet to publish data regarding the country's economic growth.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. employment rose far less than expected in December amid worker shortages, and job gains could remain moderate in the near term as spiraling COVID-19 cases disrupt economic activity.
But the Labor Department's closely watched employment report on Friday suggested the jobs market was at or near maximum employment. The unemployment rate tumbled to a 22-month low of 3.9% from 4.2% in November. The second straight big monthly decline occurred even as more people entered the labor force. Wages increased solidly, underscoring labor market tightness.
""The U.S. labor market may have lost a little momentum at the end of a stellar year, largely due to the lack of available workers rather than available positions, but it is holding up nicely, at least so far,"" said Sal Guatieri, a senior economist at BMO Capital Markets in Toronto. 
Nonfarm payrolls rose by 199,000 jobs last month, the survey of establishments showed. Data for November was revised up to show payrolls advancing by 249,000 jobs instead of the previously reported 210,000.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast payrolls would rise by 400,000 and the unemployment rate to dip to 4.1%. 
A record 6.4 million jobs were created last year. This was the largest annual increase in employment since record-keeping started in 1939, a milestone cheered by President Joe Biden, who celebrates his first anniversary in the White House on Jan. 20.
""I would argue the Biden economic plan is working,"" Biden said at the White House. ""And it's getting America back to work, back on its feet."" 
Still, employment is 3.6 million jobs below its peak in February 2020. With the jobless rate flirting with the pre-pandemic low of 3.5% and falling below the Federal Reserve's longer-run estimate of 4.0%, some economists say the U.S. central bank could start raising interest rates in March.
""Most Fed officials will conclude that full employment has been reached, and we now expect liftoff in March and four hikes in 2022,"" said Andrew Hollenhorst, chief U.S. economist at  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) in New York.
Minutes of the Fed's Dec. 14-15 policy meeting published on Wednesday showed officials at the U.S. central bank viewed the labor market as ""very tight."" (Graphic: Non-farm payroll, https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-ECONOMY/UNEMPLOYMENT/zjpqkyjzbpx/chart.png) 
The underwhelming job growth in December likely reflects labor shortages as well as anomalies with the so-called seasonal adjustment, the model used by the government to strip out seasonal fluctuations from the data. There were 10.6 million job openings at the end of November.
December is typically a weak month for payrolls growth. Unadjusted payrolls increased by 72,000. The seasonal factor added 127,000 jobs to the December tally, less than the 213,000 added in December 2020 and fewer than the roughly 425,000 average prior to the pandemic.
""The seasonal factor added about 300,000 less than in the pre-COVID years,"" said Jim O'Sullivan, chief U.S. macro strategist at TD Securities in New York. ""I'm not saying you necessarily should add 300,000, but it does look like a pretty extreme factor.""  
Employment was unlikely to have been impacted by surging infections driven by the Omicron variant of COVID-19. The government surveyed businesses and households for last month's report in mid-December just as Omicron was barreling across the country. The variant's hit to payrolls could be felt in January.
The average workweek was unchanged at 34.7 hours.
Stocks on Wall Street were mixed. The dollar fell against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury yields rose.
STRONG DETAILS
Job gains last month were led by the leisure and hospitality sector, which added 53,000 positions. Professional and business services payrolls rose by 43,000 jobs. Manufacturing added 26,000 jobs, while construction employment rose 22,000.
There were also gains in transportation and warehousing as well as wholesale trade and mining. Government employment fell by 12,000 jobs. Retail payrolls dropped as did those for utilities. (Graphic: Jobs by industry, https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-FED/INDUSTRY/qmypmdoolvr/chart.png) 
The United States reported nearly 1 million new coronavirus infections on Monday, the highest daily tally of any country in the world. Airlines have canceled thousands of flights and some school districts have suspended in-person learning. 
Some working parents may have to take on childcare duties, with the reversion to online learning. People who are out sick or in quarantine and do not get paid during the payrolls survey period are counted as unemployed even if they still have a job.
There are more signs of unemployed people stepping back into the labor market following the end of supplemental government-funded jobless benefits early in the fall. But the reentry could be slowed by soaring Omicron cases.
The survey of households, from which the unemployment rate is derived, showed 168,000 people entered the labor force. The workforce has now increased for a third straight month, though it remains 2.2 million jobs below its pre-pandemic level.
The household survey also showed an increase of 651,0000 in employment, which accounted for the three-tenths-of-a percentage-point drop in the unemployment rate. There were fewer people working part-time for economic reasons and there was a big drop in those reporting that they could not work because of the pandemic. (Graphic: Unemployment rate, https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-ECONOMY/UNEMPLOYMENT/gdpzymqoqvw/chart.png) 
Still, the labor force participation rate, or the proportion of working-age Americans who have a job or are looking for one, was unchanged at 61.9%. It remains well below the 63.4% rate before the pandemic. The employment-to-population ratio, viewed as a measure of an economy's ability to create employment, rose to 59.5% from 59.3% in November.

Tightening labor market conditions were highlighted by a solid 0.6% jump in average hourly earnings last month after a rise of 0.4% in November. The annual increase, however, fell to a still-high 4.7% from 5.1% in November. This is the result of last year's big gains falling out of the calculation.
Though inflation has outpaced wage gains, many consumers have continued to spend because of massive savings and increased job security, underpinning the economy. Growth last year is expected to have been the strongest since 1984.

Auto output in 2021 declined to 2,979,276 vehicles from 3,040,178 the year before, according to figures published by Mexico's national statistics agency (INEGI).
However, the industry did post a slight rise in exports, sending abroad 2,706,980 automobiles compared to 2,681,806 in 2020, an increase of almost one percent. 
In December alone, production fell by 16.51% while exports plunged by 17.31%, marking the sixth straight month of declines.

A global semiconductor shortage in recent months has prompted automakers in Mexico and the rest of North America to implement rolling shutdowns, curtailing production.
In 2020, Mexico auto production tanked 20% compared with the prior year due to the pandemic's hit on the economy. Mexico's top autos association AMIA has estimated production won't return to pre-pandemic levels until late 2023 or in 2024.

646,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 07, 2022 09:20AM ET</span>","Euro zone inflation hits 5%, marking another record high","FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Euro zone inflation rose unexpectedly last month, likely making for more uncomfortable reading at the European Central Bank, which has consistently underestimated price pressures and come under fire for this from some of its own policymakers.
Inflation in the 19 countries sharing the euro rose to 5% from 4.9% in November, a record high for the currency bloc and well ahead of analysts' expectation for 4.7%.
Energy prices, up 26% compared to a year earlier, remained the main driver but the increases for food, services and imported goods were also all well above the ECB's overall 2% inflation target, data from Eurostat showed on Friday.
With the economy roaring back to life from its initial pandemic shock last year, price growth took off, catching the ECB - which predicted just a benign inflation hump a few months ago - off guard.
Adding to the upward pressure, supply-chain bottlenecks curtailed the availability of consumer products, while households, forced into saving their cash for a year, started spending on everything from new cars to restaurant meals.
Most of these inflation drivers are temporary, so price pressures should ease eventually. 
But views diverge on how fast inflation will come down and where it is likely to settle once the economy adjusts to a new normal.
The ECB sees inflation back under 2% by the end of this year, but a long list of influential policymakers question this narrative, warning that risks are skewed towards higher figures and that above-target readings could persist into next year.
Part of the concern is that underlying prices - or inflation excluding volatile food and fuel prices - are also above target, suggesting that sectors prone to weak price pressures over the past decade are now adjusting.
Indeed, inflation excluding food and fuel prices, closely watched by the ECB, rose to 2.7% in December from 2.6%, while a narrower measure that also excludes alcohol and tobacco products held steady at 2.6%. Both figures were just above expectations.
Still, no policy action from the ECB is likely anytime soon.

The bank curbed but extended stimulus only a few weeks ago, so no big review of its stance is likely before March.
The ECB also argues that wage growth, a precondition of durable prices pressures, is anaemic, while the surge in coronavirus infections will likely curtain economic activity and weigh on inflation.

647,By Investing.com,"<span>Jan 07, 2022 08:42AM ET</span>","U.S. Posts Another NFP Miss but Earnings, Jobless Rate Suggest Ongoing Pressures","By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing.com -- The U.S. economy posted fewer jobs than expected for a second straight month in December, but the government's monthly report still pointed to ongoing inflationary pressures coming from the labor market.
The Labor Department said nonfarm employment rose by only 199,000 through the middle of the month. That's only half the expected 400,000 and a sharp contrast to the 807,000 gain in private payrolls reported in ADP's concurrent survey earlier in the week.  The disappointment was only partly mitigated by an upward revision of 39,000 to November's payrolls number.
However, there was still plenty of evidence that labor market tightness is feeding through into higher wages. Average hourly earnings rose 0.6% on the month, faster than November's rate of 0.4%, which was also revised higher. Analysts had forecast growth of 0.4%.  The unemployment rate, meanwhile, fell below 4% of the workforce for the first time since March 2020, and the broader U6 unemployment rate, which captures a broader range of underemployment, fell sharply to 7.3% from 7.7% a month earlier. 
""There are methodological issues with the establishment survey,"" said Marc Chandler, managing director of Bannockburn Global Forex via Twitter (NYSE:TWTR). ""Seasonal patterns have been neutered by Covid and fewer companies (are) participating.""  
Chandler suggested that the Fed is focusing more on inflation than on jobs numbers right now, and that next week's data are likely to show another rise in inflation in December.
""The Fed is on course to hike earlier rather than later,"" tweeted Societe Generale (OTC:SCGLY) Macro Strategist Kit Juckes.
U.S. stock futures reacted negatively to the news, reversing tentative gains made in the overnight session on perceptions that the data will embolden the Federal Reserve to tighten monetary policy more and faster than thought earlier. By 8:45 AM ET (1345 GMT), Dow Jones Futures were down 58 points, or 0.2%, while the S&P 500 Futures contract was also down 0.2% and Nasdaq 100 Futures were down 0.6%. 
Other risk assets also suffered, with Bitcoin falling 4% to trade close to a four-month low of $41,206 that it hit earlier in the session. 
With the exception of the headline jobs number, the report broadly corroborates the picture painted earlier this week by other economic data that showed companies struggling to retain staff despite rapidly rising labor costs. The Labor Department's Job Openings and Labor Turnover survey showed employees quit their jobs at a record rate in November - with analysts surmising that those that departed went mostly to higher-paid jobs elsewhere. The Institute of Supply Management's non-manufacturing activity index, meanwhile, was skewed sharply higher by the prices subindex, which is closely correlated to labor costs.
The report also hinted at the ongoing structural labor market problems left behind by the pandemic, one of which has been the disproportionate pressure on women to drop out of the labor force due to school closures and childcare requirements (as well as the disproportionate impact of the pandemic on services, where female participation is higher than in manufacturing). Liz Ann Sonders, chief investment strategist with  Charles Schwab  (NYSE:SCHW), noted that 152,000 men took jobs in the month, compared to only 66,000 women.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) -India cut its forecast for economic growth in the year to the end of March to 9.2% on Friday from an earlier outlook of more than 10%, as disruptions due to the Omicron variant of coronavirus hit consumer sentiment and economic activity.
The new forecast for real GDP in 2021/22 compares with a contraction of 7.3% in 2020/21 - the fastest expansion among the major economies, the Ministry of Statistics https://mospi.gov.in said when releasing its first advance estimates for national income.
The economy has been on the mend after the government lifted mobility curbs in June to curb the coronavirus. But after a surge in Omicron cases this week, many private economists have cut growth estimates to near 9% from over 10% estimates earlier.
Reserve Bank of India had earlier predicted a growth of 9.5%.
Vivek Rathi, director at consultancy Knight Frank India, said the third wave of the virus had impacted the estimates.
""We hope to have a softer landing from the third wave and continue economic momentum without severe disruptions.”
India's daily COVID-19 https://www.reuters.com/world/india/indias-new-covid-19-cases-hit-seven-month-high-117100-2022-01-07 cases jumped to 117,100 on Friday, a five-fold increase in a week and on course to overtake its previous infection peak as the fast-spreading Omicron variant replaces Delta in cities.
Manufacturing is now forecast to grow 12.5% this fiscal year compared with a 7.2% contraction in the previous year. Farm output may grow 3.9%, up from 3.6%.
Three waves of COVID-19 have pounded small businesses, and services like restaurants, tourism, educational institutions and retail, resulting in huge job losses.

The unemployment rate rose to four-month high of 7.9% in December, from 7% in the previous month, and number of those employed fell by 2.9 million from a year ago, data released by Mumbai-based think-tank Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy (CMIE) showed.

649,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 07, 2022 07:16AM ET</span>",Omicron dents euro zone's economic rebound; inflation at record high,"By Balazs Koranyi and Francesco Canepa
FRANKFURT (Reuters) -Euro zone economic sentiment dropped more than expected last month while inflation hit another record high, indicating the economy is under renewed stress as surging coronavirus infections force governments to tighten restrictions.
With infections breaking records almost daily as the Omicron variant sweeps across Europe, growth is likely to take a hit around the turn of the year even though governments have largely avoided the debilitating measures that brought their economies to a standstill a year ago.
Foreshadowing the pain, the European Commission's Economic Sentiment Indicator, a key gauge of the bloc's economic health, fell more sharply than forecast in December to a level last seen in May. The outlook for services worsened significantly and employment expectations also fell.
In Germany, the euro zone's biggest economy, the slowdown is already evident in hard data.
Supply chain bottlenecks have held back Germany's vast factory sector for most of the last quarter and industry, thought to be on the rebound, unexpectedly stumbled in November.
Output fell 0.2% on the month, despite expectations for a 1% rise, reinforcing views that Europe's biggest economy came to a halt in the fourth quarter of 2021, with no relief in sight for months.
""Unfortunately, this is where the rebound of German industry stops for the time being. The fourth wave of the pandemic and Omicron should send industrial activity back into hibernation,"" ING economist Carsten Brzeski said.
""It will take until spring before German industry is back on a fully sustainable recovery path.""
In a rare bright spot for the bloc, retail trade unexpectedly rose in November, indicating that at least consumers remained optimistic going into the Christmas shopping season.
The problem is that heavy spending by households, who were forced to save up cash for the past year amid restrictions, is pushing consumer prices to new records.
Inflation unexpectedly hit 5% last month, a record high for the 19-country currency bloc and uncomfortable reading at the European Central Bank, which has consistently underestimated price pressures.
When the economy rebounded from its initial pandemic shock last year price growth took off, primarily as oil and gas prices jumped.
Adding to the upward pressure, supply-chain bottlenecks curtailed the availability of consumer products, while households, digging into the cash they had piled up, started spending on everything from new cars to restaurant meals.
While most of these inflation drivers are temporary, many, including some influential policymakers, doubt the ECB's benign narrative that price growth will be back under its 2% target by the end of the year.
Part of their concern is that rises in underlying prices - or inflation excluding volatile food and fuel prices - are also above target, suggesting that sectors prone to weak inflation over the past decade are now adjusting.

Still, with stimulus extended only a few weeks ago, the ECB is unlikely to revisit its policy stance until March, especially as Omicron clouds the outlook. 
There was a glimmer of good news for the central bank in the Commission's sentiment survey with euro zone entrepreneurs paring back their expectations for price rises for the first time in more than a year last month.

The deficit surged to 9.727 billion euros ($10.99 billion)from 7.697 billion a month earlier with the value of imports reaching an all-time high of 52.5 billion euros versus 51.3 billion in October, the customs office said.
Like many countries around the world, France has been in the grip of an energy crisis since last year, when the lifting of COVID-19 restrictions put huge demands on depleted stocks of natural gas, sending prices of gas, related commodities and carbon emission permits to their highest in years.
Surging energy prices have added to underlying weakness in the French economy, whose trade balance has been in the red since 2004 as the country's industrial sector declined.
While President Emmanuel Macron's government has sought to reverse the trend, Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said that improving the trade balance should be one of the major economic priorities for the next government after presidential elections in April.
""The weakness of our foreign trade reflects the weakness of our domestic economy. There is not great nation with a foreign (trade) balance that remains in deficit,"" Le Maire said.
In a case in point, other official data showed a 0.4% decline in French industrial output in November versus October, confounding a median forecast by economists for a 0.5% increase.

Meanwhile, consumer spending, at +0.8%, was a little higher than the +0.5% forecast in November, data published on Friday from the INSEE stats office showed.

Civil engineering activity declined for the first time since February and growth in the commercial sector slowed. Only housebuilding saw a pickup in December, the survey showed.
Many survey respondents cited disruption arising from COVID-19 cases, which hit new records last month as the Omicron variant spread rapidly.
""UK construction companies ended last year on a slightly weaker footing as renewed pandemic restrictions held back the recovery, especially in commercial and civil engineering work,"" said Tim Moore, director at IHS Markit.
Like the PMIs published earlier this week for the manufacturing and services sectors, the construction survey showed an easing in very high cost pressures faced by companies. 
The survey's gauge of supplier delivery times rose to its highest level since November 2020, signalling reduced disruption to supply chains.

""The worst phase of supplier delays seems to have passed as the availability of construction products and materials continued to turn a corner in December,"" Moore said.
The all-sector PMI, which combines the construction, manufacturing and services readings over the week, fell to 53.6 in December from 57.4 in November, its lowest since February and a drop largely reflecting the hit to consumer-facing businesses from Omicron's spread.

Seasonally adjusted exports increased by 1.7%, the Federal Statistics Office said.
Imports rose 3.3% after a slightly revised rise of 5.2% in the prior month. The trade surplus decreased to 10.9 billion euros ($12.3 billion) from 12.4 billion euros the previous month.

House prices rose by 1.1% in December alone, the same increase as in November, and recorded their biggest quarterly rise since November 2006.
Britain is not alone among rich economies in seeing a sharp rise in house prices during the COVID-19 pandemic, despite a historic slump in economic output from which it has not yet recovered.
Halifax said multiple factors had encouraged people in Britain to buy a new home, including greater demand for space for homeworking, a shortage of other spending opportunities and a tax break on purchases which expired at the end of September.
""A lack of available homes for sale, and historically low mortgage rates, have also helped drive annual house price inflation,"" Halifax managing director Russell Galley said.

House prices were likely to rise much more slowly in 2022 than in the previous two years, reflecting the prospect of higher interest rates and a squeeze on disposable income from increased consumer price inflation, he added.
Wales reported the biggest annual increase in house prices, with a 14.5% rise in the year to December, while London was the weakest-performing part of the United Kingdom with an increase of just 2.1%.

The corporate goods price index (CGPI), a gauge of the prices companies charge each other for their goods, in December likely rose 8.8% from a year earlier, the poll of 17 economists showed.
That would follow a record 9.0% year-on-year gain in November, the fastest pace since comparable data became available in 1981.
Month-on-month, the wholesale price index is expected to have increased 0.3% in December, slightly slowing from 0.6% growth in the prior month, the poll showed.
""Import (cost) inflation apparently took a break, as the forex rate in December showed a slightly stronger yen compared to November, and the rise in oil prices halted,"" said Takeshi Minami, chief economist at Norinchukin Research Institute. 
""Nevertheless, domestically, the trend of passing higher costs to final goods prices has been going on.""
The combination of a weak yen and global commodity inflation has gradually pushed up Japan's consumer prices as well, but at a more moderate pace than wholesale inflation. The core consumer price index, the Bank of Japan's (BOJ) benchmark reading, rose 0.5% year-on-year in November, marking a near 2-year-high.
The central bank, however, made no changes to its ultra-easy policies at its December rate review except for a partial scale-down of the pandemic funding programme, as inflation remains below its 2% target.
The BOJ is due to release the CGPI data on Jan. 14 at 8:50 a.m. (Jan. 13, 2350 GMT).
Other data due next week is expected to show Japan's current account posting a 585 billion yen ($5.05 billion) surplus in November, shrinking from a 1.18 trillion yen surplus in the previous month, as record-size imports due to soaring fuel prices swelled the trade deficit.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's household spending posted an annual drop for the fourth straight month in November, a weaker-than-expected reading that threw into doubt hopes that a consumer demand recovery will give a major boost to the economy in the final quarter of 2021.
Household spending fell 1.3% in November from a year earlier, government data showed, a surprisingly weak outcome compared with the market forecast of a 1.6% gain in a Reuters poll and dropping at a faster pace than October's 0.6% decline.
The month-on-month figures were also negative, losing 1.2%, weaker than a forecast of a 1.2% gain as households remained hesitant to increase spending despite lower COVID-19 infections than during the summer months.
""Coronavirus infections had already come down, so this suggests consumers remain cautious about the outlook,"" said Takumi Tsunoda, senior economist at Shinkin Central Bank Research Institute.
The weak figures raise some concerns for policymakers hoping a rebound in consumer demand will support the economy as companies struggle with higher import cost due to a rise of raw material prices that have fuelled global inflation.
Consumer spending, however, was still expected to stage a fourth-quarter rebound after the heavy hit they took in the quarter before it, said Tsunoda.
""There will be sharp growth, but private consumption won't recover to pre-pandemic levels as it will be coming from a low base,"" he said.
Declining spending on overnight stays and eating out weighed on the headline figure, a government official said, adding those items got a boost from a campaign last year to stimulate domestic tourism and dining out.
Spending on clothes and transportation increased compared to a year earlier, the data showed. 
Separate data on Friday showed core consumer prices in Tokyo rose at the fastest pace in nearly two years in December as electricity and fuel cost surged due to higher global energy prices, while prices of overnight stays also increased.
The core consumer price index (CPI) for Japan's capital, which includes oil products but excludes fresh food prices, rose 0.5% in December compared with a year earlier, the biggest year-on-year gain since February 2020, government data showed.

Inflation-adjusted real wages, meanwhile, slumped 1.6% year-on-year in November, falling for the third straight month and boding ill for a stronger economic recovery.
Japan's economy is expected to have grown sharply in the October-December quarter of 2021 after coronavirus cases declined, though the increasing cost of goods and the recent spread of the highly infectious Omicron variant are sowing some doubts for the outlook.

658,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jan 06, 2022 07:00PM ET</span>",Japan Households Cut Spending Even Before Omicron Variant,"(Bloomberg) -- Japanese household spending fell in November for the first time in three months, a sign of unexpected fragility in consumption even before the omicron variant of the virus started to spread.
Spending declined 1.2% from the prior month, led by drops in outlays on housing and education, the ministry of internal affairs reported Friday. Overall expenditures were 1.3% below 2020’s level, compared with economist’s expectations for a 1.2% increase.
Separate reports showed Tokyo inflation rose 0.5% last month from a year ago, the highest level since February 2020. Wages were flat in November, showing how much work Prime Minister Fumio Kishida must do to stoke the pay hikes he’s called for as a centerpiece of his economic agenda.
Consumers showed less appetite for spending in November even as vaccination rates climbed and Covid cases became more rare during the second full month since emergency virus restrictions were lifted. 
The spread of the omicron variant, which has pushed case numbers back to levels not seen since late summer, could further damp the recovery if it triggers another emergency declaration, though the odds of that are still low. 
Analysts have been forecasting consumption helping the economy return to growth last quarter, with a stimulus package from the Kishida administration expected to add support this year. 
Tokyo raised its alert level one notch this week, but the governor said there are no plans at this point to ask the national government to introduce a quasi-emergency in the capital, where 641 cases were discovered Thursday, around 10 times more than a week earlier.
Tokyo Governor Says She Won’t Seek Virus Restrictions for Now
Meanwhile, higher energy prices and import costs on the back of a weaker yen continue to push Japanese inflation higher. At a policy meeting this month, the Bank of Japan will likely discuss the possibility of ditching of a long-held view that price risks are mainly on the downward side, according to people familiar with the matter. 
Any shift in the risk assessment of prices won’t be a signal that the BOJ is moving toward policy normalization since inflation is still far from the bank’s 2% target in stark contrast with many of its global peers, the people said.  
What Bloomberg Economics Says...
“We expect pent-up demand to spur spending into 1Q 2022 with wide vaccination coverage and a relatively low number of virus infections. Fiscal stimulus -- including wage support measures and cash and coupon payouts to low-income households -- has been supporting consumer sentiment.”

Japanese policy makers have repeatedly said that higher wages hold the key to whether the economy reaches a more sustainable path, where consumers tolerate higher prices, profits increase and growth quickens.

Economists polled by Reuters had forecast 197,000 applications for the latest week.

""As worker shortages have been a persistent issue and employment levels are already lower than desired, this effect has been much less during the recent holiday season."" 
Stripping out the weekly volatility, the labor market is tightening, with claims having declined from a record high of 6.149 million in early April 2020. 
Minutes of the Federal Reserve's Dec. 14-15 policy meeting published on Wednesday showed Fed officials viewed the labor market as ""very tight."" The U.S. central bank might need to raise interest rates sooner than expected and begin reducing its overall asset holdings to tame high inflation, according to the minutes.
But with the United States reporting nearly 1 million new coronavirus infections on Monday, the highest daily tally of any country in the world, a temporary rise in claims is likely. 
Some school districts are suspending in-person learning, which could force some working parents to assume childcare duties. Workers calling in sick are causing some businesses to either temporarily close or scale back services.
A separate report on Thursday from global outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas showed job cuts announced by U.S.-based employers increased 28.1% to 19,052 in December. Layoffs, however, remain low, totaling 321,970 jobs in 2021. That was down 86% from 2020.
""The sheer number of COVID cases will impact the labor market, regardless of how severe illnesses are,"" said 
Andrew Challenger, senior vice president at Challenger, Gray & Christmas. ""Those with COVID safety concerns will continue to shun in-person roles."" 
The claims data has no bearing on the Labor Department's closely watched employment report for December, due to be released on Friday, as it falls outside the survey period. The government surveyed businesses and households for last month's employment report in mid-December.
According to a Reuters survey of economists, nonfarm payrolls likely increased by 400,000 jobs in December after rising 210,000 in November. The unemployment rate is forecast falling to 4.1% from 4.2% in November. 

Prospects of a strong employment report were boosted by the ADP National employment report on Wednesday, which showed private payrolls increased by 807,00 jobs last month. That prompted economists at Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) to raise their December payrolls estimate by 50,000 to 500,000. 
A measure of manufacturing employment rose to an eight-month high in December, a survey from the Institute for Supply Management showed on Tuesday.

OTTAWA (Reuters) -Canada posted a trade surplus of C$3.13 billion ($2.45 billion) in November, the largest in over 13 years, with record exports offsetting the impact of floods in British Columbia, Statistics Canada said on Thursday.
Analysts polled by Reuters had forecast a November surplus of C$2.03 billion. Exports and imports hit all-time highs for the second month in a row, pushing the surplus to a level not seen since the C$3.45 billion posted in September 2008.
Peter Hall, chief economist at Canada's export development agency, said the data showed how much global production had recovered from the COVID-19 pandemic.
""The economy has come roaring back much more quickly and much more decidedly than anybody expected or was prepared for,"" he said by phone, noting that energy exports had posted a 2.8% gain. Canada is a major exporter of crude and natural gas.
Overall exports rose by 3.8% from October, helping outweigh the impact of massive floods and landslides in British Columbia last November that temporarily cut most links to Vancouver, the country's largest port. 
""This suggests there are modest upside risks to the preliminary estimate that GDP rose by 0.3% month on month in November,"" Stephen Brown, senior Canada economist at Capital Economics, said in a note.
Statscan said the data had been inflated by unusually high pharmaceutical shipments. In November, Canada imported COVID-19 medication for packaging and labeling and then exported it.
But even when pharmaceuticals were stripped out, overall exports still grew by 2.8% from October. Imports grew by 2.4% but that shrank to 0.1% excluding pharmaceuticals. 

The Canadian dollar was trading 0.1% lower at 1.2762 to the greenback, or 78.36 U.S. cents, as investors weighed the possibility of faster-than-expected U.S. interest rate hikes.

The Commerce Department said on Thursday that factory orders rose 1.6% in November. Data for October was revised higher to show orders rising 1.2% instead of 1.0% as previously reported.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast factory orders advancing 1.5%. Orders increased 12.9% on a year-on-year basis.
Manufacturing, which accounts for 11.9% of the economy, is being supported by businesses replenishing depleted inventories.
There were increases in orders for computers and electronic products as well as transportation equipment. But orders for machinery fell as did those for electrical equipment, appliances and components.
There are tentative signs that raw material and labor shortages are starting to abate. An Institute for Supply Management survey on Tuesday showed its measure of prices paid for inputs by factories fell by the most in a decade in December.
Shipments of manufactured goods increased 0.7% in November after surging 2.0% in October. Inventories at factories rose 0.7%. Unfilled orders increased 0.7% after gaining 0.3% in the prior month.
The Commerce Department also reported that orders for non-defense capital goods, excluding aircraft, which are seen as a measure of business spending plans on equipment, were unchanged changed in November instead of falling 0.1% as reported last month.

Shipments of these so-called core capital goods, which are used to calculate business equipment spending in the gross domestic product report, rose 0.3% in November as previously reported.
Business spending on equipment contracted in the third quarter after four straight quarters of double-digit growth.

The Commerce Department said on Thursday that the trade gap jumped 19.4% to $80.2 billion in November. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast a $77.1 billion deficit.
Goods imports soared 5.1% to an all-time high $254.9 billion, likely as congestion at ports eased. Overall imports increased 4.6% to $304.4 billion. 
The broad rise in imports was led by industrial supplies and materials. Consumer goods also increased strongly as did imports of motor vehicles, parts and engines. 

Goods exports fell 1.8% to $155.9 billion. They were pulled down by decreases in capital goods as well as industrial supplies and materials. But exports of services rose, lifted by travel and transport. Overall, exports increased 0.2% to $224.2 billion in November. 
The trade deficit has been a drag on GDP growth for five straight quarters. Fourth-quarter GDP growth estimates are as high as a 7.4% annualized rate. The economy grew at a 2.3% pace in the third quarter.

LONDON (Reuters) -Britain's services sector suffered its biggest loss of momentum last month since the country was last in lockdown, as the spread of the Omicron variant of coronavirus hammered hospitality and travel, a survey showed on Thursday.
The IHS Markit/CIPS services Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) fell to a 10-month low of 53.6 in December from 58.5 in November, according to final data, which was a fraction stronger than a preliminary ""flash"" reading of 53.2.
The composite PMI, which includes Tuesday's more upbeat manufacturing PMI, showed a similar move.
""Mass cancellations of bookings in response to the Omicron variant led to a slump in consumer spending on travel, leisure and entertainment,"" IHS Markit economist Tim Moore said.
Some 45% of hospitality businesses and 50% of firms such as beauticians and hairdressers reported increased cancellations in the run-up to Christmas, according to separate figures released by the Office for National Statistics on Thursday.
The last time the services PMI was lower was in February 2020 when the economy was still under lockdown, and restaurants and non-essential shops were closed to the public. 
December's data was above the 50 mark that normally separates growth from contraction, but economists said the scale of the fall increased the chances that official data due next month would show the economy shrank in December.
""Disruption from the current scale of infections risks worsening supply bottlenecks, particularly labour shortages. And combined with a deterioration in high-frequency indicators, the latest PMIs reinforce the likelihood that GDP fell in December,"" said Martin Beck, chief economic adviser to EY ITEM Club.
Pantheon Economics forecasts a 0.6% fall in GDP for December and a 0.3% decline for January.
""That said, we can't rule out a rise in GDP in January if consumers feel more confident to risk contracting COVID-19, now that Christmas is out of the way and people know that Omicron is less likely to result in serious illness than Delta,"" said Gabriella Dickens, senior UK economist at Pantheon.
NO NEW LOCKDOWN
Unlike during the wave of COVID-19 cases last winter - when few Britons had been vaccinated - this year Prime Minister Boris Johnson has rejected new legal restrictions in England, although curbs on hospitality apply elsewhere in the United Kingdom.
Moreover, many Britons have also followed health advice to work from home where possible and limit social gatherings. Retail footfall in the week to Jan. 2 was 25% lower than its level in the equivalent week of 2019, the ONS said.
Services businesses were more upbeat for 2022 as a whole, however, with 55% expecting output to rise compared with 10% predicting a decline, IHS Markit said.
But many economists expect a big squeeze on consumer demand this year from sharply rising inflation, which the Bank of England forecasts will peak at a 30-year high of around 6% in April, just as the government raises taxes on workers.
The BoE also started last month to raise interest rates from their record-low 0.1% to tackle longer-term price pressures.

""Many businesses cited the need to pass on escalating costs to clients over the course of 2022,"" Moore said, adding that firms faced pressure to raise pay in a competitive job market.
Both the 'prices charged' and the input costs components of the services PMI in December were well above their levels at the start of 2021, although down from peaks a few months earlier.

The Food and Agriculture Organization's (FAO) food price index, which tracks the most globally traded food commodities, averaged 125.7 points in 2021, the highest since 131.9 in 2011.
The monthly index eased slightly in December but had climbed for the previous four months in a row, reflecting harvest setbacks and strong demand over the past year. [GRA/]
Higher food prices have contributed to a broader surge in inflation as economies recover from the coronavirus crisis and the FAO has warned that the higher costs are putting poorer populations at risk in countries reliant on imports.
In its latest update, the food agency was cautious about whether price pressures might abate this year.
""While normally high prices are expected to give way to increased production, the high cost of inputs, ongoing global pandemic and ever more uncertain climatic conditions leave little room for optimism about a return to more stable market conditions even in 2022,"" FAO senior economist Abdolreza Abbassian said in a statement.
A surge in the price of fertilisers, linked in turn to spiralling energy prices, has ramped up the cost of so-called inputs used by farmers to produce crops, raising doubts over yield prospects for next year's harvests.
In December, prices for all categories in the food price index bar dairy products fell, with vegetable oils and sugar falling significantly, the agency said in its monthly update. 
It cited a lull in demand during the month, concerns about the impact of the Omicron coronavirus variant, and supplies from southern hemisphere wheat harvests for the declines.
However, all categories in the index showed sharp increases during 2021 as a whole and the FAO's vegetable oil price index hit a record high.

Crop futures have seen volatile trading at the start of 2022, with oilseed markets stirred by drought in South America and floods in Malaysia. [POI/]
Dairy prices maintained their recent strength in December, helped by lower milk production in Western Europe and Oceania, the FAO said.

Investing.com – China’s services sector activities grew faster in December thanks to rising demand and easing inflation. However, ongoing, small-scale COVID-19 outbreaks throughout the country weighed on the market.
China Caixin services purchasing managers’ index (PMI), which focuses on small companies in coastal regions, rose to 53.1 in December from 52.1 in November. 
Some analysts said the economic recovery from COVID-19 to be slower in the services sector, which is more easily affected by the COVID-19 outbreaks and resultant restrictive measures. Leisure and tourism businesses have specially been hit hard.
The northwestern city of Xi’an saw an outbreak of COVID-19 and has been in lockdown since Dec. 22, 2021.
The Caixin survey also showed that though rising slower, companies’ input prices rose for the eighteenth month in a row. A sub-index for employment rose at the fastest pace since May.
""Supply and demand both improved. As new products helped lift the market sentiment, business activity, and total new business both expanded for the fourth consecutive month. But surveyed enterprises were concerned about the disruptions caused by scattered COVID-19 flare-ups,"" Caixin Insight Group senior economist Wang Zhe said in a note accompanying the data.
“Although the measure for business expectations remained in positive territory, it fell to the lowest since September 2020 and was remarkably lower than the long-term average.”
Meanwhile, data released earlier in the week showed that the Caixin manufacturing PMI was 50.9. Official data from the National Bureau of Statistics showed that the non-manufacturing PMI was 52.7, while the manufacturing PMI was 50.3, in December."

The Caixin/Markit services Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) rose to 53.1 in December from 52.1 in November, remaining above the 50-point mark that separates growth from contraction on a monthly basis.
The survey, which focuses more on small firms in coastal regions, tallied with those of an official survey, which also showed the expansion in the services sector sped up.
Analysts say the services sector, which has been slower to recover from the pandemic than manufacturing, is more vulnerable to sporadic COVID-19 outbreaks and anti-virus measures, with leisure and tourism businesses hurt the most.
Most of China's recent local cases have been in the northwestern province of Shaanxi, where the capital city Xian has been on lockdown to control the spread of the disease.
Firms' input prices rose for the 18th month in a row, but at a slower pace, the survey showed. A sub-index for employment rose at the fastest pace since May, and a gauge of new business accelerated.
""Supply and demand both improved. As new products helped lift the market sentiment, business activity and total new business both expanded for the fourth consecutive month.

Mexico sold 1,014,680 light vehicles last year, according to figures from the national statistics agency (INEGI) after sales fell 27.9% to 950,063 in 2020, a nine-year low. There were 1.3 million vehicles sold in 2019 before the pandemic while 2016 saw a record 1.6 million sales.
Fausto Cuevas, head of the Mexican Automotive Industry Association (AMIA), recently forecast Mexico's auto production would only return to pre-pandemic levels in late 2023 or in 2024.
Car production has been hobbled in recent months by a global semiconductor shortage, prompting automakers across North America to implement rolling shutdowns and curb output.

The bottlenecks hit the industry in the second half of last year and during the October-December period, sales were the weakest they had been in the fourth quarter since 2010.
Semiconductors are an indispensable component for the automakers, who need them for a wide variety of systems such as safety, navigation and entertainment. COVID-19 outbreaks in Asian semiconductor manufacturing hubs have slowed production.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. private payrolls increased more than expected in December, pointing to underlying labor market strength, but skyrocketing COVID-19 infections could slow momentum in the months ahead.
The surge in private hiring in the ADP National Employment Report on Wednesday was based on data collected in mid-December just as the Omicron variant was sweeping across the country, causing some events and hundreds of flights to be canceled.
""The labor market continues to recover,"" said Gus Faucher, chief economist at PNC Financial (NYSE:PNC) in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. ""However, the Omicron variant is a substantial downside risk to the near-term labor market recovery."" 
Private payrolls jumped by 807,000 jobs last month, the most in seven months, after rising by 505,000 in November. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast private payrolls would increase by 400,000 jobs.
The ADP report is jointly developed with Moody's (NYSE:MCO) Analytics and was published ahead of the Labor Department's more comprehensive and closely watched employment report for December on Friday. It has, however, a poor record predicting the private payrolls count in the department's Bureau of Labor Statistics employment report because of methodology differences.
Graphic - U.S. private sector hiring: https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-ECONOMY/mopanwjwnva/chart_eikon.jpg
Economists anticipate some disruption from the winter wave of infections, though not on the scale of last summer. The hit to the labor market is expected to show in the January data. 
The United States reported nearly 1 million new coronavirus infections on Monday, the highest daily tally of any country in the world. 
Airlines have canceled flights and some school districts have suspended in-person learning as workers called in sick. 
""Most of those absentees will still be paid and therefore counted as employed this month,"" said Michael Pearce, a senior U.S. economist at Capital Economics in New York. ""But a significant minority who do not have access to paid sick leave will not, potentially knocking hundreds of thousands off the official non-farm payrolls tally in January.""
Stocks on Wall Street were trading mixed. The dollar fell against a basket of currencies. Yields on shorter-dated U.S. Treasuries rose.
BROAD INCREASE
Still, demand for labor is strong amid an acute shortage of workers. The broad increase in private hiring last month was led by a rise of 246,000 in the leisure and hospitality industry. Professional and business services added 130,000 jobs.
Manufacturing hired 74,000 more workers and construction payrolls increased by 62,000 jobs. Hiring at construction sites is being supported by a strong housing market, though rising mortgage rates could slow demand.
A separate report from the Mortgage Bankers Association on Wednesday showed applications for loans to buy a home declined over the past two weeks. Though the data can be volatile around holidays, it was in line with other indicators that have suggested the housing market could be losing steam. Contracts to purchase a previously owned home fell in November. 
Despite the ADP report's spotty track record in predicting the private payrolls component of the Labor Department's monthly employment release, last month's jump was another sign that job growth probably accelerated in December. 
The government also surveyed businesses and households for last month's employment report in mid-December.
Economists at Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) raised their December payrolls estimate by 50,000 to 500,000 after the ADP release. 
""But the ADP report is at least broadly supportive of our view that the labor market is continuing to tighten despite the recent COVID spread and some signs that consumer activity has weakened lately,"" said Daniel Silver, an economist at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) in New York. 
First-time applications for unemployment benefits declined significantly between mid-November and mid-December. The Institute for Supply Management's measure of factory employment rose to an eight-month high in December, with manufacturers noting an improvement in labor supply.
According to a Reuters survey of economists, private payrolls likely increased by 365,000 jobs in December. Overall nonfarm payrolls are forecast to rise by 400,000 jobs. The economy created 210,000 jobs in November. 

But worker shortages are constraining the labor market's recovery. The government reported on Tuesday that there were 10.6 million job openings at the end of November. 
There were signs in November that unemployed Americans were starting to slowly return to the workforce, but the rising coronavirus infections could force some to stay home.

Businesses’ payrolls grew by 807,000 last month, after a downwardly revised 505,000 gain in November, according to ADP Research Institute data released Wednesday. The median forecast in a Bloomberg survey of economists called for a 410,000 rise.
“Job gains were broad-based, as goods producers added the strongest reading of the year, while service providers dominated growth,” ADP Chief Economist Nela Richardson said in a statement.
The larger-than-expected payrolls gain could indicate that employers had more success hiring in December as higher wages and attractive working terms lured people off the sidelines. Even so, a surge in Covid-19 infections in recent weeks could impact hiring if more Americans pull back on activities like travel and restaurant dining and businesses struggle to stay open.
The data precede Friday’s monthly jobs report from the Labor Department, which is currently forecast to show that the U.S. added 384,000 private payrolls in December. ADP’s data don’t always align with those of the government because of different measurement techniques.
Strength in Services
Service-provider employment rose by 669,000 in December, the most since June, led by leisure and hospitality.
Payrolls at goods producers increased 138,000, the strongest since September 2020.

The amount spent on food, which benefited from a closure of restaurants last year and limited competition from cross-border shopping in cheaper countries, such as Germany and France, is expected to decline by 5.5%.
Non-food shopping is expected to drop by 2.8% in 2022, Credit Suisse said in its retail outlook report, one of the first forward-looking economic analyses of the year.
Still, after a 2.4% increase in overall retail spending in 2021, Swiss shops should still do better than during the pre-pandemic year of 2019, the authors of the study said. 
They forecast food retailing 4.5% above 2019 levels and non-food retail 2.1% higher.
""We expect a decline from 2021 levels this year as many of the positive factors which drove sales will be absent,"" said Credit Suisse economist Tiziana Hunziker.
""Last year people bought long-lasting goods like computers, skis or furniture, while in other areas like DIY and hobby products people have stocked up,"" she added. ""Still, I think we will be above pre-crisis levels.""

LONDON (Reuters) -The euro zone's economic recovery stuttered in December as a renewed wave of COVID-19 infections curtailed growth in the bloc's dominant service industry, a survey showed on Wednesday, and could weaken further if tighter restrictions are imposed.
As the Omicron coronavirus variant spread rapidly at the end of last year governments reimposed measures to contain infection rates, particularly in Germany, Europe's largest economy.
That meant IHS Markit's Composite Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI), a good gauge of overall economic health, sank to 53.3 in December from 55.4 in November, its lowest since March.
While the final reading was below an earlier 53.4 ""flash"" estimate it did hold above the 50 mark separating growth from contraction.
""The final Composite PMIs for December confirm that the euro zone economy ended 2021 on a weak note. The economy lost momentum at the end of last year but still appeared to be expanding,"" said Jack Allen-Reynolds at Capital Economics.
Restrictions to contain the coronavirus dampened activity in Germany's https://www.reuters.com/markets/europe/covid-curbs-dampen-activity-german-services-sector-dec-pmi-2022-01-05 services sector and concerns over the Omicron variant clouded the outlook for January, while in France https://www.reuters.com/markets/europe/french-services-growth-december-slightly-below-initial-reading-pmi-2022-01-05 growth came in slightly below an initial estimate as the pandemic weighed.
Consumer confidence in France - the bloc's second-biggest economy - nevertheless improved last month.
With customers encouraged to stay at home the euro zone's services industry saw growth wane. Its PMI dropped to an eight-month low of 53.1 from November's 55.9, below a 53.3 preliminary reading.
Weaker demand and the threat of further restrictions on the horizon meant services firms increased headcount at the slowest pace since May. The employment index fell to 53.6 from 55.4.
A factory PMI https://www.reuters.com/markets/europe/euro-zone-factory-growth-stayed-strong-dec-supply-issues-eased-pmi-2022-01-03 released on Monday, which showed manufacturing activity remained resilient in December, suggested an easing of supply chain bottlenecks had alleviated some price pressures.

But the composite input prices index stayed high at 74.1, albeit below November's 76.0. The output prices index fell but remained elevated.
The European Central Bank https://www.reuters.com/markets/rates-bonds/ecb-set-dial-back-stimulus-one-more-notch-2021-12-15 raised its inflation projections last month and now sees inflation at 3.2% this year, well above its 2.0% target.

IHS Markit's Business Activity Index for services stood at 53.0 in December, down from 55.9 in November but comfortably above the 50 mark that separates growth from contraction for an eighth successive month.
The figure was below the median forecast in a Reuters survey of seven analysts which had pointed to a reading of 53.9.
Italy's service sector took longer to recover from COVID-19 lockdowns than the smaller manufacturing sector, which has seen healthy growth for the last year and recorded its 18th consecutive month of expansion in December.
Factories, unlike many services businesses, remained open during most of the COVID-19 pandemic.
The sub-index for new business in the service sector came in at 55.4 in December from 56.3 the month before.

The composite Purchasing Managers' Index for services and manufacturing remained robust in December at 54.7, down from 57.6 posted in November but its 11th successive month of growth. 
Prime Minister Mario Draghi says the Italian economy almost certainly expanded in 2021 by more than the government's official 6.0% forecast and is predicting growth of 4.7% in 2022.

Data compiler IHS Markit said on Wednesday its Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) for the services sector fell to 57.0 points in December, down from 57.4 points in November and slightly below a preliminary reading of 57.1 points.
Nevertheless, the index remained above the 50-point threshold dividing an expansion in activity from a contraction.
A composite PMI index which includes the services and manufacturing sectors fell to 55.8 points in December from 56.1 in November, slightly better than its initial estimate of 55.6. 

""Business activity grew at the second-quickest rate since June, outpaced only marginally by that seen in November. Anecdotal evidence suggests that demand for services remains robust, causing backlogs to build and hiring to continue,"" said IHS Markit senior economist Joe Hayes.
""That said, new order growth weakened amid a notable dent to demand from overseas clients, reflecting the impact that rising COVID-19 infections had on tourism.""

Wednesday's figures from Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd showed total job ads fell 5.5% in December from November, when they jumped an upwardly revised 9.9%.
Ads were still up 32.7% on a year earlier at 212,098 and 4.2% higher than June 2021 when the Delta variant first hit.
ANZ senior economist Catherine Birch noted a huge 366,100 surge in employment reported during November suggested some outstanding positions were filled and was partly behind the drop in ads.
""But it's also possible that businesses have become more hesitant to hire due to the spread of Omicron and the consequent uncertainty around consumer behaviour and worker availability,"" she added.
New coronavirus cases began to take off in late December and are now hitting records daily.
Birch said surveys also suggested more workers were looking to switch jobs this year.

""With so much competition for labour and workers feeling secure in their jobs, we should see more people moving to better jobs and asking for larger pay rises in 2022, contributing to stronger wages growth,"" she said.
The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) is keeping interest rates at record lows in the hope of driving unemployment down to 4% or even lower and finally lifting wage growth after years of tepid gains.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. manufacturing activity slowed in December amid a cooling in demand for goods, but supply constraints are starting to ease and a measure of prices paid for inputs by factories fell by the most in a decade.
The Institute for Supply Management (ISM) survey on Tuesday also suggested some improvement in labor supply, with a gauge of factory employment rising to an eight-month high. Still, Timothy Fiore, chair of the ISM manufacturing business survey committee, noted that ""shortages of critical lowest-tier materials, high commodity prices and difficulties in transporting products continue to plague reliable consumption."" 
The survey does not fully capture the impact of the Omicron COVID-19 variant, which is rapidly spreading across the United States and abroad. Sky-rocketing infections could force workers to stay home and halt the tentative supply-chain progress.
""There's still a lot of ground to make up before supply chains fully normalize, but cooling prices and increased employment are positive signs,"" said Will Compernolle, a senior economist at FHN Financial in New York.
The ISM's index of national factory activity fell to a reading of 58.7 last month, the lowest level since January 2021, from 61.1 in November. A reading above 50 indicates expansion in manufacturing, which accounts for 11.9% of the U.S. economy.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the index would fall to 60.1. 
All of the six biggest manufacturing industries - chemical products, fabricated metal products, computer and electronic products, food, transportation equipment, and petroleum and coal products - reported moderate-to-strong growth.
Manufacturers of fabricated metal products expressed optimism that ""we have reached the top of the hill to start down a gentle slope that lets us get back to something that resembles normal."" Their counterparts in the chemical products industry said the ""gut feeling says it's getting easier to source chemical raw materials."" 
Machinery makers reported that ""costs for steel seem to be coming down some."" They also noted improvements in ""performance by suppliers"" and ""on-time deliveries."" But transportation equipment manufacturers said capacity remained ""limited due to the global chip shortage.""
The ISM survey's measure of supplier deliveries declined to a reading of 64.9 from 72.2 in November. A reading above 50% indicates slower deliveries to factories. 
The ISM's Fiore said transportation networks, a harbinger of future supplier delivery performance, were still performing erratically, but there are signs of improvement.
Raw materials have been in short supply as global economies rebounded from the coronavirus pandemic. Shortages have also been exacerbated by the shift in demand to goods from services early in the pandemic. Millions of workers needed to produce and move raw materials remain sidelined. (Graphic: More jobs than jobseekers, https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-FED/JOBS/egvbkmeoepq/chart.png) 
U.S. stocks were trading mixed, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&P 500 index having hit fresh record highs earlier in the session. The dollar was flat against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices were mostly lower.
PRICE GAUGE FALLS
The nascent signs of improvement in supply chains suggest inflation at the factory gate could soon begin to subside. 
The survey's measure of prices paid by manufacturers tumbled to 68.2 last month, the lowest level since November 2020, from 82.4 in November. The 14.2-point plunge was the biggest since October 2011.
This supports the Federal Reserve's long-held view that the current period of high inflation is transitory. Inflation is well above the U.S. central bank's flexible 2% target.
""The report is consistent with our expectation that inflation will hit an inflection point probably in the first quarter of this year,"" said Tim Quinlan, a senior economist at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) in Charlotte, North Carolina. 
The ISM survey's forward-looking new orders sub-index fell to a still-high reading of 60.4 from 61.5 in November. With customer inventories remaining depressed, the slowdown in new order growth is likely to be temporary or limited. 
Factories hired more workers, but turnover rates remained high, a trend which manufacturers said started in August.
Indeed, a separate report from the Labor Department on Tuesday showed a record 4.5 million Americans voluntarily quit their jobs in November, which will put pressure on businesses to raise wages to attract workers. 
""Replacing those workers is proving unusually challenging,"" said Julia Pollak, chief economist at ZipRecruiter. ""This is the tightest labor market ever.""  
There were 10.6 million job openings at the end of November. The high number of vacancies meant there was 0.65 unemployed person per job opening, an all-time low. Before the pandemic, there were normally about 2.3 unemployed people per job opening. (Graphic: Quitting en masse, https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-ECONOMY/znpnelbrxvl/chart.png) 

The ISM's measure of manufacturing employment rose to an eight-month high of 54.2 from 53.3 in November. This, together with very low first-time applications for unemployment benefits, supports the view that job growth accelerated in December. 
According to a preliminary Reuters survey of economists, nonfarm payrolls likely increased by 400,000 jobs in December after rising by 210,000 in November. The Labor Department is scheduled to publish December's employment report on Friday.

The Federal Statistics Office said retail sales were up 0.6% on the month in real terms. That beat a Reuters forecast of a fall of 0.5%.
For 2021, retail sales rose 0.9% in real terms and 3.1% in nominal terms, reaching record highs despite curbs on non-essential visits to the shops.
""Due to renewed coronavirus restrictions, the situation will remain tense for the time being,"" said Alexander Krueger, an analyst with Hauck Aufhaeuser Lampe private bank.
With industry still struggling amid supply shortages in microchips and other components, it would be hard for manufacturing to fill the overall output gap created by weaker consumption, he added.
The GfK market research institute said last month that consumer morale would deteriorate further as the pandemic and rise of the Omicron variant push the economy to the brink of recession.
The Ifo institute expects the German economy to shrink by 0.5% on the quarter in the final three months of 2021 and stagnate in the first three months of 2022. This would bring Germany close to a technical recession, defined as two consecutive quarters of contraction.
High infection rates during the fourth coronavirus wave in Germany, triggered by the Delta variant, had already resulted in restrictions for retailers and service providers in December.
Germany banned unvaccinated people from entering non-essential establishments. The so-called 2G rule, which allows access only for vaccinated or recovered people, has hit the Christmas business.

The rapid spread of the Omicron variant is now clouding the outlook for retailers at the start of 2022 as well.
Chancellor Olaf Scholz and state premiers are expected to discuss further measures and restrictions at a pandemic emergency meeting on Friday.

The Labour Office said the number of people out of work fell by 23,000 in seasonally adjusted terms to 2.405 million. A Reuters poll had forecast a fall of 15,000.
""The labor market developed well at the end of the year. The recovery of the previous months continued,"" Labour Office head Detlef Scheele said.
The seasonally-adjusted jobless rate fell to 5.2%, the lowest since March 2020, when Germany entered its first coronavirus lockdown.
Scheele cautioned that a jump in COVID-19 cases and renewed restrictions to contain the spread of the disease increased uncertainties.

This was mirrored in the fact that more companies signalled in December they could soon put more workers on furlough again. 
In October, the latest month for which reliable data was available, the number of employees put on reduced working hours in job protection schemes, also known as Kurzarbeit, fell to some 710.000. That was sharply down from its peak of around 6 million reached in April 2020.

LONDON (Reuters) - British consumers increased their borrowing in November by the most since July 2020, according to Bank of England data which added to signs of an early Christmas spending spree by shoppers before the Omicron coronavirus variant hit the country.
Consumer credit rose by a net 1.233 billion pounds ($1.67 billion), stronger than the median forecast in a Reuters poll of economists for a rise of 800 million pounds.
Data published last month showed British retail sales rose faster than expected in November, helped by earlier-than-usual Black Friday discounts as well as early Christmas shopping. 
Tuesday's figures from the BoE showed consumer credit rose by 0.4% in the 12 months to November having fallen in the preceding months of 2021. It was the first 12-month increase since March 2020 when the COVID-19 pandemic hit Britain.
Bethany Beckett, an economist with Capital Economics, said the figures seemed like old news giving the recent surge in COVID infections which had probably hit willingness to borrow.
""And, with real household disposable incomes facing a squeeze from higher inflation and higher taxes in the coming months, we suspect consumer spending may struggle to make much headway over the next few quarters,"" she added. 
The BoE figures also showed mortgage approvals in Britain in November were the lowest since June 2020 after the expiry of a tax break for home buyers. Approvals edged down to 66,964 from October's 67,103.
Mortgage lending rose by a net 3.693 billion pounds, up from October's slump to 1.149 billion pounds after the stamp duty tax break expired fully at the end of September.

However, the increase in November was almost 3 billion pounds below the average in the 12 months to June when the tax break was in full effect, the BoE said, suggesting cooling demand in the housing market.

685,By Investing.com,"<span>Jan 03, 2022 11:42PM ET</span>",Chinse Manufacturing Grows Unexpectedly Faster in December,"By Gina Lee
Investing.com – China’s factory activity grew at a faster pace in December, thanks to production hikes and easing price pressures. However, a weaker job market and business confidence is weighing on the market.
Data released earlier in the day showed that the Caixin manufacturing purchasing managers’ index (PMI) was 50.9, the highest since June 2021 and above the 50-mark indicating growth. Forecasts prepared by Investing.com predicted a 50 figure, whereas the index was at 49.9 in November.
Official data from the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) released during the previous week showed that the manufacturing PMI was at 50.3 in December, up from the previous month’s reading of 50.1.
Governmental efforts to stabilize prices and increase supply, which eased price pressures for raw materials, contributed to faster factory activity.
However, the Caixin survey also showed a fall in both new export orders and a gauge for employment, which hit the lowest level since February of 2021.
""Supply was strong and demand rebounded. With the easing of supply constraints, output expanded for the second month in a row and at a faster pace. But the job market was still under pressure and businesses were less optimistic, indicating an unstable economic recovery. The repeated COVID-19 flare-ups and sluggish overseas demand were factors of instability,” Caixin Insight Group senior economist Wang Zhe told Reuters.
“Policymakers should focus on shoring up employment as well as on targeted support to small and midsize businesses,” Wang added.
Slower manufacturing growth, debt woes in the property sector, and sporadic COVID-19 outbreaks slowed down China’s economic recovery, after an initial strong start in 2020.
The People’s Bank of China has stated that it will maintain a flexible monetary policy in 2022 to stabilize growth and lower financing costs for businesses under economic headwinds.
On the COVID-19 front, various cities in China saw outbreaks. The eastern coastal province of Zhejiang saw a small-scale COVID-19 outbreak in December 2021, which has since subsided, but during which some firms were forced to suspend production. The northwestern city of Xi’an remains under a lockdown that began on Dec. 22, 2021, as an outbreak in the city continues."

China’s factory activity expanded in December as production and sales picked up, though employment remained weak, a private gauge showed Wednesday. 
The Caixin Manufacturing Purchasing Managers’ Index rose to 50.9 last month from November’s 49.9, Caixin and IHS Markit said in a statement Tuesday. Economists had expected a marginal improvement to 50, the dividing line between expansion and contraction. 
Output rose at the fastest pace in the past year, supported by improved market conditions and stronger customer demand, while inflation eased, according to the statement. Employment fell for the fifth month in a row, with the sub-index dropping to 48.7, the weakest since February last year. 
“Manufacturing demand and supply improved in December with easing inflationary pressure,” said Wang Zhe, a senior economist at Caixin Insight Group, which released the data. “But the job market was still under pressure and businesses were less optimistic, indicating unstable economic recovery.”
Total new orders increased as virus flare-ups were largely brought under control, while external demand was lackluster, according to the statement. Factory inflation eased from the peak, with the average input costs rising at the weakest rate for 19 months in December.
The findings are in line with official data released last week that showed a slight acceleration in the purchasing managers’ index from the previous month. The Caixin index surveys mainly smaller and private companies, while the official PMI mostly covers larger, state-owned enterprises. 
China’s economy is facing rising pressure on multiple fronts, with policy makers focusing efforts on stabilizing growth with “proactive” policies. The housing market is struggling, local government finances are being hit by weak land sales and there has been a series of recent Covid-19 outbreaks, including one which caused authorities to lock down the city of Xi’an.

The relative strength in the Caixin PMI tallies with an official survey released on Friday which showed China's factory activity edged up.
Factory output increased at the fastest pace in a year, the private survey showed, helped by easing price pressures. A gauge of input prices fell to the lowest level since May 2020.
Soaring raw materials prices, which have weighed on manufacturers, have eased recently amid government efforts to increase supply and stabilise prices.
But the survey also showed new export orders fell, albeit at a slower pace, and a gauge for employment continued to contract, hitting the lowest level since February.

""But the job market was still under pressure and businesses were less optimistic, indicating unstable economic recovery. The repeated Covid-19 flare-ups and sluggish overseas demand were factors of instability.""
The world's second-largest economy has lost momentum since the early summer after rebounding from last year's pandemic slump, weighed down by a slowing manufacturing sector, debt problems in the property market, and small-scale COVID-19 outbreaks.
Analysts expect a further slowdown in fourth-quarter gross domestic product (GDP), after the economy grew 4.9% in July-September.
The wealthy Zhejiang province on China's eastern coast saw a small-scale COVID-19 outbreak in December, which has now subsided, but some firms were forced to suspend production.
In the northwest, the industrial and tech hub of Xian has been under lockdown as a local outbreak continues to spread in the city of 13 million.
This year, debt crises at major real estate developers amid a crackdown on the property sector have also hurt an industry critical to China's economic growth.

The central bank has said it will keep monetary policy flexible next year as it seeks to stabilise growth and lower financing costs for businesses amid growing economic headwinds.

688,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 03, 2022 12:56PM ET</span>","Turkish inflation soars to 36%, highest in Erdogan era","By Daren Butler and Jonathan Spicer
ISTANBUL (Reuters) - Turkey's annual inflation rate surged to 36.1% last month, its highest in the 19 years that Tayyip Erdogan has ruled, laying bare the depths of a currency crisis engineered by the president's unorthodox interest rate-cutting policies.
In December alone, consumer prices took a rare step into double-digits, rising 13.58%, Turkish Statistical Institute data showed on Monday, eating deeper into the earnings and savings of Turks rattled by the economic turmoil.
The year-over-year CPI outstripped a median Reuters poll forecast of 30.6% with staples such as transportation and food - which took increasing shares of households' budgets during 2021 - rising even faster.
Turkey's lira shed 44% of its value last year as the central bank slashed interest rates under a drive by Erdogan to prioritise credit and exports over currency and price stability.
On Monday the currency whipsawed down 5% then up 3%. It stood at 13.0790 versus the dollar at 1734 GMT, some 0.8% firmer than Friday's close.
Some economists predict inflation could reach as high as 50% by spring unless the direction of monetary policy is reversed. Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) said it would remain above 40% for most of the year ahead.
""Rates should be immediately and aggressively hiked because this is urgent,"" said Ozlem Derici Sengul, founding partner at Spinn Consulting in Istanbul.
The central bank was however unlikely to act, she added, and annual inflation ""will probably reach 40-50% by March"", by when administered price rises would have been added into the mix, including a 50% minimum wage hike. 
Turkey now has the eighth-highest inflation in the world, according to a Trading Economics listing.
Last year was the worst for the lira in nearly two decades, while the annual CPI was the highest since the 37.0% reading of September of 2002, two months before Erdogan's AK Party first took office.
Erdogan's focus early on Monday was on trade data which showed exports surged by a third to $225 billion last year.
""We have only one concern: exports, exports and exports,"" he said in a speech, adding the trade data showed a six-fold rise in exports during his tenure as leader.
Later, Erdogan said he was ""saddened"" that Turks had to face such high inflation levels, pledging to bring it down to single digits as soon as possible.
To support the currency and replenish its depleted reserves, the central bank said on Monday it had asked exporters to sell 25% of their hard-currency revenues to the bank for lira.
""WE DON'T GO OUT"" 
Erdogan overhauled the central bank's leadership last year. The bank has slashed the policy rate to 14% from 19% since September, leaving Turkey with deeply negative real yields that have spooked savers and investors.
The subsequent accelerating surge in prices and drop in the lira have also upended household and company budgets, scuttled travel plans and left many Turks scrambling to cut costs. Many queued last month for subsidised bread in Istanbul, where the municipality says the cost of living is up 50% in a year. 
""We don't sit with our friends in a cafe and drink coffee any more,"" Mehmet, 26, a university graduate, said. ""We don't go out, just from home to work and back again.""
The central bank has argued that temporary factors had been driving prices and forecast a volatile course for inflation, which - having been around 20% in recent months and mostly double-digits over the last five years - it said in October would end the year at 18.4%. 
Sengul suggested that, with Monday's data, that argument had run its course.
""This reflects a vicious cycle of demand-pull inflation, which is very dangerous because the central bank had implied the price pressure was from cost-push (supply constraints), and that it couldn't do anything about it,"" she said. 
Reflecting soaring import prices, December's producer price index rose 19.08% month-on-month and 79.89% year on year. Annual transportation prices soared 53.66% while the food and drinks basket jumped 43.8%, the CPI data showed.

The economic turmoil has also hit Erdogan's opinion polls ahead of an election scheduled for no later than mid-2023.
The lira touched a record low of 18.4 against the dollar in December before rebounding sharply two weeks ago after state-backed market interventions, and after Erdogan announced a scheme to protect lira deposits against currency volatility.

The IHS Markit Mexico Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index was flat in December at 49.4, unchanged from November, but still below the 50 threshold that separates growth from contraction.
The index has consistently remained below that threshold every month since March 2020 and plummeted to 35.0 in April 2020 amid the fallout from the coronavirus pandemic, in what was by far the lowest reading in the survey's 10-1/2 year history.
""2021 was not a great year for Mexican manufacturers, and December was no different. The latest set of PMI data showed further contractions in output, new orders and exports, with respective sequences of reduction extended to 22 months,"" said Pollyanna De Lima, Economics Associate Director at IHS Markit.
Goods producers again indicated that limited container availability, transportation problems and global shortages of raw materials caused severe delays in average lead times, while supply chain issues pushed input costs higher in December, the survey said.
The overall rate of purchasing price inflation was the third-fastest on record.
Inflation in Mexico reached 7.45% in early December after averaging 7.37% in November, which was the highest rate in Mexico since early 2001, according to National statistics agency INEGI.

De Lima said that firms also continued to see their order books shrink as demand was dampened by a combination of market uncertainty, rising prices, reduced client requirements and an inability to distribute goods in a timely manner due to lingering problems sourcing raw materials. 
""Worryingly, companies don't expect supply-side problems and price pressures to dissipate in 2022. Business sentiment towards the year-ahead outlook for production fell to an eight-month low as said concerns mounted,"" said De Lima.

""This is a very strong recovery and rebound,"" she said. ""This year we still have the pandemic and we were hit by Delta and Omicron, but we managed to book a 21.6% growth.""
Total government spending for 2021 was 2,786.8 trillion rupiah, she said, citing the latest unaudited data.
For 2022, the government has a budget deficit outlook of 4.85%. By law, Indonesia's budget deficit must be under 3% of GDP in 2023.
Handy Yunianto, Mandiri Sekuritas's fixed income analyst, said this year's fiscal deficit has the potential to narrow further to 4.1% as some tax hikes approved by parliament in late 2021 are to be factored into the revenue target.
Those measures include an increase in value added tax rate, a new carbon tax in April and a tax amnesty programme that will run in the first half of 2022.
Josua Pardede, Bank Permata's economist, said that the 2022 fiscal deficit could come in at a range of 3.75%-4.25% of GDP.
However, Sri Mulyani said it would be hard to forecast 2022, arguing that she could not have predicted last year's events such as the spread of the Delta variant and the commodity boom.

""We hope the good result of 2021 will provide us some cushion for 2022,"" the minister said, noting the government had a 84.9 trillion rupiah cash reserves from last year that it can carry over and use this year.

Retail sales in November rose 7.1% from a year earlier to HK$30.7 billion ($3.94 billion), government data showed on Monday. That compares with a revised an 12.1% increase in October. 
""Provided that the local epidemic situation remains under control, the improving economic and labour market conditions should continue to provide support to the retail sector,"" a government spokesman said.
In volume terms, retail sales in November grew 4.2% from a year earlier, compared with a 9.4% surge the previous month.
For the first eleven months of 2021, total retail sales increased 8.3% in value terms and rose 6.8% in volume.
Online retail sales in November in value terms jumped 27.6% from a year earlier year compared with a revised figure of 33.9% growth in October.
Sales of jewellery, watches, clocks and valuable gifts, which before the pandemic relied heavily on tourists from the mainland, climbed 14.4% in November versus a 23.1% surge in October, the data showed.
Clothing, footwear and related products rose 16.6% in November against a 10.9% jump in October. 
Tourist arrivals in November soared 59.2% from a year earlier to 9,492. That compares with a 19.6% increase in October. However, total visitor arrivals from January to November plunged 97.7% year-on-year to 81,950.
The city's economy grew 5.4% in the third quarter from a year earlier, recovering from the pandemic-induced slump, but longer-term prospects depend on the impact of the government's zero-COVID policy.
The government in November revised its full-year economy growth forecast to 6.4%, close to the upper bound of the previous forecast range of 5.5%-6.5%. 

The seasonally adjusted unemployment rate slipped to 4.1% in the September-November quarter from 4.3% in the August-October period as the labour market improved along with an ongoing economic recovery.

The global coronavirus pandemic had left factories struggling to get the materials they need and sent costs soaring, but a tentative easing of the supply issues led to a marked decrease in price pressures.
IHS Markit's final manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) dipped to 58.0 in December from November's 58.4, matching an initial ""flash"" estimate and still comfortably above the 50 mark separating growth from contraction.
An index measuring output, which feeds into a composite PMI due on Wednesday and seen as a good guide to economic health, held steady at November's 53.8.
""It has been an incredibly challenging period for euro zone manufacturers this second half of 2021, but the latest survey data hasn't spoiled the festive cheer too much,"" said Joe Hayes, senior economist at IHS Markit.
""We're seeing some tentative, but very welcome signs that the supply chain crisis which has plagued production lines all across Europe is beginning to recede. Although what gains to be had were only marginal ... PMI data showed stocks of purchases rising at a survey-record rate in December""
That easing meant the input prices index sank to an albeit still high eight-month low of 86.7 from 88.9, allowing factories to raise their prices at a much slower pace than in November.

""Easing inflation rates are again a welcome sign, but we're still in hot territory,"" Hayes added.
The European Central Bank took another small step in rolling back crisis-era stimulus last month but raised its inflation projections and now sees it at 3.2% this year, well above its 2.0% target.

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Singapore's economy expanded at its fastest annual pace in over a decade in 2021 as the country emerged from its worst recession on record, caused by the deep hit to activity from the coronavirus pandemic.
The city-state's economy grew 7.2% in 2021, preliminary data showed on Monday, broadly in line with the government's official projection and rebounding from the record 5.4% contraction in 2020. 
The financial and transport hub, often seen as a bellwether of global growth, has staged a rocky recovery as governments around the world shift their coronavirus strategies to living with the pandemic, away from ""zero-COVID"" policies.
Singapore's annual gross domestic product growth was the fastest since a 14.5% expansion in 2010, when the economy emerged from the global financial crisis.
""I'm expecting growth to be relatively buoyant. As the world economy starts to improve, I think that will also help to support the overall external demand conditions for Singapore,"" said MUFG analyst Jeff Ng. ""The main threat continues to be inflation.""
The government has previously said it expects GDP to grow 3% to 5% in 2022.
GDP rose 5.9% in October-December on a year-on-year basis, the Ministry of Trade and Industry said in a statement, faster than the 5.4% growth forecast in a Reuters poll on analysts.
GDP grew 2.6% on a quarter-on-quarter seasonally adjusted basis in October-December, higher than the 1.2% growth in preceding quarter.
PRICE PRESSURES
Separately, the Southeast Asian city-state on Monday posted a preliminary 5% rise in private home prices in the fourth quarter, the most since 2010.
The government implemented a package of measures to cool its property market last month, including raising stamp duties and tightening loan limits.
Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said last week in his New Year message Singapore's economy is recovering steadily and that the government sees a need to start raising sales tax.
The government has flagged a plan to raise the goods and services tax by 2 percentage points to 9% between 2022 and 2025. 
While analysts expect the economy to continue to grow, they cautioned that the Omicron coronavirus variant could become a drag if social distancing rules are tightened again.
The city-state has vaccinated 87% of its population. As of Saturday, 41% of the population has received their COVID-19 booster shot.
Sung Eun Jung at Oxford Economics expects growth to be led more by the service sector than the manufacturing in 2022 as domestic demand momentum improves.
""We expect monetary and fiscal policies will further tighten this year with planned GST hike adding to rising price pressures,"" she said.
Economists widely expect the central bank to tighten again in April this year as price pressures persist. Similar to major financial hubs around the world, Singapore has seen its inflation rate rise in the past few months with headline prices up 3.8% in November, the fastest in nine years. 

The Singapore dollar weakened slightly in thin trade on Monday, in line with modest gains for the U.S. dollar in the broader market. At S$1.3510 per dollar, it is not far from the seven-week high it touched at the close of last year and analysts said the GDP figure would likely be supportive.
The Monetary Authority of Singapore unexpectedly tightened its monetary policy at its last meeting in October amid mounting inflationary pressures caused by supply constraints and a recovery in the global economy.

696,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jan 02, 2022 11:45PM ET</span>",Turkish Inflation Seen Hitting 19-Year Record Amid Lira Woes,"(Bloomberg) -- Turkish inflation is expected to surge to a 19-year high in December, propelled by a slump in the lira and President Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s push for cheaper borrowing. 
Data due Monday will show consumer prices rose for a seventh straight month to an annual 27.36%, compared to 21.31% in November, according to the median estimate in a Bloomberg survey of 19 economists.
Turkey’s central bank has slashed its benchmark interest rate by 500 basis points since September in a series of moves encouraged by Erdogan, who has attacked higher rates as a challenge for businesses and a brake on economic growth. The cuts have sent the lira into a tailspin that’s fueled consumer price rises. 
The lira recovered some of its losses in December after Erdogan introduced a mechanism that promises to compensate holders of the lira when the currency weakens to a certain level. However, the currency remains about 31% weaker than it was on Sept. 23, when the central bank started cutting interest rates. It remains the worst performer among emerging market currencies against the dollar this year, with a slump of around 43%. 
How Erdogan’s Plan to Halt the Lira’s Fall Is Meant to Work 
“We expect a broad-based surge in inflation in December due to the depreciation in the lira until the introduction of the new lira deposit scheme,” said Ibrahim Aksoy, Istanbul-based chief economist at HSBC Asset Management. “While the lira has recovered with the new lira deposit facility, the possible retail price declines will probably be limited due to the high costs incurred when the lira was weaker.”
The recent rate reductions sent real yields deeper into negative territory as consumer inflation climbed in the fourth quarter. Though rising inflation has hurt Erdogan’s popularity ahead of the 2023 election, he’s insisted he will push on with a policy shift he said aims to boost manufacturing and exports and reduce the influence of international markets on Turkish monetary policy.  
The central bank expects inflation to follow a volatile course though it expects its looser monetary stance will see inflation resume its downward trend “once temporary effects disappear.” 
The bank has repeatedly said that transient factors rather than lower interest rates are behind the latest surge in prices. Turkey’s monthly inflation will begin to slow in January as the lira stabilizes and the government cracks down on unjustified price increased, Finance Minister Nureddin Nebati said on Wednesday in a televised interview.  
“A wide-ranging deterioration in price dynamics, higher trend inflation as well as an increase in the FX pass-through points to a more challenging inflation outlook in 2022” said Ehsan Khoman, head of emerging market research for Europe, Middle East and Africa at MUFG Bank in Dubai. “Our CPI estimates remain well-north of 20% until the fourth quarter of 2022.” 
The central bank raised its year-end inflation estimate to 18.4% from 14.1% in inflation report published in October. The next inflation report will be published on Jan. 27. The central bank will hold its next rate-setting meeting on Jan. 20.

The AIB IHS Markit manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) fell to 58.3 in December from 59.9 in November, having hit a record 64.1 in May, the survey showed. Readings above 50 indicate overall rises in activity.
From October to December, the PMI registered 60.1, down from 62.1 in the third quarter and 62.9 in the second but higher than in any previous quarter since the survey began.
Cost pressures remained intense with raw materials, fuel, energy and transport charges cited as driving inflation. While the input prices subindex eased to a three-month low, it was still higher than at any period prior to October's peak.
Manufacturers continued to pass higher costs on to customers, with output prices increasing at the third-fastest rate since the data series began in 2002.

""Manufacturing production is still expanding at a rapid pace, with new orders recording another marked rise, though growth in export orders remains muted,"" AIB chief economist Oliver Mangan said.
""Employment in the sector continued to grow at a solid pace. Meanwhile, manufacturers were very positive on the 12-month outlook for production, with sentiment hitting its best level since July.""

The IHS Markit purchasing managers' index (PMI) for the final month of the year rose to 51.9 from 50.9 in November, remaining above the 50 threshold that indicates expansion in activity for a 15th consecutive month.
The survey on Monday showed output continued to shrink on supply chain constraints, with firms facing semiconductor chip shortages and weak demand, though the pace was the mildest in three months.
New orders - which have the largest weighting in the PMI - grew at a faster pace as domestic demand conditions improved, offsetting sluggish overseas sales.
""Survey data showed new export orders falling for the first time since September 2020, which firms attributed to rising COVID-19 cases globally, congestion at ports and a lack of available shipping containers,"" said Joe Hayes, senior economist at IHS Markit.
Manufacturers continued to face acute cost pressures, notably in oil, natural gas, ores and electronics prices, which led them to pass higher charges on to clients.
Firms, however, remained optimistic over the coming year that supply chain pressure would ease as global economic conditions improve and on hopes for new product developments.
That led to a pick up in hiring, following two straight months of job shedding, with the rate of growth accelerating to a six-month high.

Still, economist say supply shortages need to show significant improvement for manufacturing to make a solid turnaround.
""Given South Korea's prominence in the automotive and electronics industries, substantial improvements in global supply chains will be required before we see a meaningful acceleration in manufacturing growth,"" Hayes said.

SEOUL (Reuters) -South Korea's exports expanded at their fastest pace in 11 years in 2021, with the total export value reaching a record high, supported by post-pandemic recoveries in global demand.
For the full year, exports rose 25.8% from a year earlier to $644.54 billion, trade ministry data showed on Saturday, the fastest pace since 2010. 
That also marked the first growth in three years after contractions of 5.5% and 10.4% in 2020 and 2019, respectively.
""Now is the time to head towards the $700 billion export-era ... The trade ministry will step up policy efforts so that industries and exports can tow the complete (economic) normalisation this year,"" Minister Moon Sung-wook said.
A breakdown by items showed exports of semiconductors jumped 29% year-on-year to a record $128 billion, while those of petrochemicals also surged 54.8% to a record $55.1 billion. Other items such as cars and steel jumped 24.2% and 37%, respectively.
By destination, exports to China, South Korea's biggest trading partner, rose 22.9%, and those to the United States and the European Union jumped 29.4% and 33.9%.
Meanwhile, imports for the full year jumped 31.5% to a record $615.1 billion, rebounding from a 7.1% contraction in 2020.
Moon also said the ministry is reviewing joining the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP) and aims for more trade pacts to expand its export markets.
Saturday's data also showed exports in the final month of the year expanded 18.3% year-on-year, extending growth into a 14th straight month, though the rate was slower than 32% in November. A Reuters' poll of 13 economists had expected 22% growth.

Total exports stood at $60.74 billion in December, the largest ever monthly figure.
A 35.1% jump in semiconductors exports led December growth, while overall exports to China and the United States also soared 20.8% and 22.9%, respectively.

(Reuters) -U.S. President Joe Biden and Senator Joe Manchin spoke about the ""Build Back Better"" bill a day after the conservative Democratic senator publicly rejected the president's social spending plans, a White House adviser said on Friday.
""He (Biden) has some confidence about that (bill), including discussions he has had with Senator Manchin,"" Jared Bernstein, a member of the White House council of economic advisers, said in an interview with CNN on Friday.
""The president and Senator Manchin - the day after that announcement where the senator said he couldn't vote for the bill as it was - they were talking again.""
Reuters previously reported that Biden and Manchin made no significant progress in the talks after Manchin's rejection of the plan earlier in December but aides felt reassured that lines of communication were still open and cordial. Biden told reporters this week that the pair have not spoken since then.
Manchin's rejection imperils the legislation because his support is crucial in the Senate where the Democrats have the slimmest margin of control and Republicans are united in their opposition to the bill. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer has said the chamber would vote on a package in early 2022.
Manchin's move prompted investment bank Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) to lower its forecasts for U.S. economic growth. Manchin's rejection of the bill threatened to scuttle hundreds of billions of dollars in funding for measures to fight climate change and meet the Biden administration's climate goals.
Manchin has expressed concerns about a number of proposals in Biden's signature domestic policy bill, including multiple climate proposals and extending monthly child tax credit payments.

Biden told reporters after Manchin's rejection that he and the senator were ""going to get something done"" on the legislation.
U.S. Representative Pramila Jayapal, a leading liberal House Democrat, has asked Biden to continue focusing on the social spending legislation and urged him to use executive action despite Manchin's public rejection of the plan.

The COVID-19 pandemic dampened wine trade globally in 2020, the latest year for which data are available, as restaurants and bars remained closed for long periods.
Champagne was hit the hardest. Sales outside the EU of the famed French sparkling wine fell over 20% by volume to 66 million litres in 2020 from nearly 84 million litres the previous year.
That largely contributed to a 6% overall drop in EU exports of sparkling wines last year compared to 2019, the Eurostat data showed.
EU exports fell from a peak of 528 million litres in 2019 to 494 million litres in 2020 - still nearly twice the level recorded in 2010.
Of the three main categories of sparkling wine exported from the EU, only champagne recorded a significant drop by volume.
Prosecco, which is by far the most exported, recorded sales outside the EU of 205 million litres in 2020, compared to nearly 207 million litres in 2019.
Cava, which is produced in Spain, bucked the trend by increasing its extra-EU exports by more than 10% to 58 million litres in 2020, getting closer to replacing champagne as the second most sold EU sparkling wine outside the 27-nation bloc. 

Total champagne sales, including in the EU, fell 18% last year by volume, producers' group CIVC has estimated.
Despite the drop in sales by volume, vintage champagnes have proven a lucrative draw for investors this year, outperforming all major financial market assets from Big Tech to bitcoin. Salon le Mesnil's 2002 vintage surged more than 80% in value in 2021 on online platforms.

The official manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) rose to 50.3 from 50.1 in November, data from the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) showed. 
Analysts had expected it to fall slightly to the 50-point mark, which separates growth from contraction. 
The world's second-largest economy has lost steam since the early summer after rebounding from last year's pandemic slump, weighed down by a slowing manufacturing sector, debt problems in the property market, carbon emissions-related curbs, and small-scale COVID-19 outbreaks. 
Next year, China will face ""unprecedented"" difficulty in stabilising trade, Vice Commerce Minister Ren Hongbin warned on Thursday, as production capacity in other exporting countries recovers from COVID-induced shocks and competes with Chinese exports. 
""Looking to January, we expect the manufacturing PMI to fall to 50.0, weighed on by the stricter-than-usual anti-pollution measures to ensure blue skies for the upcoming Winter Olympics that will start in early February and contracting demand as result of the property downturn and slowing export growth,"" Nomura economists wrote in a note. 
Data from the statistics bureau showed a sub-index for new orders improved slightly in December but remained in contraction, at 49.7 versus 49.4 in November. 
New export orders shrank further, with the sub-index coming in at 48.1 compared with 48.5 a month earlier, indicating fragile overseas demand.
A sub-index for production remained in positive territory at 51.4, but was lower than November's 52.0.
""Compared with previous cycles, we believe the pain threshold is higher, as Beijing has given more weight to long-term targets than to short-term growth stability,"" Nomura said.
""Still, there is a limit to how much they will allow growth to slow, and this limit could be seriously tested in the spring of 2022.""
COVID DISRUPTIONS
The wealthy Zhejiang province on China's eastern coast saw a small-scale COVID-19 outbreak in December, which has now subsided, but some firms were forced to suspend production. 
In the northwest, the industrial and tech hub of Xian has been under lockdown as a local outbreak continues to spread in the city of 13 million.
Samsung Electronics (OTC:SSNLF) and Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU), two of the world's largest memory-chip makers, have warned that the ongoing lockdown of the city could affect their chip manufacturing bases in the area.
Activity in China's overall services sector grew at a slightly faster pace in December, rising to 52.7 from November's 52.3. 
China's official composite PMI, which includes both manufacturing and services activity, stood at 52.2 in December, unchanged from November. 
Analysts expect a further slowdown in fourth-quarter gross domestic product (GDP) after the economy grew 4.9% in July-September.
Debt crises at major real estate developers amid a crackdown on the property sector have hurt an industry critical to China's economic growth.
The central bank in mid-December cut the reserve requirement ratio (RRR) - the amount of cash that banks must hold in reserve - to bolster slowing economic growth.
The bank has said it will keep monetary policy flexible next year as it seeks to stabilise growth and lower financing costs for businesses amid the growing economic headwinds. 

Bruce Pang, head of macro and strategy research at China Renaissance Securities, said he expected more support measures to be rolled out. 
""In our view, 2022 should bring more targeted easing to engineer a soft landing and support SMEs, high-tech and innovation firms, advanced manufacturing and green industries,"" Pang said.

The official manufacturing purchasing managers’ index rose to 50.3, beating the median estimate of 50, the National Bureau of Statistics said Friday. The non-manufacturing gauge, which measures activity in the construction and services sectors, increased to 52.7, above the consensus forecast. The 50-mark separates expansion from contraction in conditions. 
China’s economy is facing rising pressure on multiple fronts, with policy makers announcing a shift in focus to stabilizing growth next year with “proactive” policies. However, the housing market is still struggling, local government finances are being hit by weak land sales and there has been a series of recent Covid-19 outbreaks, including one which caused authorities to lockdown the city of Xi’an. 
Friday’s data showed China’s economy maintained its recovery trend, Zhao Qinghe, senior statistician at the NBS, said in a statement. The manufacturing PMI climbed for a second straight month as some commodities prices fell significantly and cost pressures of companies eased to some extent, he said. 
However, insufficient demand remains a main problem for manufacturers. More than 39% of the surveyed companies said they face such issues, indicating “the problem of shrinking demand is still prominent,” Zhang Liqun, a researcher with the State Council’s Development Research Center, said in a statement released by the China Federation of Logistics and Purchasing.
New orders remained subdued and new export orders worsened, highlighting the pressure China faces to stabilize trade next year. Construction activity cooled, with the sub-index falling to 56.3 due to cold weather and the approach of holidays, Zhao said. 
The property downturn continues to dampen sentiment and slow down construction activities, and government pressure on local governments to borrow and spend isn’t yet having much effect in boosting investment and construction. 
A set of earliest available indicators tracked by Bloomberg suggested that while the economy remained stable overall, the slumping property sector and slowing external demand are clouding the outlook.

Investing.com – Chinese factory activity rose in December, in a surprise move as the country attempts to curb its latest COVID-19 outbreaks.
Data from the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) released earlier in the day showed that the manufacturing Purchasing Manager’s Index (PMI) increased to 50.3 in December, up from the previous month’s reading of 50.1. Forecasts prepared by Investing.com predicted a 50 figure.
Meanwhile, the non-manufacturing PMI rose to 52.7 from November’s 52.3.
Economic recovery in the world’s second-largest economy has lost steam since early summer 2021, after an initial strong recovery in 2020. Slower manufacturing growth, a debt-ridden property sector and resurgence of COVID-19 outbreaks all contributed to this slowdown.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. health experts on Thursday urged Americans to prepare for severe disruptions in coming weeks as the rising wave of COVID-19 cases led by the Omicron variant threatened hospitals, schools and other sectors impacting their daily lives.
The warning came as the United States reached a record high in COVID-19 cases, while federal officials issued more travel warnings and reportedly prepared to authorize booster shots for 12 to 15-year-olds next week.
For the second day in a row, the United States had a record number of new reported cases based on the seven-day average, with more than 290,000 new infections reported each day, a Reuters tally showed. 
At least 18 states and Puerto Rico have set pandemic records for new cases, according to the tally. Maryland, Ohio and Washington, D.C., also saw record hospitalizations as overall U.S. COVID-19 hospitalizations rose 27%.
The surge comes amid increased holiday travel, with New Year's celebrations still to come, and as schools grapple with students' return to classrooms following winter breaks. 
""We are going to see the number of cases in this country rise so dramatically, we are going to have a hard time keeping everyday life operating,"" Dr. Michael Osterholm, an infectious disease expert at the University of Minnesota, told MSNBC.

Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation's top infectious disease official, on Wednesday said cases will likely rise throughout January, a warning echoed by the governor of Louisiana, where hospitalizations have more than tripled in the past two weeks.
""We are still at the very beginning of this current surge,"" John Bel Edwards told a news conference on Thursday. ""January is going to be very, very challenging."" 
U.S. health officials have said early data show Omicron appears less severe but have continued to push vaccinations, masks and physical distancing. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has also issued new guidelines shortening isolation and quarantine periods, which have been criticized by some disease experts https://www.reuters.com/world/us/no-tests-no-problem-experts-question-new-us-cdc-policy-covid-isolation-period-2021-12-29 and health care workers.
U.S. health regulators plan to approve a third vaccine dose for 12 to 15-year-olds next week, according to media reports. Boosters are already approved for those 16 and older.
With testing shortages and breakthrough cases, experts warn the surge would stress hospitals and businesses, although some state and city leaders said on Thursday they would keep schools open for children returning from winter break next week.
""We are committed in Arkansas to in-class instruction,"" Arkansas Governor Asa Hutchinson said. ""It’s so important to our future, to our students, to their mental health.""
Rising hospitalizations as healthcare workers are sidelined with their own COVID-19 infections is also concerning, as are fewer effective therapeutics, Dr. Peter Hotez, an infectious disease expert at Baylor College of Medicine, told CNN.
A rise in in hospitalization of children across the United States has also fueled concerns. 
Already, 825,663 people have died in the United States from COVID-19 since early 2020, data showed, with the latest wave of hospitalizations driven by those not vaccinated.
President Joe Biden this month announced new plans to combat Omicron, but some experts have criticized the measures as arriving too late.
'HUNKER DOWN'
Cruise operators took a hit on Thursday after the CDC warned people to avoid cruises regardless of their vaccination status due to onboard outbreaks, a potential drag on an economy that otherwise appears to be holding up. 
While airline travel has been widely disrupted, holiday sales were strong, new claims for state unemployment benefits fell last week to their lowest level of the pandemic, and U.S. stocks hit record highs on Thursday.
How schools handle the surge is also key, especially for working parents. U.S. Education Secretary Miguel Cardona told MSNBC that schools should stay open and that federal funds were available for staffing and testing to help make that happen.
""We can't shut down our city again,"" New York City Mayor-elect Eric Adams said while unveiling his plan on Thursday to fight COVID-19 while keeping the country's most populous city -- including its schools -- open for business.
Conditions should improve after January, as testing shortages ease and recently-approved medicines become more widely available, experts said. 
""We do have light at the end of the tunnel,"" said University of Minnesota's Osterholm. ""But for right now, you're going to have to hunker down.""
In Arkansas, which on Thursday reported a record high of 4,978 new cases, Hutchinson said the state would make 1.5 million at-home tests available to residents, a move he hoped would free up health care workers to staff hospitals.

West Virginia Governor Jim Justice urged the relatively high proportion of unvaccinated people in his state to get inoculated but said he was against mandates.
If the situation worsens ""and a bunch more people die, you'll have a run on the bank as far as people running to get vaccinated or to get their booster shots,"" Justice said.

The official manufacturing Purchasing Manager's Index (PMI) is expected to fall to 50 in December, from 50.1 in November, according to the median forecast of 24 economists polled by Reuters on Thursday. A reading below 50 indicates contraction from the previous month, above 50 expansion.
""We expect NBS manufacturing PMI to moderate to 49.9 in December from 50.1 in November,"" said analysts at Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) in a note this week, referring to the National Bureau of Statistics.
""(The) COVID outbreak in Zhejiang province since mid-December probably affected industrial activities, and container throughput data also pointed to weaker trade growth in December compared with November,"" they said.
The wealthy Zhejiang province, on China's eastern coast, saw a small-scale COVID-19 outbreak earlier this month, which has now subsided. Some firms were forced to suspend production. 
The world's second-largest economy, which staged an impressive rebound from last year's pandemic-induced slump, has lost momentum since the second half as it grapples with a slowing manufacturing sector, debt problems in the property market and sporadic small COVID-19 outbreaks. 
Analysts expect a further slowdown in fourth quarter gross domestic product (GDP) growth.
China's central city of Xian reported on Thursday more than 100 new cases of COVID-19, taking its tally of locally transmitted infections to the highest in any Chinese city this year.
Samsung Electronics (OTC:SSNLF) and Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU), two of the world's largest memory-chip makers, have warned that the ongoing lockdown of the city could affect their chip manufacturing bases in the area.

Profits at China's industrial firms grew at a much slower pace in November, the statistics bureau said on Monday, pressured by falling prices of some raw materials, a faltering property market and weaker consumer demand.
The official PMI, which largely focuses on big and state-owned firms, and its sister survey on the services sector, will be released on Friday. The private Caixin manufacturing PMI will be published on Jan. 4.

The 12-month inflation rate to November was 5.5%, and analysts polled by Reuters had expected the final 2021 reading to come to 5.7%.
Prices increased 1.3% in December from November, compared with a 0.2% rise in December 2020, INE said.
Electricity fees drove the annual price index to the 32-year high, INE said, adding that prices for food also rose significantly in 2021, after a general decline the previous year.
The inflation rate for 2021 was the highest since a 6.9% increase in 1989, when the country was experiencing a rapid economic expansion after joining the European Community, as the European Union was then called, in 1986.

Spain also registered an annual inflation rate of 6.9% in March 1992.

Economists polled by Reuters had expected prices to rise by a monthly 0.5%.
House prices this month were 10.4% higher than in December 2020 and the average price of a property stood at record high of 254,822 pounds ($343,296.20).
Britain's housing market rebounded strongly after the first coronavirus lockdown in 2020 and has powered ahead since then, helped by a now-lapsed tax break for buyers and by ongoing demand for bigger properties as more people work from home.
""It appears likely that the housing market will slow next year, since the stamp duty holiday encouraged many to bring forward their house purchase in order to avoid additional tax,"" Robert Gardner, Nationwide's chief economist, said.
But the outlook remained extremely uncertain, he said.

""The market still has significant momentum and shifts in housing preferences as a result of the pandemic could continue to support activity and price growth,"" Gardner said.

The Markit purchasing managers index (PMI) for the services sector rose to 49.5 from 47.1 in November but remained below the 50 mark that separates expansion from contraction.
""The sector has been particularly hard-hit by COVID-19 restrictions, especially those in consumer-facing industries,"" said Sian Jones, senior economist at survey compiler IHS Markit.
Weak demand from domestic and foreign clients led to spare capacity, resulting in a renewed contraction in workforce numbers, the monthly survey showed.
Cost burdens rose across the service sector, with higher input prices attributed to unfavourable exchange rates, rising fuel and salary costs as well as increased subcontractor fees.

The degree of confidence among service sector companies fell to its lowest since October 2020 although hopes for a recovery in client demand remained in place.
""Headwinds facing Russian private sector firms will be significant going into 2022, as high inflation, growing COVID-19 cases and weak demand threaten the near-term outlook,"" Jones said.

Industrial production rose 5.1% in November from the previous month, the statistics office said Thursday, ending three months of declines and beating economists’ estimate for a 2.5% increase. Automobile production gained 11.3% as a supply shortage of chips eased, while semiconductor manufacturing increased 4.5%.
Korea’s output rebound, along with improvements seen in Japan, adds further evidence that global manufacturing was on the mend before the new variant disrupted economic re-openings in some countries. Outside the pandemic, the monthly production gain was the biggest seasonally adjusted gain since 2009.

Korea’s preliminary trade figures last week suggest global demand has held up despite a worsening of the pandemic, but there’s much uncertainty as to whether the momentum will be carried over into 2022. 
While countries are refraining from re-imposing harsh lockdowns, heightened caution against the variant may still weigh on business activity.  
Finance Minister Hong Nam-ki said in a Thursday Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) post that the November gains in output fully recovered the losses in the past three months and contributed to the fastest increase in facilities investment since 2014.

713,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 29, 2021 01:41PM ET</span>",U.S. goods trade gap hits record; pending home sales slip,"By Dan Burns
(Reuters) - The U.S. trade deficit in goods mushroomed to the widest ever in November as imports of consumer goods shot to a record ahead of the second straight COVID-distorted holiday shopping season along with industrial supplies, while exports slipped after a historic gain a month earlier.
The goods trade gap reported Wednesday by the Commerce Department is likely to remain historically high as long as the coronavirus pandemic continues, economists said. The emergence of the fast-spreading Omicron variant of COVID-19 that has driven U.S. and global caseloads to a record this week may exacerbate it further in the near term if it limits American consumers' spending on services and restokes demand for imported goods.
Omicron also stands as a downside risk in the housing market. A reading of pending home sales also out Wednesday showed an unexpected drop in November, and while that data largely predated Omicron's ascendance in the United States, the highly contagious new variant could further limit home sales in the near term, the National Association of Realtors (NAR) said.
The goods trade deficit widened last month by 17.5% to $97.8 billion from $83.2 billion in October, Census Bureau data showed. That exceeds the previous record deficit set in September of $97 billion and may damp optimism that trade might finally add to U.S. economic growth this quarter for the first time in more than a year.
Imports rose by 4.7% with industrial supplies leading the way with an increase of $5.7 billion to $63.2 billion, followed by consumer goods rising by $2.9 billion to just shy of $67 billion as retailers rushed to fill store shelves ahead of Christmas. Both were record highs.
""The emergence of the Omicron variant may further ignite demand for imported goods if services activity is restricted"" in the first quarter of 2022, Nancy Vanden Houten, lead economist at Oxford Economics, wrote after Wednesday's report.
Goods exports, meanwhile, declined 2.1%, with weakness across the board outside of a 4.3% increase in food exports. The drop was led by declines of $1.4 billion in industrial supplies in and $1.3 billion in capital goods.
The worldwide surge of coronoavirus cases to a record in recent days - including a record U.S. caseload - may weigh on global demand in the months ahead, risking an even wider trade gap, Vanden Houten said. (Graphic: U.S. goods trade deficit hits a record, https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-ECONOMY/znvneldmbpl/chart.png) 
The so-called Advance Indicators report also showed wholesale inventories climbed 1.2% last month, while retail inventories increased 2.0%. Retail inventories, excluding autos, which go into the calculation of gross domestic product, edged up by 1.3% to $465.2 billion, the latest in a string of record-high readings.
The economy grew at a 2.3% annualized rate in the third quarter, a step-down from earlier in the year but activity has rebounded in the fourth quarter with a consensus among economists building around a growth rate of 6% to 7% in the final three months of 2021.
Trade has been a drag on gross domestic product growth for five straight quarters, while inventories added to output in the third quarter. 
Earlier this month, the Commerce Department reported a sharp reduction in the overall trade deficit - including services - for October, which had generated some optimism that trade may contribute to the improvement in output in the final quarter of the year. The big reversal to a record goods trade gap in November may prompt a rethinking of that.
Economists at Action Economics have dialed back their fourth-quarter GDP growth estimate to 6.5% from 7.0%, with exports now seen subtracting from growth rather than adding to it as had been previously expected. Economists at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) and Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), meanwhile, left their estimates intact at 7%.
Meanwhile, contracts to buy U.S. previously owned homes fell unexpectedly in November as limited housing stock and lofty prices crimped activity, and the explosion of new coronavirus cases poses a risk to the housing market headed into 2022. 
NAR said its Pending Home Sales Index, based on signed contracts, fell 2.2% last month to 122.4. Pending home sales were lower in all four regions.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast contracts, which typically become final sales after a month or two, would rise 0.5% in November.

""There was less pending home sales action this time around, which I would ascribe to low housing supply, but also to buyers being hesitant about home prices,"" said Lawrence Yun, NAR's chief economist.
Looking ahead, Yun said Omicron poses a risk to the housing market's performance, as buyers and sellers are sidelined, and home construction is delayed.

Economists polled by Reuters had forecast contracts, which typically become final sales after a month or two, would rise 0.5% in November.
Pending home sales dropped 2.7% in November on a year-on-year basis. Limited inventory has led to double-digit growth in home prices.
""There was less pending home sales action this time around, which I would ascribe to low housing supply, but also to buyers being hesitant about home prices,"" said Lawrence Yun, NAR's chief economist. ""While I expect neither a price reduction, nor another year of record-pace price gains, the market will see more inventory in 2022 and that will help some consumers with affordability.""
Demand for housing shot up early in the coronavirus pandemic as Americans decamped from city centers to suburbs and other, less densely populated areas in a hunt for larger homes to accommodate online schooling and working from home.
The market cooled off in the first half of the year as limited inventory lifted prices beyond the reach of many would-be buyers. Also the rollout of vaccines fueled optimism that people would be able to return to work in offices in urban areas and other business districts.
Activity has picked up again in recent months, however. The combined annual sales rate of new and existing U.S. homes reached 7.2 million units in November, the highest since January.

Now, though, new variants of COVID-19 - first Delta and now Omicron - have swept across the country, forcing employers to retreat again on large-scale return-to-office plans. The U.S. coronavirus caseload has shot to a record in the last week, according to a Reuters tally, surpassing the previous peak set early this year.
NAR's Yun said Omicron, the highly transmissible variant seen driving the latest surge in infections, poses a risk to the housing market's performance, as buyers and sellers are sidelined, and home construction is delayed.

October's seasonally adjusted contraction was the third month-on-month decline in economic activity in a row, figures from national statistics agency INEGI showed.
A Reuters poll of analysts had forecast the economy would grow by 0.8% during October following a disappointing third quarter in which gross domestic product (GDP) shrank by 0.4%.
""Going forward, lingering supply-chain frictions, cost-push pressures, policy uncertainty, and weak business confidence are likely to weigh on the broad industrial sector for a while,"" Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) economist Alberto Ramos said in a client note.
Still, Ramos said Mexico's economy had room to grow and should benefit in coming quarters from terms of trade, increasing COVID-19 vaccinations, and normalization of activity in sectors still lagging, particularly services.
Separate INEGI data showed exports performed strongly in November, reaching a record $43.9 billion in seasonally adjusted terms, and contributing to an adjusted trade surplus of $463 million after six straight months of deficits.
Mexican business operations have been disrupted by bottlenecks in international supply chains, which have led to temporary work stoppages in industries including carmaking, a pillar of the country's manufacturing sector.
But a breakdown of the INEGI figures showed the contraction in October was led by weakness in tertiary activities, which cover services, and by primary activities, which encompass farming, fishing and mining.

Primary activities shrank by 1.2% from September, while tertiary activities were down by 0.5%. By contrast, secondary activities, which include manufacturing, rose by 0.6%.
Compared to the same month last year, the economy grew in October by 0.3% in seasonally adjusted terms. In unadjusted terms it shrank 0.7%, the INEGI data showed.

719,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 23, 2021 08:35PM ET</span>",Japan consumer prices rise at fastest pace in nearly 2 years on fuel costs,"By Takahiko Wada and Leika Kihara
TOKYO (Reuters) -Japan's November consumer inflation marked the biggest year-on-year rise in nearly two years on surging fuel costs, a sign that the fallout from global commodity price gains is broadening.
The increase, however, is unlikely to prompt the Bank of Japan (BOJ) to withdraw monetary stimulus any time soon, with inflation still distant from the central bank's 2% target, analysts say.
The data released on Friday highlights the fresh challenge policymakers face in preventing rising costs of living from hurting already weak household spending and Japan's fragile economic recovery.
BOJ Governor Haruhiko Kuroda said on Thursday a weak yen could be inflicting bigger pain on households than before by pushing up prices of imported goods.
""Faced with price hikes for a range of daily necessities, consumers may become even more cautious in boosting spending,"" said Yasunari Ueno, chief market economist at Mizuho Securities.
Japan's core consumer price index (CPI), which excludes volatile fresh food but includes oil costs, rose 0.5% in November from a year earlier, government data showed, exceeding a median market forecast for a 0.4% gain.
It was the biggest increase since February 2020 and followed a 0.1% rise in October.
The gain was driven by a 15.6% surge in energy costs. Food costs also rose 1.4%, indicating households were facing higher grocery costs even when wage growth remains slow.
Core consumer inflation is already above 1% when stripping away the impact of this year's cuts in cellphone charges, which knock off 1.5% point off the index, analysts say.
""We expect underlying inflation to accelerate to a peak of around +1.0% next year as goods inflation rises further and the drag from mobile phone tariff cuts drops out of the annual comparison,"" said Tom Learmouth, Japan economist at Capital Economics.

Japan has not been immune to global commodity inflation, with wholesale prices rising a record 9.0% in November from a year earlier.
But core consumer inflation has hovered around zero, as firms remain cautious about passing on costs to consumers on concerns that households may hold back on spending.

Consumer prices, excluding those for fresh food, gained 0.5% compared with a year earlier, the ministry of internal affairs reported. Economists had forecast a 0.4% increase.
Rises in global commodity prices and higher import costs on a weaker yen have pushed Japan’s inflation back above zero. But the impact on the consumer price index has been muted in Japan compared with other nations mainly because of government-initiated cuts to mobile phone fees. 
Japanese companies are facing the biggest cost pressure in four decades, and some companies are opting to pass higher costs to consumers while many remain reluctant to do so out of fear of losing customers to competitors. 
 What Bloomberg Economics Says...
“Japan’s core inflation looks set to come in at a yawn-inducing 0.4% in November. Strip out mobile phone charges, though, and it might get your blood racing -- we estimate that narrower measure could approach 2%.”

More details:
Unlike in the U.S. and Europe, the inflationary pressure has yet to cause monetary policy changes in Japan with the central bank pledging to keep up its stimulus until the 2% inflation target is achieved. Bank of Japan Governor Haruhiko Kuroda said last week a weaker yen has been a plus for the economy as a whole by boosting exports and the value of earnings abroad. 
Prime Minister Fumio Kishida is looking to make companies raise pay for workers by larger amounts through bigger tax incentives. The BOJ has long argued that higher wages are a key to increasing consumer spending and securing a sustained gain in inflation. His economic stimulus measures approved last month include help for people and businesses to deal with higher energy prices.

JOHANNESBURG/LONDON (Reuters) -Omicron advanced across the world on Thursday, with health experts warning the battle against the COVID-19 variant was far from over despite two drugmakers saying their vaccines protected against it and signs it carries a lower risk of hospitalisation.
Coronavirus infections have soared wherever the highly infectious Omicron variant has spread, triggering new restrictions in many countries and record new cases.
But in another glimmer of hope two days before Christmas, a U.S. Federal Drug Administration (FDA) official said data indicated that both Merck & Co Inc's and  Pfizer  Inc (NYSE:PFE)'s COVID-19 anti-virals are effective against the variant.
There were encouraging signs too about hospitalisation rates from Britain and South Africa, although the head of a leading African health agency joined the World Health Organization in cautioning that it was too soon to draw broader conclusions.
""Let's be careful not to extrapolate what we are seeing in South Africa across the continent, or across the world,"" Africa Centres for Disease Control (CDC) chief John Nkengasong said.
Nevertheless, U.S. stock indexes and yields on U.S. Treasuries both climbed on Thursday, partly on new optimism after Omicron helped ratchet up market volatility for much of the last month of 2021.
""Today is a very calm day. It’s the relief over Omicron apparently not being as bad as we feared,"" Ryan Detrick, chief market strategist at LPL Financial (NASDAQ:LPLA), said.
Even as Omicron has begun leaving an imprint on parts of the U.S. economy, economists say it so far seems unlikely to prevent a second straight year of above-trend growth. 
First identified last month in southern Africa and Hong Kong, Omicron is becoming dominant in much of Europe including Britain https://www.reuters.com/world/uk/englands-covid-19-prevalence-reaches-record-1-45-people-ons-2021-12-23, where daily new infections have soared beyond 100,000. 
France had its worst-ever day in terms of new COVID-19 cases on Thursday, with more than 91,000 recorded, while Germany reported its first Omicron death.
In Italy, the first Western country to be hit by the pandemic last year, all public New Year's Eve celebrations were banned, while Greece banned public Christmas festivities. Both countries also made outdoor mask-wearing mandatory. 
In the United States, millions of Americans pushed ahead with holidays including cross-country flights. Authorities said 2,081,297 passengers were screened through the nation's airports on Wednesday, 144,000 more than on the same date in 2019 before the pandemic. 
Increases in hospitalisations and deaths in South Africa and Britain since Omicron took hold appear to have been only gradual, and AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN) https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/astrazeneca-shot-third-dose-works-against-omicron-study-2021-12-23 and  Novavax  (NASDAQ:NVAX) https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/novavax-says-covid-vaccine-boosts-response-omicron-variant-2021-12-22 joined other manufacturers in saying their shots protect against it.
University of Edinburgh https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/scotland-reports-fewer-covid-19-hospitalizations-with-omicron-2021-12-22 researchers who tracked 22,205 Omicron patients said on Wednesday the number who needed to be hospitalised was 68% lower than they would have expected, based on the rate in patients with Delta.
Imperial College London https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/hospital-stay-risk-omicron-is-40-45-lower-than-delta-uk-study-2021-12-22 researchers reported evidence of a comparable 40%-45% reduction in hospitalisation risk.
Britain recorded a record number of new coronavirus cases on Thursday, with the daily tally reaching 119,789. But analysis of preliminary data by the UK Health Security Agency showed an individual with Omicron was estimated to be between 31% and 45% less likely to attend hospital compared to someone with Delta, and 50% to 70% less likely to be admitted.
UKHSA boss Jenny Harries said this was ""an encouraging early signal"", but added: ""this is early data and more research is required to confirm these findings"".
In Washington, the FDA authorised Merck's anti-viral pill for certain high-risk adult patients, a day after giving the go-ahead to a similar treatment from Pfizer. 
Both pills worked, said Patrizia Cavazzoni, a top FDA official, adding that both interfere with how the virus replicates, a process that is not altered across variants. 
'DON'T OVER-INTERPRET'
Scientists have warned that, with the surge in cases in Britain, even a small proportion of hospitalisations could overwhelm the healthcare system. 
In the U.S. Midwest, Omicron's rapid spread has hospitals ""preparing for the worst,"" with their personnel already severely strained from a wave of the Delta variant.
The British data supported findings from South Africa's National Institute for Communicable Diseases (NICD).
A separate South African government-backed study, yet to be peer-reviewed, on health workers given the Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) vaccine identified ""clear and early de-coupling"" of hospitalisation from Omicron cases compared with Delta.
AstraZeneca said a three-course dose of its vaccine offered protection against the variant, citing data from an Oxford University lab study.
Findings from the study, yet to be published in a peer-reviewed journal, matched those from rivals Pfizer-BioNTech, and  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA).
Novavax also said early data showed its vaccine - authorised for use by the European Union and WHO but yet to be approved by the United States - generated an immune response against Omicron.
But the older Delta variant lurks.
The coronavirus death toll in Russia, where officials had detected only 41 Omicron cases, passed 600,000 on Thursday, Reuters calculations based on official data showed, after a surge of Delta-linked infections.
Only the United States and Brazil have recorded more coronavirus deaths.

722,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 23, 2021 02:52PM ET</span>","Analysis-Omicron begins to leave mark on U.S. economy, but unlikely to derail it","By Jonnelle Marte
(Reuters) - The fast-spreading Omicron variant of COVID-19 has started leaving an imprint on slices of the U.S. economy as some events are canceled or postponed, consumers cut back on restaurant dining and understaffed businesses shut down in some of the most-afflicted areas such as New York City. 
But even as economists say the variant could be a drag on growth early next year, they caution it is too soon to gauge the mark that will be left by an iteration of the virus that may on balance prove less severe even if it is the most transmissible version yet in nearly two years of the pandemic. It also seems unlikely at this stage to prevent a second straight year of above-trend growth.
Preliminary data out Thursday from the U.K. government showed a 50-70% lower probability of an Omicron infection resulting in hospitalization than with the Delta variant. That followed a study on Wednesday from South Africa, where Omicron was first identified last month, that suggested infections peaked quickly there and symptoms were less severe. 
Nonetheless, Mark Zandi, chief economist for Moody's (NYSE:MCO) Analytics, expects the U.S. economy to take a hit in the near term from a surge that could infect more people than earlier waves but end more quickly. He now forecasts the U.S. economy will grow by 2% in the first quarter of 2022, down from 5%.
""Omicron is already affecting people’s behavior and business practices,"" said Zandi, pointing to a decline in credit card spending over the past several weeks. 
Credit card balances were fractionally lower in the week ending Dec. 8, marking the first time since October that they didn't increase week over week, according to the Federal Reserve. 
Consumers are also cutting back on trips to restaurants as the virus spreads. The number of diners seated at U.S. restaurants was down 10% for the week ending Dec. 23 when compared with the same week in 2019, according to the restaurant reservations site OpenTable. That is lower than Nov. 25, when dining activity was on par with 2019 levels. 
""The situation is changing rapidly and this is far from the resurgence many restaurants were counting on this holiday,"" Debby Soo, chief executive of OpenTable, said in a statement to Reuters.
Still, other parts of the economy appeared to be running as usual for now. 
The number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits held below pre-pandemic levels last week. And while workplace activity declined slightly last week after rising earlier in December, it was in line with the drop seen heading into the holidays in 2019 and stronger when compared to the same time last year, said Dave Gilbertson, vice president of the payroll management firm UKG. 
""So far, we haven’t seen widespread business shutdowns, and customer demand remains strong across industries,"" Gilbertson said in an email. 
And Americans by and large seemed more committed to their holiday travel plans. The number of people checked through airport security in the approach to Christmas is roughly double last year's volumes, Transportation Security Administration data showed. Wednesday's total exceeded the comparable 2019 level by about 144,000 passengers, one of only a handful of days so far to top pre-pandemic levels and by the largest margin yet. 
TOO EARLY TO KNOW
Some analysts say it may just be too soon for the effects of Omicron to show up in economic reports. 
Consumer sentiment improved in December but Richard Curtin, director of the University of Michigan's Surveys of Consumers said ""too few interviews"" were done to capture the impact of the Omicron variant.
""Confidence and spending are likely to be depressed in January, but it is too early to know the eventual impact of Omicron on the economy,"" Curtin said in a statement on Thursday. 
Some economists are downgrading their forecasts for how much the U.S. economy and the labor market will grow early next year amid a surge in infections and a decline in fiscal support. 
Oxford Economics lowered its growth projections for next year to 4.1% from 4.4% because of the surge in infections, and says growth could slow to 3.7% if President Joe Biden's Build Back Better spending plan is completely blocked. The package's odds of passing dimmed after Senator Joe Manchin said he would not support the bill, but some analysts say a modified version of the bill could be approved later.
And Aneta Markowska and Thomas Simons, economists for Jefferies, earlier this week said economic activity is likely to soften in January, and they ""see relatively high probability"" the labor market could contract next month, similar to December 2020, if more businesses furlough workers because of the virus. 

Biden announced new steps this week meant to stem the health and economic consequences of the infection surge, including new sites for testing and vaccination, more at-home rapid tests and an extension of the pause on student loan payments until May 1, 2022. 
Zandi says that despite the slowdown he is expecting, growth could rebound quickly in the second quarter and the economy could expand by just over 4% next year. That would be almost double the annual growth rate that prevailed in the decade before the pandemic.

723,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 23, 2021 11:30AM ET</span>",UK car plants have worst November since 1984,"LONDON (Reuters) - British car manufacturers had their slowest November in 37 years as the sector struggled to cope with the impact of the coronavirus pandemic on global supply chains, industry data showed on Thursday.
Car production fell by 28.7% compared with November 2021 to 75,756 units, despite a 53% increase in electric vehicle output, the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) said.
It was the fifth consecutive month of decline and represented the worst November performance since 1984. 
Some of the fall was due to the permanent closure of a Honda's car factory in July but SMMT Chief Executive Mike Hawes said the figures were ""incredibly worrying"" and underscored the severity of the industry's situation.
It the first 11 months of 2021, British car production of just under 800,000 units was down by 433,000 compared with 2019, before the pandemic hit.
""COVID is impacting supply chains massively, causing global shortages - especially of semiconductors - which is likely to affect the sector throughout next year,"" Hawes said.
The risks of a new economic slowdown caused by the Omicron variant of the coronavirus and rising inflation represented the toughest business environment in decades, Hawes said.
""We have to look to government to provide support measures in the same way it is recognising other COVID-impacted sectors,"" he said.
Britain announced on Tuesday 1 billion pounds of extra support for hospitality and leisure businesses which have been hit hardest by Omicron.

Hawes said Britain's automotive industry was as well prepared as it could be for the implementation of full post-Brexit customs controls at UK borders from Jan. 1 but any delays would put further stress on just-in-time operations. 
""Should any problems arise, contingency measures must be implemented immediately to keep cross border trade flowing smoothly,"" he said.

724,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 23, 2021 10:40AM ET</span>",U.S. new home sales race to seven-month high in November,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Sales of new U.S. single-family homes surged to a seven-month high in November, boosted an acute shortage of previously owned homes on the market, but soaring house prices are an obstacle for first-time buyers. 
New home sales increased 12.4% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 744,000 units last month, the highest level since April, the Commerce Department said on Thursday. October's sales pace was revised down to 662,000 units from the previously reported 745,000 units.
Sales rose in the densely populated South as well as in the West and Northeast, but fell in the Midwest. 
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast new home sales, which account for more than 10% of U.S. home sales, rising to a rate of 770,000 units.
Sales dropped 14.0% on a year-on-year basis in November. They peaked at a rate of 993,000 units in January, which was the highest since the end of 2006. 
The National Association of Realtors said on Wednesday that the inventory of previously owned homes fell to an eight-month low in November.
The median new house price accelerated 18.8% in November to $416,900 from a year ago. There were 402,000 new homes on the market, up from 392,000 units in October. 
Houses under construction made up 62.9% of the inventory, with homes yet to be built accounting for about 27.4%. 

There is a record backlog of houses authorized for construction but not yet started, according to government data published last week. Builders are struggling with worker shortages, expensive materials and delays getting supplies.
At November's sales pace it would take 6.5 months to clear the supply of houses on the market, down from 7.1 months in October.

725,By Bloomberg,"<span>Dec 23, 2021 10:18AM ET</span>",U.S. New-Home Sales Jump in November to a Seven-Month High,"(Bloomberg) -- Sales of new U.S. homes rose in November to a seven-month high, underscoring strong demand for housing against a backdrop of low borrowing costs and desire for more space during the pandemic.
Purchases of new single-family homes increased 12.4% to a 744,000 annualized pace following a downwardly revised 662,000 in October, government data showed Thursday. The median estimate in a Bloomberg survey of economists called for a 770,000 rate.
The figures point to strong housing demand in the final quarter of the year despite still-high prices. However, rising Covid-19 cases in the U.S. and overseas could create supply chain and labor headwinds in the coming months, slowing construction and leading to further inventory shortages. 
The new home sales report, produced by the U.S. Census Bureau and the Department of Housing and Urban Development, showed the median sales price of a new home rose 18.8% from a year ago to a record $416,900.
There were 402,000 new homes for sale as of the end of November, up from a month earlier. At the current sales pace, it would take 6.5 months to exhaust the supply of new homes, compared with four months a year ago.
Growing Backlogs
Of the homes sold in last month, construction on 221,000 had yet to be started, the most since May, suggesting backlogs are growing. Already completed homes 164,000, the lowest since August.
Sales rose in all regions but the Midwest. The West posted the largest gain, with the strongest pace since January.
Separate data Wednesday showed that existing home sales, which make up 90% of home purchases, increased for a third straight month in November.
New-home purchases account for about 10% of the market and are calculated when contracts are signed. The new-homes data are volatile; the report showed 90% confidence that the change in sales ranged from a 4.8% decline to a 29.6% increase.

Power and LMC Automotive said in a report released on Thursday.
Retail sales of new vehicles could fall 17.7% to 2,923,600 units from a year earlier, the report said.
""Intense demand with this limited supply is resulting in prices continuing to increase,"" said Thomas King, president of the data and analytics division at J.D. Powers. 
Auto manufacturers of all sizes are grappling with the strongest inflationary pressure in three decades, following a relentless rise in raw materials prices.
Average transaction prices are expected to reach $45,743, going above the $45,000 mark for the first time, and 20% higher than December 2020 when prices first breached the $38,000 level.
Production at auto plants rose 2.2% last month after advancing 10.1% in October. But November motor vehicle output remained 5.4% below the levels seen in the same period last year because of a global shortage of semiconductors.
Total new-vehicle sales for December 2021, including retail and non-retail transactions, are projected to reach 1,245,600 units, a 20.5% decrease from last year.
""A mild improvement in the chip shortage may be overshadowed by risk from the surge in Omicron variant COVID-19 cases"", said Jeff Schuster, president, Americas operations and global vehicle forecasts, LMC Automotive. 
The average new-vehicle retail transaction price in December is expected to reach $45,743, the previous high was in November at $44,515. 

The seasonally adjusted annualized rate for total new-vehicle sales is expected to be 13 million units, down 3.5 million units from 2020.
Despite the added risk, the consultants expect 2022 global light vehicle sales to improve to 86 million units, an increase of 750,000 units from last month.

Orders for non-defense capital goods excluding aircraft, a closely watched proxy for business spending plans, dipped 0.1% last month, the Commerce Department said on Thursday. These so-called core capital goods orders shot up 0.9% in October.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast core capital goods orders rising 0.6%. 
Shipments of core capital goods gained 0.3% last month after increasing 0.4% in October. Core capital goods shipments are used to calculate equipment spending in the GDP measurement.
Business spending on equipment contracted in the third quarter after four straight quarters of double-digit growth. It was weighed down by a shortage of motor vehicles. A global shortage of semiconductors is hampering motor vehicle production.

Orders for durable goods, items ranging from toasters to aircraft that are meant to last three years or more, accelerated 2.5% last month after edging up 0.1% in October. They were boosted by a 6.5% jump in orders for transportation equipment, which followed a 0.3% drop in October. Motor vehicle orders increased 1.0% after rebounding 5.8% in October.
Orders for the volatile civilian aircraft category soared 34.1% after falling 4.1% in October. Boeing (NYSE:BA) reported on its website that it had received 109 aircraft orders last month compared to only 10 in October.

Purchases of goods and services, after adjusting for higher prices, were little changed following a 0.7% gain in October, Commerce Department figures showed Thursday. Unadjusted for inflation, so-called nominal spending rose 0.6%, matching the median estimate of economists.
Underlying the spending figures are a series of crosscurrents. Buffeted by headlines about snarled supply chains, many Americans started their holiday shopping earlier than usual this year, helping to explain the strong advance in the prior month.
But consumers are also facing the fastest inflation in decades. With every trip to the grocery store and gas pump eating away a little more of their paychecks, people have less left over for discretionary purchases. And the new omicron variant of Covid-19 threatens to curb the incipient rebound in outlays for services.
The personal consumption expenditures price gauge, which the Federal Reserve uses for its 2% inflation target, increased 0.6% from a month earlier and 5.7% from November 2020, the highest reading since 1982. Those figures were in line with economists’ estimates, and followed an annual increase in the Labor Department’s consumer price index that was also the fastest since 1982.
The data come on the heels of a hawkish pivot by Fed officials, who have been under pressure to take action against overheating prices. Last week the central bank announced it would accelerate the end of its asset-buying program, and new interest-rate projections indicated policy makers favor raising borrowing costs by three-quarters of a percentage point next year.
Consumers are saving less amid the rapid price increases. Adjusted for inflation, disposable personal income, or after-tax income, fell 0.2%, the fourth straight decline. The savings rate -- personal saving as a share of disposable income -- declined to 6.9%, the lowest since December 2017. Nominal personal income rose 0.4% last month. 
Though federal stimulus has waned, a host of companies have hiked pay this year to attract and retain talent amid widespread hiring struggles. In November, wages and salaries rose 0.5%, following a 0.8% gain in October, the report showed.

Still, the performance marked an 11th month of gains, bringing the number of formal jobs created so far this year to 2.993 million, the highest for the period in a historical series that began in 2010.
The increase was led by the services sector, which created 180,960 formal jobs in November. Four of five sectors covered by the Labor Ministry showed net job growth in the month, with the exception of farming, which lost 16,797 jobs. 
Figures do not include nearly 40 million undocumented workers, who do not have formal employment registration.
According to the ministry, the total number of formally registered workers in Brazil was up 0.79% from the previous month, to 41.552 million.

The resource-rich country has been enjoying an export boom on the back of rising prices of its top commodities such as coal, palm oil, tin, steel and rubber.
Exports in the first 11 months of the year reached $209.2 billion, up almost 43% on a yearly basis, with November's shipments of $22.84 billion a record monthly figure.
""If the numbers are consistent in December, we will see exports surpassing $225 billion to $230 billion and 2021 will be the highest in our export history,"" Minister Muhammad Lutfi told a news conference.
Indonesia's previous record high for exports was $203.5 billion in 2011, at the peak of the previous commodities' upcycle.
""Our surplus has reached $34 billion ... If consistent, we will book a $35 billion surplus in 2021,"" Lutfi added.
That forecast is the nation's largest trade surplus since 2007.

Due to the significant surplus in the trade in goods, Indonesia may record its first current account surplus https://www.bi.go.id/id/publikasi/ruang-media/news-release/Pages/sp_2333221.aspx in a decade this year, the central bank has said, giving a forecast range of between a 0.3% surplus to a 0.5% deficit, relative to gross domestic product.

The core inflation rate — the central bank's favoured price measure - rose to 1.6% in November on a year-on-year basis, the highest since January 2019, versus 1.5% in the prior month. A Reuters poll of economists had forecast a 1.5% increase.
Core inflation is projected to average 0.9% for 2021 with headline inflation at 2.3%, the Monetary Authority of Singapore and ministry of trade and industry said in a joint statement.

That compared with a previous outlook for core inflation to come in near the upper end of a 0–1% range, and headline prices to be at about 2%.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. consumer confidence improved further in December, suggesting the economy would continue to expand in 2022 despite a resurgence in COVID-19 infections and reduced fiscal stimulus.
The survey from the Conference Board on Wednesday showed more consumers planned to buy a house and big-ticket items such as motor vehicles and major household appliances as well as go on vacation over the next six months. Inflation concerns eased a bit and households remained upbeat about the labor market.
This will likely help to underpin consumer spending even as government income to households is diminishing. 
President Joe Biden's signature $1.75 trillion domestic investment bill known as Build Back Better (BBB), which aims to expand the social safety net and tackle climate change, suffered a blow on Sunday when moderate Democrat Senator Joe Manchin said he would not support it. That prompted economists to slash their growth estimates for next year.
""Consumers are bullish on 2022,"" said Robert Frick, corporate economist with Navy Federal Credit Union in Vienna, Virginia. ""This is further evidence that consumer spending will keep rising and be the main factor fueling the expansion.""
The Conference Board's consumer confidence index increased to a reading of 115.8 this month from an upwardly revised 111.9 in November. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the index rising to 110.8 from the previously reported reading of 109.5. The cut-off date for the survey, which places more emphasis on the labor market, was Dec. 16.
Consumers' assessment of current business and labor market conditions was little changed, but their short-term outlook for income, business and labor market conditions was upbeat, which the Conference Board viewed as ""setting the stage for continued growth in early 2022."" 
Consumers' inflation expectations over the next 12 months fell to 6.9% from a more than 13-year high of 7.3%. Its so-called labor market differential, derived from data on respondents' views on whether jobs are plentiful or hard to get, slipped to a still-high reading of 42.6 this month from 44.7.
This measure correlates to the unemployment rate from the Labor Department. The share of consumers planning to buy a motor vehicle over the next six months increased. Buying intentions for household appliances like washing machines, dryers and refrigerators also rose and more consumers were inclined to buy a house and go on vacation over the next six months.
The show of underlying strength as the nation confronts a winter wave of coronavirus infections, driven by the Delta and highly contagious Omicron variants is welcome news. Surging infections could significantly curb growth in the first quarter.
Stocks on Wall Street were trading higher. The dollar slipped against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices were higher.
STRONG HOUSING DEMAND
The run of good news was extended by a second report from the National Association of Realtors showing existing home sales rose 1.9% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 6.46 million units in November.
But the housing market continues to be dogged by a severe shortage of homes for sale, which is keeping house prices elevated and squeezing first-time buyers out.
The median existing house price increased 13.9% from a year earlier to $353,900 in November. First-time buyers accounted for 26% of sales last month, compared to 32% a year ago. That was the smallest share since January 2014.
The reports added to October consumer spending data as well as a sharp narrowing of the trade deficit and steady rebuilding of inventories by businesses in suggesting the economy this year is on track to record its best performance since 1984. 
A third report from the Commerce Department on Wednesday showed gross domestic product increased at a 2.3% annualized rate in the July-September quarter, revised up from the 2.1% rate estimated last month.
Growth last quarter was the slowest since the second quarter of 2020, when the economy suffered a historic contraction in the wake of stringent mandatory measures to contain the first wave of coronavirus cases.
The economy was restrained by a resurgence in coronavirus infections over summer, shortages of motor vehicles amid strained global supply chains as well as a decline in pandemic relief money from the government to businesses, households and state and local governments. 
Growth was also hampered by Hurricane Ida, which devastated U.S. offshore energy production at the end of August.
""The recovery will end 2021 on a strong note, with strong household finances, rising employment, and an improved health backdrop, before Omicron arrived, supporting GDP growth above 7% in fourth quarter,"" said Oren Klachkin, lead U.S. economist at Oxford Economics in New York.

Fourteen out of 22 industries contributed to GDP growth in the third quarter. Services industry output increased at a 3.9% rate, led by professional, scientific and technical services, finance and insurance, administrative and waste management, as well as accommodation and food services, and information. That partly offset decreases in retail and wholesale trade.
Output in the goods-producing industries contracted at a 5.5% pace, reflecting a broad decline that was dominated by construction. The government sector grew at a 5.1% rate, led by state and local governments.

734,By Bloomberg,"<span>Dec 22, 2021 10:18AM ET</span>","U.S. Consumer Confidence Rose in December, Defying Omicron Fears","(Bloomberg) -- U.S. consumer confidence rose in December by more than expected as Americans’ outlook for employment and the economy improved, suggesting some resilience in the recovery despite growing concerns about the omicron variant and elevated prices.
The Conference Board’s index increased to 115.8 from an upwardly revised 111.9 reading in November, according to the group’s report Wednesday. Economists in a Bloomberg survey had called for a reading of 111. 
The data suggest consumers remain optimistic despite new Covid-related restrictions in some parts of the country as the omicron variant spreads. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell and various economists have said that each coronavirus wave brings a smaller economic impact as Americans become more comfortable adapting to the virus and its variants.
Households in December became slightly more sanguine about their inflation expectations for the coming year, which hit a 13-year high last month, according to the Conference Board’s data. 
The Conference Board’s expectations index increased to a five-month high of 96.9, while the gauge of current conditions edged down to 144.1.
The share of consumers who said jobs were “plentiful” fell slightly to 55.1%. Consumers said they were more likely to purchase cars, homes and appliances.
“Looking ahead to 2022, both confidence and consumer spending will continue to face headwinds from rising prices and an expected winter surge of the pandemic,” Lynn Franco, senior director of economic indicators at the Conference Board, said in a statement.

The KBC Bank Ireland consumer sentiment index declined to 74.9 in December from 83.1 in November to hit its lowest level since February.
KBC Ireland chief economist Austin Hughes said consumers have been unsettled by the emergence of the Omicron variant and the realisation that the worst of the pandemic might not be behind them.
He said a surge in inflation, and energy costs in particular, and the impact of new public health restrictions on employment, could also be weighing on sentiment.

Although all five main elements of the KBC Bank consumer sentiment survey weakened in December, Hughes said the best performing elements of the December survey were consumer thinking on how their personal finances would evolve in the next twelve months.
""Resilience in these areas suggests that while Irish consumers may be down, they are not out.""

QUITO (Reuters) - Ecuadorian President Guillermo Lasso said on Tuesday the government will from January gradually reduce a tax levied on international transfers, which he said negatively affects efforts to attract foreign investors.
Lasso, a conservative ex-banker who took office in May, has taken various measures to appeal to investors as he seeks to revive an economy battered by coronavirus. 
The capital exit tax, charged on transfers made from the Ecuador to other countries, has been harshly criticized by exporters who say it raises their costs.
The 5% tax will be reduced by one percentage point next year, Lasso said in a television interview. 
""We are going to reduce the capital exit tax by one point in 2022, through 0.25% (reductions) each quarter and beginning on Jan. 1,"" Lasso said.
""It's a tax on the entrance of capital that has done a lot of harm to Ecuador,"" Lasso said. ""For fiscal reasons we can't eliminate it in one go. We need to do it gradually so we don't impact public finances.""
The tax raised $1 billion in 2020, according to government figures.
Lasso added he is also working to reduce the country's fiscal deficit, which is set to end this year at around $4 billion and next at $2.6 billion. 
""We'll gradually lower taxes as the economic situation of the country allows,"" he said.

Lasso in November ordered the implementation of a controversial tax reform, after lawmakers failed to block or approve the bill. 
The reform will raise an additional $1.9 billion in tax revenue during its first two years, partly by increasing tax contributions from larger companies and reducing the amount of deductions those who earn more than $2,000 per month can claim.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The U.S. current account deficit surged to a 15-year high in the third quarter amid a record increase in imports as businesses rushed to replenish depleted inventories to meet strong demand.
The Commerce Department said on Tuesday that the current account deficit, which measures the flow of goods, services and investments into and out of the country, accelerated 8.3% to $214.8 billion last quarter. That was the largest shortfall since the third quarter of 2006. 
Data for the second quarter was revised to show a $198.3 billion deficit, instead of $190.3 billion as previously reported. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast a $205.0 billion deficit last quarter.
The current account gap represented 3.7% of gross domestic product. That was the largest share since the fourth quarter of 2008 and was up from 3.5% in the April-June quarter. 
Still, the deficit remains below a peak of 6.3% of GDP in the fourth quarter of 2005 as the United States is now a net exporter of crude oil and fuel. 
The wider deficit is not a problem for the United States given the dollar's status as the world's reserve currency. The third quarter likely marked a peak for the current account gap, though much would depend on the severity of the COVID-19 Omicron variant. The trade deficit narrowed sharply in October. 
""Robust export growth in the fourth quarter suggests the balance has likely reached a cyclical trough and the latest trade data signals a narrower deficit in the fourth quarter,"" said Mahir Rasheed, a U.S. economist at Oxford Economics in New York. ""Assuming a moderate impact from the Omicron variant in the first quarter, we look for stronger foreign consumption and moderating U.S. demand to drive the current account deficit lower next year.""
Imports of goods increased $10.0 billion to a record $716.4 billion, boosted by petroleum products and chemicals. Services imports rose $12.6 billion to $141.0 billion, mostly reflecting personal travel as well as sea freight and air passenger transport.
Exports of goods advanced $4.8 billion to $441.6 billion, also a record high, driven by natural gas and petroleum products. There were also increases in exports of medicinal, dental, and pharmaceutical products. But exports of corn and soybeans fell.
Services exports fell $0.1 billion to $190.8 billion, pulled down by decreases in charges for licenses for the use of patents and trade secrets. There were also declines in exports of telecommunications, computer and information services. But professional and management consulting services increased. 

Primary income receipts increased $17.9 billion to $281.9 billion, lifted by direct investment income as well as portfolio investment income amid a surge in equity prices. Payments of primary income rose $8.6 billion to $233.7 billion, reflecting higher interest rates on long-dated debt securities.
Secondary income receipts climbed $0.1 billion to $41.6 billion, reflecting taxes on income and wealth.

Trade volume slipped between July-September due to supply chain disruptions, shortages of production inputs and rising COVID-19 cases, the WTO said in a statement on its website.

The figures from the Confederation of British Industry, collected between Nov. 22 and Dec. 10, show little evidence of a knock from the Omicron variant of coronavirus, which has been a major blow for face-to-face consumer services businesses.
The CBI's monthly order book balance for manufacturers slipped to +24 in December from November's record high of +26, while output growth over the past three months was the highest since July.
Growth is expected to slow slightly over the next three months but remains well above its long-run average.
""UK manufacturing demand remains strong, and output accelerated to meet this demand in December. However, behind the scenes, firms are battling pressures on a number of fronts,"" said Anna Leach, the CBI's deputy chief economist.

The gauge of stocks of finished goods dropped to a record low -24 in December, down from a previous record low of -16 in December.
Inflation pressures eased only marginally, with a balance of +62 of firms reporting price rises in December, down from +67 in November.

742,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 20, 2021 06:07AM ET</span>",Wage rises set to push up Dutch inflation through 2023 - central bank,"AMSTERDAM (Reuters) - Inflation in the Netherlands is set to remain elevated until at least 2023 as a labour shortage drives up wages during an economic boom, the Dutch central bank (DNB) said on Monday.
Inflation in the euro zone's fifth-largest economy is likely to run at 3.0% in 2022 and 2.9% in 2023, after a spike in energy prices drove up consumer prices by an estimated 2.7% on average this year, the DNB said.
""Inflation will be driven up by higher wages in a labour market that continues to be tight"", the DNB said.
""But for now, we don't see undesirable levels of wage inflation"", the central bank added, as wages are expected to rise by 2.5% on average in the next two years.
The European Central Bank (ECB) last week said inflation in the euro zone as a whole would fall slightly below 2% by the end of 2022 and was expected at 1.8% in 2023 and 2024.
The Dutch economy has rebounded more strongly than most other euro countries from its coronavirus slump, and the DNB said it expects it to expand by 4.5% this year and 3.6% in 2022 before growth moderates to 1.7% in 2023.
This strong recovery is also visible in the labour market, where the number of vacancies has been higher than the number of unemployed for months and the DNB expects unemployment to remain at historically low levels until at least the end of 2023. 

The outlook could worsen, however, if the coronavirus pandemic continues to limit activity throughout next year, the bank said.
The Netherlands reverted to a strict lockdown on Sunday, closing all but essential stores and most other public places in a bid to limit the spread of the Omicron variant.

743,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 20, 2021 04:33AM ET</span>",Turkey's crisis rattles the faithful in Erdogan's heartland,"By Dominic Evans and Tuvan Gumrukcu
KONYA, Turkey (Reuters) - Turkish labourer Hasan Sarikaya says he has no job, no money and no hope for a better future while President Tayyip Erdogan - the leader he supported for years - remains in power.
Like many people in the industrial city of Konya in Turkey's conservative heartlands, which enjoyed an economic boom in the early years of the Erdogan era, Sarikaya has been hit by the crash in the lira, spiralling inflation, and a business slump.
Their misfortunes may spell trouble for Erdogan as economic pain erodes support for Turkey's most successful modern politician and transforms the next elections, due in mid-2023, into the toughest test of his two decades in power.
""I'm looking for work, I can't pay my debts... there is no solution. People are fed up now,"" said Sarikaya, 31, speaking on a busy Konya street. ""I voted (for Erdogan) for years... Watch now, he won't be able to save himself.""
Erdogan's enduring appeal through more than a dozen national and local election triumphs was based on a record of economic growth and pious conservative values which enthused millions of Muslim Turks who had long felt ignored by a secular elite.
Konya, home of the revered 13th-century Sufi mystic poet Rumi, has been a bastion for his AK Party (AKP), turning under his rule from an agricultural centre into an industrial powerhouse.
Erdogan won 75% of Konya's vote in the 2018 presidential election and AKP support was higher than in all but one of Turkey's 81 provinces. That dominance is now threatened by an unprecedented set of challenges.
Other Konya residents who spoke to Reuters, including industrial workers, farmers and students, echoed Sarikaya's lament over rising prices and fewer jobs. 
Although many said they would stick with Erdogan's party at the next elections, national surveys over the last year suggest Sarikaya's disillusion is part of a wider trend, with opposition parties pulling ahead of the AKP and its parliamentary ally, the nationalist MHP.
""Never have we seen such low support for the AKP in the past,"" said Sinan Ulgen, director at the Istanbul-based Centre for Economics and Foreign Policy Studies. ""There is an increased perception that in 2023 there will be political change.""
WINNER TAKES ALL
Erdogan has ruled Turkey, first as prime minister and later as president, since 2003. Three years ago he assumed wider powers under a new executive presidency that critics say created a hyper-centralised system ill-equipped to tackle Turkey's economic, political and security challenges.
Power drained from institutions and ministries to the sprawling presidential palace in Ankara. Erdogan has dismissed three central bank governors since 2019, and sacked three bank policy makers in October.
Erdogan says the central bank remains independent, but it bowed to his call to slash interest rates well below inflation, triggering a 56% fall in the lira this year and driving up the cost of living for ordinary Turks.
The presidency did not respond to a request for comment on the impact of government policy on the economy and on support for Erdogan. 
His opponents, energised by a groundswell of support, are on the offensive, accusing him of driving Turkey into poverty. 
Erdogan's problems are compounded by the very presidential system he championed, which requires an absolute majority of votes at the ballot box, denying candidates the option of building alliances to reach the threshold. 
Polls suggest three potential rivals - the mayors of Istanbul and Ankara, both from the main opposition Republican People's Party (CHP), and the leader of the nationalist IYI Party - would all beat him in a straight race.
""It's a 'winner takes all' system - that raises the risk at a time when his political popularity is sinking,"" Ulgen said.
""A SULTAN IN AUTUMN""
For the first time in an election Erdogan will also face two breakaway parties established by founding members of his AKP.
One is the Gelecek (Future) Party, led by ex-prime minister Ahmet Davutoglu, the other is run by Erdogan's former ally Ali Babacan. Both offer disenchanted AKP voters a chance to reject Erdogan without abandoning his conservative values.
""If voters have to make a choice and are right-oriented, they will find another right-wing party closer to them,"" said Hasan Ekici, local Gelecek Party chairman in Konya.
While national support for the new parties remains in low single digits, even marginal swings to them could harm Erdogan enough to turn the tables.
""Developments since 2018 when Turkey had its first economic crisis under Erdogan... all point to the fact that Erdogan is a sultan in the autumn of his career,"" said Soner Cagaptay, director of the Turkish Research Program at The Washington Institute for Near East Policy.
Concern over the 67-year-old leader's health, rebuffed by the presidential palace, has also swirled. Known as a fiery orator, Erdogan has sometimes appeared tired and pale in the past year, walking awkwardly and dozing off on camera.
In a country where half the population is 31 or younger, many have known no other leader. Erdogan says young Turks should appreciate their country's progress under him, but he has struggled to win over most young people. 
Nevertheless, Erdogan's party still enjoys more support than any other and can rely on near blanket support from media owned predominantly by his supporters.
His rule witnessed a construction boom and improved health services, and religious Turks welcomed his ending of restrictions on wearing headscarves. 
The loose alliance of his opponents lacks an agreed policy platform and has yet to select a presidential candidate.
But the gathering uncertainty over Erdogan's prospects is rippling out to the wider world, where he has been making tentative efforts to repair strained relations with some of Turkey's allies and rivals.

Unal Cevikoz, a retired ambassador, said countries such as Egypt and Israel, long at odds with Erdogan, were in no rush to make up with him. 
""People sense that the wind of change is now blowing and everybody is waiting for a change in the government,"" he said.

Taiwan's export orders, a bellwether of global technology demand, rose 13.4% from a year earlier to $65.5 billion last month, the highest monthly figure on record, data from the Ministry of Economic Affairs showed on Monday.
That was the 21st month of expansion, with the pace much faster than the median forecast for a rise of 5.8% in a Reuters poll.
The ministry said supply chain problems were easing and there was solid consumer demand for technologies such as notebook computers and 5G ahead of the festive season.
The ministry said it expected export orders for all of 2021 to rise between 24.9% and 25.2% versus 2020.
However, the ministry's statistics director Huang Yu-ling said there were ""too many uncertain factors next year"", including the COVID-19 pandemic and the fact 2022's numbers will be coming off the high base of 2021.
""There will be supply chain bottlenecks in the future, it is difficult to judge whether there will be high growth next year,"" Huang said.
The end of the year is traditionally busy for Taiwanese suppliers due to the Christmas and New Year holidays, followed by the Lunar New Year in February.
Taiwanese companies such as Foxconn and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd (TSMC) are major suppliers to Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) Inc and other global tech firms.
In October, export orders rose 14.6% from a year earlier to $59.1 billion, underperforming expectations due to supply problems in the tech sector.
The ministry said it expects export orders in December to be in a range of a fall of 0.1% and a rise of 2.4% from a year earlier.

Orders from the United States rose 10.8% in November from a year earlier, a far faster rate of expansion compared with the 0.5% logged in October, while orders from China jumped 25.3%, versus a gain of 21.7% the previous month.
Orders from Europe fell 2%, while those from Japan edged up 0.7%.

The comments, at a special meeting to mark the U.N.'s international migrants day, underlined the new Islamist Taliban government's push to engage with the world community, four months after they seized power in Kabul.
The movement's deputy Foreign Minister, Sher Mohammad Abbas Stanikzai, said it was the responsibility of countries like the United States, which have blocked billions of dollars of central bank reserves, to help Afghanistan recover after decades of war.
""The impact of the frozen funds is on the common people and not Taliban authorities,"" he told the conference, attended by representatives of the International Organization for Migration (IOM) and UNHCR, the United Nations refugee organization.
U.N. bodies estimate that millions of Afghans could face hunger over the winter without urgent help, but aid has been hampered by international unwillingness to engage directly with the Taliban, in part because of concern over rights for women and political inclusion.
The abrupt withdrawal of foreign aid following the Taliban victory has pushed Afghanistan's fragile economy close to collapse. Millions are without work and the banking system is only partially functional.
""If the political and economic situation doesn't change, there will be more migration,"" Stanikzai said.
The United States has issued guidance that would permit personal cash remittances to Afghanistan but it has not relented on its refusal to release the $9 billion in central bank reserves or lift sanctions on a number of Taliban leaders.

Taliban Foreign Minister Amir Khan Muttaqi met representatives from the International Committee of the Red Cross on Saturday in Islamabad, ahead of a meeting of foreign ministers from the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation to discuss the situation in Afghanistan.
He said the Taliban welcomed international humanitarian organisations and gave assurances that they would be allowed to work unimpeded.

Natural gas prices have hit record highs in recent months, with energy demand outpacing supply as global economies recover from the COVID-19 pandemic, increasing energy costs across Europe.
Greece has taken a series of relief measures, including subsidising electricity bills for four months since September and ramping up a grant for low-income households to help them buy heating oil over the winter.
""We have already set up a strong wall as a shield against rising energy prices,"" Mitsotakis said during a parliamentary debate ahead of a vote on the 2022 budget.

LIMA (Reuters) -Peru's central bank said on Friday that it maintains its expectations that the country's economy will grow 3.4% in 2022, while it revised its guidance for 2021, saying the economy will grow by 13.2% rather than a previous estimate of 11.9%. 
Central bank president Julio Velarde added in a press conference that he expects Peru's fiscal deficit to fall to 3.1% of gross domestic product in 2021 and 2.8% in 2022. 
Peru's tax revenue has increased significantly in 2021 over pre-pandemic levels because of the high price of minerals, which has helped narrow the fiscal deficit. Peru is the world's No. 2 copper producer. 
But the mining sector is also undergoing turmoil, with one of Peru's largest copper mines, MMG Ltd's Las Bambas, set to suspend production on Saturday because of a road blockade from a local community over jobs and economic contributions. 
Las Bambas, Velarde said, represents 1.2% of Peru's GDP. 

""We are considering the Las Bambas suspension in this year's estimates, but we are also assuming that this issue will in some way be resolved next year and for Las Bambas to continue producing,"" he said.

The volume of business closures dropped sharply last year, when many businesses were kept on life support by government COVID support programmes. Court capacity was reduced and creditors faced restrictions on taking legal action until recently, slowing the process of company dissolutions.

Britain first expressed concern about the Omicron variant on Nov. 25. and on Dec. 9, Prime Minister Boris Johnson imposed tougher COVID-19 restrictions in England, ordering people to work from home, wear masks in public places and use vaccine passes to slow the spread.

Eurostat said inflation in the 19 countries sharing the euro rose to 4.9%, a year-on-year surge in line with an earlier Eurostat estimate. Month-on-month, the increase was revised down to 0.4% from a previously reported 0.5%.
The ECB wants to keep inflation at 2.0% over the medium term and has repeatedly said the inflation surge is temporary. The bank expects price growth to slow during 2022, but admitted this will take longer than initially expected.
Breaking down the year-on-year total, more expensive energy added 2.57 percentage points to inflation, services 1.16 points, non-energy industrial goods 0.64 points and food, alcohol and tobacco a further 0.49 points, Eurostat said.
Without the volatile energy and unprocessed food prices, a measure the ECB calls core inflation, prices rose 0.1% on the month for a 2.6% year-on-year gain. 
An even narrower measure, looked at by many economists, that also excludes alcohol and tobacco showed prices unchanged in the month and also up 2.6% from a year earlier.

The country’s main gauge of business expectations slipped to 92.6 in December, falling for a sixth month, according to the Ifo institute. That’s a bigger decline than predicted by economists in a Bloomberg survey. Current conditions were also assessed as weaker than in November.
The data follow a string of reports highlighting the challenges for Europe’s largest economy as it navigates a fourth pandemic wave that’s come with record numbers of cases. Service providers are suffering from reinstated curbs, while manufacturers are only starting to see an easing of supply bottlenecks.
The Bundesbank acknowledged the problems in updated projections published earlier on Friday though argued that the recovery is only “slightly delayed.” 
The economy is seen suffering a setback in the current quarter and the first three months of 2022, before it’ll regain “significant momentum” in the spring amid “substantially” rising private spending. The central bank expects supply bottlenecks to be resolved by the end of next year. 
At the same time, the Bundesbank predicts inflation will remain above 2% through 2024 -- an outlook that will amplify calls within Europe’s largest economy for a speedy removal of monetary stimulus. Outgoing President Jens Weidmann is warning that price pressures could be even stronger and warned that the European Central Bank mustn’t ignore those risks.
German consumers, businesses and politicians are increasingly on edge after inflation hit 6% last month. With no replacement named yet for Weidmann, who departs at the end of the year, the team around newly appointed Finance Minister Christian Lindner has tried to assuage concerns, arguing that price stability ranks at the top of their agenda.
Citing a stronger outlook for economic growth and inflation, ECB officials on Thursday announced a gradual reduction in bond purchases next year. An emergency pandemic program will be halted as planned in March, with regular asset purchases temporarily boosted to smooth the transition.

754,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 17, 2021 03:51AM ET</span>",British retailers report pre-Xmas sales boost in November,"By David Milliken and Andy Bruce
LONDON (Reuters) -British retail sales rose faster than expected last month, helped by Black Friday discounts, early Christmas shopping and no lockdown restrictions that closed many shops last year, official figures showed on Friday.
Retail sales volumes rose by 1.4% in November on a seasonally-adjusted basis and were 4.7% higher than a year earlier, when non-essential stores were closed to the public, the Office for National Statistics said.
Economists polled by Reuters had on average forecast that sales volumes would rise by 0.8% on the month and be 4.2% higher than in November 2020. October sales were revised higher too.
""Retail sales picked up in November, boosted by strong Black Friday and pre-Christmas trading. Clothing stores fared particularly well and have exceeded their pre-pandemic level for the first time,"" ONS statistician Heather Bovill said.
Clothing and footwear sales were hard hit by the pandemic, as people went out less and shops were shut, but have now risen 51% from a year ago.
British retail sales rebounded rapidly after a slump at the start of the pandemic in 2020, but had drifted lower since a peak in April as easing COVID-19 restrictions gave consumers a wider range of spending options.
Friday's figures pre-date the spread of the Omicron variant in Britain, which are a concern for many stores, and prompted the Bank of England to downgrade its short-term growth forecasts on Thursday.
DISCOUNTS EXPECTED
""Rising cases will likely cool off the high street and put pressure on last minute online orders, and we should expect to see heavy discounting over Boxing Day and the New Year as retailers look to shift excess stock,"" said Erin Brookes, head of European retail at consultants Alvarez & Marsal.
Consumer electricals retailer Currys said its market had softened in recent weeks, online fashion retailer Boohoo warned on annual profit, and data has indicated fewer shoppers on Britain's high streets.
Previous data from the British Retail Consortium showed a 5% rise in retail spending last month as shoppers snapped up Black Friday discounts - many of which were offered earlier in the month than in previous years.
Trade bodies also had reports of people shopping earlier than usual for Christmas due to COVID concerns.
The pandemic led to a big shift towards online shopping, which has only partly reversed and accounted for 26% of spending last month compared with 20% before the pandemic.
Friday's data also highlight the inflation pressures which prompted the BoE to raise interest rates on Thursday for the first time since the start of the pandemic, and which are likely to squeeze consumers' disposable income further in 2022.

The retail sales deflator, an inflation measure used in the retail sales data, rose to 6.0% in November, its highest since August 2008.
The broader consumer price inflation measures targeted by the BoE hit a 10-year high of 5.1% in November.

The warning for Latin America's second-biggest economy was detailed in a report from the country's financial stability council issued late Thursday.
The council, which includes Mexico's finance minister, central bank governor and head of the banking commission, also cited ""potential impacts"" depending on how credit rating agencies assess state-owned Pemex, the world's most-indebted oil company, which lost its investment grade rating in 2020.

BUENOS AIRES (Reuters) - Argentina's economy expanded 11.9% on a year-on-year basis in the third quarter of 2021, the country's statistics agency said on Thursday, in line with expectations of a sharp rebound from the 10.2% contraction in the same period last year.
The South American grains-producing nation has seen its economy recover more quickly than initially expected after taking a big hit from the COVID-19 pandemic, with the government nudging up its annual growth forecast for 2021 to around 10%.
A Reuters poll of 17 local and foreign analysts had predicted a median 12% expansion for the July-September quarter.
""In the third quarter, a recovery in consumption stood out,"" said Isaías Marini, an economist at consultancy Econviews, who had forecast a 12% rise and expected the recovery to last into the final quarter of the year as salaries picked up.
""The salary improvements, recent easing (of restrictions) and the reactivation of credit suggest the year will end even above 10%. But short-term risks are the scarcity of reserves to finance growth, and the consequent exchange rate instability.""
""One of the biggest drivers today comes from the extractive activity of oil and fuel production. The agricultural sector is also showing a good performance and outlook,"" said Pablo Besmedrisnik, economist at consulting firm Invenómica.

""The two sectors are key to getting the foreign exchange Argentina needs in the short and medium term.""

The online car shopping guide estimated that 15.2 million new cars will be sold in 2022, representing a 1.2% increase from its 2021 vehicle sales estimate.
Shortages of semiconductor chips that control everything from heated seats to infotainment systems have caused major automakers such as General Motors (NYSE:GM) to cut production or, in some cases, build vehicles without certain features. 
""Sales have been depressed since the spring, but consumer appetite for new vehicles continues to run high, which will only serve to build up deferred demand next year and beyond,"" said Jessica Caldwell, Edmunds' executive director of insights. 
Edmunds also said it expects the average transaction price for new vehicles, which jumped to $45,872 in November from $39,984 a year earlier, to hit record levels.
The U.S. electric vehicle (EV) market will continue to see growth and will surpass 600,000 units in 2022, Edmunds predicted, adding that Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co's F-150 Lightning ""will be the champion of the segment."" 

Edmunds, which guides car shoppers from research to purchase, said the booming used-car market will continue to draw more shoppers as inventory shortages squeeze the new vehicle market.
Data firm IHS Markit on Thursday said that U.S. new car sales in 2022 will rise to 15.47 million vehicles from an estimated 15.07 million in 2021. It also said it sees mainland China new car sales rising to 26.92 million in 2023 and 28.99 million in 2024.

Data firm IHS Markit said on Thursday that its flash manufacturing PMI fell to a reading of 57.8 in mid-December from 58.3 in November. That was the lowest since December 2020. A reading above 50 indicates expansion in the manufacturing sector, which accounts for 12% of the economy. Economists had forecast the flash PMI climbing to 58.5. 
Manufacturing remains underpinned by strong demand for goods and extremely lean inventories at businesses. But strained supply chains because of the COVID-19 pandemic are a constrain.
There are glimmers of hope, however. The survey showed ""supply chain delays moderating markedly during the month,"" and ""the rate of job creation quickened to the fastest since June."" It also noted that ""the rate of cost inflation softened to the slowest for seven months."" 
But shortages remained binding for the vast services sector. The survey's flash services sector PMI dipped to a reading of 57.5 from 58.0 in November. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast a reading of 58.5 for the services sector, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity.
A measure of services sector input prices rose to 77.4, the highest since the series started in 2009, from 75.7 in November. That is a potential sign that inflation could remain significantly high for a while. Consumer prices increased by the most since 1982 on a year-on-year basis in November.

With both manufacturing and services sectors activity slowing, overall business activity cooled this month. The survey's flash Composite PMI Output Index fell to a reading of 56.9 from 57.2 in November. 
Its measure of prices paid by businesses for inputs climbed to 78.1. That was the highest reading since the series started in 2009 and followed 77.6 in November.

Housing starts increased 11.8% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.679 million units last month, the highest level since March, the Commerce Department said on Thursday. Data for October was revised down to a rate of 1.502 million units from the previously reported 1.520 million units.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast starts rising to a rate of 1.568 million units. Starts for both single-family and multi-family housing projects rose last month.
Permits for future homebuilding increased 3.6% to a rate of 1.712 million units in November.
Starts dropped from the 1.725 million unit-pace scaled in March, which was more than a 14-1/2-year high as builders struggled with shortages and more expensive raw materials.

Nonresidential construction input prices increased by nearly 25% in the 12 months through November, according to producer price data released this week. There is a huge backlog of houses authorized for construction but not yet started.

TOKYO (Reuters) -Japan's exports sped up in November, as supply constraints eased slightly for the country's big automakers, although imports hit a record on soaring materials costs, which could hurt household consumption.
The trade data came days after the Bank of Japan's quarterly tankan survey showed an improvement in service-sector sentiment, suggesting robust consumption will support the recovery, although the new Omicron variant and rising costs remain downside risks.
Exports climbed 20.5% in November from a year earlier, government data showed on Thursday, the ninth straight month of increase, slightly missing forecasts for a 21.2% gain but well up on a 9.4% rise in the previous month.
Shipments of cars - Japan's No.1 export item - rose 4.1% from a year earlier, marking the first increase in three months, although auto exports to the United States and China decreased year-on-year.
""The jump in exports in November suggests that most supply chain constraints in the automobile sector had already eased last month,"" said Tom Learmouth, Japan economist at Capital Economics.
""Exports will remain strong over the coming months as motor vehicle exports recover further and external demand for capital goods continues to rise.""
Other than cars, growing shipments of steel, semiconductor equipment and chips contributed the most to the increase, a government official said.
    Shipments to China, Japan's biggest trade partner, increased 16.0% year-on-year, the data showed.
Imports rose 43.8% year-on-year in November to 8.32 trillion yen ($72.87 billion), the largest yen amount since comparable data became available in January 1979 and jacked up by a 144.1% rise in fuels such as oil, LNG and coal.
Imports growth accelerated from 26.7% in October and was bigger than economists' forecast of 40.0%.
That brought a trade deficit of 954.8 billion yen, the biggest shortfall since January 2020 and exceeding the median estimate for a 675.0 billion yen deficit.
""While the weak yen has certain benefits such as boosting exporters' competitiveness and inbound tourists' spending, more Japanese manufacturers have shifted production bases offshore and COVID-19 border controls shut out tourists now,"" said Masato Koike, senior economist at Dai-ichi Life Research Institute.
""Rising costs are weighing on Japan when a weak yen has less impact on increasing sales of goods and services.""
The BOJ's latest tankan survey on Monday showed rising raw material costs clouding the corporate and economic outlook. BOJ governor Haruhiko Kuroda said on Wednesday inflation may approach its elusive 2% target.
However, the central bank is unlikely to change its easy monetary policy at its next rate review on Friday.

    The world's third-largest economy is expected to post strong growth in October-December after a contraction in the third quarter, as household spending improved on low COVID-19 infections.

LONDON (Reuters) -Euro zone business growth slowed more than expected this month as renewed restrictions imposed to curb the Omicron coronavirus variant curtailed the recovery in the bloc's dominant services industry, a survey showed on Thursday.
Europe is facing a fourth wave of infections and many governments have been encouraging citizens to stay home and avoid unnecessary social contact.
IHS Markit's Flash Composite Purchasing Managers' Index, a good indicator of overall economic health, dropped to 53.4 in December from 55.4 in November, its lowest since March and below the 54.0 predicted in a Reuters poll.
That headline number was dragged down by the services PMI, which sank to an eight-month low of 53.3 from 55.9. While above the 50-mark separating growth from contraction it missed the Reuters poll estimate for 54.1.
""The renewed decline in the Composite PMI in December suggests growth slowed to a crawl as tighter restrictions and growing consumer caution are taking their toll on economic activity, with the service sector bearing the brunt,"" said Michael Tran at Capital Economics.
Growth in demand for services dropped to its lowest since April - when it contracted - with the new business index falling to 52.6 from 54.2.
In the German private sector growth evaporated as restrictions hit the services sector in Europe's largest economy, earlier data showed.
Meanwhile, in France - the euro zone's second biggest economy and the only other country in the bloc to report flash data - activity expanded at a slower pace, a trend partly due to the new COVID-19 variant.
In Britain, outside the currency bloc, the new variant hammered hospitality and travel companies, sending private sector growth to a 10-month low, its PMI showed ahead of a Bank of England https://www.reuters.com/markets/europe/inflation-risk-omicron-slowdown-boe-rate-move-balance-2021-12-16 policy announcement due later on Thursday.
The Bank's decision is a close call. Investors had been largely betting against an increase in Bank Rate with the new coronavirus wave in full swing until data on Wednesday showed British consumer price inflation https://www.reuters.com/world/uk/uk-inflation-jumps-10-year-high-51-2021-12-15 leapt by far more than expected and hit a decade-high in November.
PRICE PRESSURES EASE
Factories, generally less affected by coronavirus restrictions, also suffered somewhat and the manufacturing PMI dipped to a 10-month low of 58.0 from November's 58.4. An index measuring output that feeds into the composite PMI nudged up to 53.9 from 53.8.
In one brighter spot for policymakers at the European Central Bank https://www.reuters.com/markets/rates-bonds/ecb-set-dial-back-stimulus-one-more-notch-2021-12-15, who meet later on Thursday, price pressures abated although remained high. The input prices index eased to 87.0 from 88.9, and the output prices index staged an even bigger fall.
""Price pressures have been easing in December, albeit only cautiously. It is a cautious sign of some easing pressures coming from supply shortages, which confirms some anecdotal evidence but it's way too early to conclude that the worst is behind us,"" said Bert Colijn at ING. 
The ECB is set to halve the amount of assets it buys each month from April, according to a Reuters poll https://www.reuters.com/article/eurozone-economy-poll/ecb-to-halve-bond-purchases-from-april-say-economists-idUSKBN2IS00V of economists, although interest rate increases are likely years away.

But as the vaccine roll-out continues apace, optimism about the year ahead improved. The composite future output index recovered to 66.5 from 66.1.
""Forward-looking indicators also offered a glimmer of hope. Year-ahead sentiment improved marginally in December, in part due to hopes of further easing in supply-side disruptions following some encouraging signs in December,"" said Ricardo Amaro at Oxford Economics.

The European Union's statistics office Eurostat said the unadjusted trade surplus of the 19 countries using the euro was only 3.6 billion euros in October, down from 29.8 billion a year earlier and half of the 7.6 billion expected by economists.
While seasonally unadjusted exports rose 7.3% year-on-year in October, the value of imports rocketed 24.1%, Eurostat said. Adjusted for seasonal swings, the trade surplus was 2.4 billion euros with exports up 2.4% month-on-month and imports up 4.3%.
This was mainly a result of much more expensive energy that the euro zone imports mainly from Russia and Norway. In the first 10 months of the year the overall energy trade deficit of the whole European Union rose to 207.2 billion euros from 131.6 billion in the same period of 2020.

The EU's trade deficit with its biggest trading partner China also widened to 189.2 billion euros in January-October from 151.8 billion in the same period of 2020. 
At the same time the bloc's trade surplus with Britain continued to grow after the United Kingdom left the EU's single market at the start of 2021, rising to 115.4 billion euros in the 10 months of 2021 from 88.2 billion in 10 months of 2020.

The preliminary ""flash"" IHS Markit/CIPS UK Composite Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) sank to 53.2 in December from 57.6 in November.
While still above the 50 dividing line between growth and contraction, a Reuters poll of economists had pointed to a much stronger reading of 56.4.
The survey showed slower growth in new orders and price pressures - something that will have been noted by the BoE's rate-setters who had access to the PMI in advance of their December policy decision, due to be announced at 1200 GMT.
Inflation has soared globally this year due to higher energy prices and COVID-related supply-chain bottlenecks. In Britain, post-Brexit trade and migration barriers have added to the problems.
The BoE has said interest rates will almost certainly need to rise to bring down inflation pressures, but it held off on a widely expected move last month due to uncertainty about the impact of the end of the government's job furlough programme.
Data subsequently showed no hit to the labour market, but Thursday's PMI suggested faltering economic growth caused by the Omicron variant and restrictions to slow its spread is now the main downside risk.
""Activity fell sharply in the hotels, restaurants, travel and transport sectors, and ground to a halt in other consumer-facing businesses,"" said Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit.
""The pace of economic growth looks likely to continue to weaken as we head into 2022.""
The PMI for the services sector fell sharply to 53.2 in December from 58.5 in November, reaching its lowest level since February and below all forecasts in the Reuters poll that had pointed to a reading of 57.0.
The survey's gauge of optimism hit a 14-month low.
""Concerns about prolonged pandemic restrictions and the subsequent hit to business and consumer confidence had a negative influence on growth expectations for 2022,"" IHS Markit said.
Manufacturers have fared better this month.
The factory PMI's output index rose to 53.3 in December from 52.7 in November, a four-month high, thanks to an easing in supply chain problems that have persisted for more than a year.

Export orders have fallen again, however.
""Brexit-related trade difficulties featured prominently in the comments from survey respondents that saw a drop in export sales during December,"" IHS Markit said.

IHS Markit's flash composite purchasing managers' index fell to 50.0, an 18-month low, from 52.2 in November. This was weaker than a Reuters poll of analysts who had predicted a decline to 51.1 in December.
A reading of 50 marks an unchanged level of activity, with any value above that signalling growth and any below pointing to a contraction.
""The German economic recovery was stopped in its tracks in December by the resurgence of the pandemic, as renewed restrictions and increased uncertainty dampened activity across the country's service sector,"" Markit economist Phil Smith said.
The flash PMI for services activity dropped to 48.4, a 10-month low, from 52.7 the previous month, suggesting a drop in sales among retailers in the crucial holiday season at the end of the year.
The industrial sector showed some signs of improvement after supply bottlenecks for microchips and other intermediate goods hit factory output, especially among Germany's big carmakers.
The flash PMI for manufacturing edged up to 57.9 from 57.4 in November.
""Any disruption to supply chains from the emergence of the Omicron variant seems to have been limited so far,"" Smith said.
But he cautioned that the Omicron impact may not have filtered through yet and the situation could change quickly if more infections started to appear, especially in countries with a ""zero COVID"" approach.
The PMI survey data pointed to rates of inflation in input costs and output charges easing slightly from the multi-year highs seen in November when the EU-harmonized consumer price index hit 6% in Germany.
At the same time, business expectations brightened, buoyed by hopes that supply-chain problems and pandemic-related curbs on activity could fade over the coming year, Markit said.

The Ifo economic institute said on Tuesday it expected the German economy to shrink by 0.5% quarter-on-quarter in the final three months of this year and to stagnate in the first three months of next year.
Coupled with the current surge in overall prices, Germany is now facing several winter months of ""stagflation"", or zero growth combined with unusually high inflation.

Data compiler IHS Markit said that its flash composite PMI index for December, which includes both the services and manufacturing sectors, stood at 55.6 points.
While readings above 50 points point to positive overall business expectations, the latest print marked a slight drop from the 56.1 recorded in November, although it still beat the consensus forecast in a Reuters poll of analysts of 55.0 points.
""A new wave of COVID-19 infections and the emergence of the Omicron variant reportedly weighed on the upturn"", said IHS economist Joe Hayes.
The reading for growth in France's dominant services sector edged down to 57.1 points from 57.4 in November, but it beat a forecast for 56.0 points.
The flash PMI for the manufacturing sector in December fell 54.9 points, down from 55.9 points in November and falling short of the 55.5 points seen by analysts.
IHS said that overseas demand fell at the fastest pace since January.

""The drop in new foreign client business was particularly pronounced at service providers as the emergence of the Omicron variant dented tourism"", Hayes said, adding that the manufacturing sector was still experiencing shortages of raw materials and components.
""Late deliveries of inputs and delayed production schedules were commonly cited factors by survey respondents,"" he added.

The Federal Statistics Office said the negotiated wages of unionised employees rose by an average of 1.3% on the year in 2021, the smallest increase recorded since the office began compiling the data in 2010.
With consumer prices projected to rise by 3% this year, workers suffered an actual drop in real wages.
Central bankers and policymakers are watching wage developments in the euro zone very closely. They are looking for any hints as to whether rising consumer prices lead to higher wages which could mark the start of a wage price spiral and lead to higher inflation also in the medium term.
The decline in real wages bodes ill for future household spending which was the sole driver of gross domestic product growth in the third quarter in light of supply bottlenecks and production problems in the industrial sector.

Restrictions to break a fourth wave of coronavirus infections are likely to hurt retail sales and business in the services sector, knocking away Germany's last pillar of growth in the final quarter this year.
The new chancellor, Olaf Scholz from the centre-left Social Democrats, has vowed to raise the national minimum wage by around 25% to 12 euros an hour next year.

The figure was not as bad as expected by economists polled by Reuters, who had forecast production-based growth would shrink 4.5% for the quarter, while the Reserve Bank of New Zealand had pencilled in a drop of 7.0%.
The fall follows a 2.4% rise in the June quarter.
Annual GDP fell 0.3%, also better than a Reuters poll forecast for a 1.6% drop, Statistics New Zealand said in a statement.
The New Zealand dollar was largely unmoved by the announcement, maintaining earlier gains that took it to $0.6780.
New Zealand's largest city, Auckland, was in lockdown for most of the third quarter after it became the epicentre of a Delta outbreak, forcing businesses and other activities to stay shut for about 100 days. 
Retail, manufacturing, construction, and recreational activities were the most affected by lockdown measures, the statistics department said.
New Zealand's economy has rebounded strongly from last year's recession, due to its success in eliminating the coronavirus for a long period. The country was virus-free for months until the Delta outbreak in Auckland in August. 
Concerns of an overheated economy prompted the Reserve Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ) to raise interest rates twice in recent months.

""With (COVID) restrictions gradually easing over Q3 and Q4 we think activity will rebound in Q4,"" Ben Udy, economist at Capital Economics said in a note. 
""Given that the fall in activity in Q3 was well below the RBNZ's expectations, today's data will only add fuel to market expectations of further interest rate hikes,"" he added.

SYDNEY (Reuters) -Australian employment blew past all expectations in November as coronavirus lockdowns were lifted, driving the unemployment rate sharply lower in a major boost to the economic outlook.
The upside surprise came just as the head of the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) opened the door to an early end to bond buying should the recovery outpace expectations.
Thursday's data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics certainly met that criteria with employment jumping a record 366,100 in November, eclipsing market forecasts of a 205,000 rebound. 
A sharp 4.5% increase in hours worked also pointed to a strong rebound in economic growth after a Delta-driven contraction in the third quarter.
The jobless rate dropped to 4.6%, from 5.2% in October, well under forecasts of 5.0%. The decline came even as a lot more people went looking for work, pushing the participation rate up to 66.1% and back near pre-pandemic peaks.
That outperformance also suggested the RBA would have to upgrade its forecasts given it had thought unemployment would not reach 4.5% until the middle of next year.
""It's fair to say that the labour market has all but recovered from the lockdowns,"" said Marcel Thieliant, a senior economist at Capital Economics.
""The remarkable recovery suggests the RBA will end its asset purchases altogether in February.""
The central bank currently buys A$4 billion ($2.87 billion)of government bonds a week as part of its quantitative easing campaign and had been looking to taper that in February before ending purchases in May.
An early end to the programme would echo the U.S. Federal Reserve's decision to cease its purchases in March, though the RBA still insists an actual hike in rates is unlikely in 2022.
""We are in no hurry to increase interest rates,"" RBA Governor Philip Lowe said earlier on Thursday, arguing that inflation and wage growth in Australia was still well below U.S. levels and rising only slowly.
Financial markets have other ideas, with futures fully priced for hike to 0.25% by June and rates approaching 1.0% by the end of the year.
Data on labour demand seem to support the market with job advertisements surging 15% in October and November to reach 13-year highs, more than 40% up on pre-pandemic levels.

Firms are also increasingly complaining of a lack of suitable workers, in part because Australia's borders remained closed to migrants and backpackers.

The economy added 366,100 roles in November, compared with economists’ estimate for a 200,000 increase, data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics showed Thursday. The unemployment rate declined to 4.6% after having risen in the previous two months and was better than the median forecast of 5%. The participation rate rose to 66.1% from a revised 64.6% in October. 
Australia’s benchmark three-year bond yields extended gains to 11 basis points while the currency swung from a decline to a small advance.
The result will be a shot in the arm for a conservative government that’s trailing in opinion polls ahead of an election due by May. It’s aiming to further buttress its economic credentials after steering the country through a once-in-a-century pandemic, with Treasurer Josh Frydenberg releasing updated budget forecasts later today that are expected to show an improving fiscal position.
The data will also be welcomed by the nation’s monetary authorities, with the Reserve Bank aiming to tighten the labor market sufficiently -- meaning unemployment around 4% -- to spur faster inflation. The RBA is running ultra-low interest rates at present and Governor Philip Lowe says he won’t be hiking until actual inflation, not forecast, is sustainably within the central bank’s 2-3% target.
The RBA forecasts underlying inflation will only reach the mid-point of the band in late 2023. Money markets are more optimistic on the economy’s prospects and are challenging Lowe’s (NYSE:LOW) stance: pricing in three rate increases next year. 
Today’s jobs data, while only one month, is likely to add ballast to the market’s view that the central bank’s guidance puts it on track to fall behind the curve.

Activity in the services sector also grew at a slower pace, slipping from a more than two-year high recorded in the prior month, suggesting it will take time for the sector to fully recoup the negative impact from the coronavirus pandemic.
The au Jibun Bank Flash Japan Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) fell to a seasonally adjusted 54.2 from a final 54.5 in the previous months.
""Manufacturers and services companies signalled softer rates of output and new order growth compared to November,"" said Annabel Fiddes, economics associate director at IHS Markit, which compiles the survey.
""Cost pressures also remained more acute at manufacturers, with average input prices rising rapidly amid reports of higher material costs and supplier shortages.""
Manufacturers reported a decline in suppliers' delivery times and stocks of purchases and a slowing expansion of new export orders.
Both manufacturers and service-sector firms became less optimistic about business conditions in the 12 months ahead, IHS Markit's Fiddes said. 
""Concerns over supply chains, rising costs and the unpredictable nature of the pandemic (including new strains) pushed overall optimism down to the lowest in four months,"" she said.

Human resources data company XpertHR said there were signs of pay pressure with median settlements the highest since June 2020 and up from the 2.0% recorded in the three months to the end of August.
Pay freezes were much rarer than last year and the top quarter of pay awards were for a rise of at least 3%.
However, the increase is far below the 5.1% increase in consumer price inflation recorded for November and a 7.1% rise in retail price inflation which trade unions often use as a basis for wage bargaining.
""The rise in the median basic pay award could be the first sign of the pay pressure that we expect to see in the months ahead,"" said Sheila Attwood, pay and benefits editor at XpertHR.
""High inflation rates pushing up the cost of living and labour shortages are putting pressure on employers to increase wages to attract and retain workers,"" she added.

The Bank of England has been looking closely at pay pressures ahead of its December interest rate decision, due to be announced at 1200 GMT on Thursday.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -Foreign holdings of U.S. Treasuries, led by Japan and China, rose to a record high for the month of October, data from the Treasury department showed on Wednesday.
Major foreign owners of Treasuries showed holdings of $7.648 trillion in October, an all-time peak, compared with $7.549 trillion the previous month.
The record number suggested continued appetite for U.S. government debt given uncertainty about global growth and inflation and amid low bond yields around the world, analysts said.
""U.S. yields were a little higher during the month and that may have attracted some of the buyers and made Treasuries look like a better investment,"" said Gennadiy Goldberg, senior rates strategist, at TD Securities in New York.
U.S. benchmark 10-year Treasury yields started October with a yield of 1.4650%, rising nearly 10 basis points to 1.5609% by the end of that month.
Japan remained the largest non-U.S. holder of Treasuries with holdings in October of $1.320 trillion, a record peak, from $1.299 trillion the previous month.
China's holdings also increased to $1.065 trillion, from $1.047 trillion in September. 
On a transaction basis, foreigners sold Treasuries in the month of October to the tune of $43.5 billion, the largest outflow since May.
But TD's Goldberg said this does not reflect the true picture in terms of foreign holdings of Treasuries because there is a bias toward transactions that does not account for steady holdings.
Data also showed U.S. corporate bonds had inflows for a third straight month with $11.995 billion in October, from $1.09 billion in September.
Foreign investors, meanwhile, sold $21.827 billion in U.S. equities in October, after also selling $10.951 billion the previous month.
Data also showed that U.S. residents reduced their holdings of long-term foreign securities, with net sales of $29.2

Overall, net foreign acquisitions of U.S. long-term and short-term securities, including banking flows, showed a net inflow of $143 billion in October, from an outflow of $27.3 billion in September.

778,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 15, 2021 03:02PM ET</span>","Shortages, inflation curb U.S. retail sales in November","By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. retail sales increased less than expected in November, likely payback after surging in the prior month as Americans started their holiday shopping early to avoid empty shelves.
A rotation in spending from goods back to services also appears to have held back retail sales last month, with the report from the Commerce Department on Wednesday showing a sharp drop in receipts at electronics and appliance stores. Online retail sales were unchanged. Higher food and gasoline prices are probably curtailing discretionary spending. 
The modest retail sales gain did not change views that the economy was regaining steam after a slowdown in the third quarter that was triggered by the COVID-19 Delta variant and rampant shortages. In a nod to soaring inflation, the Federal Reserve on Wednesday said it would end its pandemic-era bond purchases in March, paving the way for three quarter-percentage-point interest rate increases by the end of 2022.
""Consumers are still doing their best to keep the economy's sails full and the recovery on track,"" said Christopher Rupkey, chief economist at FWDBONDS in New York.
Retail sales rose 0.3% last month after surging 1.8% in October. Sales have now risen for four straight months. They increased 18.2% year-on-year in November. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast retail sales rising 0.8%. Estimates ranged from as low as being unchanged to as high as a 1.5% increase.
Several of the top U.S. retailers reported in mid-November that they had noticed an earlier start to holiday shopping. Retail sales could remain moderate in December, though higher savings and rising wages amid a tight labor market are supportive of spending.
Trillions of dollars in COVID-19 pandemic relief from governments across the globe fueled demand for goods, straining supply chains. The resulting shortages, ranging from motor vehicles to furniture and electronics, have raised goods prices.
Consumer prices increased a solid 0.8% in November, with the year-on-year gain of 6.8% the largest since June 1982. Inflation is likely to remain high for a while. A separate report from the Labor Department on Wednesday showed import prices increased 0.7% in November.
""Consumers have been bombarded with messages about the impact of supply shortages on the availability of holiday gifts,"" said David Berson, chief economist at Nationwide in Columbus, Ohio. ""They may well have done a lot of their holiday shopping earlier than usual.""
Stocks on Wall Street were mixed. The dollar rose against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices fell.
MIXED BAG
The moderation in retail sales, which are mostly goods, was in part due to shortages and higher prices. Receipts at auto dealerships dipped 0.1% after accelerating 1.7% in October. Automobiles remain scarce because of a global semiconductor shortage. Sales at electronics and appliance stores fell 4.6%.
But sales at service stations increased 1.7%, lifted by higher gasoline prices. Receipts at food and beverage stores rose 1.3%, also reflecting rising inflation. 
""Food and gas are forcing hard choices for consumers in other areas this holiday season,"" said Tim Quinlan, a senior economist at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) in Charlotte, North Carolina. ""Consumers are no longer the price-takers they were when they were flush with cash from stimulus checks."" 
There were also increases in sales at building material stores as well as at sporting goods, hobby, musical instrument and book stores. Sales at clothing stores rose 0.5%. 
Receipts at restaurants and bars increased 1.0%. Restaurants and bars are the only services category in the retail sales report. These sales were up 37.4% from last November, suggesting spending was reverting back to services. Demand shifted to goods during the pandemic.
Excluding automobiles, gasoline, building materials and food services, retail sales dipped 0.1%. Data for October was revised higher to show these so-called core retail sales accelerating 1.8% instead of the previously reported 1.6%.
Core retail sales correspond most closely with the consumer spending component of gross domestic product. Though inflation-adjusted, or real, consumer spending was probably flat in November, it is above its third-quarter pace. Consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity rose at a 1.7% annualized rate in the third quarter.
""We still think that real consumer spending growth will be strong in the fourth quarter on average, with firm earlier momentum before the disappointing November,"" said Daniel Silver, an economist at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) in New York.
Rising COVID-19 infections could slow spending over winter, with the highly transmissible Omicron variant posing an additional risk. The Atlanta Fed lowered its fourth-quarter growth estimate to a 7.0% rate from a 8.7% pace earlier.
The economy grew at a 2.1% pace in the third quarter. Growth estimates for this quarter were boosted by a third report from the Commerce Department on Wednesday showing businesses' inventories accelerated 1.2% in October.

""The winter Delta wave is now upon us,"" said Diane Swonk
chief economist at Grant Thornton in Chicago. ""The bulk of the weakness associated with the current wave of infections is expected to show up in the first quarter data.""

779,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 15, 2021 10:26AM ET</span>",U.S. business inventories increase strongly in October,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. business inventory accumulation increased strongly in October, suggesting that restocking could again support economic growth this quarter even as motor vehicle inventories remain depressed because of shortages.
Business inventories rose 1.2% after gaining 0.8% in September, the Commerce Department said on Wednesday. Inventories are a key component of gross domestic product.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast inventories rising 1.1%. Inventories increased 7.8% on a year-on-year basis in October. Retail inventories edged up 0.1% in October as estimated in an advance report published last month. That followed a 0.1% dip in September. Motor vehicle inventories decreased 1.0% instead of 0.7% as estimated last month.
Retail inventories excluding autos, which go into the calculation of GDP, increased 0.5%, rather than 0.4% as estimated last month.
A moderate pace of inventory drawdown in the third quarter accounted for all of the 2.1% annualized rise in GDP last quarter. Inventories were depleted in the first half of the year, and COVID-19 pandemic-related shortages are making it difficult to rebuild stocks.
The urgent need to restock is keeping manufacturing humming and supporting the overall economy.
""Inventory-to-sales ratios have collapsed throughout the pandemic,"" said Jonathan Golub, chief U.S. equity strategist at  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) Securities USA in New York. ""While supply constraints have contributed to these declines, robust sales is the primary culprit. Inadequate inventories, and the need to replenish them, should support robust nominal GDP in 2022.""
There are concerns from some economists that businesses wary of delays getting stock could over-order and end up with excess inventory, which could put the economic expansion in jeopardy.

Wholesale inventories rose 2.3% in October. Stocks at manufacturers increased 0.8%.
Business sales advanced 2.1% in October after rising 1.2% in September. At October's sales pace, it would take 1.24 months for businesses to clear shelves, down from 1.26 months in September.

780,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 15, 2021 08:46AM ET</span>","Japan overstated some construction order data for years, PM says","By Tetsushi Kajimoto and Kantaro Komiya
TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's prime minister said on Wednesday that the government had overstated the value of some construction orders received from builders for years, in a blow to the credibility of official statistics widely used by investors and economists.
Officials and analysts said the builders involved were relatively small firms and therefore this practice was likely to have had only a minimal impact on gross domestic product (GDP) figures.
""It is regrettable that such a thing has happened,"" Prime Minister Fumio Kishida said. ""The government will examine as soon as possible what steps it can take to avoid such an incident from happening again.""
He made the comment in parliament after the Asahi newspaper reported that the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism had been ""rewriting"" data received from about 12,000 companies since 2013 at a pace of about 10,000 entries per year.
Kishida said that ""improvements"" had been made since January 2020 and that there was no direct impact on GDP data for the fiscal years 2020 and 2021.
However, the news is likely to raise questions about the reliability of data that is a cornerstone for economists and investors looking to understand and forecast trends in the world's third-largest economy.
It is not the first time that issues have been raised about government data. Similar concern was voiced about a flaw in health ministry wage data found in 2018.
""The biggest problem is not the effect on the GDP per se but the damage to reliability of (official) statistics,"" said Saisuke Sakai, senior economist at Mizuho Research and Technologies.
""We can't help doubting this kind of issue could happen across government ministries,"" Sakai said.
'UNDER PRESSURE'
The construction orders data combines public and private orders, which in fiscal 2020 totalled roughly 80 trillion yen ($700 billion). The figures also feed into Japan's GDP calculations. 
For the construction survey, the ministry collects monthly orders data from building companies through local prefectural authorities.
Companies that fall behind in submitting data often sent in several months' worth of figures at a time. In these instances, the ministry would instruct local authorities to rewrite the orders for the combined months as the figure for the latest, single month.
""We engaged in such a practice to reflect the actual situation regarding orders placed. If we had refused to collect data that way, the number of samples would have dwindled,"" said a ministry official directly in charge of the data.
The official added that the practice may have begun in around 2000, when the ministry started tracking the data.
""We were under pressure not to reduce samples, even though looking back, this practice was weird.""
Furthermore, when an entry was missing from a company, the ministry would put in a tentative figure by taking the average of the orders from the rest of the industry in that month, resulting in double-counting once the missing sum arrived.
Considering Japan has hundreds of thousands of construction companies, the proportion of those concerned was very small, said Akiyoshi Takumori, chief economist at Sumitomo Mitsui (NYSE:SMFG) DS Asset Management.
""How much influence do they have? The kind of sloppy company which puts out numbers late is probably not big.""
Still, Land Minister Tetsuo Saito, a veteran lawmaker of the Komeito party, the smaller of the two ruling coalition parties, confirmed the practice in parliament and said it was ""extremely regrettable"".
Ministry officials said they had not directly reported the data flaws to Saito's predecessor, Kazuyoshi Akaba.
Asked about the issue, the government's top spokesperson said only that the land ministry had been instructed to analyse ""as soon as possible"" what had led to the practice.
""We will first wait for the results of that investigation,"" Chief Cabinet Secretary Hirokazu Matsuno told reporters.

Restating data this way, which may have broken the law, continued until January 2020 after the Board of Audit pointed it out to the ministry, the ministry said. It added that the original construction survey forms from before 2019 had already been discarded so it would be hard to restore monthly figures from previous years.

The value of overall retail purchases increased 0.3% last month, following an upwardly revised 1.8% advance in October, Commerce Department figures showed Wednesday. Excluding gas and motor vehicles, sales climbed 0.2% in November. The figures aren’t adjusted for inflation.
The median estimate in a Bloomberg survey called for a 0.8% gain in overall retail sales from the prior month. 
The softer-than-expected report may reflect the pulling forward of holiday sales as many Americans, aware of supply-chain slowdowns, shopped earlier than usual. 
U.S. consumer prices are rising at the fastest rate in almost 40 years. Accelerating inflation risks may give consumers additional pause in coming months, especially as remaining fiscal supports like a moratorium on federal student loan payments end early next year.
Inflation-adjusted consumer spending data for November will be released next week.
Five of the 13 retail categories showed declines in receipts last month, led by a drop at electronics and appliances merchants. Sales at non-store retailers, which includes e-commerce, were little changed in November.
Rising prices could be driving some of the increases in categories like gasoline stations and grocery stores. 
So-called control group sales -- which are used to calculate gross domestic product and exclude food services, auto dealers, building materials stores and gasoline stations -- fell 0.1% in November from a month earlier.

782,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 15, 2021 07:06AM ET</span>",UK inflation jumps above 5% as BoE considers rate rise,"By David Milliken and Andy Bruce
LONDON (Reuters) -British inflation surged to its highest in more than 10 years in November, jumping to 5.1% and potentially unsettling the Bank of England a day before it announces whether it is raising interest rates for the first time since COVID-19 struck.
Price pressure from a broad range of consumer goods and services - but especially petrol, clothing and footwear - lay behind the increase in inflation to its highest since September 2011, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said.
The reading exceeded all forecasts in a Reuters poll of economists, which had pointed to a rise of 4.7% from October's 4.2%. 
Last month the BoE, which announces its December policy decision on Thursday, had predicted consumer price inflation - just 0.7% at the start of 2021 - would peak at around 5% next April, when regulated household energy bills increase.
Inflation has soared globally this year due to higher energy prices and COVID-related supply-chain bottlenecks. In Britain, post-Brexit trade and migration barriers have also caused problems.
The BoE has said interest rates will almost certainly need to rise to bring down inflation pressures, but held off on a widely expected move last month due to uncertainty about the impact of the end of the government's job furlough programme.
Many economists still expect the BoE to stay on hold again on Thursday, because of the potential impact on economic growth of rapidly rising cases of the Omicron coronavirus variant, despite the inflation surprise.
""Under usual circumstances, it would be consistent with an imminent rate rise,"" said HSBC economist Chris Hare. On balance, Omicron headwinds pointed to no rise on Thursday. ""But the decision is not a straightforward one by any means,"" he added.
INFLATION IN ACTION
The International Monetary Fund - which predicts British inflation will hit a 30-year high of 5.5% next year - on Tuesday urged the BoE not to succumb to ""inaction bias"".
However, any immediate rise in borrowing costs would do little to curb a short-term rise in inflation. 
Samuel Tombs, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said it could reach 6% next April but fall rapidly thereafter and undershoot the BoE's 2% target in 2023.
Market reaction to Wednesday's data was initially muted. Sterling rose modestly against the dollar and the euro, and interest-rate sensitive two-year gilt yields hit a one-week high.
Interest rate futures now price in a 63% chance of a rate rise on Thursday - compared with below 50% on Wednesday, and see a slightly faster pace of tightening in 2022. 
A rate rise to 0.25% from 0.1% was already fully priced in for February, which would make the BoE the first of the world's major central banks to increase interest rates since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Wednesday's data showed core consumer price inflation, which excludes more volatile energy, food, alcohol and tobacco prices, rose to 4.0% from October's 3.4%, its highest since 1992. Fuel prices rose 28.5%.
The retail price inflation (RPI) measure - used for inflation-linked government bonds and wage-bargaining but which the ONS says is no longer accurate - rose to 7.1% from 6.0%, its highest since March 1991.

Consumer prices rose 5.5% year-on-year in November, the fastest pace since 1992, according to final data from INE, up from 5.4% in October. 
The flash estimate for November released late last month was 5.6%. The monthly inflation rate in November was 0.3%. 
Food and transport prices rose 3.3% and 13.5% from a year ago, the INE said in its more detailed second reading, pushed by high fuel prices.
Core inflation, which strips out volatile food and energy prices, was 1.7% year-on-year, compared with a reading of 1.4% a month earlier, INE added.

High inflation threatens Spain's growth prospects. Bank of Spain Governor Pablo Hernandez de Cos said on Tuesday that rising inflation, supply bottlenecks and a surge in COVID-19 cases in Europe would hit the Spanish economy and prompt a slight downward revision of growth forecasts in the fourth quarter and early 2022.
Meanwhile, the European Central Bank is maintaining its message that rapid price growth is temporary. ECB President Christine Lagarde said earlier this month that euro zone inflation had already peaked and may soon begin a decline that will continue through next year.

Investing.com -- Annual consumer price inflation in the UK surged to 5.1% in November, adding to pressure to the Bank of England to raise interest rates.
The Office for National Statistics (ONS) reported on Wednesday that consumer prices rose at their fastest rate since September 2008, from 4.2% in October. Analysts had expected a rate of 4.7% ahead of time. The monthly rate of inflation rose 0.7%, compared with a fall of 0.1% in the same month the previous year.
The ONS attributed the rise in inflation to transport, housing and household services.
The inflation data is the last reading on consumer prices that BoE policymakers will receive before their final policy meeting of the year on Thursday. Strength in the labor market and elevated inflation underline the case for higher interest rates. But renewed fears over the prospect of an economic slowdown from the rapid spread of the Omicron variant of Covid -19 mean policymakers are likely to keep rates on hold.
On Tuesday, the latest UK employment report showed that jobs growth remained strong and vacancies stayed at record levels in November.
The BoE had been expected to hike rates in November, in what would have been the first increase since the pandemic struck, but instead it kept rates unchanged, despite some hawkish guidance from top policymakers in the weeks leading up to the meeting. 
Last week data showed that the UK economy flatlined in October, even before the emergence of Omicron, causing markets to push back bets for a rate hike to February."

BEIJING (Reuters) -China's factory output grew faster than expected in November, supported by stronger energy production and a moderation in sky-high materials costs, but new curbs to fight rising COVID-19 cases hit retailers in the world's second-largest economy.
The data, along with a slowdown in investment growth, underlines the persistent headwinds facing the economy, which have already prompted policymakers this month to ratchet up support.
""The economy remained quite weak in November,"" said Zhiwei Zhang, chief economist at Pinpoint Asset Management.
""Domestic consumption weakened further, which is driven by the zero tolerance policy that hurts the service sector and the continued slowdown in the property sector.""
Factory production rose 3.8% in November from a year earlier, official data showed on Wednesday, beating expectations for a 3.6% rise and accelerating from a 3.5% increase in October.
China's coal output hit a record in November as Beijing urged miners to ramp up production to ensure sufficient energy supplies in the winter heating season, while daily crude oil throughput rebounded in November.
Retail sales, however, rose 3.9% in November from a year earlier, below the 4.6% growth expected in the poll and October's 4.9% rise.
Fixed asset investment rose 5.2% in the first 11 months from the same period a year earlier, slower than the 5.4% increase tipped by a Reuters poll and the 6.1% in January-October.
China's economy, which is losing steam after a solid recovery from the pandemic last year, faces multiple challenges heading into 2022, due to a property downturn and strict COVID-19 curbs that have hit consumer spending.
Despite the pick-up in industrial activity in November, new COVID-19 outbreaks are creating fresh problems for policymakers as the Omicron variant of the virus threatens the global economic outlook.
More than a dozen Chinese-listed companies said they had suspended production in coronavirus-hit parts of Zhejiang province in response to new COVID-19 curbs, causing their share prices to plunge this week.
Separate data on Wednesday showed China's property downturn persisted in the final quarter of 2021 with home prices, sales, investment and construction mired in negative territory last month, weighed by weak demand and a cash crunch among developers.
Some analysts expect fourth-quarter gross domestic product growth to dip below 4% from the 4.9% pace in the previous quarter, although the full-year growth could still be about 8%, above the official target of over 6%.
China's red-hot factory-gate inflation cooled slightly, driven by a government crackdown on runaway commodity prices and an easing power crunch.
MORE SUPPORT LIKELY
At a key agenda-setting meeting last week, China's top leaders pledged to focus on stabilising the economy and keeping growth within a reasonable range in 2022.
Signalling a sense of urgency, top leaders have also vowed to front-load stimulus next year ahead of the 20th Communist Party Congress, where key political leadership changes are likely to announced.
To shore up flagging growth, the People's Bank of China (PBOC) has cut the amount of cash banks must hold in reserve, its second such move this year. It also cut the rates on its relending facility to support the rural sector and small firms.
On Wednesday, the PBOC injected funds into the financial system through medium-term loans, but kept the interest rate on that facility unchanged.
Ting Lu, chief China economist at Nomura, said this week he expected the downward pressure on the economy to persist in the first half of 2022, prompting the central bank to deliver another half percentage point RRR cut.
 Barclays  (LON:BARC) expects one round of 5-10 basis point cuts on the rates of open market operations, the medium-term lending facility and benchmark loan prime rate by March 2022 and one more RRR cut in the first quarter.

Citi expects China to keep its budget deficit of 3.2% of GDP in 2022, in line with 2021, and a quota of 3.8 trillion yuan ($597.02 billion) on special local government bonds to fund infrastructure projects, up from 3.65 trillion yuan this year.

Investing.com – China's industrial production grew faster than expected in November, with stronger energy production and moderating raw materials prices lending support. However, growth in retail sales slowed as fresh COVID-19 outbreaks led to tighter restrictive measures in the country.
Chinese data released earlier in the day showed that industrial production grew 3.8% year-on-year, above the 3.6% growth in forecasts prepared by Investing.com and the previous month’s 3.5% growth. However, Chinese industrial production in the year to date grew 10.1% year-on-year, lower than October’s 10.9% growth.
The data also showed that retail sales grew 3.9% year-on-year, lower than the 4.6% growth in forecasts prepared by Investing.com and October’s 4.9% growth. Fixed asset investment grew 5.2% year-on-year, also lower than the 5.4% growth in forecasts prepared by Investing.com and the previous month’s 6.1% growth.
The largely disappointing data emphasized the headwinds faced by the world’s second-largest economy’s recovery. These include wobbles in the property sector and COVID-19 outbreaks leading to tight restrictive measures and reduced consumer spending.

The Westpac-Melbourne Institute index of consumer sentiment released on Wednesday fell 1.0% in December, wiping out November's 0.6% gain.
The index reading was down 6.9% on December last year, though at 104.3 it meant optimists still outnumbered pessimists.
Westpac chief economist Bill Evans noted there were sharp falls in New South Wales and Victoria where COVID-19 cases were highest. The survey also found more concern about rising inflation, which may have hurt spending plans.
The survey's measure of whether it was a good time to buy a major household item slid 5.3% in December, to be down more than 13% on a year ago.
""The strong growth outlook we see for 2022 is dependent on a surge in consumer spending, as households re-emerge from restrictions and draw down on the large savings accumulated through the COVID lockdown periods,"" said Evans.

789,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 14, 2021 01:23PM ET</span>",U.S. producer prices soar as supply bottlenecks persist,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. producer prices increased more than expected in November as supply constraints persisted, leading to the biggest annual gain since the series was revamped 11 years ago and supporting views that inflation could remain uncomfortably high for some time.
The report from the Labor Department on Tuesday, which also showed strong growth in underlying producer inflation, followed on the heels of news last Friday that annual consumer prices surged by the most since 1982 in November. Soaring inflation complicates President Joe Biden economic agenda, including a $1.75 trillion social policy and climate bill stuck in Congress. 
Together with a tightening labor market, rising price pressures will likely see the Federal Reserve announcing that it will accelerate the tapering of its massive bond purchases when officials end a two-day meeting on Wednesday and potentially start raising interest rates sooner than previously expected.
""Price metrics have been running well above target for much longer than anticipated,"" said Rubeela Farooqi, chief U.S. economist at High Frequency Economics in White Plains, New York. ""These data support the Fed's switch to a faster taper that will likely precede a quicker tightening of policy next year.""
The producer price index for final demand jumped 0.8% last month after advancing 0.6% in October. The broad-based increase in the PPI was led by a 0.7% rise in services, which followed a 0.2% gain in October. The acceleration in services reflected a 2.9% jump in prices for portfolio management. 
There were also increases in prices for hotel and motel accommodation as well as airline fares and transportation of freight and mail. But prices for wholesale furnishings and bundled wired telecommunications access services fell.
Wholesale goods prices rose 1.2% after increasing 1.3% in October. Prices for iron and steel scrap rose 10.7%. There were also increases in wholesale gasoline and food prices. But prices for diesel fuel fell as did the cost of light motor trucks. 
In the 12 months through November, the PPI shot up 9.6%. That was the largest gain since November 2010 and followed an 8.8% increase in October. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the PPI climbing 0.5% on a monthly basis and surging 9.2% year-on-year.
The government reported last Friday that the consumer price index surged 6.4% in the 12 months through November, the biggest year-on-year rise since June 1982.
Trillions of dollars in COVID-19 pandemic relief from governments across the globe fueled demand for goods, leaving supply chains overstretched. The normalization of economic activity has also juiced demand for services, with the delivery of some being hampered by worker shortages, driving up prices.
Stocks on Wall Street were mostly lower. The dollar was flat against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices fell.
GLIMMERS OF HOPE
There are, however, some hopeful signs that the supply bottlenecks could be starting to ease. An Institute for Supply Management survey this month showed ""some indications of slight labor and supplier delivery improvement"" in November. 
Crude oil prices have eased off recent highs and were approaching $73 a barrel on Tuesday after the International Energy Agency said that the Omicron coronavirus variant was set to dent the global demand recovery. Shipping costs are also off their recent peaks. 
""Supply chain pressures should ease in the next few months as holiday shopping lets up and producers have more time to adjust capacity, but the impacts on producer prices and then to consumer prices will not be immediate,"" said Will Compernolle, a senior economist at FHN Financial in New York.
""In the meantime, year-on-year changes in producer prices will remain high.""
Excluding the volatile food, energy and trade services components, producer prices surged 0.7%. The so-called core PPI gained 0.4% in October. In the 12 months through November, the core PPI jumped 6.9%, the largest rise since 12-month data were first calculated in August 2014, after marching 6.3% in October.
The Fed tracks the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index, excluding the volatile food and energy components, for its flexible 2% inflation target.
Portfolio management prices, hotel and motel accommodation as well as airline fares go into the calculation of the core PCE price index. With these data and CPI numbers in hand, economists are forecasting that the core PCE price index rose at least 0.4% in November. That would lift the year-on-year increase in the core PCE price index to about 4.6%, which would the strongest annual reading since 1989. 

""While modal scenarios where inflation returns toward the 2% target over multiple years still make sense, risks of a more extended sojourn above target continue to rise and are clearly at their most elevated in at least 40 years,"" said Andrew Hollenhorst, chief U.S. economist at  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) in New York.
The core PCE price index accelerated 4.1% in the 12 months through October, the most since January 1991. Data for November will be released next Thursday.

790,By Bloomberg,"<span>Dec 14, 2021 08:54AM ET</span>","U.S. Producer Prices Post the Biggest Annual Gain Since 2010, Fanning Inflation","(Bloomberg) -- Prices paid to U.S. producers rose in November by more than expected, underscoring how climbing input costs are fanning already overheated consumer inflation. 
The producer price index for final demand increased 0.8% from the prior month and 9.6% from a year earlier, Labor Department data showed Tuesday. The annual advance was the largest in figures back to 2010. 
The monthly jump was the largest since July and exceeded the median estimate of economists in a Bloomberg survey that called for a 0.5% gain. 
Excluding the volatile food and energy components, the so-called core PPI increased 0.7% and was up by a record 7.7% from a year ago. Prices of goods and services both advanced last month.
Stock-index futures extended losses as the data reinforced expectations that Federal Reserve policy makers will tighten monetary policy next year.
Materials costs have risen rapidly this year amid transportation bottlenecks, robust demand, and labor constraints. Many businesses have successfully passed those added costs on to customers through higher prices, and the latest report suggests additional consumer price increases in the coming months.   
Data out last week showed the consumer price index rose 6.8% last month from a year ago, the fastest annual pace in nearly 40 years. While first concentrated in a handful of categories associated with the economy’s reopening, inflation has broadened out. 
The larger-than-expected, sustained increase in inflation has put pressure on policy makers to act. The Fed, which will wrap up its final meeting of the year Wednesday, is anticipated to accelerate the wind down of its bond buying program, an action that would allow the central bank to begin increasing interest rates next year.
Producer prices excluding food, energy, and trade services -- a measure often preferred by economists because it strips out the most volatile components -- rose 0.7% from the prior month. Compared with a year earlier, the gauge jumped a record 6.9%.
Goods prices increased 1.2% in November from a month earlier, reflecting broad advances that included iron and steel scrap, gasoline, and fruits and vegetables.
Services costs rose 0.7%, in part reflecting a jump in prices for investment portfolio management.
Costs of processed goods for intermediate demand, which reflect prices earlier in the production pipeline, rose 1.5% from a month earlier. Compared with a year earlier, the measure jumped 26.5% -- the largest since 1974.

BERLIN (Reuters) - Persistent supply bottlenecks and a fourth wave of coronavirus infections in Germany are further delaying the recovery of Europe's largest economy from the pandemic, the Ifo institute said on Tuesday as it slashed its growth forecast for next year.
The Ifo institute expects the German economy to shrink by 0.5% quarter-on-quarter in the final three months of this year and to stagnate in the first three months of next year.
Coupled with the current surge in overall prices, Germany is now facing several winter months of zero growth and unusually high inflation, a combination described by economists as stagflation.
For 2022 as a whole, Ifo slashed its economic growth forecast to 3.7% from 5.1% projected in September, and also confirmed its already reduced forecast of 2.5% for this year. For 2023 it lifted its growth forecast to 2.9% from 1.5%.
""The strong recovery initially expected for 2022 will be further pushed back,"" Ifo chief economist Timo Wollmershaeuser said.
INFLATION
The bleak outlook was shared by the economy ministry, which on Tuesday said in its monthly report that the government expected to see ""rather weak"" economic output in the final quarter of the year.
Activity in the services sector will likely slow as Germany faces renewed curbs aimed at breaking its fourth wave of COVID infections, while supply bottlenecks for microchips especially in the car industry hamstrung manufacturing, the ministry said.
However, in view of the high order backlog, the ministry had a positive outlook for German exports.
The inflation rate is seen rising further in the short term, reducing the purchasing power of German consumers in light of meagre wage growth so far.
Ifo expects the national consumer price index (CPI) to rise by 3.1% this year and by 3.3% next year - both rates clearly above the European Central Bank's price stability target of 2% for the euro zone as a whole.
""Rising costs associated with delivery bottlenecks play a driving role, as does the delayed adjustment to the increased energy and raw material prices,"" Wollmershaeuser said.
In 2023, Ifo expects inflation rate to slow to 1.8%.
Ifo head Clemens Fuest called on the ECB to announce an end to its Pandemic Emergency Purchase Programme (PEPP) at its regular meeting on Thursday.

""We have very strong signals from companies that significant price increases are imminent,"" Fuest said.
At their Dec. 16 Governing Council meeting ECB policymakers will debate options on how to adapt the bank's regular asset purchase programme (APP) once the much larger pandemic-fighting PEPP scheme ends in March.

LONDON (Reuters) -British employers hired a record number of staff in November, adding to signs that the labour market withstood the end of the government's furlough scheme and underscoring the Bank of England's dilemma as it meets on interest rates this week.
Tax office data showed 257,000 people joined company payrolls last month, the most since records began in 2014.
The BoE, under pressure to address fast-rising inflation, wants to be sure that the expiry of the furlough scheme at the end of September did not cause a jump in unemployment before any decision to raise rates for the first time since the pandemic.
But the fast spread of the Omicron coronavirus variant has raised fears of a new economic slowdown and prompted investors to bet against a rate hike by the BoE as soon as Thursday, after its December Monetary Policy Committee meeting.
""The combination of a tight labour market and low unemployment evident in today's data could on their own be sufficient to merit a rate rise,"" KPMG UK's Chief Economist Yael Selfin said.
""Nonetheless, with the emergence of the Omicron variant over the recent weeks, we now expect the MPC to unanimously hold off raising rates until next year.""
The ONS's director of economic statistics, Darren Morgan, cautioned that the payrolls figures could include people recently made redundant but still working out their notice and the data can be volatile.
October's increase was slashed to 74,000 from an originally reported 160,000.
WAGE GROWTH SLOWS AS INFLATION GROWS
While the overall picture from the data was one of strong jobs growth and a record number of vacancies, employers are worried that any further restrictions to slow the spread of COVID-19 could hit the economy's recovery from its 2020 slump.
""The economy should remain as open as is feasibly safe to do so in the coming weeks,"" Matthew Percival, director of employment at the Confederation of British Industry, said.
Official data showed the unemployment rate fell to 4.2% in the three months to October, as expected by economists polled by Reuters and down from 4.3% in the three months to September.
Employment rose by 149,000 in the August-October period, less than a predicted increase of 228,000 in the Reuters poll, while the number of unemployed fell by 127,000.
The ONS said average weekly earnings were 4.9% higher than in the same three months of 2020, the smallest annual increase since March.
Excluding bonuses, earnings were 4.3% higher than a year earlier, the smallest rise since the three months to February.
Adjusted for inflation, which is expected to hit almost 5% in data due to be released on Wednesday, total pay growth was the weakest since September last year, representing another potential drag on the economy's recovery.
The ONS said it was no longer estimating underlying pay growth excluding the impact of the furlough scheme and other pandemic-related factors which have distorted the data.

Job vacancies hit an all-time high of 1.219 million in the three months to November, although the pace of growth in new openings continued to slow. In November alone, vacancies edged down for the first time since February when Britain was in a tight lockdown. 
Much of the recent growth in employment was among part-time workers, the ONS said.

Tuesday's survey from National Australia Bank (OTC:NABZY) (NAB) showed its index of business conditions rose 2 points in November to +12, comfortably above its long-run average.
The gain was driven by a 5 point jump in employment to an historically strong +11, while the index of sales index added 1 point to +16 and profitability held at +8.
The survey's measure of confidence eased 8 points to +12, but that followed an 11 point surge the month before and again remained well above the long-run average.

""There is still scope for things to improve further in coming months, particularly in recreation & personal services which was still in negative territory in November despite many restrictions easing in the month.""

Investing.com -- The U.K. labor market continued to improve in October after the end of the government's furlough scheme, smoothing the way for the Bank of England to raise interest rates if it wants to. 
Employment rose by 149,000 in the three months through October, relative to the previous three months, according to figures released by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) on Tuesday.  That was less than the 228,000 expected. The number of those claiming jobless benefits fell by 49,800 in November, after a smaller decline of 14,900 in October.
The U.K. employment rate was up 0.2% on the previous quarter and just 1.1% shy of its rate before the Covid pandemic hit. Unemployment was estimated by the ONS at 4.2% of the workforce for the period, 0.4% lower than the previous quarter’s figures. Total hours worked in the economy were also up but remain below pre-coronavirus levels.
U.K. employment figures have improved in tandem with the easing of Covid restrictions. But fears are rising that Boris Johnson’s government will reimpose steadily harsher restrictions to deal with the fresh wave of Covid-19 infections and potentially stall the economic recovery.
Rising inflation had led to speculation that the Bank of England would raise interest rates imminently.
“My instinct is still that the Bank of England will raise interest rates in early ’22,” said Chris Bailey, an analyst with Financial Orbit via Twitter (NYSE:TWTR). “They should do it this week but undoubtedly will choose not to,” he added.
Paul Donovan, chief economist at UBS Global Wealth Management, said the figures showed little evidence of an impact from the ending of furlough in the U.K. and also suggested that the hit to U.K. labor supply from European workers who returned home during Covid was perhaps milder than first feared.
He noted that the number of jobs in the U.K. economy is now above its pre-pandemic level.
“Some of the increase to above pre-pandemic levels could be workers taking on additional employment,” Donovan said, adding: “That is supported by research that suggests that the growth in jobs recently has been particularly a growth in part-time jobs.”

The survey by benefits company Mercer of firms that employ about 118 million people showed the average cost of employer-sponsored health insurance per employee jumped 6.3% this year to $14,542 - the largest rise since 2010.
The increase was just 3.4% in 2020 when the pandemic had strained hospital capacity and forced people to put off elective procedures.
""I think that's (catch-up care) certainly part of the cost driver,"" Kate Brown, Mercer's Center for Health Innovation Leader, told Reuters.
Brown said several other factors, including claims related to the treatment of long-term effects of COVID-19 and specialty drug pricing, could also be driving the cost rise and may continue into 2022.
The survey, which included 1,745 public and private employers, showed firms expect a ""fairly typical"" cost increase of 4.4% next year.
But most of them were unwilling to try to reduce the cost increase as they double down on making physical and mental healthcare more affordable for employees dealing with the stress of the nearly two-year-long pandemic.
Tracy Watts, national leader for U.S. health policy at Mercer, said generous health benefits could help companies in attracting and retaining staff in the tight labor market.

Adding or expanding programs to increase access to behavioral healthcare was among the top three priorities for all large employers, the survey showed.
""It's clearly become very salient throughout the pandemic that mental health is a critical need for all people and it's become really more top of mind for most employers over the last two years,"" Brown said.

Higher inflation, caused in part by pandemic-related supply chain disruptions and demand shifts, is also eroding wage gains, and some consumers expect that situation to worsen in the near term, according to the New York Fed survey. While near-term inflation expectations rose, year-ahead earnings expectations declined in November. 
Consumers said they expect inflation to reach a median of 6.0% in one year, up from an expectation of 5.7% in October. Expectations for year-ahead earnings growth dropped to 2.8% in November from 3.0% in the previous month. 
That would leave inflation growing 3.2 percentage points faster than earnings in one year, the widest gap since the survey launched in 2013. 
Median expectations for what inflation could be in three years, however, dropped to 4.0% from 4.2%, the first decline since June and only the second drop since October 2020. And uncertainty over what future inflation could look like also rose to new highs for the New York Fed survey.
INFLATION OVERSHADOWS EMPLOYMENT
Inflation is now the central economic concern voiced by American consumers, according to the latest Consumer Sentiment Index survey from the University of Michigan.
""When directly asked whether inflation or unemployment was the more serious problem facing the nation, 76% selected inflation while just 21% selected unemployment,"" Richard Curtin, the survey's director, said in a statement on Friday with the release of the latest reading covering early December. 
Fed officials, stung by persistently high inflation and encouraged by lower-than-expected unemployment, are likely to announce after their policy meeting this week that they plan to wind down their bond-buying program more quickly to clear the way for rate increases. 
Some policymakers say they are worried low interest rates could be fueling stronger gains in stock market prices, real estate values and other asset prices. 

The survey showed expectations for future home price growth declined slightly last month, but consumers are still expecting more robust growth than they did before the coronavirus pandemic. Consumers said they expect home prices to rise by a median of 5% in one year, down from 5.6% in October but well above the 3.1% expected in February 2020. 
The monthly survey of consumer expectations is based on a rotating panel of approximately 1,300 households.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India's retail inflation accelerated in November, led by a rise in food prices, but remained within the medium-term target of the central bank, strengthening views that the bank could keep interest rates on hold at its next meeting in February.
Consumer prices rose 4.91% in November from the same month last year, speeding up from October's 4.48% but lower than the consensus Reuters poll forecast of 5.10%, Ministry of Statistics data showed on Monday.
The Reserve Bank of India left interest rates on hold last week, saying growth was a priority as it warned of risks from inflation and the new Omircon variant on the economic recovery. 
India's economy expanded 8.4% in the September quarter from a year earlier, the fastest pace among major economies, but economists say the pandemic situation is a wild card.
The central bank expects retail inflation at 5.1% for October-December period and 5.7% for January-March quarter in the current financial year. 
Food prices, which contribute to nearly half of the consumer price index (CPI) rose 1.87% year-on-year in November, compared with 0.85% a month before. Prices of edible oil rose nearly 30% from a year ago period while vegetable prices fell by 13.6%.
Inflation has been within the RBI's 2-6% target range in recent months, and a cut in fuel tax last month by the federal government and softening of global crude oil prices have dampened inflationary pressures. 
Economists, have, however warned of risks of uptick in headline inflation over the coming months as companies pass on rising input costs to consumers amid economic recovery. 
""CPI inflation is set to rise further over the coming months and the risks are stacked to the upside,"" said Shilan Shah, India economist at Capital Economics. 
However, any rise in inflation is unlikely to trigger monetary tightening by the central bank, he said. 
Retail fuel prices rose 13.35% in November year-on-year compared to 14.35% in the previous month, the data showed. 

Annual core inflation, excluding volatile food and energy prices, was estimated at between 6.08% and 6.2% in November, according to three economists, compared with 6% to 6.1% in the previous month.
The government does not release core inflation numbers.

The price measure is widely considered an indicator of future inflationary tendencies as wholesale trade is the hinge between manufacturers and end-customers.
""The high rates of change for wholesale prices in annual comparison derive from increased prices for raw materials and intermediate products,"" the Federal Statistics Office said in a statement.
The largest impact on the annual measure came from increased prices for mineral oil products, which rose 62.4% on the year.
Supply chain bottlenecks have put upwards pressure on the cost of intermediate products.
More than half of German companies doing business abroad are suffering severe problems in their supply chains or logistics, pushing them to diversify suppliers, shorten delivery routes and even relocate their own production, a survey showed last month.
German consumer prices, harmonised to make them comparable with inflation data from other European Union countries, rose 6.0% year-on-year in November, increasing pressure on the European Central Bank to react.

Germany's new chancellor, Olaf Scholz, said last month - just before taking office - that very high inflation rates had to be watched closely.
On the month, wholesale prices rose 1.3% in November.

803,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 13, 2021 03:46AM ET</span>",Most UK manufacturers raising prices since at least 2000-survey,"By Victor Jack
LONDON (Reuters) - The number of British manufacturers raising prices has hit its highest in at least two decades, according to a survey published on Monday as the Bank of England considers whether to head off inflation pressure with an interest rate hike this week.
Trade body Make UK and accountants BDO said a net balance of 52% of manufacturers had increased their prices in the final three months of the year, up from 50% three months earlier and the fourth quarterly rise in a row.
It was the highest reading since the survey began asking questions about prices in 2000, pushed up in large part by global supply chain problems since the COVID-19 pandemic, and the share was likely to rise further to 58% in early 2022.
Domestic market orders outpaced export orders but demand for both was slowing, the survey showed.
Make UK said it remained positive about manufacturing output growth for next quarter but lowered its forecast for 2021 from 7.1% to 6.9% and predicted growth of 3.3% in 2022.
""While manufacturers will be able to enjoy some festive cheer this year, their spirits will be tempered by the eye-watering impact of escalating cost pressures,"" James Brougham, senior economist at Make UK, said.
""Given the global nature of some of these pressures there is little sign that they will abate anytime soon. However, they will hope as we enter a fresh year that these will gradually unwind,"" he said.
Richard Austin, head of manufacturing at BDO, said orders and output remained very positive compared to historical levels but input prices, labour, logistics and inflation were ""settling in for the long haul.""
Official data last week showed British manufacturing output in October remained more than 2% below its pre-pandemic level. 

The survey of 303 companies was conducted between Nov. 3 and Nov. 24.
The figures come ahead of the BoE's interest rate announcement on Thursday as it tries to balance rising inflationary pressures with the risk that the Omicron variant of the coronavirus slows Britain's recovery from the pandemic.

804,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 12, 2021 09:50PM ET</span>","Japan's service-sector mood improves; Omicron, rising costs cloud outlook","By Leika Kihara and Tetsushi Kajimoto
TOKYO (Reuters) -Japan's service-sector mood improved to a two-year high but the recovery among manufacturers stalled, a closely watched central bank survey showed, a sign rising raw material costs was weighing on the economy's recovery from the pandemic.
Big firms expect conditions to worsen ahead as high fuel prices and a weak yen push up import costs, reinforcing expectations Japan will maintain massive fiscal and monetary support to underpin a fragile economy.
""Non-manufacturers' sentiment got a boost from the end to pandemic curbs, while supply constraints hit manufacturers,"" said Toru Suehiro, an analyst at Daiwa Securities.
""Overall, business confidence lacks strength with both manufacturers and non-manufacturers expecting conditions to worsen,"" he said.
The headline index gauging big manufacturers' sentiment stood at plus 18 in the final quarter of 2021, unchanged from the previous quarter and below a market forecast for plus 19, the Bank of Japan's (BOJ) tankan survey showed on Monday.
Rising costs and auto output disruptions hit industries such as non-ferrous metals, chemicals and machinery, it showed.
By contrast, big non-manufacturers' sentiment improved for the sixth straight quarter at plus 9, up from plus 2 in September and exceeding market forecasts of plus 6.
The index hit the highest level since December 2019, as the Sept. 30 lifting of state of emergency curbs to combat the COVID-19 pandemic boosted morale among retailers.
But the survey, conducted for a month through Dec. 10, likely did not incorporate much of the recent spread of the Omicron variant, with nearly 80% of the replies coming in by Nov. 29.
Rising raw material costs add to uncertainty by squeezing profits of firms just emerging from the pandemic's hit.
An index gauging big manufacturers' output prices rose to levels last seen in 1980, though the gauge for input prices was also at its highest since 2008, the survey showed, a sign firms may struggle to hike prices as much as needed to cover costs.
Companies expect inflation to hit 1.1% a year from now, the tankan showed, marking the highest level since September 2015.
Despite the murky outlook, companies plan to increase hiring and capital expenditure to deal with a chronic labour shortage.
Big firms plan to increase capital spending by 9.3% in the year ending in March 2022, less than market forecasts for a 9.8% gain but rebounding from an 8.3% drop in the previous year.
Separate data showed machinery orders, a leading indicator of capital expenditure, rose in October for the first time in three months.
The tankan also showed corporate funding continued to ease, giving the BOJ scope to phase out emergency support deployed last year to combat a pandemic-induced credit crunch.

Japan has lagged other countries in staging a strong rebound from last year's pandemic hit, shrinking an annualised 3.6% in July-September due to weak consumption and output hit by a spike in infections and supply constraints.
While analysts expect growth to bounce back in the final quarter of this year, some warn the emergence of Omicron clouds the outlook and may keep the recovery feeble next year.

805,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 12, 2021 08:00PM ET</span>",Japan's Oct machinery orders rise for first time in 3 months,"By Kantaro Komiya
TOKYO (Reuters) -Japan's core machinery orders rose in October for the first time in three months as service sector firms ramped up investment amid low COVID-19 infections, a welcome sign firms were spending and the broader economy was recovering.
The world's third-largest economy is set to post a solid rebound this quarter after a larger-than-expected contraction in July-September, although the outlook is currently blurred by uncertainties around the new Omicron coronavirus variant.
Core machinery orders, a highly volatile leading indicator of capital spending in the coming six to nine months, rose 3.8% in October from the previous month, the Cabinet Office data showed on Monday.
That compared with a 2.1% expansion forecast by economists in a Reuters poll and followed no change in September.
Core orders from service-sector firms excluding ships and electrical utilities gained 16.5% month-on-month in October, led by transport and postal services that grew 170.1% due to large-scale orders for railroad vehicles.
""As the coronavirus outbreak settled down, capital expenditure among a broad range of non-manufacturers grew,"" a government official told reporters.
Meanwhile, orders from manufacturers declined 15.4% from a month earlier, as decreasing demand from chemical firms offset growth from semiconductor-making equipment and production machinery companies.
In a year-on-year basis, core orders rose 2.9% in October, the data showed, versus a 4.0% rise expected by economists.
Companies' capital expenditure slowed in the third quarter due to a global resurgence of COVID-19 outbreak, which particularly battered carmakers and other manufacturers dependent on parts supplies from Asian factories.

While supply bottlenecks eased, the outlook on production and spending remained sluggish. The Bank of Japan's quarterly Tankan survey on Monday showed large manufacturers' business mood was flat in December from October, whereas sentiment among service-sector firms improved more than expected.
The central bank is expected at this week's policy review to debate whether to extend pandemic relief programmes beyond their current March 2022 deadline, although no change to its ultra-easy monetary policy is expected.

806,By Bloomberg,"<span>Dec 12, 2021 07:36PM ET</span>",Japan Big Manufacturing Outlook Slips in Sign of Omicron Concern,"(Bloomberg) -- Confidence among Japan’s large manufacturers held at the highest level since 2018 but slippage in the outlook signaled that the omicron variant has clouded views on the country’s economic recovery.
Sentiment among big makers of products stayed at 18 this month, while an index of the outlook slipped to 13, according to the Bank of Japan’s quarterly Tankan survey released Monday. The index subtracts the percentage of pessimists from the percentage of optimists.
 
The Tankan offers a key piece of information for BOJ policy board members as they decide the fate of a special Covid funding program as early as Friday. Deputy Governor Masayoshi Amamiya said last week that economic uncertainty is extremely high partly due to the emergence of the new variant.
Until the emergence of omicron, Japanese businesses had seen reasons for more optimism compared with the summer. Infection cases at home and a continued economic recovery in their main export destinations from U.S. to China had given cause for guarded bullishness. 
Prime Minister Fumio Kishida also likely helped buoy corporate sentiment by unveiling a larger-than-expected economic package last month offering record fiscal support for the economy.    
The Tankan survey was taken from Nov. 10 to Dec. 10, so at least some of the businesses responding factored omicron into their answers. The variant was flagged as a variant of concern on Nov. 26.
A separate report Monday from the Cabinet Office showed orders for Japanese machinery rose for the first time in three months. Bookings are a signal of planned capital spending.

807,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 10, 2021 02:15PM ET</span>",U.S. budget gap rises from a year earlier in November,"(Reuters) - The U.S. government on Friday posted a $191 billion budget deficit for November, 32% higher than the $145 billion shortfall a year earlier as pandemic-related spending drove record outlays for the month and outstripped a sharp rise in personal income tax receipts on the back of the rebounding economy.
The November deficit was $4 billion below the median estimate among economists polled by Reuters of $195 billion.
Receipts for the second month of the federal government's fiscal year totaled $281 billion, up 28% and a record for the month of November, the Treasury Department said. Individual tax receipts rose 27% to $244 billion.
A Treasury official said the increase stems largely from the improvement in the economy and people continuing to return to work after last year's widespread shutdowns from the COVID-19 pandemic, which triggered a short but sharp recession.
Spending also was a record for the month of November, with total outlays of $473 billion, up 30% from November 2020's $365 billion. Spending increases for the Health and Human Services and Treasury departments largely arising from pandemic programs drove most of the increase.
For the fiscal year 2022 to date the deficit totaled $356 billion, a decrease of 17% from the first two months of fiscal 2021, which is being fueled by record year-to-date increases in government revenue.

808,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 10, 2021 12:51PM ET</span>",U.S. inflation sizzles as consumer prices post biggest annual gain since 1982,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. consumer prices rose solidly in November as Americans paid more for food and a range goods, leading to the largest annual gain since 1982, posing a political nightmare for President Joe Biden's administration and cementing expectations for the Federal Reserve to start raising interest rates next year.
The report from the Labor Department on Friday, which followed on the heels of a slew of data this month showing a rapidly tightening labor market, makes it likely the U.S. central bank will announce that it is speeding up the wind-down of its massive bond purchases at its policy meeting next week. 
With supply bottlenecks showing little sign of easing and companies raising wages as they compete for scarce workers, high inflation could persist well into 2022. The increased cost of living, the result of shortages caused by the relentless COVID-19 pandemic, is hurting Biden's approval rating. The White House and the Fed have characterized high inflation this year as transitory.
""There's not much room to explain away this inflation from pandemic or reopening anomalies,"" said Will Compernolle, a senior economist at FHN Financial in New York. ""Inflation is a tax, gas and food are among the most regressive aspects of it. Lower-income Americans spend disproportionately on both.""
The consumer price index increased 0.8% last month after surging 0.9% in October. The broad-based rise was led by gasoline prices, which increased 6.1%, matching October's gain. With crude oil prices declining recently, gasoline prices have likely peaked for now.
Food prices rose 0.7%. The cost of food at home increased 0.8%, driven by a jump in the price of fruits and vegetables, meat, and cereals and bakery products. The price of food consumed at home gained 6.4% over the past 12 months, the most since December 2008. Dining out was also more expensive last month.
In the 12 months through November, the CPI accelerated 6.8%. That was the biggest year-on-year rise since June 1982 and followed a 6.2% advance in October. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the CPI would climb 0.7% and rise 6.8% on a year-on-year basis.
Rising inflation is eroding wage gains. Inflation-adjusted average weekly earnings fell 1.9% on a year-on-year basis in November.
Biden acknowledged the increased burden on household budgets from the high inflation, while trying to reassure Americans that the country was pushing ahead with efforts to ease supply bottlenecks.
""We are making progress on pandemic-related challenges to our supply chain which make it more expensive to get goods on shelves, and I expect more progress on that in the weeks ahead,"" Biden said in a statement.
Indeed, gasoline prices have been trending lower since the end of November. That helped to lift consumer sentiment in early December, a separate survey from the University of Michigan showed on Friday.

Investors took the strong inflation readings in stride. U.S. stocks were trading higher. The dollar slipped against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices rose.  
TIGHTENING LABOR MARKET 
The government reported last week that the unemployment rate fell to a 21-month low of 4.2% in November. Tightening labor market conditions were underscored by a report on Thursday showing new applications for unemployment benefits dropped to the lowest level in more than 52 years last week.
Other data this week showed there were 11 million job openings at the end of October and Americans quit jobs at near-record rates. Fed Chair Jerome Powell has said the U.S. central bank should consider hastening the tapering of its bond purchases at its policy meeting next week.
""The Fed has little choice but to accelerate tapering and prepare for the possibility of much earlier rate hikes than it was planning just a few months ago,"" said Sal Guatieri, a senior economist at BMO Capital Markets in Toronto.
Excluding the volatile food and energy components, the CPI rose 0.5% last month after gaining 0.6% in October. The so-called core CPI was supported by rents, with owners' equivalent rent of primary residence, which is what a homeowner would receive from renting a home, rising a solid 0.4%.
(Graphic: Core CPI, https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-STOCKS/egvbkolqnpq/corecpi.png) 
Hotel and motel accommodation also cost more as did apparel, household furnishings and healthcare.
Prices for used cars and trucks increased 2.5% for a second straight month. New motor vehicle prices rose 1.1%, marking the eighth consecutive month of gains. A global semiconductor shortage has undercut motor vehicle production. 
Airline fares rebounded 4.7%. But gains are likely to be curbed by the spread of the Omicron variant of COVID-19, which could make some people hesitant to travel by air. The United States is already experiencing a resurgence in coronavirus infections, driven by the Delta variant. 
But the cost of motor vehicle insurance fell. Recreation prices dropped after nine straight months of gains. The so-called core CPI jumped 4.9% on a year-on-year basis, the largest rise since June 1991, after increasing 4.6% in October.
The Fed tracks the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index, excluding the volatile food and energy components, for its flexible 2% inflation target. The core PCE price index surged 4.1% in the 12 months through October, the most since January 1991. Data for November will be released later this month.
(Graphic: The COVID inflation surge, https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-FED/INFLATION/akvezawxopr/chart.png) 

Economists expect the year-on-year CPI could top 7% before falling back and the core CPI rate could rise above 6%.
""The recent strength in CPI and PCE inflation reflects both factors that are temporary and should fade over time and factors that could be more persistent,"" said Daniel Silver, an economist at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) in New York. ""But the tightening in the labor market likely will continue over time and this should keep upward pressure on inflation.""

The University of Michigan's closely watched Consumer Sentiment Index rose to 70.4 this month from a final November reading 67.4, which had been the lowest since November 2011. Economists polled by Reuters had been expecting it to slip further, with a median estimate of 67.1.
Readings of both current conditions and future expectations also improved unexpectedly.

The increase in headline sentiment was powered entirely by a 23.6% improvement among households in the lower one-third of the survey's income distribution, the biggest monthly increase for that group since 1980. This was driven by expectations of improving incomes in the year ahead. Sentiment slipped further for the middle and upper thirds.
""While it is usually assumed that such extreme changes represent an erroneous result due to small samples, in 1980 it was the households in the bottom income third that initially signaled the end of the first part of the double recession in 1980-82, with upper income households following in subsequent months,"" survey Director Richard Curtin said in a statement.

“This report solidifies the view of what the Fed’s path will be. This further alleviates any doubt as to an acceleration of their tapering to come out of next week’s meeting. What will be key to watch from the Fed is their dot plot to see committee members’ views of when the path of hikes will come over the next two years.
“Today’s report probably doesn’t change what the market’s perspectives on when rate hikes begin, which consensus shows is some time in the second quarter. 
  “The inflation trends continue, but the trends are a little bit worrisome right now.”
MICHAEL ARONE, CHIEF INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, STATE STREET GLOBAL ADVISORS, BOSTON
“Today’s CPI report confirmed what most Americans already know, and that is prices across a number of the components have been increasing and increasing by the largest amounts we’ve seen in decades. There’s not a big surprise here, most of this data was expected.
“The Fed is set to accelerate the tapering, and that means they’ll end in March and they’re likely to begin to raise rates at that point. Again, most of that is priced into the market already, and the Fed is behind the curve and they need to catch up. They’ll start to do that at next week’s meeting.
“The market’s positive reaction is interesting in that this data suggests that the Fed will have to tighten monetary policy more aggressively than just a couple of month ago, and the market’s acceptance of that is a little surprising to me.”
THOMAS HAYES, MANAGING MEMBER, GREAT HILL CAPITAL LLC, NEW YORK
""The market is up is because the numbers were pretty much in line with expectations, certainly on the core CPI front, and did not dramatically exceed as feared. The market doesn't like surprises.""
""The market has pretty much accepted the fact that they'll likely accelerate the tapering to end in March versus originally in June, that's known since the Powell pivot last week and now in line with expectations. The key variable now is how quickly will they be hiking rates and we won't know that until after March.""
PETER CARDILLO, CHIEF MARKET ECONOMIST, SPARTAN CAPITAL SECURITIES, NEW YORK
“The numbers came in just a bit higher than we’re looking for.”
“The good news is that over the past 12 months it didn’t exceed the top point. From that perspective it’s not going to cause jitters in the market because elevated inflation is already priced into the market. But this does mean we’re probably going to be faced by a more hawkish Fed and a change in monetary policy is likely to happen in the latter part of the second quarter of 2022.”
“I don’t think it’s going to impact the equity markets.”
JOHN CANAVAN, LEAD ANALYST, OXFORD ECONOMICS, NEW YORK

    ""From a market perspective, the response was clearly just relief. It wasn't worse than expected. The headline figures were very much in line with expectations, particularly on a year-over-year basis. And we've seen stocks rally, the dollar dip, and Treasuries rebound. That's clearly just a knee-jerk response to a little bit of relief given how often we have seen inflation figures outpace expectations. At least for this month, as high as inflation is, it was no worse than markets had previously expected.""
    ""With figures in line with expectations, I assume Fed expectations were similar, so this shouldn't really change anything one way or another. We continue to look for the Fed to pare down asset purchases next week or at least announce it next week.""

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's economy barely grew in October, even before the emergence of the Omicron coronavirus variant, further denting expectations that the Bank of England (BoE) will raise interest rates next week for the first time since the pandemic struck.
Gross domestic product edged up by just 0.1%, slowing sharply from September's 0.6% growth and much weaker than a forecast of 0.4% in a Reuters poll of economists.
The world's fifth-biggest economy remained 0.5% smaller than it was just before Britain was first hit by COVID-19 in early 2020, the Office for National Statistics said.
""We've always acknowledged there could be bumps on our road to recovery,"" finance minister Rishi Sunak said, adding that Britain's economic support measures and vaccine programme would keep the recovery on track.
Over the three months to October, the economy grew by 0.9%, its slowest since a lockdown in early 2021, the ONS said.
""Hopes that either the health or economic pain of this crisis would be all over by Christmas have been dashed,"" said James Smith, research director at the Resolution Foundation think-tank.
INFLATION
""The possibility that restrictions will need to be tightened, combined with high inflation and rising energy bills, means government should prepare for fresh targeted economic support that may be necessary in the months ahead.""
Sandra Horsfield at Investec sounded less concerned, saying the weakness was mostly caused by global supply chain problems rather than a slump in demand. ""We would not regard it as a worrying signal for the outlook,"" she said.
Sterling fell as investors bet that the BoE, seeking to balance inflationary pressures with Omicron uncertainty, will again hold interest rates steady next Thursday.
A BoE survey showed inflation expectations among the public for the coming year jumped in November but were little changed for the longer term, the bank's main focus.
Economists cut their near-term growth forecasts after Friday's data. 
Allan Monks at JP Morgan predicted GDP would grow by 0.9% in the fourth quarter and in the first three months of 2022, down from his previous estimates of 1.3% and 1.0%, before bouncing back in the spring.
A strong rebound in Britain's economy earlier this year - following a near-10% slump in 2020 due to the pandemic - ran into supply chain problems over the summer and is expected to lose more momentum because of new COVID-19 restrictions to slow the spread of the Omicron variant. 
October's meagre growth was supported by a continued rise in face-to-face appointments at doctors' surgeries in England, which had fallen sharply during the pandemic, contributing to a 0.4% rise in output in Britain's dominant services sector.
But industrial output fell 0.6% due to a drop in electricity and gas production and oil field maintenance.
The manufacturing sector flat-lined amid supply chain problems and staff shortages. Construction fell by the most since April 2020, down by 1.8% from September.

Separately, the ONS released trade data showing that Britain's goods trade deficit narrowed to 13.9 billion pounds in October from 14.7 billion pounds in September.

Investing.com -- The British economy grew by less than expected in October, as supply chain issues and sharply rising input costs hit key sectors such as construction and car retail.
U.K. gross domestic product rose only 0.1% in October, below a consensus forecast of 0.4% and down from 0.6% in September. The construction sector contracted particularly sharply, by 1.8%, the largest fall since April 2020. The sector is 2.8% below its pre-pandemic level. October's fall in construction output was largely due to a drop off in new work. Industrial production also fell 0.6%, due largely to maintenance at oil and gas fields in the North Sea.
Monthly figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) showed that U.K. GDP remains 0.5% below its pre-pandemic February 2020 level.  
Services continue to underpin the British economy, accounting for the 0.9% growth in GDP in the three months to October 2021. The sector's output overall is back to pre-Covid levels thanks to the gradual easing of restrictions over the last six months.  That included, notably, the reopening of the hospitality and entertainment sectors in the summer.
The biggest driver of October's growth in services came from human health and social work activities, which climbed by 3.5% with an increase in face-to-face appointments at doctors' surgeries in England, the ONS said.
The data had little effect on the British pound, which has already slumped this week on the assumption that the spread of the Omicron variant of Covid-19 will force the Bank of England to delay its first interest rate hike again when its Monetary Policy Council meets next week. By 3:35 AM ET (0835 GMT), the pound was down less than 0.1% at $1.3214.
Susannah Streeter, senior investment and markets analyst at  Hargreaves  Lansdown (LON:HRGV), said the sluggish GDP figures meant the Bank of England's interest rate dilemma had intensified.
‘’The latest reading for the economy shows just how vulnerable the economy was to a fresh shock,"" Streeter said, adding: ""The spread of the Omicron variant is now set to be the body blow, sending the recovery reeling, while prices continue to climb. Although a rate rise can’t be completely ruled out next week, most bets are off that the Bank will push them up so soon. A rate rise in February is more likely to be on the table, as the inflation kettle is set to be whistling loudly by then.’’"

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's business mood improved in the three months to December and exports continued to benefit from robust global demand in November, a Reuters poll showed, offering policymakers hope the economy is gradually emerging from its pandemic-induced slump.
The data would bode well for the Bank of Japan, which is set to maintain ultra-easy policy next week and debate whether to phase out pandemic-relief fund schemes that expire in March.
The BOJ's closely-watched ""tankan"" survey is likely to show the headline index for big manufacturers' sentiment edged up to plus 19 in December from plus 18 three months ago, according to analysts polled by Reuters.
""Manufacturers' sentiment will likely improve as the worst has passed in terms of chip shortages, and supply constraints caused by Southeast Asian factory shutdowns are gradually easing,"" said analysts at Mizuho Research & Technologies.
Big non-manufacturers' sentiment index is also seen improving to plus 6 from plus 2, as the Sept. 30 lifting of state of emergency curbs to combat the pandemic helped boost consumption, the poll showed.
Big manufacturers and non-manufacturers both expect conditions to improve three months ahead, according to the poll, highlighting growing optimism among companies over the outlook.
The tankan will also show big firms plan to increase capital expenditure by 9.8% in the fiscal year ending in March, slightly lower than an estimate for a 10.1% gain in the previous survey, the poll showed.
But the December tankan is unlikely to factor in much of the impact of the recent spread of the Omicron new variant, which could hurt business confidence ahead, analysts say.
Markets are also focusing on the tankan's indices gauging corporate funding for clues on whether the BOJ will decide next week to scale down pandemic-relief funding support.
The BOJ will release the survey on Dec. 13 at 8:50 a.m. local time (Dec. 12 at 2350GMT).
Separate data on Japan's trade balance will show exports rose 21.2% in November from a year earlier, a sign robust global demand continues to underpin the economy, the poll showed.

Machinery orders, a leading indicator of corporate capital expenditure, likely rose 2.1% in October from the previous month, the poll showed.
The government will release the machinery orders data on Dec. 13 at 8:50 a.m. (Dec. 12 at 2350GMT), and the trade data on Dec. 16 at 8:50 a.m. (Dec. 15 at 2350GMT).

815,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 09, 2021 04:36PM ET</span>",U.S. weekly jobless claims at lowest level since 1969 as labor market tightens,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits dropped to the lowest level in more than 52 years last week as labor market conditions continued to tighten amid an acute shortage of workers.
The plunge reported by the Labor Department in its weekly unemployment claims report on Thursday was, however, probably exaggerated by difficulties adjusting the data for seasonal fluctuations around this time of the year. 
The claims report, the most timely data on the economy's health, followed on the heels of news last week that the jobless rate fell to a 21-month low of 4.2% in November. Data on Wednesday showed there were 11 million job openings at the end of October and Americans quit jobs at near-record rates.
""While the latest data should be taken with a grain of salt given seasonal adjustments, we may be entering a stretch when lower-than-average layoffs continue until the 'Great Resignation' fades,"" said Robert Frick, corporate economist at Navy Federal Credit Union in Vienna, Virginia.
Initial claims for state unemployment benefits tumbled 43,000 to a seasonally adjusted 184,000 for the week ended Dec. 4, the lowest level since September 1969. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast 215,000 applications for the latest week.
Claims have declined from a record high of 6.149 million in early April of 2020. Applications typically increase as the weather gets colder, but economists say this seasonal pattern is not holding because of a tightening labor market.
Unadjusted claims rose 63,680 to 280,665 last week, a smaller increase than had been anticipated. 
""The seasonal factors had expected an increase of 106,047 (or 48.9 percent) from the previous week,"" the Labor Department said in its report.
""The big jump in filings before seasonal adjustment was not fully realized, and the tight labor market may be limiting the amount of seasonal layoffs that take place around this time of year relative to norms,"" said Daniel Silver, an economist at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) in New York.
U.S. stocks were trading lower after three straight days of gains. The dollar rose against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices were mostly higher. 
EXTREMELY LOW LAYOFFS
Filings increased sharply in California, New York, Texas and Michigan. There were also notable rises in Minnesota, Illinois, Indiana, Oregon, Wisconsin, and Pennsylvania. Some of these states are experiencing a resurgence in COVID-19 infections.
Claims fell significantly in Virginia and North Carolina.
The four-week moving average of initial claims, considered a better measure of labor market trends as it irons out week-to-week volatility, fell 21,250 to 218,750, the lowest level since March of 2020. It matches the average that prevailed from 2018 to 2019.
""The labor market continues to tighten on almost every metric and in almost every report that pertains to jobs,"" said Conrad DeQuadros, senior economic advisor at Brean Capital in New York. ""Layoffs are running at extremely low levels and consistent with a tight labor market when the unemployment rate averaged 3.8%.""
Labor market tightness bolsters Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's view that the U.S. central bank should consider speeding up the winding down of its massive bond purchases at its policy meeting next week. It also puts an early Fed interest rate increase on the table. 
The claims data aligns with other reports on consumer spending, manufacturing and services industries activity that have suggested the economy was regaining steam in the fourth quarter after a lull in the July-September period.
A separate report from the Commerce Department on Thursday showed the accumulation of wholesale inventories accelerated in October, supporting the stronger growth expectations. 
Fourth-quarter GDP growth estimates are as high as an 8.6% annualized rate. The economy grew at a 2.1% pace in the third quarter. 
But the spread of the Omicron variant of COVID-19 poses a risk to the economic outlook. While little is known about the impact of the new variant, some slowdown in hiring and demand for services is likely, based on the experience with the Delta variant, which was responsible for the slowest economic growth pace in more than a year last quarter.
Rising coronavirus infections could also delay the much anticipated return to the labor force by the millions of unemployed Americans, some of whom started trickling back in November. The workforce remains 2.4 million below its pre-pandemic level even as generous federal government-funded benefits have expired and schools reopened for in-person learning. Companies are also raising wages.

The claims report showed continuing claims rose 38,000 to 1.992 million in the week ended Nov. 27. There were 1.948 million people receiving benefits under all programs in the week ended Nov. 20, down 350,527 from the prior week.
Worker shortages are hampering job growth. The government reported last week that nonfarm payrolls increased by 210,000 jobs, the fewest since last December.

816,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 09, 2021 10:41AM ET</span>",U.S. October wholesale inventories revised slightly higher,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. wholesale inventories increased a bit more than initially thought in October, suggesting that the restocking of warehouses could again support economic growth this quarter. 
The Commerce Department said on Thursday that wholesale inventories accelerated 2.3%, instead of 2.2% as estimated last month. Stocks at wholesalers increased 1.4% in September.
Economists polled by Reuters had expected inventories would be unrevised. Wholesale inventories jumped 14.4% in October from a year earlier.
Motor vehicle inventories rebounded 2.3% after falling 1.5% in September. They continue to be constrained by a global shortage of semiconductors, which has hampered motor vehicle production.
Inventories are a key part of gross domestic product. Wholesale inventories, excluding autos, advanced 2.3% in October. This component goes into the calculation of GDP.
A moderate pace of inventory drawdown in the third quarter accounted for all of the 2.1% annualized rate of increase in GDP growth last quarter. Inventories were depleted in the first half of the year, and COVID-19 pandemic-related shortages are making it difficult to rebuild stocks.

The urgent need to restock is keeping manufacturing humming. There are concerns from some economists that businesses wary of delays getting stock could over-order and end up with excess inventory, which could put the economic expansion in jeopardy.
Sales at wholesalers increased 2.2% in October after rising 1.7% in September. At October's sales pace it would take wholesalers 1.22 months to clear shelves, unchanged from September.

Figures from national statistics agency INEGI showed inflation in Latin America's No. 2 economy jumped to 7.37% last month from 6.24% in October. That compared with the consensus forecast of a Reuters poll for 7.22%.
The November figure took inflation to its highest level since January 2001.
The core rate of inflation, which strips out some volatile items, reached 5.67%.
The Bank of Mexico (Banxico) last month raised its benchmark interest rate by 25 basis points to 5%, the fourth consecutive hike. It also revised up its expectations for Mexican inflation at the close of this year.
Banxico's final monetary policy meeting for the year is due on Dec. 16. The bank targets inflation of 3%, with a one percentage point tolerance range above and below that.

Earlier this week, Irene Espinosa, a member of the central bank's board, said Banxico's monetary policy stance continues to be accommodative and that it should respond forcefully to anchor inflation expectations.
Month-on-month, Mexican consumer prices increased by 1.14% in November, the INEGI data showed. Meanwhile, the core index of prices rose by 0.37% from October.

LONDON (Reuters) -British households ate out less and spent more on goods as the Omicron coronavirus variant spread last week, according to data on Thursday that could mean inflation stays high for longer if it marks a return to behaviour seen earlier in the pandemic.
Bank of England policymakers had been counting on a drop-off in demand for consumer goods - which soared during the pandemic and have been beset by supply-chain difficulties - to pull down rapidly rising inflation, now on course to hit 5%.
But Black Friday sales last week pushed spending on credit and debit cards in Britain to its highest level since before the first lockdown of March 2020, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said.
Over the same period, cafe chain Pret a Manger reported a drop in sales in 8 out of 10 locations, the ONS said.
Restaurant bookings for the week to Monday fell to their lowest since restrictions on indoor hospitality eased in May, dropping by six percentage points to 5% above the equivalent figure in 2019, according to OpenTable data.
The figures pointed to a shift in consumer behaviour with the emergence of the Omicron strain of the virus, which on Wednesday prompted new health restrictions in England.
Last week, Bank of England rate-setter Catherine Mann said the Omicron variant could impede a shift in spending - away from goods and towards services like eating out and tourism - that would help to dampen inflation.
Still, BoE officials are likely to be reassured by a Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) survey that showed consumers' long-term inflation expectations fell to their lowest since May.
""Rate-setters may see that as some success from their hawkish words and it may give them room to wait before hiking interest rates,"" economist Robert Wood wrote in a BofA Global Research note.
The report, based on responses given before Wednesday's announcement of renewed COVID-19 restrictions in England, showed a record 45% of Britons expect life ""never"" to return to normal.
The new rules fell short of a lockdown, but angered some retail and leisure businesses which said they were being hammered.

Citi said it expected the new restrictions to reduce economic growth by 0.4 and 0.3 percentage points in December and January respectively.
Financial markets now show a less than 40% chance that the BoE will hike interest rates this month to 0.25% from 0.10% - something that had been priced as a near certainty as recently as a few weeks ago.

Seasonally adjusted exports increased by 4.1% on the month after falling in August and September, the Federal Statistics Office said.
Imports also saw an unexpected leap, growing 5% after a slightly revised rise of 0.4% in the prior month. 
Bankhaus Lampe chief economist Alexander Krueger said catch-up effects in the auto sector likely boosted export figures and warned that large leaps would be unlikely due to uncertainty caused by the pandemic and delivery logistics.
""If materials once again flow in sufficient quantities, companies will be able to work off their order backlogs,"" said VP Bank chief economist Thomas Gitzel.
""First, however, we have to get through the drought that lies ahead due to the lack of materials.""
The DIHK Chambers of Industry and Commerce expect exports to grow by 7.5% this year and by 7% next year.
The trade surplus decreased to 12.5 billion euros ($14.16 billion) from a revised 12.9 billion euros in September.

A Reuters poll had pointed to a 0.9% increase in exports and a 0.4% rise in imports, with a trade balance of 13.4 billion euros.

821,By Investing.com,"<span>Dec 08, 2021 11:28PM ET</span>",China Factory Inflation Slows Down From 26-Year High,"By Doris Yu
Investing.com – China’s factory inflation slowed down slightly in November from a 26-year high, helped by a government crackdown on runaway commodity prices and an easing power crunch.
National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) data released earlier in the day showed that the consumer price index (CPI) grew 2.3% year-on-year, lower than the 2.5% growth in forecasts prepared by Investing.com but higher than October’s 1.5% growth. The CPI grew 0.4% month-on-month in November, higher than the 0.3% growth in forecasts prepared by Investing.com but lower than the previous month’s 0.7% growth.
Recent government policies to rein in sharply rising energy and raw materials prices are taking effect, NBS senior statistician Dong Lijuan said in a statement accompanying the data release. These include setting an immediate ex-mine price target and ordering rapid production to cool high prices, which has been effective in easing a power shortage expected this winter.
Factory inflation remained high, however. The producer price index (PPI) grew 12.9% year on year, higher than the 12.4% growth in forecasts prepared by Investing.com but lower than October's 13.5% growth.
While PPI has likely peaked, the rate at which it will slow down is highly uncertain, according to Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) senior EM economist Zhou Hao.
However, consumer inflation remained modest as restrictive COVID-19 measures impeded consumption and demand. Vegetable prices jumped 30.6% while pork prices dropped 32.7%, which sped up consumer inflation.
""Food aside, price pressures are generally easing, especially in heavy industry,"" Capital Economics senior China economist Julian Evans-Pritchard said in a note.
""As such, we don’t think inflation concerns will hold back the People’s Bank of China (PBOC) from further loosening measures including policy rate cuts.""
On Monday, the PBOC said it will reduce most banks’ reserve requirement ratio by 0.5 percentage points from next week.
The country’s top leaders also signaled that they would focus on stabilizing macroeconomic conditions for 2022. They also hinted that the country will ease some property curbs in the next year."

The producer price index rose 12.9% in November, the National Bureau of Statistics said on Thursday, slower than October's 26-year high of 13.5% but faster than the 12.4% expected in a Reuters poll of analysts.
While factory inflation remains uncomfortably high, the price moderation may give policymakers some latitude to unleash more stimulus to shore up flagging growth.
China's economy, which staged an impressive rebound from last year's pandemic slump, has lost momentum in recent months as it grapples with surging prices, a slowing manufacturing sector, debt problems in the property market and persistent COVID-19 outbreaks.
The People's Bank of China (PBOC) on Monday announced a cut to the amount of cash that banks must hold in reserve, its second such move this year, to bolster slowing growth.
""Food aside, price pressures are generally easing, especially in heavy industry,"" said Julian Evans-Pritchard, senior China economist at Capital Economics, in a note. ""As such, we don’t think inflation concerns will hold back the PBOC from further loosening measures including policy rate cuts.""
Factory-gate inflation has sped up since May this year due to soaring commodity prices, piling pressures on downstream businesses to pass on their costs to consumers.
Authorities have rolled out a series of interventions in recent months, including setting an immediate ex-mine price target and ordering rapid production to cool red-hot prices, measures that have proven effective in easing a power shortage expected this winter.
Government policies to rein in sharply rising energy and raw materials prices are taking effect, said Dong Lijuan, a senior statistician at the NBS in a statement accompanying the data release.
Factory inflation remains extremely high, however, with prices in coal mining and washing surging 88.8% on the year and oil and gas extraction seeing 68.5% growth.
While PPI has likely peaked, the rate at which it will slow down is highly uncertain, said Zhou Hao, senior EM economist at Commerzbank (DE:CBKG).
The consumer price index (CPI) rose 2.3% year-on-year, the NBS said in a separate statement, slower than expectations for a 2.5% rise but picking up from 1.5% in October.
Consumer inflation remains modest as strict COVID-19 curbs impede consumption and weigh on demand, pointing to a limited pass-through from high factory gate prices.
No cases of the Omicron COVID-19 variant have been reported in China to date, but its emergence could add pressure to the strict zero-tolerance policy on coronavirus cases and increase logistical challenges for exporters, analysts say.

The world's second-largest economy faces multiple headwinds heading into 2022 including the downturn of its property sector.
China's top government think tank on Monday recommended authorities set an economic growth target of above 5% for next year and a consumer inflation target of 3%.

The producer price index rose 12.9% from a year earlier, above economists’ forecasts of a 12.1% gain, data from the National Bureau of Statistics showed Thursday. The consumer price index increased 2.3%, the fastest pace since August 2020 but below the projected 2.5% gain.
The slowdown is a sign that the government’s efforts to tame soaring commodity prices and deal with power shortages over the past few months are having an effect. If the prices pressures continue to abate, it may provide more room for the central bank to add stimulus.
Consumer inflation sped up, as vegetable prices rose 30.6% while pork prices dropped 32.7%. Core CPI, which excludes more volatile food and energy prices, rose 1.2%, as sporadic Covid-19 outbreaks likely continue to weigh on services consumption. 
The central bank acted to release 1.2 trillion yuan ($189 billion) into the economy, announcing Monday it would reduce most banks’ reserve requirement ratio by 0.5 percentage point from next week. While the central bank said this wasn’t the start of an easing cycle, financial markets are showing some expectation of further action.
The Communist Party’s top leaders also indicated earlier this week that their focus for the coming year is stabilizing macroeconomic conditions and signaled an easing of some property curbs next year, as a real estate downturn and sporadic virus outbreaks weigh on the economic outlook.

The Recruitment and Employment Confederation said permanent placements of workers sped up in November to hit its fifth-fastest pace since its surveys began in 1997, pushing up these workers' pay by a record amount. Temporary hiring also accelerated.
Governor Andrew Bailey and other BoE officials have voiced concern that the shortage of candidates to fill near-record levels of vacancies could fuel a surge in pay that causes the recent jump in inflation to become entrenched.
""The current trajectory is unsustainable in the long run for businesses and the wider economic recovery,"" Claire Warnes, head of education, skills and productivity at KPMG UK, which produces the survey with REC, said.
Better skills training, more labour market flexibility and improved transport links were all important for making sure the labour market continued to function well, she said.
Official measures of broader pay trends have also shown a jump in wages but stripping out distortions caused by the pandemic, growth in earnings could be as low as an annual 3.4%, less than inflation.
The REC survey showed a further fall in candidate supply last month, albeit a less severe one than in October. Demand for staff rose again but at the slowest pace in six months.
Neil Carberry, REC's chief executive, said it was too early to tell the effect of the Omicron variant of the coronavirus, which was unknown when the survey took place from Nov. 12-24.

""December may be slower than previous months as its effects feed through,"" he said. ""Hospitality will be in the forefront of any changes as we approach the festive season, of course, and the impact of high inflation will also be felt as purses tighten in January.""
Some BoE officials have said they want to understand the potential economic impact of Omicron before any decision to raise borrowing costs. Financial markets see a reduced chance of a rate hike on Dec. 16, at the end of the central bank's December meetings which begin this week.

TOKYO (Reuters) - The total amount of money circulating in Japan rose at the slowest annual pace in 19 months in November, as firms and households saw less need to hoard cash with the economy emerging from the initial shock caused by the COVID-19 crisis.
The data underscores how Japan's economy is normalising from last year's pandemic crunch, and will likely be among data the Bank of Japan will scrutinise in debating next week whether to phase out pandemic-relief fund schemes.
Japan's M2 money stock, a measure on the total amount of money available in the economy, rose 4.0% in November from a year earlier, Bank of Japan data showed on Thursday, slowing from a 4.2% gain in October. It was the smallest annual increase since a 3.7% gain in April last year.
The average amount of cash, at 1,175.8 trillion yen ($10.34 trillion), hit a fresh record, as the central bank continued to print money to cushion the economic blow from the pandemic.
""The balance of money stock remains at historical levels with the slowdown largely a reaction to last year's surge. There's no big change in the uptrend (in money stock),"" a BOJ official told a briefing.
The BOJ ramped up purchases of corporate bonds and commercial paper, and introduced a loan scheme aimed at channelling funds to small firms via financial institutions last year to combat a cash crunch caused by the pandemic.

The recent spread of the Omicron new variant complicates the BOJ's decision, expected to be made as early as next week's rate review, on whether to phase out the programmes when they reach their current deadline in March 2022.

LONDON (Reuters) - The number of people in Britain putting their home up for sale fell for an eighth month in a row in November, placing further upward pressure on house prices, the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (RICS) said on Thursday.
RICS said its monthly house price balance held at +71 in November after an upward revision to October's reading, not far from the 33-year high of +82 recorded in June.
""The continuing drought in new listings was a significant factor holding back the market nationwide,"" RICS said.
""Unless this trend is reversed soon, transaction levels may flat-line in 2022 with limited choice proving more significant than any shift in the interest rate environment for new buyers,"" RICS chief economist Simon Rubinsohn added.
The Bank of England has said it is likely to raise interest rates from a record-low 0.1% in the coming months, although financial markets have dialled back their bets on a move at next week's meeting, due to the new Omicron coronavirus variant.
Britain's housing market surged through most of last year and in 2021, bolstered by more demand for space to work from home during the pandemic, as well as temporary tax breaks for house-buyers which were phased out between July and September.
The most recent official data shows house prices rose 11.8% in the year to September and RICS said surveyors expected house prices to ""drift higher"" over the next 12 months.
""Even if the cost of mortgage finance does begin to edge up, it is likely that house prices will continue to move higher through the coming year, albeit at a somewhat slower pace than over the past 12 months,"" Rubinsohn said.

Rents were forecast to rise by 4% as demand from tenants rose but supply from landlords fell.
BoE Deputy Governor Ben Broadbent said on Monday that he expected consumer price inflation to ""comfortably exceed"" 5% by April next year.

""Under normal circumstances, a near record number of job openings would be something worth celebrating,"" said Jennifer Lee, a senior economist at BMO Capital Markets in Toronto. ""But no employer is in a celebratory mood. It is difficult to fill orders or meet customer demands if there are not enough people to do the actual work.""
Job openings, a measure of labor demand, increased by 431,000 to 11.0 million on the last day of October. This was the second-highest on record. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast 10.4 million vacancies.
The surge was led by the accommodation and food services industry, where vacancies increased by 254,000 jobs. There were 45,000 job openings in the nondurable goods manufacturing industry, while vacancies increased by 42,000 in the educational services sector. But job openings decreased by 115,000 in state and local government, excluding education. 
Regionally, the rise in job openings was more pronounced in the South, with moderate gains in the West and Midwest. Vacancies fell in the Northeast. The job openings rate rose to 6.9% from 6.7% in September.
Hiring dropped by 82,000 jobs to 6.5 million in October. The finance and insurance industry accounted for the decline, with a 96,000 drop in payrolls. There were, however, increases in hiring in educational services as well as state and local government education. The hiring rate was unchanged at 4.4%.
There were about 1.5 job openings per unemployed worker in October.

The government reported last Friday that nonfarm payrolls increased by 210,000 jobs in November, the fewest since last December, after rising 546,000 in October. The unemployment rate fell to a 21-month low of 4.2%.
Though employment is 3.9 million jobs below the peak in February 2020, economists believe that number probably is not a true reflection of the labor market's health as the shortfall includes people who have retired.
The JOLTS report showed layoffs fell by 35,000 to 1.361 million. The layoffs rate was unchanged at 0.9% for a third straight month. 
Quits decreased by 205,000 to a still-high 4 million in October. The decline was in several industries, with large drops in transportation, warehousing and utilities as well as finance and insurance, and arts, entertainment and recreation. 
But 21,000 more people quit their jobs in state and local government, excluding education. There were also more quits in mining and logging. The quits rate fell to 2.8% from 3.0% in September amid a large drop in the leisure and hospitality sector.
(Graphic: Americans still quitting their jobs in big numbers, https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-ECONOMY/byprjqqnxpe/chart.png) 

""The quits rate in those industries dropped by half a percentage point, signaling some easing in job hopping,"" said Nick Bunker, director of research at Indeed Hiring Lab. ""In addition to the slowdown in wage growth in the sector seen in recent jobs reports, this trend suggests maybe the advantageous situation for workers in this sector might deteriorate in the months ahead if the current situation continues.""
The quits rate is normally viewed by policymakers and economists as a measure of job market confidence. The still-high quits rate suggests wage inflation will likely remain uncomfortably high for a while. Inflation is way above the Federal Reserve's flexible 2% target.

The company reported this week that its back-to-work barometer based on keycard, fob, and building access data shows a 10-city average occupancy in buildings and businesses it secures rose to 40.6% after the Thanksgiving holiday, the highest level since COVID-19 forced millions to work remotely from home starting in March 2020.
Austin, Texas, had the highest metropolitan area occupancy at 59.3%, with New York at 37%, Chicago at 35.2%, and Los Angeles at 36.3%.
If the upward trend in the return of U.S. workers after more than a year and a half working from home holds up in coming weeks, it could result in a stronger December employment report, Nicholas Colas, co-founder of DataTrek Research, said on Wednesday.
In a daily briefing, Colas pointed to a ""surprising"" surge in office occupancy in the latest week despite news of the Omicron variant of the coronavirus and given that occupancy was expected to remain soft throughout the holiday period.
Colas said urban unemployment was ""a significant issue"" for the labor market during the pandemic.

""More office workers means more demand for ancillary services in large metro areas, and better employment trends as a result,"" he wrote.
November nonfarm payrolls increased by a lower-than-expected 210,000 jobs, the fewest since December 2020.

830,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 08, 2021 06:08AM ET</span>",Japan downgrades Q3 GDP on deeper hit to consumer spending,"By Daniel Leussink and Kantaro Komiya
TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's economy shrank slightly faster than initially reported in the third quarter, as a sharp rise in local COVID-19 cases hit private consumption and a global chip supply shortage hurt corporate sentiment.
The deeper contraction is a setback for policymakers hoping easing supply shortages and loosened pandemic curbs would support a recovery in the world's third-largest economy this quarter.
Japan's economy declined an annualised 3.6% in July-September, revised Cabinet Office data showed Wednesday, worse than the preliminary reading of a 3.0% contraction.
The data, which was worse than economists' median forecast for a 3.1% drop, equals a real quarter-on-quarter contraction of 0.9% from the prior quarter, versus a preliminary 0.8% drop.
""This confirms that economic conditions were stagnating in the July-September quarter,"" said Atsushi Takeda, chief economist at Itochu Economic Research Institute.
""Growth turned negative due to the resurgence of the coronavirus.""
The faster decline was mainly due to a larger fall in private consumption, which makes up more than half of gross domestic product, and shrank 1.3% from the previous three months, worse than the initial estimate of a 1.1% drop.
Consumption fell as bad weather kept shoppers at home and a global chip shortage hit sales of cars and electronics due to production snags, a government official said.
""A large contraction in durable goods (spending) indicated that car production cuts had a huge impact,"" said Wakaba Kobayashi, an economist at Daiwa Institute of Research.
Durable goods spending posted its biggest drop since 1994 when comparable data first became available, the official said, slumping 16.3% quarter-on-quarter and pulling down household consumption by 0.7 percentage points.
The data showed public investment dropped 2.0% versus the initial estimate of a 1.5% decline, while capital spending saw a smaller fall, shrinking 2.3% from the prior quarter, compared with a 3.8% preliminary drop.
The net contribution of exports to the GDP change was zero, offset by imports. Meanwhile, domestic demand pulled GDP down by 0.9 percentage point, matching a preliminary contribution.
The GDP downgrade, which took into account a change in the way seasonal adjustments were calculated, comes after data on Tuesday showed household spending fell for a third straight month in October.
However, in a more recent sign that consumption has picked up, a sentiment index of ""economy watchers"", or workers close to consumer and retail trends, rose in November to an eight-year high.
Since the start of the pandemic, Japan's government has sought to support the fragile economy by large-scale fiscal spending. It unveiled a record $490 billion package last month.

Analysts are hopeful spending will pick up due in part due to that spending package, with Daiwa's Kobayashi seeing positive impact from the first quarter of next year.
""We expect the stimulus package to boost Japan's GDP by around 2%, by pushing up private consumption, government spending and public investments,"" she said.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's service sector sentiment index rose 0.8 point to 56.3 in November to mark the third straight month of increase, a Cabinet Office survey showed on Wednesday, as COVID-19 cases remained low and face-to-face services saw consumers returning.
The index, which hit the highest level in nearly eight years, is based on a survey of workers such as taxi drivers, hotel workers and restaurant staff who are called ""economy watchers"" for their proximity to consumer and retail trends.

832,By Bloomberg,"<span>Dec 07, 2021 11:18PM ET</span>",China’s Factory Inflation Seen Easing From Peak in November,"(Bloomberg) -- China’s factory inflation may have peaked and started slowing in November, providing some relief for companies and making room for the central bank to do more to support the economy. 
The producer price index is forecast to have climbed 12.1% in November from a year earlier, slower than the 26-year high of 13.5% in October, according to the median estimate in a survey of economists. Despite the retreat, the projected increase would still be the second fastest in 26 years.
Faster inflation in China in recent months fanned stagflation concerns amid a domestic economic slowdown and worries about persistent global inflation. It also increased the challenge for the People’s Bank of China on how to stimulate growth without adding to inflationary pressures, so slower price rises may make it easier to add stimulus.
The central bank acted to release 1.2 trillion yuan ($189 billion) into the economy, announcing Monday it would reduce most banks’ reserve requirement ratio by 0.5 percentage point from next week. While the central bank said this wasn’t the start of an easing cycle, financial markets are showing some expectation of further action.

The Communist Party’s top leaders also indicated earlier this week that their focus for the coming year is stabilizing macroeconomic conditions and signaled an easing of some property curbs next year, as a real estate downturn and sporadic virus outbreaks weigh on the economic outlook.
A milder pace in price hikes show previous government measures to boost commodity supplies and tame surging costs are having some effect. Iron ore prices continued dropping in November, although they have started to climb again this month. An easing power crunch also helped to lift caps on factory output which had boosted prices.
The falling inflation trend can also be seen in the price sub-indexes of China’s manufacturing purchasing managers index. Input prices for manufacturing dropped sharply in November to 52.9 from 72.1, while output prices plunged to 48.9 from 61.1. 
Consumer inflation is forecast to have risen faster, quickening to 2.5% from 1.5% in October and potentially hitting the highest level since mid-2020. The pickup has been driven by more expensive food, with vegetable and fruit prices continuing to rise rapidly while pork has started to become pricier.

Even so, a deflationary drag from pork prices will likely continue for a while due to the low base for comparison from last year. The rise in core CPI is still muted, as it excludes more volatile food and energy prices, and sporadic Covid-19 outbreaks likely continue to weigh on services consumption. 
The National Bureau of Statistics is scheduled to release the November inflation data at 9:30 a.m. Thursday Beijing time.

LONDON (Reuters) - The United States became Britain's biggest export market for financial services in the run up to Brexit, overtaking the European Union where sales shrank in 2020, TheCityUK lobby group said on Wednesday.
Britain's financial sector was largely cut off from the EU - previously its single biggest customer - when Britain fully left the bloc's orbit last December.
For 2020, total financial services exports remained little changed at 82.4 billion pounds ($109.07 billion). Exports to the EU fell 6.6% to 24.7 billion pounds, but rose 4.1% to 57.7 billion pounds to non-EU countries.
Exports to the United States rose 5.3%, said TheCityUK, which promotes Britain's financial sector overseas.
Britain's financial services trade surplus of $80.6 billion remains the largest in the world, nearly the same as the next two leading countries, the United States and Singapore, combined at $91.7 billion.
The EU, meanwhile, is building up its autonomy in finance, making it unlikely that Britain will regain unfettered access to the continent's investors and financial markets.
""The UK’s status as a world leading financial centre is at risk unless industry, government and regulators work together to boost long term competitiveness, deepen key trade links, and focus on new areas of future global growth,"" said Anjalika Bardalai, TheCityUK's chief economist and head of research.

Britain is now revising its financial rules to maintain London's attractiveness as a global financial centre to keep up with leader New York, and fend off competition from EU cities like Amsterdam as well as Asian centres.

834,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 07, 2021 07:21PM ET</span>",Record exports sharply narrow U.S. trade deficit,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. trade deficit narrowed sharply in October as exports soared to a record high, potentially setting up trade to contribute to economic growth this quarter for the first time in more than a year.
The report from the Commerce Department on Tuesday, which also showed imports rising to an all-time high, added to a tightening labor market, strong consumer spending as well as services and manufacturing activity that have suggested an acceleration in growth was underway as the year winds down.
""The trade deficit is narrowing big time and pouring even more fuel into the economy's tank which guarantees stronger growth as 2021 comes to an end,"" said Christopher Rupkey, chief economist at FWDBONDS in New York. ""The brightening trade picture is additional evidence that the economy is very strong."" 
The trade gap plunged 17.6% to a six-month low of $67.1 billion. That was the biggest percentage drop since April 2015, reflecting an increase in the flow of goods and services following disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. 
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast a $66.8 billion deficit. Exports accelerated 8.1% to an all-time high of $223.6 billion. The surge was led by goods exports, which soared 11.1% to $158.7 billion, also a record high. 
Exports of industrial supplies and materials increased $6.4 billion, with shipments of crude oil advancing $1.2 billion. 
Petroleum exports were the highest on record.
Capital goods exports increased $3.1 billion, boosted by other industrial machines as well as civilian aircraft. Food exports rose by $2.1 billion, with soybeans increasing $1.8 billion. Exports of consumer goods jumped $1.6 billion, lifted by increases in shipments of gem diamonds as well as motor vehicles, parts and engines. 
The nation exported more services, which rose $1.0 billion to $64.9 billion. That reflected a rise in overseas travel, other business services and charges for the use of intellectual property. Further gains are likely after the United States reopened its borders to international travelers in early November after a 20-month ban. 
The Omicron variant of the coronavirus could, however, temporarily slow international travel following recent restrictions on travelers from southern African countries.
""While international travel activity could be dampened again later in the month with the emergence of the Omicron variant, we expect a continued normalization of travel through 2022,"" said Veronica Clark, an economist at  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) in New York.
U.S. financial markets were unmoved by the data.
STRONG IMPORT 
The surge in exports eclipsed a 0.9% increase in imports to $290.7 billion, also a record high. Goods imports climbed 0.7% to an all-time high of $242.7 billion. The rise was led by motor vehicles, parts and engines, which increased $1.5 billion. There were also gains in imports of consumer goods, including cell phones and other household goods.
Imports of industrial supplies and materials fell as did imports of capital goods, pulled down by declines in semiconductors and civilian aircraft. There is a global chip shortage.
Adjusted for inflation, the goods deficit decreased $13.5 billion to $97.6 billion in October. That was the smallest so-called real goods deficit since last December. If the real goods trade deficit continues to shrink, trade could contribute to gross domestic product this quarter. The trade gap has been a drag on GDP growth for five straight quarters.
""Early in the fourth quarter it looks like net exports are on track to add to GDP growth although the recent volatility in the monthly figures makes it hard to detect any underlying trend,"" said Daniel Silver, an economist at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) in New York. ""We continue to see upside risk to our 7.0% real GDP growth forecast for the fourth quarter."" 
Fourth-quarter GDP growth estimates are as high as an 8.6% annualized rate. The economy grew at a 2.1% pace in the third quarter. It is regaining speed after being restrained by shortages and a flare-up of COVID-19 infections, driven by the Delta variant. Shortages because of snarled supply chains caused by the coronavirus are fanning price pressures.
There are signs inflation could remain well above the Federal Reserve's 2% target for a while, also as companies competing for workers raise wages.
A separate report from the Labor Department on Tuesday showed unit labor costs, the price of labor per single unit of output, surged more than initially thought in the third quarter. Labor costs accelerated at a 9.6% annualized rate last quarter, revised up from the 8.3% pace reported in November. 
Unit labor costs increased at a 6.3% rate compared to a year ago, the largest gain since 1982.

""Unit wage cost pressures are strong in the face of a tight labor market,"" said Conrad DeQuadros, senior economic advisor at Brean Capital in New York.
The unemployment rate is at a 21-month low of 4.2%.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japanese manufacturers' business confidence index rose to a four-month high in December as supply constraints began to ease, the Reuters Tankan showed on Wednesday, offering policymakers some hope the economy was headed for a moderate recovery.
Sentiment among non-manufacturers also improved in December, suggesting consumption was gradually recovering after the lifting of social curbs by end-September to contain the spread of coronavirus cases.
The survey's findings bode well for the government's efforts to pull Japan out of its pandemic-induced slump including with a record $490 billion stimulus package.
But the poll, conducted between Nov. 24 and Dec. 3, likely did not take into account any impact from the recent spread of the new Omicron variant.
The monthly poll, which tracks the Bank of Japan's (BOJ) closely watched Tankan quarterly survey next due on Dec. 13, showed the manufacturers' sentiment index improved to 22 in December, following three straight months of declines to 13 in November. That compared with a reading of 18 in the BOJ's latest October survey.
""In terms of the fallout from the pandemic, we may have passed the worst,"" said a precision machinery company manager.
The index gauging non-manufacturers' sentiment rose to 6 in December from 1 in November, marking the highest level since February 2020 when the pandemic initially struck Japan.
On outlook, both manufacturers and services companies were more optimistic, with the three-month forward index among manufacturers rising to 26 from 19 and for services companies to 21 from 15. 
While non-manufacturers' sentiment improved, some sectors continued to suffer from the pandemic's scars such as those offering face-to-face services including retail and travel.
""Travel and leisure demands haven't been restored, although (consumers') cautious mood is easing,"" a service company manager said.

The Reuters Tankan poll heightens the chance the BOJ's Tankan survey for December will show a further improvement in business conditions.
The central bank is expected to keep monetary policy steady at its Dec. 16-17 meeting, where the fate of its pandemic-relief programmes will also be discussed.

With France now in its fifth wave of COVID-19 outbreaks, the outlook was marginally less optimistic than last month when the Bank of France forecast 0.75% growth from the third quarter.
Prime Minister Jean Castex said on Monday night clubs would be closed ahead of Christmas and social distancing measures tightened, but ruled out a new lockdown because nearly 90% of eligible people have been vaccinated.
Drawing on the findings of its monthly survey of 8,500 firms, the central bank said companies expected improved business conditions in the industrial and services sectors, while activity was seen stable in construction.
Led by the dominant service sector, staffing difficulties worsened slightly with 51% of all firms reporting trouble getting enough workers in the survey conducted Nov. 26-Dec. 3 after 49% in October.

Meanwhile, supply chain problems also got worse in the industrial sector, rising to 57% from 56% in October with the car industry worst hit. However, supply problems in construction eased to 56% from 58%.
Against that backdrop, the central bank estimated the economy was operating at 0.75% above pre-crisis levels of activity this month.

The Labor Department said on Tuesday that unit labor costs, the price of labor per single unit of output, accelerated at a 9.6% annualized rate last quarter. That was revised up from the 8.3% pace reported in November.
Labor costs rose at a 5.9% pace in the April-June quarter. They increased at a 6.3% rate compared to a year ago, instead of the previously reported 4.8% rate.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast unit labor costs would rise at an unrevised 8.3% pace.
Pandemic-related shortages amid snarled supply chains have boosted inflation well above the Federal Reserve's 2% target. Wages are also rising as companies scramble for workers.
Hourly compensation increased at a 3.9% rate in the third quarter, rather than at a 2.9% rate as previously reported. 

The surge in labor costs came at the expense of worker productivity, which fell at a downwardly revised 5.2% rate last quarter. Productivity was previously reported to have tumbled at a 5.0% pace. It grew at a 2.4% pace in the April-June quarter.
Compared to the third quarter of 2020, productivity fell at a 0.6% rate. It was previously reported to have declined at a 0.5% rate. Hours worked increased at a 7.4% rate last quarter, revised up from the previously estimated 7.0 pace.

House prices rose 3.4% in the three months to the end of November, the sharpest increase since late 2006, and are 8.2% higher than a year earlier, according to the monthly figures from the lender, part of Lloyds Banking Group (LON:LLOY).
""The performance of the market continues to be underpinned by a shortage of available properties, a strong labour market and keen competition amongst mortgage providers keeping rates close to historic lows,"" Russell Galley, managing director of Halifax, said.
The Bank of England plans to start raising interest rates in the coming months from their record low 0.1%, although the emergence of the Omicron variant of coronavirus means markets are split over whether this will happen at next week's policy meeting.
Halifax said house prices rose 1.0% in November alone, the same increase as in October.
British house prices have risen strongly through most of the COVID-19 pandemic, in line with many other big economies, reflecting an increased demand for space to work from home and - in Britain's case - temporary tax incentives to move house.
The most recent official data showed house prices in September, the last month when the tax break applied, were 11.8% higher than a year before, just off a 15-year peak of 12.6% in June when the tax incentive started to be phased out in England. 

But Halifax said there were signs that the shift in demand towards larger, less central housing was reversing, as prices for apartments rose faster than those for detached houses.
""We would not expect the current level of house price growth to be sustained next year given that house price to income ratios are already historically high, and household budgets are only likely to come under greater pressure in the coming months,"" Galley said.

The ZEW economic research institute said its economic sentiment index fell to 29.9 from 31.7 points in November. A Reuters poll had forecast a steeper fall to 25.1.
""The German economy is suffering noticeably from the latest developments in the COVID-19 pandemic,"" ZEW President Achim Wambach said in a statement, adding that persistent supply bottlenecks were weighing on production and retail trade.

Recent economic data has painted a mixed picture of the German economy at the start of the final quarter of 2021.

While weaker demand from abroad drove a much bigger than expected drop in industrial orders in October, factory output rose more than expected in the same month due to higher production in the car industry.
A pandemic-related scarcity of microchips and other electronic components has caused massive supply bottlenecks and production problems in Germany's mighty automobile industry and other important sectors of the economy.

Exports last month were the highest monthly figure on record, rising 30.2% from a year earlier to $41.58 billion, the Ministry of Finance said on Tuesday.
A Reuters poll of analysts had forecast a rise of 23.05% for November, compared with a 24.6% increase in October.
The ministry attributed the growth to strong demand for tech products in the festive season in which vendors traditionally launch new models such as smartphones.
The growth was also supported by robust demand for chips, a shortage of which has crippled car plants globally and is affecting consumer electronics.
Exports of telecommunication and electronics products rose 19.5% in November to reach $5.69 billion, with semiconductor exports growing 26.7% from a year earlier.
Firms such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd (TSMC) are major suppliers to Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) and other global tech giants, as well as providers of chips for auto companies and lower-end consumer electronics.
The ministry warned of risks ahead, including uncertainty over the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as supply chain bottlenecks.
But it said the strong growth should continue, with the holiday period, traditionally a busy time for Taiwan's tech firms, helping exports, along with a steady improvement in global economic fundamentals.
Ministry official Beatrice Tsai expected exports in the fourth quarter to hit a record high.
November exports to China, Taiwan's largest trading partner, grew an annual 18.9% to $17.14 billion, while exports to the United States jumped 39.2%.
Imports leapt 33.8%, above economists' expectations for a 25.45% rise and an increase of 37.2% in October.

Taiwan could see December exports increase in the range of 21% to 25% from a year earlier, the ministry added.
China's exports growth lost steam in November, pressured by a strong yuan, weakening demand and higher costs.

But overall output was still 6.5% lower compared to February 2020, the month before pandemic restrictions came into effect.

The car industry increased production by 12.6% in October, according to the statistics office, which Kraemer said had helped boost overall output.

The car industry is sitting on bulging order books and has not been able to process orders due to the acute bottlenecks.

TOKYO (Reuters) -Japan's household spending posted an annual drop for the third straight month in October, though the pace of decline slowed, as consumer sentiment struggled to stage a convincing recovery after coronavirus curbs ended.
The world's third-largest economy has lagged other nations in its recovery from the health crisis, mostly due to sluggish consumption. Analysts expect consumer sentiment to pick up this quarter as local COVID-19 infections fell.
Household spending fell 0.6% in October from a year earlier, after a 1.9% decline in September and a 3.0% drop in August, government data showed, matching the median market forecast in a Reuters poll.
The figures highlighted that consumers' mood was still cautious even after state of emergency curbs to contain the virus ended in September, said Takeshi Minami, chief economist at Norinchukin Research Institute.
""This was a weak result,"" he said. ""It feels like spending is slowly picking up but not in one go.""
The month-on-month figures were positive, posting a seasonally adjusted 3.4% rise, slightly weaker than a forecast of a 3.6% gain and slowing from a 5.0% month-on-month increase in September.
On a year-on-year basis, spending on overnight stays and eating out continued to decline, though the drop was smaller than in the prior month, while that on transportation rose.
Policymakers are hoping a rebound in domestic demand will support the economy as manufacturers navigate a global chip shortage and are hit by surging raw material prices.
The Japanese government unveiled a $490 billion spending package last month as it seeks to put its economy firmly on a recovery track, going against a global trend of unwinding crisis-mode stimulus.
Spending will likely benefit from the government's plan to restart a domestic tourism campaign, which could push up the gross domestic product by about 1% next year, said Minami.
If the campaign would be restarted early next year, it would most likely boost second-quarter spending, Minami said, adding that growth was quite good in the fourth quarter last year when the government was also subsidising domestic travel.
But the economy was not expected to see any major boost from cash handouts for households with children, he added, as the money was likely to be added to savings.

Separate data on Tuesday showed the coincident indicator index, which consists of a range of data such as factory output, employment and retail sales, rose for the first time in four months in October.
Japan's inflation-adjusted real wages slumped 0.7% year-on-year in October, falling for the second straight month and boding ill for a sustainable recovery of consumer sentiment.

844,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 07, 2021 12:10AM ET</span>",China Nov export growth slows but imports accelerate on restocking,"BEIJING (Reuters) -China's exports growth lost steam in November, pressured by a strong yuan, weakening demand and higher costs, but imports unexpectedly accelerated as the country scrambled to restock depleted commodities like coal.
Exports rose 22% year-on-year in November, customs data showed on Tuesday, slower than the 27.1% jump in the previous month but faster than the 19.0% expected in a Reuters poll.
Imports climbed 31.7%, beating the 19.8% rise in October and well above the forecast 20.6% gain.
China's coal imports in November hit their highest level in 2021, as the world's biggest consumer of the dirty fuel scrambled during the onset of winter to feed its power system, which had been experiencing shortages.
The easing of the power crunch also helped increase demand for copper. Imports of the key industrial metal hit their highest levels since March.
""Coal imports in particular soared. I think this reflects the policy change in China to solve the energy shortage problem, which constrained growth in Q3,"" said Zhiwei Zhang, chief economist at Pinpoint Asset Management. ""I don't think there is a significant improvement of domestic demand yet.""
China's trade surplus was $71.72 billion last month, narrower than the poll's forecast for $82.75 billion and the $84.54 billion surplus in October. 
The data comes a day after China's central bank announced a cut to the amount of cash that banks must hold in reserve, its second such move this year, to bolster slowing economic growth.
The country has staged an impressive rebound from the pandemic but there are signs momentum is flagging. Power shortages, regulatory crackdowns on major industries and debt troubles in the property sector are weighing on China's recovery.
Analysts expect more supportive policy measures in the coming months.
A private sector survey showed factory activity fell in November, hit by higher prices and subdued demand although the government's official survey showed activity grew in the month.
China's factory-gate inflation hit a 26-year high in October as coal prices soared during the power crunch.
No cases of the Omicron COVID-19 variant have been reported in China to date, but its emergence could add pressure to the strict zero-tolerance policy on coronavirus cases and increase logistical challenges for exporters, analysts say.
But Omicron could also support China's exporters in the near-term by keeping consumers abroad buying goods, rather than services, amid increased social distancing, said Julian Evans-Pritchard, senior China economist at Capital Economics, in a note.

""That said, the scope for a further rise in outbound shipments is limited – container throughput has levelled off in the past 12 months as ports have been operating close to capacity,"" he added.
China reported 94 new confirmed coronavirus cases for Dec. 6, with locally transmitted infections in Inner Mongolia, Heilongjiang, Yunnan and Zhejiang.

Investing.com – China’s export growth hit a new record in November but faced pressure from a strong yuan as well as weakening demand and higher costs. Import growth quickened, indicating stronger domestic activity.
Data released earlier in the day showed that exports grew 22% year on year, above the 19% growth inf forecasts prepared by Investing.com but below October’s 27.1% growth.
Imports grew 31.7%, well above the 19.8% growth in forecasts prepared by Investing.com but below the 20.6% growth recorded in October.
The data comes a day after the People’s Bank of China said it would reduce most banks’ reserve requirement ratio by 0.5 percentage points next week. The central bank’s second such move in 2021 will release CNY1.2 trillion ($188.16 billion) of liquidity.
China has staged an impressive economic recovery from COVID-19, but power shortages, regulatory crackdowns, and the property sector’s debt woes remain roadblocks.
China could issue more policy measures to support the recovery in the months ahead, with Premier Li Keqiang saying on Monday that China has room for a variety of monetary policy tools.
On the COVID-19 front, China has to date not recorded any cases of the omicron variant. However, if it emerges, it could add pressure to China’s zero-tolerance policy towards the virus and increase logistical pressures for exporters, according to analysts.
The data also showed a trade balance of $71.72 billion in November, with forecasts prepared by Investing.com’s predicting an $82.75 billion balance, and an $84.54 billion balance recorded in October."

The seasonally adjusted IHS Markit UAE Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI), inched up to 55.9 in November from 55.7 in October, which was its highest since June 2019 - boosted by Dubai hosting the Expo world fair.
The continued improvement in business conditions is a marked turn from last year, when the UAE's PMI recorded just four months of expansion as the pandemic pummelled tourism, aviation and other key sectors of the economy.
""The upturn was supported by marked expansions in output and new business volumes midway through the fourth quarter,"" IHS said in the PMI report. 
""The indices for both measures ticked up to their highest levels since mid-2019, as firms highlighted a strong increase in demand as the country reopened to tourism and benefited from the Expo 2020. Export sales also increased, albeit at a much softer pace than total new business.""
The output sub-index rose to 61.6 in November from 61.1 in October. New orders also quickened their pace of growth.
Despite that, the employment sub-index was mostly flat and sentiment for future output dipped.

""Whilst higher than seen throughout much of the pandemic, business confidence was still subdued compared to the historical average in November, as firms indicated that high competition had clouded their sales forecasts. Output prices were subsequently lowered for the fourth month running, while there was little change in staff levels despite growing capacity pressures,"" said David Owen, economist at survey compiler IHS Markit.
""The stagnation of hiring activity suggested that businesses are delaying staff decisions until they know the full extent of the economic recovery following the expo. That said, further rises in demand and backlogs could support an increase in employment sooner rather than later.""

The world's top buyer of soybeans brought in 8.57 million tonnes in November, up 68% from October's figure of 5.11 million, data from the General Administration of Customs showed. 
Hurricane Ida limited U.S. grains exports in September, including soybeans, by crippling terminals and delaying shipments.
U.S. shipments picked up later as the hurricane impact eased and the market entered the peak export season. 
For the whole marketing year, however, China's U.S. soybean imports were expected to fall from the previous year, as the hurricane delays clipped the export window for American beans, which also faced strong competition from an early Brazilian harvest. 
China's November soybean imports were also down from 9.59 million tonnes in the corresponding month a year earlier, when a large volume of U.S. cargoes arrived following a trade deal.
China brought in 87.65 million tonnes of soybeans in the first 11 months of the year, down 5.5% from the corresponding period the previous year, the data showed.
Soybean shipments in 2021 were seen to slow from the previous year, as low crush margins curbed demand.
China's soybean crush margins increased from June's record lows to more than 200 yuan a tonne in October, before retreating.
Hog margins in the southwestern province of Sichuan, a top producer of pigs, are 250 yuan a head, up sharply from early October, when farmers faced a loss of 400 yuan on each animal.

But pig prices are expected to fall in the new year if production is not cut substantially, the farm ministry said.
China also brought in 673,000 tonnes of vegetable oils in November. Imports in the first 11 months of the year were 9.573 million tonnes, up 1.6% on the year, the data showed.

Exports rose 22% in dollar terms from a year earlier to almost $326 billion, while imports grew 31.7%, leaving a trade surplus of $71.2 billion for the month, the customs administration said Tuesday. Economists had forecast exports to grow by 20.3% and imports to increase by 21.5%. 
The data show the continuing strength of global demand for Chinese goods, which has been strong throughout the pandemic. If the spread of the new omicron virus variant proves to be serious and other nations start to lock down again, that will likely provide support for China’s exports, especially personal protective gear and work from home devices.
Exports usually peak at the end of the year, buoyed by the Christmas shopping season, although a higher base for comparison last year might drive the headline growth rate lower. 
China’s economy has come under increasing pressure from a deepening housing market slump, which may continue to be a drag on growth over the next year. Policy makers moved to expand support for the nation’s economy Monday, with the central bank announcing a cut to most banks’ reserve requirement ratio which will release 1.2 trillion yuan ($188 billion) of liquidity.

LONDON (Reuters) - British consumer spending picked up in November, boosted by earlier-than-usual Christmas shopping and a recovery in spending at pubs and restaurants before news of the Omicron variant of the coronavirus, industry surveys showed on Tuesday.
The British Retail Consortium, a trade body representing major high-street retailers, said total sales in November were 5.0% higher than a year earlier, the biggest annual increase since July and up from an increase of 1.3% in October.
Separate credit and debit card data from payments provider Barclaycard showed consumer spending - which includes things such as eating out and travel, as well as shopping - was 16.0% higher than in November 2019, before the pandemic.
Consumer demand has been fairly resilient in Britain through the pandemic, as household incomes were supported by government measures. But there have been big shifts within sectors - with a large chunk of retail spending moving online, and only partly reversing when shops reopened. 
Travel remains depressed, with spending on plane tickets 22.1% below its level two years ago. Restaurant spending was 4.3% down compared with November 2019, compared with an 8.3% shortfall in October, Barclaycard data showed.
Overall non-essential spending grew at its fastest rate since the start of the pandemic, up 17.7% from two years before.
However, economists forecast that households' disposable income will become increasingly squeezed in coming months as inflation picks up further and payroll taxes rise from April, complicating the task of the Bank of England which is due to consider whether to raise interest rates next week.
BRC chief executive Helen Dickinson said November's boost in spending partly reflected Black Friday sales promotions beginning earlier in the month than previous years.
""As people prepared their wardrobes for the cold weather this winter, consumers took advantage of discounted clothing, shifting the focus of Black Friday from just electronics and household appliances,"" she said.
Like-for-like sales, a measure which adjusts for changes in retailers' floor space, were 1.8% higher than a year before, compared with a 0.2% drop in October.

Four in 10 consumers surveyed said that they were doing their Christmas shopping earlier than before, Barclaycard said.
""The arrival of Christmas markets and lights across the UK brought some festive cheer to the retail, leisure and hospitality sectors in November, while the return of darker nights and colder evenings saw Brits spend more on at-home pursuits,"" Barclaycard executive Jose Carvalho said.

MEXICO CITY (Reuters) -Mexican automotive production and exports fell for the fifth month running in November, figures from the national statistics agency (INEGI) showed on Monday, as ongoing shortages of semiconductors put the brakes on the industry.
Mexican automotive production plunged by 20.25% from November 2020 to 248,960 vehicles, while auto exports declined by 16.46% to 240,341 units, the INEGI data showed.
A global semiconductor shortage https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/mexicos-auto-heartland-workers-struggle-chip-shortage-bites-2021-11-24 has prompted automakers in Mexico and the rest of North America to implement rolling shutdowns, curtailing production and hitting workers hard.
""The stoppages are due to the shortage of semiconductors, and yes, production decreased due to the shortage,"" a spokesperson for the Mexico operations of Detroit-based General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) said in response to a query about falling output.
INEGI data showed that GM Mexico's production fell 43.7% in November from a year earlier, to 40,534 units.
Nissan (OTC:NSANY)'s Mexico unit told Reuters the shortage was also impacting production, after INEGI data showed its output plummeted 27.2% in November to 41,525 vehicles.
Mexican auto parts industry group INA said the global semiconductor shortage could be further complicated in 2022 as fifth-generation (5G) technologies are adopted.
""We estimate the impact due to semiconductor shortage will last at least until the first quarter of next year. But this is coupled with a very important issue, which is the switch from 4G networks to 5G,"" INA interim chief Alberto Bustamante said.
Bustamante estimated the impact due to the chip shortage could begin normalizing as of the second quarter of 2022.
Mexico's auto production fell by 20% to 3.04 million vehicles last year during the first phase of the coronavirus pandemic, and the Mexican Automotive Industry Association (AMIA) has forecast that it could drop by up to 5% more in 2021.

AMIA chief Fausto Cuevas forecast that Mexico's auto production would return to pre-pandemic levels by late 2023 or in 2024.
In the first 11 months of 2021, Mexican automotive production fell by 0.68% from the same period last year to 2,767,004 vehicles, while auto exports over the same period increased by 3.02% to 2,479,515 units, INEGI figures show.

BERLIN (Reuters) -Investor morale in the euro zone in December fell to its lowest level since April as renewed restrictions to contain a fourth wave of coronavirus infections clouded the growth outlook, a survey showed on Monday.
Sentix's index for the euro zone fell to 13.5 from 18.3 the previous month. Analysts on average had expected a December reading of 15.9, according to a Reuters poll.
Tightened lockdown measures, especially in Germany and Austria, considerably dampened the assessment of current conditions in the euro zone, said Sentix Managing Director Manfred Huebner.
""A slowdown and even a recession no longer seem to be ruled out now. These lockdowns hit the economy harder than before,"" Huebner said.
A current conditions index fell for the third month in a row to 13.3 from 23.5 in November, dropping to its lowest since May. Still, an expectations index rose to 13.8 from 13.3 in the previous month.
Sentix surveyed 1,164 investors on Dec. 2-4.
The Sentix survey followed economic data from Germany, Europe's largest economy, where weaker demand from abroad drove a much bigger-than-expected drop in industrial orders due to lockdowns in Asia and supply chain problems at home.
A Sentix sub-index for investor morale in Germany fell for the fifth month in a row to reach its lowest level since March.
""The tightening of the coronavirus measures and, in particular, the exclusion of customers from the retail sector through the so-called 2G measures put a considerable strain on the situation in Germany,"" Huebner said.

Household spending was already the sole driver of growth in Germany in the third quarter as factories struggled with a pandemic-related scarcity of microchips and other electronic components.
The jump in coronavirus infections and the renewed curbs are now threatening to knock away Germany's last pillar of growth, setting its economy on track for stagnation at best in the final quarter of this year.

BERLIN (Reuters) -Weaker demand from abroad drove a much bigger than expected drop in German industrial orders, including cars, in October, data showed on Monday, further clouding the growth outlook for manufacturers in Europe's largest economy.
A pandemic-related scarcity of microchips and other electronic components has caused massive supply bottlenecks and production problems in Germany's mighty automobile industry and other important sectors of the economy.
Orders for goods 'Made in Germany' dropped 6.9% on the month in seasonally adjusted terms after a revised rise of 1.8% in September and a plunge of 8.8% in August, figures from the Federal Statistics Office showed.
A Reuters poll of analysts had pointed to a smaller decline of 0.5% on the month in October.
""After incoming orders climbed to an all-time high in mid-2021, the index has lost more than 16 points in recent months,"" the economy ministry said, adding that the second sharp decline within three months put a further damper on the economic outlook.
Excluding distorting factors from bookings for big ticket items such as planes, industrial orders were still down 1.8%, the data showed.
The drop was driven by a decline in foreign orders of more than 13% on the month, with demand from countries outside the euro zone such as China particularly weak. Orders from domestic clients rose 3.4%.
""New lockdowns in Asia are slowing industry in Germany,"" VP Bank analyst Thomas Gitzel said. He added that the current wave of coronavirus infections across the globe was putting a renewed burden on the world economy.
Gitzel said that domestic demand should remain strong, helped by the new ruling coalition's commitment to massive investment in the green economy.

""The decarbonization of the economy requires major investments in new technologies. German industry can and will benefit from this,"" Gitzel said.
The weak orders data suggest that manufacturing will hamper overall economic growth in the coming months, with analysts expecting stagnation at best in the final quarter of this year.

The monthly purchasing managers' data also showed an easing in inflation pressures to their lowest since April - although they are still high in outright terms.
The survey largely predates the emergence of the Omicron variant of COVID-19, and the signs of an easing in inflation may encourage the Bank of England to wait rather than raise interest rates this month, as had been widely expected. 
The IHS Markit/CIPS UK Construction Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) rose to 55.5 last month from 54.6 in October, and IHS Markit said the worst of supply chain shortages appeared to have passed for the sector. 
Just under half of construction companies reported longer delivery times, compared with more than three quarters in June.
""Port delays and a severe lack of transport availability due to haulage driver shortages continued to hold back supplier performance, although firms noted an improvement in the availability of specific items, especially timber,"" IHS Markit said.
Some 72% of firms reported increased costs for building supplies - compared with just 3% who saw a fall - but this still represented the lowest inflation pressure since April.
The all-sector PMI - a combined reading of November's manufacturing, services and construction surveys - edged down to 57.4 from October's 57.5, which was the highest since July.

Construction order growth was the strongest in three months, but economists warned that 2022 might still prove tough. A moratorium on commercial property evictions is due to end - reducing the demand for new space - and a likely rise in interest rates and lower disposable income hurt housing demand.
""Despite the 8% increase in public sector gross investment in the upcoming 2022/23 fiscal year, which will boost the pipeline of civil engineering work, overall construction output looks set to rise slowly,"" said Samuel Tombs of Pantheon Macroeconomics.

The Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) said 115,706 new cars were registered in November, up from 113,781 in October but 31% below their average in the five years running up to the pandemic.
Some 1.54 million new cars have been registered so far this year, compared with 1.50 million in the same period of 2020. 
""What looks like a positive performance belies the underlying weakness of the market. Demand is there, with a slew of new, increasingly electrified, models launched but the global shortage of semiconductors continues to bedevil production,"" said Mike Hawes, the SMMT's chief executive.
Chip shortages were likely to continue into next year, he added.

Battery-powered electric cars accounted for 19% of the market - twice as much as a year earlier, while plug-in hybrid electric vehicles made up 9%. 
The SMMT called on the government to speed up its charging infrastructure rollout, saying there was one charger currently installed for every 52 new plug-in cars.

Monday's figures from Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd showed total job ads climbed 7.4% in November from October, when they had already gained 7.5%.
That left adds 52% higher than a year earlier at 222,093, and a lofty 44% up on pre-pandemic levels.
ANZ senior economist Catherine Birch said the report indicated a sharp rebound was likely in official employment figures following a surprise 46,300 drop in October and a rise in the jobless rate to 5.2%.
""Job ads suggest the unemployment rate should drop back below 5% in the near term, and we expect it to fall to around 4% by the end of 2022 and even further in 2023,"" said Birch. ""Underemployment is also likely to be much lower.""

The Reserve Bank of Australia is seeking to drive unemployment down to 4% or even lower in the hope of finally lifting wage growth after years of tepid gains.

The Confederation of British Industry cut its forecasts for economic growth to 6.9% in 2021 and 5.1% in 2022 from previous estimates of 8.2% and 6.1%.
It said the downgrade mostly reflected weaker growth since its last forecasts in June and the supply chain problems that have slowed the recovery from last year's coronavirus slump were likely to end in mid-2022.
With exports still weak, household spending would drive 90% of growth next year and two-thirds of it in 2023 thanks to a strong jobs market and savings racked up during the pandemic.
Business investment looked set to grow by 8.2% next year and go above its pre-pandemic level but the bounce would probably prove short-lived with corporate investment falling back in mid-2023 when a tax incentive is due to expire.
""One policy in place for 18 months can't change under-investment over four decades,"" Rain Newton-Smith, the CBI's chief economist, said. 
The CBI called on Prime Minister Boris Johnson to introduce regulations to spur investment and innovation to help build new markets in clean energy and other sectors.

The new forecasts from the group saw inflation peaking at 5.2% in April and remaining above the Bank of England's 2% target for around another year while unemployment would fall to 3.8% by the end of 2023. 
The CBI's forecasts were made before the emergence of the Omicron variant of the coronavirus which has led to tighter COVID rules. Rain-Smith said she was hopeful that Britain's high levels of vaccinations would minimise the growth hit.

IHS Markit's Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) came in at 48.7 - below the 50.0 threshold that separates growth from contraction - unchanged from October.
""A sharp rise in business costs continued to drive higher selling prices and lower demand across the Egyptian non-oil economy during November,"" IHS Markit said. 
The input cost inflation sub-index, at 63.7, was at its second-fastest in over three years, beaten only by October's 64.5. 
""A loss of client demand and slowdowns due to global supply chain issues were often behind the downturn,"" it said. ""Companies noted that higher selling prices often deterred customer spending in the domestic market."" 
The sub-index for future output expectations slipped to 60.6, its lowest level in a year, from 65.0 in October, with higher inflation expectations weighing on sentiment.

The output sub-index climbed to 47.7 from 47.5 in October, while the new orders sub-index inched down to 48.6 from 48.7.
""Higher fuel and shipping costs often led to increased prices, including for raw items such as foodstuff and paper,"" IHS Markit said, adding that companies also raised wages in response to an uptick in living expenses.

The seasonally adjusted IHS Markit Saudi Arabia Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) fell to 56.9 in November from 57.7 in October, remaining above the 50.0 mark that separates growth from contraction for the 15th consecutive month.
The headline figure was down to a three-month low as growth in new orders declined for the second month in a row from September's seven-year high.
New export orders, however, accelerated in November at their fastest pace since May, pointing to higher demand from abroad due to the easing of pandemic-related restrictions.
""The Saudi Arabia PMI continued to signal a strong end to the year for the non-oil economy"", said David Owen, economist at IHS Markit.
""Despite slipping to a three-month low, new business growth was rapid overall, whilst activity expanded at one of the quickest rates since the start of the pandemic"", he said.
Surveyed businesses linked higher sales to a return to normal economic conditions after the COVID-19 pandemic and to higher tourism.
The sustained growth in output led firms to hire slightly more than in October, although the overall employment rate remained subdued as many remained cautious over sales forecasts.

""Jobs growth remained disappointingly mild, with many firms choosing not to expand their workforces amid a weak level of optimism for future activity"", said Owen.
""The threat of future COVID-19 waves continued to promote a cautious outlook, leading to a decline in the number of firms expecting output to expand over the next year,"" he added.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. employment growth slowed considerably in November amid job losses at retailers and in local government education, but the unemployment rate plunged to a 21-month low of 4.2%, suggesting the labor market was rapidly tightening.
The four-tenths-of-a-percentage-point drop in the jobless rate from October reported by the Labor Department in its closely watched employment report on Friday occurred even as 594,000 people entered the labor force, the most in 13 months. Workers put in more hours, boosting aggregate wages, which should help to underpin consumer spending.
""Don't be fooled by the measly payroll jobs gain this month because the economy's engines are actually in overdrive as shown by the plunge in joblessness,"" said Christopher Rupkey, chief economist at FWDBONDS in New York.
The survey of businesses showed nonfarm payrolls increased by 210,000 jobs last month, the fewest since last December. But the economy created 82,000 more jobs than initially reported in September and October, a sign of strength. That left employment 3.9 million jobs below the peak in February 2020.

Despite November's slowdown in hiring, which also reflected a small gain in the leisure and hospitality industry, 6.1 million jobs have been added this year. Economists say the economy is very close to maximum employment, putting an early interest rate increase from the Federal Reserve on the table.
Fed Chair Jerome Powell told lawmakers this week that the U.S. central bank should consider speeding up the winding down of its massive bond purchases at its Dec. 14-15 policy meeting.
""The Fed will see the report as more than adequate to stay on course to accelerate tapering of asset purchases at the December meeting implying an end to purchases in March,"" said Andrew Hollenhorst, chief U.S. economist at  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) in New York. ""Moreover, an unemployment rate that is poised to fall below 4.0% perhaps in the coming months keeps a first Fed rate hike in June or even earlier firmly on the table."" Economists polled by Reuters had forecast that payrolls would advance by 550,000 jobs. Hiring continues to be hampered by worker shortages. There were 10.4 million job openings at the end of September.
U.S. stocks were trading sharply lower. The dollar rose against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury yields fell.
TIGHT LABOR SUPPLY
Employment growth was held back by a decline of 20,400 jobs in the retail sector. State and local government education employment fell by 12,600 jobs. That led to a drop of 25,000 in overall government jobs, the fourth straight monthly decrease.
Pandemic-related staffing fluctuations have distorted normal seasonal patterns in state and local government education. There have also been shortages of bus drivers and other support staff.
The leisure and hospitality sector added only 23,000 jobs compared to 170,000 in the previous month. Professional and business services payrolls increased by 90,000 jobs.
There were also solid gains in transportation and warehousing as well as in construction. Manufacturing employment increased by 31,000 jobs.
November's modest job growth did little to temper expectations that the economy was poised for stronger growth this quarter after hitting a speed bump in the third quarter.
A measure of services sector activity scaled a fresh record high in November.
Consumer spending and manufacturing activity have been strong. Spending should remain supported by rising wages as companies scramble for scarce workers. Average hourly earnings increased 0.3%, keeping the annual increase in wages at 4.8%. The average workweek climbed to 34.8 hours from 34.7. As a result of the longer workweek, aggregate wages rose 0.7%.
But the spread of the new, highly contagious Omicron variant of COVID-19 poses a risk to the brightening picture. While little is known about the impact of Omicron, some slowdown in hiring and demand for services is likely, based on the experience with the Delta variant, which was responsible for the slowest economic growth pace in more than a year last quarter.
While labor supply remains tight, there are signs that some of the millions of Americans who lost their jobs during the pandemic-induced recession are wading back into the labor force.
The smaller survey of households, from which the unemployment rate is derived, showed the labor force participation rate, or the proportion of working-age Americans who have a job or are looking for one, was 61.8%. That was the highest level since March 2020 and was up from 61.6% in October. The workforce remains 2.4 million below it pre-pandemic level.

""If more people are starting to look for work again, this would allow for stronger near-term hiring,"" said Gus Faucher, chief economist at PNC Financial (NYSE:PNC) in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.
The household survey also showed a rise of 1.136 million in the number of people employed. The employment-to-population ratio, viewed as a measure of an economy's ability to create jobs, jumped to 59.2%, also the highest since March 2020, from 58.8% in October.

860,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 03, 2021 10:27AM ET</span>",U.S. factory orders rise more than expected in October,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - New orders for U.S.-made goods increased more than expected in October and businesses spending on equipment appeared to rebound after declining in the third quarter. 
The Commerce Department said on Friday that factory orders increased 1.0% in October. Data for September was revised higher to show orders gaining 0.5% instead of 0.2% as previously reported. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast factory orders rising 0.5%. 
Orders increased surged 17.1% on a year-on-year basis.
Manufacturing, which accounts for 12% of the economy, is being driven by still-strong demand for goods despite spending shifting back to services. Businesses are rebuilding depleted inventories, but shortages of labor and raw materials stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic remain challenges.
An Institute for Supply Management survey on Wednesday showed manufacturing activity picked up in November, noting ""some indications of slight labor and supplier delivery improvement.""
Shipments rose 2.0% after advancing 1.0% in September. Inventories at factories gained 0.8% in October. Unfilled orders rose 0.3% after increasing 0.7% in the prior month.
The Commerce Department also reported that orders for non-defense capital goods, excluding aircraft, which are seen as a measure of business spending plans on equipment, increased 0.7% instead of 0.6% as reported last month. 

Shipments of these so-called core capital goods, which are used to calculate business equipment spending in the gross domestic product report, rose 0.4%. They were previously reported to have increased 0.3%.
That suggests a potential rebound in business spending on equipment after it contracted in the third quarter after four straight quarters of double-digit growth, though inflation could cut into the gains.

The Institute for Supply Management said on Friday its non-manufacturing activity index increased to 69.1 last month, the highest reading since the series started in 1997, from 66.7 in October. A reading above 50 indicates growth in the services sector, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity. 
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the index falling to 65. The survey added to data on consumer spending, the labor market and manufacturing in painting a strong picture of the economy. The Omicron variant of COVID-19, however, poses a risk to the outlook.
The ISM's measure of services industry employment increased to a seven-month high of 56.5 from 51.6 in October. That offered hope that a pandemic-related labor crunch, which has hampered faster job growth, could be starting to ease. There were 10.4 million job openings at the end of September.
With employment levels rising, services industries made progress in reducing the backlog of unfinished work last month.
Overall, supply constraints remained binding. The survey's measure of supplier deliveries was unchanged at a high 75.6. A reading above 50% indicates slower deliveries. 
Longer delivery times accounted for some of the surprise increase in the services index. They are normally associated with a strong economy and increased customer demand, which would be a positive contribution to the ISM non-manufacturing index.
In this instance, however, slower supplier deliveries also indicate relentless pandemic-related shortages.

The survey's measure of prices paid by services industries ticked down to a still-high 82.3 from 82.9 in October. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell told lawmakers on Tuesday that ""the risk of higher inflation has increased."" 
A measure of new orders received by services businesses held at a record 69.7 last month.

The survey period reflects a month in which cases of the coronavirus rose again following a fall in new infections in October. Economic policymakers have been grappling with what is keeping people on the sidelines and how many they expect to eventually come back into the labor force. 
The number of people who said they did not look for work because of COVID-19 fears declined to 1.19 million from 1.29 million the prior month, the lowest number since the pandemic began but not enough to cool intense hiring competition by firms amid labor shortages.
The figures are derived from an ongoing additional survey of households carried out by the U.S. government that has accompanied the monthly jobs report since the beginning of the pandemic.
Overall, U.S. job growth increased far less than expected in November, likely as millions of unemployed Americans remained home despite companies boosting wages, generous jobless benefits expiring and schools fully reopening.
It could cause a headache for the Federal Reserve, which is set to decide whether to speed up the conclusion of its bond purchase program at its next policy meeting on Dec. 14-15, in order to possibly raise interest rates sooner next year to rein in inflation which is at a 31-year high. 
""It's a market that's healing but healing at an uneven level"" said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Spartan Capital Securities in New York.

For those in jobs, the impact of COVID continued to recede. Approximately 3.64 million people were unable to work in November or reported reduced hours due to their business either closing entirely or cutting back operations, down from roughly 3.83 million in the prior month, according to the survey.
The number of people who said they teleworked recently due to the pandemic fell last month to 17.5 million from 18.05 million in October.

OTTAWA (Reuters) - Canada's economy posted an unexpectedly large job gain in November, driving the jobless rate down and hours worked up to pre-pandemic levels, data showed on Friday, but economists say it is unlikely to change the Bank of Canada's guidance amid worries over a new coronavirus variant.
The Canadian economy added a net 153,700 jobs in November, well above analysts' expectations of 35,000, while the unemployment rate dropped to 6.0%, beating a consensus estimate of 6.6% and edging closer to the February 2020 jobless rate of 5.7%, Statistics Canada said.
""I think the job market is tighter than the Bank of Canada has been letting on,"" said Derek Holt, vice president of capital market economics at Scotiabank, pointing to wages gains, which accelerated to 3.0% on the year from 2.1% in October.
""We're 186,000 jobs above pre-pandemic levels. So the Bank of Canada's narrative that we still have runway, in terms of a labor market recovery, is looking weaker by the moment,"" Holt added.
The Bank of Canada in October signaled it could start hiking rates as soon as April 2022. Since then, massive flooding in British Columbia has hampered trade through Vancouver and the Omicron coronavirus variant has emerged as a new global threat.
Those factors create uncertainty for the central bank and it is unlikely to markedly change its tune in its rate decision next week, said economists.
""If we didn't have the variant bringing some uncertainty over the outlook, I think it would be almost all systems go for the Bank to start teeing up tightening reasonably early in 2022,"" said Doug Porter, chief economist at BMO Capital Markets.

Canadian employment increased in both the services and goods-producing sector, and gains were fairly evenly split between full and part-time work. Total hours worked climbed 0.7%, returning to pre-pandemic levels for the first time.
The Canadian dollar was trading 0.4% higher at 1.2760 to the greenback, or 78.37 U.S. cents.

PETER CARDILLO, CHIEF MARKET ECONOMIST, SPARTAN CAPITAL SECURITIES, NEW YORK
“It’s a market that’s healing but healing at an uneven level. The reason we have the drop in unemployment is people dropping out the workforce and that’s not a good sign. This is significant, in that the if Fed abandons its full employment standard - which they probably will due to wage inflation concerns - it means that even though this is a disappointing report, the Fed is not likely to alter its accelerated tapering pace and could begin raising rates in the second quarter. 
""The bottom line is it’s a disappointment.” 
JIM VOGEL, INTEREST RATE STRATEGIST, FHN FINANCIAL, MEMPHIS, TENNESSEE
“Right now, people are sorting through the really good numbers in the household survey, and for now they are reducing their emphasis on the big payroll miss. It’s not completely unusual for the official business survey to be a bit wonky and that’s why we’ve seen so many upward revisions and that’s part of the feel. We are trading not only the payroll number this morning, but we are still trading Powell’s confident expression that tapering is a good idea from Tuesday, and we’re working on the premise that they’ve come to some pretty firm conclusions regardless of fourth quarter data.”
JJ KINAHAN, CHIEF MARKET STRATEGIST, TD AMERITRADE, CHICAGO
“So we’re going to have the unemployment rate fall by 0.4% but miss on the top line number – something doesn’t add up. As I was looking through the sectors, the sectors that don’t truly make sense to me are leisure and hospitality up so small and retail being down, which is very odd for this time of year. So I’m wondering if we are going to see some revisions going forward on those two because those just don’t add up with everything else I am seeing. Because you did get some strong numbers out of warehousing again, which is great, professional services, construction, manufacturing – all the areas you want to see growth we are seeing it, which is fantastic.” 
“The futures seemed to like it, that top-line number, maybe people are thinking that although Powell talked this week about the taper maybe this slows the pace or slows them starting it.” 

“Pretty significant revisions in September - 67,000 more, October 15,000 more. Something is very odd about this report.”
“The rally here may be top line related but when you add that top line with the employment rate it is hard to square the circle so we’ll see if the buying momentum can last off of that. There are two other things at work - the volatile week in general, this could be a little momentum from yesterday. And two weeks from today is quadruple witching, we also have the end of the year coming up, so you do have people already starting to adjust their portfolios in a bigger way.”

866,By Investing.com,"<span>Dec 03, 2021 08:34AM ET</span>",U.S. Jobs Growth Slowed Sharply in November: NFP +210k vs +550k Expected,"By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing.com -- The U.S. labor market lost momentum significantly in November, defying expectations for another strong month of job gains. 
The Labor Department said nonfarm employment rose by only 210,000 through the middle of the month, down from 546,000 in October. The latter figure was revised up by 15,000 from its original estimate, but didn't come close to offsetting the disappointment of the November number, which was over 300,000 short of a consensus forecast of 550,000. Expectations for a strong report had hardened after payrolls processor ADP had said on Wednesday that the private sector had added 534,000 jobs in the month, by its calculations. There has also been little to suggest a weakening in labor market in other data, with the monthly Job Openings survey continuing to show near-record levels of vacancies. 
Despite the big shortfall in job creation, the unemployment rate fell by more than expected to 4.2% of the workforce from 4.6% in October. That reflected an increase in labor force participation, which rose to 61.8% of the adult population, from 61.6% in October. The participation rate, which has been a particular problem holding back the economic recovery this year, is now at its highest since March last year.
""Notable job gains occurred in professional and business services, transportation and warehousing, construction, and manufacturing,"" the Bureau of Labor Statistics said, adding that employment in the retail trade actually declined in the month leading up to the Thanksgiving holiday.
The expansion of the labor force should, all other things being equal, take the steam out of some of the inflationary pressure that has built over the last year, in an environment of sustained high spending despite increasing supply-side constraints and bottlenecks. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell acknowledged earlier this week that inflation was likely to remain higher for longer than at first estimated, largely due to such supply-side issues. 
However, all other things appear increasingly unlikely to stay equal in the near term, given the emergence of a new and seemingly more infectious strain of Covid-19 over the last week. The Omicron strain is now spreading rapidly through South Africa, the first country where it was detected, and has already been identified in more than two dozen countries across the world. Much of Europe has already announced a fresh wave of mobility and social distancing restrictions, with Germany - Europe's largest economy - effectively locking down unvaccinated adults in a suite of new measures prepared by the new government. U.S. President Joe Biden has announced the tightening of testing requirements on people arriving in the U.S. It is unclear that that will be enough to stop Omicron from spreading in the community.
""Labor supply simply isn't returning quickly enough and, for companies desperate to hire, this is a huge problem,"" said ING chief international economist James Knightley in a note to clients.   ""The implication is that it constrains growth and pay is bid higher, with those cost increases likely passed onto consumers.""
He noted that the discrepancy between what employers were saying and what households were saying (the household survey of employment rose by over 1 million) made it hard to interpret the numbers cleanly. 
""Effectively you can defend any position by picking out the bits of the report that suits your view,"" Knightley said."

Economists polled by Reuters had expected increases of respectively 0.2% and 1.2%.
With energy prices having soared and coronavirus infections rising, resulting in renewed restrictions, consumers are expected to become more cautious in the coming months.

The IHS Markit/CIPS UK Services Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) fell to 58.5 in November from 59.1 in October, revised down slightly from a preliminary ""flash"" reading of 58.6.
The survey's gauges of costs paid by services companies and prices they charged to customers hit their highest levels since records started in 1998, which some Bank of England officials may view as backing the case for an interest rate hike on Dec. 16 at its next policy announcement.
New orders rose at the fastest pace in five months, driven by the travel industry after the easing of lockdown restrictions, the PMI showed.
""Worryingly, the fastest-growing parts of the service sector are also the most exposed to the return of tighter pandemic restrictions, especially as we approach the crucial festive spending period,"" said Tim Moore, economics director at IHS Markit.

Optimism fell to a one-year low, even before news of the Omicron variant of COVID-19 became known to most of the companies surveyed last month.
The composite PMI - a combination of the services survey and Wednesday's manufacturing PMI - eased to 57.6 in November from 57.8 in October.

ROME, Dec 3 (Reuters) - The Italian economy will grow by 6.3% this year, national statistics bureau ISTAT said on Friday, revising up a previous projection of 4.7% made in June due to an acceleration of domestic demand and world trade. 
In its twice-yearly economic outlook report, ISTAT forecast that gross domestic product will increase next year by 4.7%, raising its June forecast of 4.4%.
The institute's latest projections are broadly in line with those of Mario Draghi's government, which sees officially sees growth of 6.0% this year and 4.7% in 2022.
Draghi and other ministers have said recently this year's growth will exceed the official 6.0% target, which was made at the end of September.
The increase in GDP this year and next ""will be determined mainly by the contribution of final domestic demand, accompanied by a more modest contribution from net exports,"" ISTAT said.
The economy grew by 2.6% in the third quarter this year from the previous three months mainly due to strong consumer spending, the statistics bureau said on Tuesday, following a 2.7% GDP rise in the second quarter.
Last year, when the economy was hobbled by coronavirus lockdowns, recorded a record GDP contraction of 8.9%.
ISTAT estimated an average jobless rate of 9.6% this year, down from its June projection of 9.8%. It cut its 2022 forecast to 9.3% from 9.6%.
The unemployment rate stood at 9.4% in October, ISTAT reported on Thursday, the highest reading since June.

The Caixin/Markit services Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) fell to 52.1 in November from 53.8 in October, but remained above the 50-point mark that separates growth from contraction on a monthly basis.
The readings in the private survey, which focuses more on small firms in coastal regions, tallied with those of an official survey, which also showed the expansion in the services sector lost some steam.
Analysts say the services sector, which has been slower to recover from the pandemic than manufacturing, is more vulnerable to sporadic COVID-19 outbreaks and anti-virus measures, clouding the outlook for a much anticipated rebound in consumption in the months to come.
China's leisure and tourism businesses have been feeling the heat from the country's zero tolerance COVID-19 strategy to contain infections. The country is currently battling a small-scale outbreak in Inner Mongolia.
Firms' input prices also expanded for the 17th month in a row and at the fastest pace since May due to rising labour and raw material costs. Prices charged also rose, but at a slower pace, pointing to margin pressures.
A sub-index for new business rose, but at the slowest pace since August. Business expectations improved from the month before, however.
Caixin's November composite PMI, which includes both manufacturing and services activity, fell to 51.2 from 51.5 the previous month.

Investing.com – China's services sector activity grew at a slower pace in November as inflationary pressures and small COVID-19 outbreaks continue, a private survey showed on Friday.
The Caixin services purchasing managers' index was 52.1, lower than the 52.6 in forecasts prepared by Investing.com and the 53.8 figure reported during the previous month. However, it remained above the 50-point mark indicating growth.
The Caixin survey, which focuses more on small firms in coastal regions, follows data released by the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) earlier in the week that showed the non-manufacturing PMI was at 52.3.
The NBS data also said the manufacturing PMI was at 50.1, and Wednesday’s Caixin manufacturing PMI was at 49.9.
The services sector has been slower to recover from COVID-19 than manufacturing, as it is more vulnerable to COVID-19 outbreaks and the accompanying restrictive measures. Continuous COVID-19 outbreaks, although small, are clouding the outlook for the anticipated rebound in consumption for the foreseeable future. China's leisure and tourism businesses have been particularly impacted as the country continues its zero-tolerance approach to the virus.
Companies saw input prices expand for a 17th consecutive month, and at the fastest pace since May 2020, thanks to rising labor and raw material costs. Prices charged also rose, albeit at a slower pace.

The AIB IHS Markit Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) dropped to 59.3 in November from 63.4 the month before, remaining well ahead of the 50 mark that separates growth from contraction. It has fallen below 50 nine times since the start of the pandemic. 
Ireland has been reporting COVID-19 case numbers near record highs since early November, even though 91% of eligible people over the age of 12 are fully vaccinated. 
The death rate has been far lower than earlier waves, however, and case numbers have stabilised in recent days. The government has reported its first case of the Omicron variant, but has said it is too soon to judge its likely impact on the economy. 

Reports of rising COVID-19 case numbers weighed on business levels and expectations, with the slowdown evident in all of the survey's sub-indices, the survey's authors said. 
The 12-month outlook was the weakest since March and growth in employment slowed, the survey showed. Inflationary pressures remained strong with input and output prices near record highs.

DUBLIN (Reuters) - Ireland collected 9.4%, or 5.4 billion euros ($6 billion), more tax than expected in the first 11 months after it took in a record amount of corporate tax in November, traditionally the most buoyant period of the year. 
Tax revenues proved extremely resilient during the worst of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 and have taken off this year despite the economy being in its third and longest lockdown for much of the first half. 
The finance ministry took in 1.5 billion euros more that it had budgeted for last month alone, it said on Thursday.
It also collected 4 billion euros in corporate tax versus the 3.2 billion expected, putting Ireland on course for another record annual haul with corporate receipts making up more than one in every five euros of tax collected.
That also meant corporate receipts for November were greater than the annual corporate tax take ten years ago, when the state took in 3.8 billion euros. 
While global corporate tax reforms are forecast to slow the recent rapid growth in a category dominated by foreign multinationals, they were 26% ahead of target during the first 11 months of the year at 13.6 billion euros.
Finance Minister Paschal Donohoe said the outturn reflected the very robust performance of the technology sector during the pandemic and that the receipts across the board were another positive indicator of the strength of Ireland's economic recovery.
VAT receipts were 7.2% above forecast year to date at the end of November while income tax, the largest category, was 4.3% ahead of target after both also enjoyed a bumper month.
With spending 3.4% below forecast, the exchequer recorded a narrower deficit of 4.9 billion euros on a 12-month rolling basis.
The government forecast last month that it would run a 2021 budget deficit of 5.9% of modified gross national income, down from 8.8% last year.

While Ireland's fiscal watchdog predicted this week that the deficit would be lower than that by year end, Donohoe told Reuters on Wednesday that the new Omicron COVID-19 variant made December too uncertain to call.

876,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 02, 2021 12:08PM ET</span>","Brazil in recession as drought, inflation and interest rates bite","By Marcela Ayres and Camila Moreira
BRASILIA (Reuters) -Brazil's economy contracted slightly in the three months to September, government data showed on Thursday, as surging inflation, steep interest rate hikes and a severe drought triggered a recession in Latin America's largest economy.
The 0.1% decline in Brazil's gross domestic product (GDP) in the third quarter, reported by official statistics agency IBGE, was below a median forecast for zero growth in a Reuters poll. 
Brazil's economic rebound from the worst of the COVID-19 pandemic has sputtered as inflation surged into double digits, forcing the central bank to raise borrowing costs aggressively despite the downturn.
Economists have said that the stubbornly high levels of inflation in Brazil have steadily eroded consumers' purchasing power, proving a drag on the economy.
Some analysts said Thursday's weak data may discourage the bank's monetary policy committee, called Copom, from an even larger interest rate increase at its December meeting.
""Against this backdrop, we no longer see Copom upping the pace of monetary tightening next week,"" William Jackson, chief emerging markets economist at Capital Economics, told clients in a note, forecasting another rate increase of 150 basis points.
Big rate hikes from the central bank, whose autonomy was written into Brazil's constitution this year, are one more headwind for a weak economy, which is weighing on President Jair Bolsonaro's popularity as he prepares to seek relection in 2022.
Revised data showed a 0.4% drop in the second quarter, worse than the 0.1% decline reported previously. Two straight quarters of contraction meet the definition of a recession. 
Unusually dry weather this year has also hurt key Brazilian crops such as corn and coffee. Vanishing reserves at hydropower dams drove up electricity costs, adding to price shocks.
Agricultural production fell 8.0% in the third quarter, while industrial output was flat and services advanced 1.1%.
Brazil's auto industry has struggled to ramp up production amid a shortage of components such as microchips in global supply chains. Shortages have also hurt manufacturing in Mexico, whose economy contracted more than expected in the quarter.
WORSE TO COME 
Some economists are warning of a deeper downturn next year.
The market outlook for 2022 economic growth has fallen from 2.3% in June to less than 0.6% in the latest central bank poll of economists, released on Monday.
Brazil's Economy Ministry dismissed that consensus in a statement on Thursday, reaffirming its forecast of economic growth above 2% next year and pointing to recent job creation data as evidence of a resilient recovery.
Brazil's unemployment rate fell to 12.6% in the third quarter from 14.2% in the prior quarter, data showed this week, hitting the lowest point since the beginning of the pandemic.

""The government has an obvious bias to overestimate (growth) as long as possible. But there comes a point when you can't,"" said José Francisco Gonçalves, chief economist at Banco Fator.
Compared to the third quarter of 2020, Brazil's economy grew 4.0%, IBGE data showed, below a median forecast of 4.2% growth.

877,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 02, 2021 10:17AM ET</span>",U.S. labor market tightening; layoffs near three-decade lows,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits increased less than expected last week, pointing to tightening labor market conditions, while layoffs tumbled to the lowest level in 28-1/2 years in November. 
The weekly unemployment claims report from the Labor Department on Thursday, the most timely data on the economy's health, also showed jobless benefits rolls falling below 2 million for the first time since the COVID-19 pandemic started in the United States more than 20 months ago. 
The upbeat news on the labor market added to strong consumer spending and manufacturing data in suggesting that the economy was accelerating after hitting a speed bump in the third quarter. The Omicron variant of the coronavirus, however, poses a risk to the brightening picture. 
Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell in a nod to the strengthening economy told lawmakers this week that the U.S. central bank should consider accelerating the pace of winding down its bond purchases at its Dec. 14-15 policy meeting. 
""Companies are not laying off workers like they did during the recession,"" said Christopher Rupkey, chief economist at FWDBONDS in New York. ""Powell was right to hint the Fed might speed up the tapering process because a tight labor market means increasing wage demands will stoke the fires of inflation."" 
Initial claims for state unemployment benefits rose 28,000 to a seasonally adjusted 222,000 for the week ended Nov. 27. Claims dropped to 194,000 in the prior week, which was the lowest number since 1969.
They tend to be volatile around Thanksgiving, the start of the holiday season. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast 240,000 applications for the latest week. Claims have declined from a record high of 6.149 million in early April 2020.
Unadjusted claims fell 41,622 to 211,896 last week. There were sharp declines in filings in California, Texas and Virginia, which offset notable rises in North Carolina and Wisconsin.
U.S. stocks opened higher. The dollar fell against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices were lower.
EYES ON PAYROLLS 
Last week's data has no bearing on the department's closely watched employment report for November, scheduled to be published on Friday, as it falls outside the period during which the government surveyed businesses and households for the nonfarm payrolls count and the unemployment rate. Claims declined between mid-October and mid-November.
According to a Reuters survey of economists, nonfarm payrolls probably increased by 550,000 jobs in November after rising 531,000 in October. The unemployment rate is forecast dipping to 4.5% from 4.6% in October. 
Also arguing for continued improvement in the labor market, the ADP National Employment report on Wednesday showed private payrolls increased by 534,000 jobs last month. A measure of manufacturing employment rose to a seven-month high, a survey from the Institute for Supply Management showed. 
The Conference Board's labor market differential - derived from data on consumers' views on whether jobs are plentiful or hard to get - jumped to a record high in November. 
The run of good news on the labor market was extended by a separate report on Thursday from global outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas showing job cuts announced by U.S.-based employers dropped 34.8% in November to 14,875, the fewest since May 1993. So far this year, there have been 302,918 job cuts, down 86% compared to the same period in 2020.
But worker shortages are hindering faster job growth. The Federal Reserve's Beige Book on Wednesday described employment growth ranging from ""modest to strong"" across Fed districts during October and early November, with contacts noting ""persistent difficulty in hiring and retaining employees."" 
There were 10.4 million job openings as of the end of September. The workforce is down 3 million people from its pre-pandemic level, even as generous federal government-funded benefits have expired, schools have reopened for in-person learning and companies are raising wages. 

But there is hope that worker shortages could start easing soon. Thursday's claims report showed the number of people receiving benefits after an initial week of aid plunged 107,000 to 1.956 million in the week ended Nov. 20. 
The lowest level in the so-called continuing claims since mid-March 2020 likely reflected a combination of people exhausting their benefits as well as finding work. A total 2.31 million people were receiving unemployment checks under all programs in mid-November.

Initial unemployment claims in regular state programs totaled 222,000 in the week ended Nov. 27, an increase of 28,000 from the prior week, Labor Department data showed Thursday. The median estimate in a Bloomberg survey of economists called for 240,000 applications.
The four-week average of initial applications, which smooths out large swings in the data, dropped to 238,750.
The level of claims is still near the lows of the pandemic and points to the labor market’s continuing recovery. However, the emerging omicron variant poses a risk to what’s otherwise been a solid pace of hiring.

The Food and Agriculture Organization's (FAO) food price index, which tracks international prices of the most globally traded food commodities, averaged 134.4 points last month compared with a revised 132.8 for October.
The October figure was previously given as 133.2.
The November reading was the highest for the index since June 2011. On a year-on-year basis, the index was up 27.3% last month.
Agricultural commodity prices have risen steeply in the past year, driven by harvest setbacks and strong demand.
The FAO's cereal price index rose by 3.1% in November from the previous month and was 23.2% higher than its year-ago level, with wheat prices hitting their highest level since May 2011. 
FAO said wheat prices were supported by concerns about unseasonable rains in Australia and uncertainty over potential changes to export measures in Russia.
The dairy price index posted the largest monthly rise, up 3.4% from the previous month. ""Strong global import demand persisted for butter and milk powders as buyers sought to secure spot supplies in anticipating of tightening markets,"" FAO said.
Global sugar prices rose 1.4% on the month and was up nearly 40% year-on-year. ""The increase was primarily driven by higher ethanol prices,"" FAO said. 
The meat price index posted its fourth consecutive monthly decline, shedding 0.9% on the month, while world vegetable oil prices fell 0.3% on October levels, but international palm oil prices remained firm, FAO said. 
Rome-based FAO cut its projection of global cereal production in 2021 to 2.791 billion tonnes from 2.793 billion estimated a month ago, according to its cereal supply and demand outlook.
However, the expected world cereal output would still represent a record, FAO said.

""The month-to-month downgrade is primarily the result of an anticipated marginally smaller global coarse grains outturn, reflecting reduced forecasts for barley and sorghum production,"" FAO said.
World cereal utilization in 2021/22 was forecast to rise by 1.7% above the 2020/21 level, hitting 2.810 billion tonnes. FAO's forecast for world cereal stocks by the close of seasons in 2022 stood at 822 million tonnes, up 2.9 million tonnes since November but still down 0.7% from opening levels.

The data marks the ninth consecutive month of falling jobless figures and the lowest unemployment figure for November since 2008, the ministry said.
Spain added 109,451 net jobs over the month, while some 125,632 people were still enrolled in the state supported furlough scheme, 39,992 fewer than a month earlier, separate data from the Social Security Ministry showed.
This has brought the number of registered workers to 19.77 million, a record high for the Spanish labour market, according to the ministry.
Spain has experienced strong employment growth so far in the second half of the year, thanks to the containment of the pandemic in a country with one of the highest vaccination rates in the world.
Although tourism data is still far from pre-pandemic levels, the autumn is proving to be good for activity in the sector, where more than 30,000 jobs were created in catering alone.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. manufacturing activity picked up in November amid strong demand for goods, keeping inflation high as factories continued to struggle with pandemic-related shortages of raw materials.
Signs that the economy was gathering momentum halfway through the fourth quarter were underscored by other data on Wednesday showing private employers maintained a strong pace of hiring last month. But there are fears that the Omicron variant of COVID-19 could hurt demand for services as well as keep the unemployed at home, and hold back job growth and the economy.
""Manufacturing should continue to contribute positively to GDP growth over the next year as businesses replenish inventories and supply-chain issues improve,"" said Ryan Sweet, a senior economist at Moody's (NYSE:MCO) Analytics in West Chester, Pennsylvania. ""There are risks, including the potential for businesses overbooking orders now and the Omicron variant magnifying price and supply chain issues.""
The Institute for Supply Management (ISM) said its index of national factory activity increased to a reading of 61.1 last month from 60.8 in October. 
A reading above 50 indicates expansion in manufacturing, which accounts for 12% of the U.S. economy. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the index rising to 61.0.
""The U.S. manufacturing sector remains in a demand-driven, supply chain-constrained environment, with some indications of slight labor and supplier delivery improvement,"" said Timothy Fiore, ISM chair of the manufacturing business survey committee.
Global economies' simultaneous recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic, fueled by trillions of dollars in relief money from governments, has strained supply chains, leaving factories waiting longer to receive raw materials. 
The Federal Reserve's Beige Book on Wednesday described economic activity as growing at ""a modest to moderate pace"" during October and early November, but noted that ""growth was constrained by supply chain disruptions and labor shortages."" 
All of the six largest manufacturing industries in the ISM survey, including computer and electronic products as well as transportation equipment, reported moderate to strong growth. 
Makers of computer and electronic products said ""international component shortages continue to cause delays in completing customer orders."" Transport equipment manufacturers reported ""large volume drops due to chip shortage."" Furniture producers said ""business is strong but meeting customer demand is difficult due to a shortage of raw materials and labor."" 
But there are some glimmers of hope. Prices for steel plate and hot-rolled coil appear to be nearing a plateau, according to manufacturers of fabricated metal products. Supply of plastic resins is improving, accounts from electrical equipment, appliances and components, as well as plastics and rubber products manufacturers suggested.
The ISM survey's measure of supplier deliveries slipped to 72.2 from 75.6 in October. A reading above 50% indicates slower deliveries. 
The long delivery times kept inflation at the factory gate bubbling. The survey's measure of prices paid by manufacturers fell to a still-high 82.4 from 85.7 in October.
Factories are easily passing the increased production costs to consumers and there are no signs yet of resistance. 
Fed Chair Jerome Powell told lawmakers on Tuesday that ""the risk of higher inflation has increased,"" adding that the U.S. central bank should consider accelerating the pace of winding down its large-scale bond purchases at its next policy meeting in two weeks.
The Fed's preferred inflation measure surged by the most in nearly 31 years on an annual basis in October.
Stocks on Wall Street rebounded after Tuesday's sell-off. The dollar was steady against a basket of currencies. Prices for longer-dated U.S. Treasury prices rose.

STRONG ORDERS
The ISM survey's forward-looking new orders sub-index climbed to 61.5 last month from 59.8 in October. Customer inventories remained depressed. 
With demand robust, factories hired more workers. A measure of manufacturing employment rose to a seven-month high.
Strengthening labor market conditions were reinforced by the ADP National employment report on Wednesday showing private payrolls increased by 534,000 jobs in November after rising 570,000 in October. That was broadly in line with expectations. 
Graphic: ADP: https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-STOCKS/byvrjqjlzve/adp.png 
This, combined with consumers' robust perceptions of the labor market last month suggest job growth accelerated further in November. First-time applications for unemployment benefits declined between mid-October and mid-November. 
But a shortage of workers caused by the pandemic is hindering faster job growth. There were 10.4 million job openings at the end of September. 
Workers have remained home even as companies have been boosting wages, school reopened for in-person learning and generous federal government-funded benefits ended. 
""Overall, the risk remains that renewed health concerns will keep workers, especially those with caregiving responsibilities, from returning to the labor force, preventing a return to pre-pandemic strength,"" said Rubeela Farooqi, chief U.S. economist at High Frequency Economics in White Plains, New York. 

According to a Reuters survey of economists nonfarm payrolls probably increased by 550,000 jobs in November. The economy created 531,000 jobs in October.

The new reading signaled a further deterioration in the health of the manufacturing sector, though the contraction was mild compared to those seen since the onset of COVID-19, the survey said.

LONDON/TOKYO (Reuters) -Global factory activity accelerated in November although crippling supply bottlenecks remained, putting a cap on output and driving up the cost of raw materials, according to surveys published on Wednesday.
Towards the end of the month, the newly-detected Omicron coronavirus variant emerged as a fresh worry for policymakers, who are already trying to pilot recovering economies and tamp-down inflation.
The November surveys likely did not reflect the spread of the variant, which could add further pressure on pandemic-disrupted supply chains, with many countries imposing fresh border controls to seal themselves off.

The findings from the private-sector survey, which focuses more on small firms in coastal regions, stood in contrast with those in China's official PMI https://www.reuters.com/markets/asia/china-nov-factory-activity-unexpectedly-grows-supply-snags-ease-2021-11-30 on Tuesday that showed manufacturing activity unexpectedly rose in November, albeit at a very modest pace.

""But demand was relatively weak, suppressed by the COVID-19 epidemic and rising product prices.""
Beyond China, however, factory activity seemed to be on the mend with PMIs showing expansion in countries ranging from Japan, South Korea, India, Vietnam and the Philippines.

890,By Bloomberg,"<span>Dec 01, 2021 08:36AM ET</span>","U.S. Companies Added 534,000 Jobs in November, ADP Data Show","(Bloomberg) -- U.S. companies added workers at a healthy clip in November, suggesting employers continue to chip away at filling a near-record number of open positions.
Businesses’ payrolls increased by 534,000 last month after a 570,000 gain in October, according to ADP Research Institute data released Wednesday. The median forecast in a Bloomberg survey of economists called for a 525,000 rise.
The figures suggest steady improvement in a labor market where skills mismatches, job switching and pandemic-related factors are still making it difficult for employers to attract and retain workers. Total employment as measured by ADP remains well below its pre-pandemic level, and the emerging omicron variant represents a risk to labor force participation. 
The data precede Friday’s monthly employment report from the Labor Department, which is forecast to show that private payrolls increased by 525,000 in November.
“The labor market recovery continued to power through its challenges last month,” Nela Richardson, ADP’s chief economist, said in a statement. “Service providers, which are more vulnerable to the pandemic, have dominated job gains this year. It’s too early to tell if the omicron variant could potentially slow the jobs recovery in coming months.”
Service-provider employment increased 424,000 in November, led by leisure and hospitality. Employment at professional and business services rose by the most since June 2020. Transportation employment also posted a strong advance.
Payrolls at goods producers rose by 110,000, reflecting sizable gains in manufacturing and construction.
Employment at companies with at least 500 workers increased by 277,000 in November. Small businesses posted a gain of 115,000.
ADP’s payroll data represent firms employing nearly 26 million workers in the U.S.

891,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 01, 2021 04:57AM ET</span>",Soaring cost pressures hit UK manufacturers in Nov -PMI,"LONDON (Reuters) - More British manufacturers than at any point in the last 30 years reported rising costs last month, according to a survey on Wednesday that underlined pressure on the Bank of England to raise interest rates.
The IHS Markit CIPS UK Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) rose in November to 58.1 from 57.8 in October. 
While revised down from a preliminary ""flash"" reading of 58.2, the survey showed a mostly improving picture for British manufacturers, marked by rising orders and employment.
But the PMI's measure of factory costs, historically a good guide to official producer input price inflation, rose to the highest level since records began in 1992 as businesses struggled with global supply chain problems.
A Confederation of British Industry survey earlier this week showed costs rising at the fastest rate in over 20 years for firms in Britain's services sector.
The BoE is keeping a close eye on gauges of cost pressure in the economy. 

While it has said higher borrowing costs can do nothing to influence energy prices paid by businesses and consumers, some of its policymakers are concerned that high inflation could harm its credibility in the eyes of the public.
Earlier on Wednesday, a survey showed British retailers increased prices for the first time in more than two years in November as the pandemic's hit to global supply chains and staff availability pushed up inflation for shoppers.

892,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 01, 2021 04:25AM ET</span>",Euro zone factory growth picked up in Nov but inflationary pressures mounted,"LONDON (Reuters) - Manufacturing growth in the euro zone accelerated slightly last month but supply chain bottlenecks worsened, putting a cap on output and driving the cost of raw materials up at the fastest rate in over two decades, a survey showed.
Disruptions caused by the coronavirus pandemic, alongside a shortage of heavy goods vehicle drivers, has led to product shortages and left factories struggling to get the materials they need to manufacture goods.
IHS Markit's final manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) nevertheless nudged up to 58.4 in November from October's 58.3, shy of an initial 58.6 ""flash"" estimate but still comfortably above the 50 mark separating growth from contraction.
An index measuring output, which feeds into a composite PMI due on Friday and seen as a good guide to economic health, rose to 53.8 from October's 53.3.
""A strong headline PMI reading masks just how tough business conditions are for manufacturers at the moment. Although demand remains strong, as witnessed by a further solid improvement in new order inflows, supply chains continue to deteriorate at a worrying rate,"" said Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit.
Those disruptions have made it a sellers' market for raw materials and the input prices index was only just below October's record high.
But factories passed on more of those rising costs to customers and increased their prices at the fastest pace since IHS Markit began collecting the data 19 years ago. The output prices index climbed to a survey high of 73.7 from 72.6.
That suggests overall inflation https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/euro-zone-inflation-hits-record-high-likely-peak-2021-11-30 in the bloc, which preliminary official data showed on Tuesday was a record high 4.9% last month, will continue to overshoot the European Central Bank's 2.0% target.

Elevated inflation and a surge in house prices has put pressure on the ECB, which has undershot its inflation target for nearly a decade, to act. 
The ECB is forecast to keep its key interest rates on hold through to end-2023 at least, a November Reuters poll https://www.reuters.com/business/euro-zone-inflation-remain-above-ecbs-target-next-year-2021-11-12 found.

893,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 01, 2021 02:41AM ET</span>",UK house price climb gathers more speed in November -Nationwide,"LONDON (Reuters) -The growth of British house prices accelerated last month and the market was holding up despite the end of pandemic emergency support measures for housing and the broader economy, mortgage lender Nationwide said on Wednesday.
House prices rose by 0.9% in November compared with October when they rose by 0.7%, Nationwide said. A Reuters poll of economists had pointed to a monthly 0.5% increase.
The increase left house prices 10% higher than in November 2020, above a median forecast of 9.3% in the Reuters poll.
Nationwide chief economist Robert Gardner said house prices were now almost 15% above their level in March 2020 when the pandemic swept Europe.
""Underlying activity appears to be holding up well,"" Gardner said. 
Demand for housing has been strong in Britain - and many other countries around the world - since the lifting of the first coronavirus lockdown last year, boosted by demand for bigger properties as more people work from home.
The British market was also stoked by a tax incentive offered by finance minister Rishi Sunak which fully expired at the end of September, when a jobs support programme also lapsed.
Since the end of the furlough programme there has been no sign of a big jump in unemployment.
""If this is maintained, housing market conditions may remain fairly buoyant in the coming months, especially since the market has momentum and there is scope for ongoing shifts in housing preferences, as a result of the pandemic, to continue to support activity,"" Gardner said.
A shortage of homes for sale has also continued to support house prices. 

Gardner said the outlook remained uncertain due to factors such as the possibility of the Bank of England raising interest rates and the impact of the Omicron variant of the coronavirus on public health and the economy. 
""Indeed, house price growth has been outpacing income growth by a significant margin and, as a result, housing affordability is already less favourable than was the case before the pandemic struck,"" he said.

The IHS Markit Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) rose to 51.7 from 51.6 in October, staying above the 50.0 mark that separates expansion from contraction for the second month in a row.
Growth in output and new orders accelerated to the fastest pace since May as client demand strengthened.
""Although the upturns were historically subdued, they were the fastest for six months,"" said Sian Jones, an economist at survey compiler IHS Markit.
Employment increased for the second month running in November, with the pace of job creation at its fastest since December 2018 thanks to higher production requirements.
Input costs rose markedly due to increased supplier costs and raw materials shortages. Firms said they had partially passed them on to clients.

The level of optimism among producers reached a five-month high as they hoped for an uptick in customer orders.
""Upbeat expectations came despite a recent surge in COVID-19 cases which could threaten the speed of recovery in demand conditions across the sector,"" Jones said.

895,By Investing.com,"<span>Dec 01, 2021 12:07AM ET</span>",Chinese Manufacturing Activity Falls Back into Contraction in November,"By Gina Lee
Investing.com – China’s factory activity slid back into contraction in November, with subdued demand, as well as rising unemployment and prices, weighing on manufacturers.
The Caixin manufacturing purchasing managers index (PMI), released earlier in the day, was at 49.9, just below the 50-mark indicating growth. It also was lower than the 50.6 figure reported in October, as well as the 50.5 predicted in forecasts prepared by Investing.com.
The findings from Caixin’s survey, which focuses more on small firms in coastal regions, contrasted with Tuesday’s data from the National Bureau of Statistics. The data showed the manufacturing PMI was at 50.1, while the non-manufacturing PMI was at 52.3.
“Supply in the manufacturing sector recovered, while demand weakened. Relaxing constraints on the supply side, especially the easing of the power crunch, quickened the pace of production recovery,” Caixin Insight Group senior economist Zhe Wang said in a statement accompanying the data release.
“But demand was relatively weak, suppressed by the COVID-19 epidemic and rising product prices.”
Although China initially staged an impressive economic recovery from COVID-19, a slowing manufacturing sector, debt woes in the property market, and COVID-19 outbreaks have all contributed to a slowdown.
Investors predict that a slowdown in gross domestic product recorded for the third quarter of 2021 to continue in the year’s last quarter.
The Caixin survey also showed that production expanded in November for the first time in four months, while new orders fell back into contraction.
Caixin’s Wang urged policymakers to focus on supporting small companies and pay attention to problems including deepening unemployment, limited household income growth, and weak purchasing power.
“In addition, the prices of some raw materials remained high. Enterprises are still facing high-cost pressures. Policymakers should treat inflation seriously,” he added.
Meanwhile, the Caixin services PMI is due later in the week."
896,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 30, 2021 11:11PM ET</span>",China's property woes worsen as home prices slip in November-survey,"BEIJING (Reuters) - China's property market woes worsened in November, with prices for both new and resale homes falling amid weaker demand in bigger cities, a private-sector survey showed on Wednesday.
The property sector, accounting for a quarter of the country's gross domestic product, has slowed sharply in recent months, with sentiment shaken by tight regulations and a growing liquidity crisis that has engulfed some of the country's most indebted developers.
New home prices in 100 cities dipped 0.04% in November from a month earlier, compared with 0.09% growth in October, according to data from China Index Academy, one of the country's largest independent real estate research firms.
That was the first decline in the survey since 2015, except for a drop of 0.24% in February 2020, the height of the COVID-19 pandemic in China.
Only 30% of 100 cities reported monthly price rises for new homes.
Prices in the resale home market fell 0.08% month-on-month, deepening from a 0.04% decrease in October. 
Official data for October had shown a price drop for that month for new homes, the first decline since March 2015, and falling resale prices in most cities, along with a plunge in construction starts.
""The downward trend in the property market remains unchanged in the near future"", said the academy's research director Cao Jingjing.
Rapidly deteriorating conditions in the property sector have prompted speculation that policymakers may start to dial back tough restrictions on buyers and developers and even cut interest rates.
But policymakers are widely expected to stand firm for now, while making some financial tweaks to help genuine home buyers.
Some banks have accelerated the disbursement of approved mortgages and some were told to issue more loans to property firms for project development.
The southwestern city of Chengdu last week moved to ensure developers receive funds from presold properties and fresh loans, in the first such move by a Chinese city to ease a liquidity crisis.
Monthly new home prices in Tier-one and Tier-two cities dropped 0.1% and 0.02%, versus gains of 0.01% and 0.09% in October, the data from the Academy survey showed.

The property regulation policies are expected to be fine-tune, said the Academy's Cao.
Oxford Economics in a recent note expected the property downturn would continue into the first half of 2022.

The Caixin/Markit Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) fell to 49.9 in November from 50.6 the month before, versus analyst expectations of 50.5 in a Reuters poll. The 50-mark separates growth from contraction on a monthly basis.
The world's second-largest economy, which staged an impressive rebound from last year's pandemic slump, has lost momentum since the second half as it grapples with a slowing manufacturing sector, debt problems in the property market and COVID-19 outbreaks.
Analysts expect the slowdown in gross domestic product (GDP)seen in the third-quarter to continue in the fourth with demand expected to remain soft given the prolonged global COVID-19 pandemic. 
The findings from the private survey, which focuses more on small firms in coastal regions, stood in contrast with those in an official survey on Tuesday that showed manufacturing activity grew for the first time in three months.

""But demand was relatively weak, suppressed by the COVID-19 epidemic and rising product prices.""
Production in November expanded for the first time in four months, while new orders slid back into contraction, the Caixin survey showed.
Declines in employment also deepened.
Cost pressures are finally easing after the relentless build-up in the past few months as government efforts to curb record high raw material prices paid off. 
A sub-index for input prices declined to 52.3 from 65.1 the previous month, driving a slowdown in output price inflation.
Firms reported prices of steel fell at a steep pace in November, while the prices of chemicals and electronics remained high, the survey showed.

Wang from Caixin Insight Group urged policymakers to focus on supporting small companies and pay attention to problems including deteriorating employment, limited household income growth and weak purchasing power for consumer goods.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japanese companies raised spending on plant and equipment for the second straight quarter in July-September, but the pace of gains slowed as global supply shortages due to a resurgent coronavirus pandemic hit corporate activity.
A slow pickup in company spending is likely to worry policymakers hoping strong domestic demand can make the country's economic recovery more sustainable.
Ministry of Finance (MOF) data out on Wednesday showed capital expenditure in the third quarter rose 1.2% from the same period last year.
It marked the second straight quarter of year-on-year gains, having posted a much larger 5.3% expansion in the second quarter.
""This outcome shows quite a substantial fall in economic activity due to the global impact of a spreading of coronavirus infections,"" said Takumi Tsunoda, senior economist at Shinkin Central Bank Research.
""While there's demand for capital spending, its progress was delayed. Due to parts shortages machines could not be produced,"" he said.
The data, which will be used to calculate revised gross domestic products (GDP) due next Wednesday, showed business spending, recurring profits and sales all declined from the previous quarter on a seasonally adjusted basis.
""Corporate expenditure rose compared to the same period in the previous year, but it fell from the prior quarter reflecting the spread of infections and growing uncertainty about the outlook,"" a government official said.
It comes after private-sector data showed Japan's manufacturing activity grew in November at the fastest pace in nearly four years. The government said on Tuesday factory production grew in October, raising hopes of a recovery fuelled by stronger car output.
The world's third-largest economy declined in the third quarter as global supply disruptions hit exports and the health crisis soured consumer sentiment.
A preliminary estimate found the economy shrank an annualised 3.0% in July-September amid a resurgence of coronavirus infections.
Tsunoda said the capital expenditure component of the revised third-quarter GDP figures was likely to be downgraded.
Wednesday's data showed manufacturers' business spending improved 0.9% from a year earlier, while that of service-sector firms advanced 1.4%.

Capital expenditure, however, lost 2.6% in July-September from the previous quarter on a seasonally-adjusted basis, the MOF data showed.
Corporate recurring profits rose 35.1% in July-September from a year earlier, while sales were up 4.6%.

The IHS Markit purchasing managers' index (PMI) for November edged up to 50.9 from 50.2 in October, and managed to hold above the 50-mark threshold that indicates expansion in activity, for a 14th straight month.
""Despite the headline PMI rising slightly in November, this masked a second successive contraction in output levels, while new order growth broadly stagnated as supply shortages hit demand,"" said Usamah Bhatti, economist at IHS Markit.
Output continued to shrink on shortages of materials, notably in the semiconductors market, while slowing new orders put more strains on firms.
Total new orders and export orders barely grew, as higher demand in key Asian markets such as Japan, mainland China and Taiwan were offset by supply difficulties in the automotive industry.
Adding to the challenge, manufacturers faced more cost burdens, with input prices rising at their quickest pace since the survey began in April 2004, due to higher raw material costs.
That led firms to pass higher costs on to clients, pushing factory gate inflation to a four-month high, and reduce staffing levels for a second straight month.
Firms, however, were optimistic over the coming year that supply chain pressure would ease amid a global recovery in demand, with business confidence improving to a three-month high.

""Confidence was underpinned by hopes that supply chain pressure would ease and the recovery in global demand would accelerate the launch and mass production of new products,"" Bhatti said.
The November survey did not reflect the spread of the Omicron coronavirus variant that may add further pressure on the pandemic-disrupted supply chains, with many countries imposing fresh border controls to seal themselves off.

Businesses, however, said cost pressures remained an issue as materials shortages and delivery delays caused input prices to surge the most in 13 years.
The final au Jibun Bank Japan Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) in November rose to 54.5 on a seasonally adjusted basis, marking its fastest pace of expansion since January 2018.
The figure, which compared to the prior month's 53.2 and a 54.2 flash reading, also marked the 10th straight month of expansion in manufacturing activity.
""The Japanese manufacturing sector continued to see an improvement in operating conditions midway through the fourth quarter,"" said Usamah Bhatti, economist at IHS Markit, which compiles the survey.
Bhatti said manufacturers reported a sustained and marked deterioration in lead times, with evidence suggesting supply chain disruptions continued to hinder activity within the sector.
""Material shortages and logistical disruptions contributed to a rapid rise in average cost burdens, as input prices rose at the fastest pace since August 2008,"" Bhatti added.

Data on Tuesday showed Japan's industrial output rise for the first time in four months in October as faster car production offset declines in manufacturing of chemicals, steel and other sectors.
The world's third-largest economy is expected to rebound in the current quarter after contracting in July-September as curbs to stem a rise in coronavirus infections hurt household and corporate sentiment.

Retailers have been advertising holiday deals as early as September and are offering smaller discounts, as they look to minimize product shortages ahead of Christmas due to supply chain bottlenecks and cushion the hit to profits from surging costs.
However, those efforts have led to a more spread out holiday shopping season and fewer people concentrating their spending on days like Black Friday and Cyber Monday.
A total of 179.8 million shoppers made purchases in stores and online over the shopping period from Thanksgiving Day through Cyber Monday, compared with 186.4 million shoppers in 2020, NRF's survey showed.
The total number of online shoppers fell 12.1% to 127.8 million, while in-store foot traffic rose 13.7% from a year ago when the pandemic kept shoppers away from stores. 
""With early deals in October, consumers were not waiting around for discounts on big shopping days like Cyber Monday and Black Friday,"" said Taylor Schreiner, director, Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) Digital Insights. 
Data from Adobe Analytics showed online spending on both Cyber Monday and Black Friday declined for the first time ever this year.
NRF's survey of 5,759 consumers also showed shoppers spent an average of $301.27 on holiday purchases such as gifts, toys and apparel, down from $311.75 last year.

The holiday season kicks off just as the new Omicron coronavirus variant triggers uncertainty over the economic reopening, but NRF CEO Matthew Shay warned against a return to lockdowns. 
""We've got to continue to keep the economy open and moving forward. We want to work with the administration and President (Biden) to get that done,"" Shay said.

902,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 30, 2021 03:57PM ET</span>","Rising inflation, relentless pandemic dampen U.S. consumer confidence","By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. consumer confidence dropped to a nine-month low in November amid worries about the rising cost of living and pandemic fatigue, but that did not change expectations for stronger economic growth this quarter.
The survey from the Conference Board on Tuesday showed consumers less enthusiastic about buying a house and big-ticket items such as motor vehicles and major household appliances over the next six months, likely because of shortages, which have boosted prices. Consumers held strong views of the labor market, with the gap between those saying jobs are plentiful versus hard to get widening to a record high.
""This isn't a cause for concern as the relationship between spending and sentiment is loose, particularly in the short-run,"" said Ryan Sweet, a senior economist at Moody's (NYSE:MCO) Analytics in West Chester, Pennsylvania. ""The good news is that consumers' assessment of the labor market improved in November, pointing toward further acceleration in job growth.""
The Conference Board said its consumer confidence index fell to 109.5 this month, the lowest reading since February, from 111.6 in October. The survey was conducted before the discovery of Omicron, a new COVID-19 variant.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the index falling to 111.0. The measure, which places more emphasis on the labor market, is down from a peak of 128.9 in June. The fall was less than that of the University of Michigan's survey of consumer sentiment, which hit a decade low.
Data this month have suggested that the economy was accelerating in the fourth quarter, with consumer spending surging in October and first-time applications for unemployment benefits at a 52-year low. 
That led economists to raise their growth estimates for the fourth quarter to as high as an 8.6% annualized rate. The economy grew at a 2.1% pace in the July-September quarter. 
But the outlook for next year has been clouded by the Omicron variant.
While economists expect consumer confidence to decline further because of both the Delta and Omicron variants, they held onto their lofty growth forecasts for the current quarter.
""We currently expect the Omicron variant will have only a moderate negative impact on growth,"" said Nancy Vanden Houten, chief U.S. financial economist at Oxford Economics in New York. ""We still anticipate real GDP growth of 7.9% in fourth quarter and real consumer spending growth of 6.5%.""
Stocks on Wall Street fell. The dollar rose against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices were mixed.
STRONG LABOR MARKET VIEWS 
The Conference Board's so-called labor market differential, derived from data on respondents' views on whether jobs are plentiful or hard to get, jumped to a reading of 46.9 this month, the highest on record, from 43.8 in October.
This measure correlates to the unemployment rate from the Labor Department.
Combined with multi-decade low jobless claims, it raises hopes that employment growth accelerated further this month, though a shortage of workers remains a challenge. There were 10.4 million job openings at the end of September.
Consumers' inflation expectations over the next 12 months surged to 7.6%, the highest since June 2008, from 7.1% last month. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell told lawmakers on Tuesday that the risk of higher inflation has increased and that it was appropriate to consider wrapping up bond purchases.
""These data provide further evidence that inflation expectations held by the general public are beginning to become unanchored,"" said Conrad DeQuadros, senior economic adviser at Brean Capital in New York.
Rising inflation is starting to influence consumers' spending decisions, the Conference Board survey suggested. 
The share of consumers planning to buy a motor vehicle over the next six months was the smallest in the current series. There was a break in the series in November 2010. Motor vehicles are scarce because of a global semiconductor shortage. 
Buying intentions for household appliances like television sets and refrigerators also fell, though intentions to purchase washing machines and clothes dryers rose. Consumers were less inclined to buy a house over the next six months, reflecting a dearth of homes on the market. Slowing demand could help to further cool house price inflation.
A second report on Tuesday showed the S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller's 20 metropolitan area home price index rose 19.1% on a year-on-year basis in September after advancing 19.6% in August.

Signs that house price growth was moderating were evident in a third report from the Federal Housing Finance Agency that showed house prices rose 17.7% in the 12 months through September after powering ahead 18.5% in August.
""There is still low availability of for-sale homes, which continues to drive price growth, but the competition has faded and assuaged some of the bidding war intensity,"" said Selma Hepp, deputy chief economist at CoreLogic. ""Overall, home price growth is likely to continue slowing over the next year.""

Asia's third-largest economy has rebounded strongly from last year's deep pandemic-induced slump, boosted by vaccinations and stronger government spending, economists said. But new COVID-19 variants, a global slowdown and rising manufacturing prices all pose risks to growth.

""Data clearly shows that corporate income and profit are above the pre-pandemic level,"" K.V. Subramanian, chief economist at the finance ministry told reporters after the data release. 
He said double-digit growth was expected in the current fiscal year, which ends in April 2022, with growth of 6.5% to 7% predicted for the following fiscal year. 
The International Monetary Fund has forecast 2021 economic growth of 9.5% in India compared to a forecast for China of 8%. 
The Reserve Bank of India's (RBI) monetary policy committee meets on Dec. 6-8. With households increasingly worried about inflation, policymakers are expected to speed up measures to suck up excess liquidity before normalising interest rates. 
""With growth revival and sticky core inflation, we expect RBI to undertake phased withdrawal of liquidity and start raising the policy rates soon,"" said Sujan Hajra, chief economist at Anand Rathi Securities, Mumbai.
Consumer spending - the main driver of the economy - rose 8.6% from a year earlier in July-September following 19.3% growth in previous quarter, Tuesday's data showed. 
Manufacturing expanded 5.5% and farm output rose 4.5% during the three months to September, which bolstered the recovery as lower interest rates lifted consumer spending and investments. 
Investments rose 11% compared with growth of 55.3% in the previous quarter, while state spending jumped 8.7% after contracting nearly 5% in the April-June period.
RISKS TO GROWTH
Modi has rolled back three farm laws aimed at cutting subsidies and attracting investments while putting planned labour reforms on hold as his party faces growing criticism over rising distress among workers during the pandemic. 
Rising prices and falling rural wages risk denting consumer demand, analysts say. Real rural wages have contracted 3% so far in the current fiscal year, according to estimates, leading to declines in two-wheeler and tractor sales.
Supply bottlenecks including chip shortages have also hit production of vehicles and other electronic goods.
The emergence of the Omicron coronavirus variant has led health authorities to tighten testing at Indian airports while Prime Minister Narendra Modi has ordered a review of plans to ease travel curbs. 

Private economists said the new COVID-19 variant could dampen hopes of recovery in tourism and other services, as only around 32% of the population has been fully vaccinated. 
""We need to watch out for any risks from the Omicron COVID variant and any escalation in supply disruptions due to stricter lockdowns across the globe,"" said Sakshi Gupta, senior economist at HDFC Bank.

OTTAWA (Reuters) -The Canadian economy roared back in the third quarter, with growth most likely accelerating in October on a manufacturing rebound, though economists were cautious on the looming impact of the Omicron COVID-19 variant.
Canada's economy grew 5.4% in the third quarter on an annualized basis, beating analyst expectations for a gain of 3.0%, Statistics Canada data showed. A preliminary estimate for October showed a gain of 0.8%, while September's GDP was in line with expectations for a 0.1% rise.
Statscan revised down annualized second-quarter GDP to a contraction of 3.2% from a previous dip of 1.1%. But with the October gain, economic activity is now just 0.5% below pre-pandemic levels.
""The October increase was maybe more encouraging for the speed of recovery even than the third quarter numbers,"" said Nathan Janzen, senior economist at Royal Bank of Canada.
""There is a lot of uncertainty right now about how long this can be sustained just given ... the Omicron variant.""
The third-quarter rebound was driven by one of the largest household spending sprees on record, as COVID-19 restrictions were eased and consumers bought everything from clothing to personal grooming services. Exports were also up, led by crude oil.
""We had a pretty strong showing in consumer spending. So that was nice to see after the weakness we had in the second quarter,"" said Jimmy Jean, chief economist at Desjardins Group. 
""But now the question is what's going to happen in fourth quarter,"" he added, pointing to both the emergence of the Omicron variant and flooding in the western province of British Columbia that cut off a key port from the rest of Canada. ""It seems the more we go into the quarter the risk has tilted to the downside.""
Canada has reported five cases of the Omicron variant. The health minister in the province of Quebec warned residents to rethink holiday travel. 

The Bank of Canada last month signaled it could start hiking rates as soon as April 2022, with inflation set to stay above target through much of next year due to supply chain bottlenecks and high energy prices.
The Canadian dollar was trading 0.2% lower at 1.2768 to the greenback, or 78.32 U.S. cents. Investors are pricing in a first rate hike in either March or April. [BOCWATCH]

A measure of home prices in 20 U.S. cities jumped 19.1%, down from 19.6% in August and the second straight slowdown, the S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller index showed Tuesday. Nationwide, prices climbed 19.5%, which was also down from a month earlier.
While values are still soaring, the cooldown comes more than a year after the pandemic sparked intense competition for a tight supply of listings across the country. Fewer families generally shop for homes after the start of the school year, and September’s jump in mortgage rates curbed buyers’ ability to bid up prices.
More owners are expected to list their properties for sale in the coming months, which would help ease the inventory shortage. But demand remains intense, signaling that meaningful relief from price gains may be a ways off.
A measure of contracts to buy previously owned U.S. homes jumped to a 10-month high in October, the National Association of Realtors reported Monday. Completed purchases are on track to exceed 6 million in 2021, the most in 15 years, the group said. 
Prices in Phoenix surged 33% from a year earlier in September, according to the index. Following were Tampa, with a 28% jump, and Miami, with 25%.

(Reuters) - Portugal's tourism-dependent economy grew 2.9% in the third quarter of 2021 from the previous three-month period, data from the National Institute of Statistics (INE) showed on Tuesday.

907,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 30, 2021 05:12AM ET</span>",Euro zone inflation hits record high in likely peak,"FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Euro zone inflation soared to its highest rate on record this month on surging energy costs, likely peaking before a slow decline that will keep it uncomfortably high for much of the next year, data from Eurostat showed on Tuesday. 
Consumer price growth in the 19 countries sharing the euro accelerated to 4.9% in November, by far the highest level in the 25 years since the figure has been compiled, up from 4.1% a month earlier and well ahead of expectations for 4.5%. 
Energy prices were up 27% compared with a year earlier as oil prices soared but inflation in services and non-energy industrial goods, a drag on price growth in past years, were both above 2%, suggesting a rapid rise in underlying price pressures. 
Although inflation is now more than twice the European Central Bank's 2% target, it is unlikely to trigger any policy action, even if the data make for uncomfortable reading and could trigger political pressure on the ECB to rein in price growth.
The ECB has long argued that the inflation surge is temporary, caused by a range of one-off factors, and will subside over time so policy action now would be counterproductive as it would thwart economic growth just when inflation eases on their own.
While some policymakers have warned that high inflation, even if temporary, could trigger a surge in wages, ECB President Christine Lagarde and chief economist Philip Lane have dismissed this argument, saying that wage growth remains anaemic and there is no sign that firms are permanently altering their remuneration behaviour.
Indeed, the ECB has promised continued stimulus with bond buys and record low rates throughout 2022, even as a long list of central banks around the world are already tightening policy. 
The potential headache is that inflation will now take months to drop and could stay above the ECB's target until the second half of 2022, a communication challenge for a bank that has struggled with low inflation for a decade and has little experience with price growth above its target.
Underlying prices, a key focus for policymakers as they exclude volatile food and energy prices, also surged. 
Inflation excluding food and fuel prices and a narrower measure that also excludes alcohol and tobacco products, both rose to 2.6%, well ahead of expectations for 2.3%. 

Although both of those figures were high, Lane has dismissed these readings in the recent weeks, arguing that they are skewed by post-pandemic factors and so are not accurate gauges of actual underlying price growth.
The ECB will next meet on Dec. 16, when it is almost certain to end a 1.85 trillion euro emergency bond purchase scheme but will likely ramp up other measures to make up for the lost stimulus.

Consumer prices rose 0.4% from last month, giving a 12-month inflation rate of 3.4%, the highest since September 2008, INSEE said.
The result slightly exceeded a Reuters poll of 17 economists' expectations which had an average forecast for inflation to remain unchanged this month at 3.2%.
Following a broader global trend, the November increase was almost exclusively driven by surging energy prices, which were up 21.6% over one year.

Separately, INSEE reported that consumer spending fell 0.4% in October from September due to a 1.8% drop in spending on manufactured goods. Economists had expected spending to remain unchanged on average.
INSEE said that consumer spending was 1.8% below pre-crisis levels seen at the end of 2019.

The Federal Statistics Office said agreed wages of unionised employees rose by an average of 0.9% year-on-year from July to September. This was the smallest increase recorded since the office began compiling the data in 2010.
Central bankers and policy makers are watching the development of wages in the euro zone very closely. They are looking for any hints as to whether rising consumer prices lead to higher wages which could mark the start of a wage price spiral and lead to higher inflation also in the medium term.
Tuesday's figure includes the agreed basic remuneration and the extra payments provided for in-wage settlements, such as one-off payments, annual extra payments or agreed back payments.
Excluding special effects related to extra payments in the car industry, negotiated wages rose by 1.3% on the year.
As consumer prices rose by 3.9% in the three months, workers suffered an actual decline in real wages in the third quarter, the office added.
The weak wage data comes after unions on Monday secured a 2.8% wage increase for more than a million public sector workers at the federal state level, a deal analysts said was too modest to kick off a wage-price spiral in Germany.

The decline in real wages bodes ill for future household spending which was the sole driver of German gross domestic product growth in the third quarter in light of supply bottlenecks and production problems in the industrial sector.
Chancellor-in-waiting Olaf Scholz, from the centre-left Social Democrats (SPD), has said his three-way ruling coalition with the Greens and Free Democrats (FDP) will raise the national minimum wage by around 25% to 12 euros an hour next year.

By Gina Lee
Investing.com – China recorded a surprise growth in factory activity in November, the first in three months, as a surge in raw material prices and power rationing both eased.
National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) data released earlier in the day showed that the manufacturing purchasing managers index (PMI) was at 50.1 in November, higher than the 49.6 figure in forecasts prepared by Investing.com and the previous month’s 49.2 figure.
The non-manufacturing PMI was at 52.3, higher than the previous month’s 52.4 figure. Both indexes were above the 50-mark indicating growth.
""A series of recently introduced policies and measures to ensure energy supply and stabilize market prices has been proven to be effective,"" NBS senior statistician Zhao Qinghe told Reuters.
""Power rationing eased somewhat in November while prices for some raw materials dropped significantly, driving an expansion in manufacturing PMI.""
However, the manufacturing PMI could stay near the 50-mark for the months to come, due to constraining factors such as power curbs, high raw material prices, and weaker consumption, Hwabao Trust economist Nie Wen told Reuters.
New restrictions on manufacturing in northern China are already in place due to the Beijing Winter Olympics, due to take place in February 2022.
In the services sectors, the latest lockdown measures due to COVID-19 outbreaks have weighed on services activity, but an uptick in construction has improved sentiment.
As China’s economic recovery from COVID-19 continues to slow down, the GDP is set to slow down further in the fourth quarter of 2021. Premier Li Keqiang has acknowledged that the economy faces new downward pressures but added that authorities should avoid ""aggressive"" one-size-fits-all policy responses.
Investors now await the Caixin manufacturing and services PMIs, due later in the week."

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia's economy got a much-needed boost from strong exports and government stimulus spending in the third quarter which should have at least tempered the huge hit to activity from coronavirus lockdowns.
While gross domestic product (GDP) still likely suffered its second largest contraction on record last quarter, a timely 1.7 percentage point contribution from trade and public spending will soothe some of the pain.
The GDP report is due on Wednesday and is forecast to show a drop of 2.7%, a contraction only surpassed by the 7.0% plunge that followed the start of the pandemic last year.
The drop is again due to the virus, which closed the states of New South Wales and Victoria for much of the quarter and hammered consumer spending.
Fortunately for the economy, the government stepped in with emergency aid which saw total public spending add A$3.5 billion ($2.50 billion), or 0.7 percentage points, to GDP.
Australia also benefited from strength in resource exports and a fall in import volumes which saw real net exports add 1.0 percentage points to GDP in the quarter.
The country's current account surplus climbed to a record A$23.9 billion in the quarter led by an 8% jump in exports.
The surplus would have been even larger but Australian firms, particularly miners, paid out a lot more in dividends to foreign investors after a bumper earnings season.
In any case, a rapid economic recovery is already underway as world-beating levels of vaccination have allowed most restrictions to be lifted, unleashing a wave of pent-up demand.
Retail sales surged a huge 4.9% in October as shops reopened, a splurge that banks say continued in November. CBA reported spending on its cards for the week to Nov. 26 was 24% higher than in the same week of 2019 before the pandemic hit.
The labour market has also been surprisingly resilient with payrolls rebounding to above pre-lockdown levels in October, well ahead of expectations.
The emergence of the Omicron variant is a potential threat, with the government delaying the opening of international borders by two weeks, though stay-at-home rules are unlikely as 87% of the adult population is fully vaccinated.

912,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 29, 2021 10:11PM ET</span>",China factory activity unexpectedly grows as some bottlenecks ease,"BEIJING (Reuters) -China's factory activity unexpectedly picked up in November, growing for the first time in three months as the crippling surge in raw material prices and power rationing eased, taking some pressure off the manufacturing sector.
The official manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) rose to 50.1 in November from 49.2 in October, data from the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) showed on Tuesday.
The 50-point mark separates growth from contraction. Analysts had expected it to come in at 49.6.
The world's second-largest economy, which staged an impressive rebound from last year's pandemic slump, has lost momentum in the second half of this year as it grapples with slowing manufacturing, debt problems in the property market and COVID-19 outbreaks.
Analysts expect the slowdown in gross domestic product (GDP)seen in the third-quarter to continue in the fourth with demand expected to remain soft.
""A series of recently introduced policies and measures to ensure energy supply and stabilise market prices has been proven to be effective,"" said Zhao Qinghe, senior statistician at the NBS.
""Power rationing eased somewhat in November while prices for some raw materials dropped significantly, driving an expansion in manufacturing PMI.""
Reflecting the positive headline PMI, a subindex for production rose to 52.0 in November from 48.4 in October while new orders fell at a slower pace, although November marked the fourth straight month of declines in customer demand.
TEMPORARY REPRIEVE
There were also signs of relief elsewhere in Asia with Japanese factory output rising for the first time in four months in October as facilities in other parts of the region resumed operations after COVID-19 closures.
The supply resumption helped cool the prices of crucial production materials.
A sub-index for input prices in the Chinese PMI stood at 52.9 in November, down significantly from 72.1 in the previous month, pointing to easing cost pressures.
That drove prices charged lower, falling for the first time since May 2020.
Despite the improvement, Nie Wen, an economist at Hwabao Trust, said he expects the manufacturing PMI to hover around 50 for the months to come, due to constraining factors such as power curbs, high raw material prices and weaker consumption. 
Analysts also warn that there could be new restrictions on manufacturing in northern China due to the upcoming Beijing Winter Olympics while the impact from new COVID-19 strain Omicron on China's economy remains to be seen.
Factory gate inflation hit a 26-year high in October, further squeezing profit margins for producers and heightening stagflation concerns. As a result, policy sources say China's central bank will likely move cautiously on loosening monetary policy to bolster the economy.
Premier Li Keqiang last week acknowledged that China's economy faces new downward pressures but said authorities should avoid ""aggressive"" one-size-fits-all policy responses.
In contrast to the uptick in the factory sector, growth in the services sector slowed slightly with the official non-manufacturing PMI in November easing to 52.3 from 52.4 in October.
Fresh lockdown measures as China raced to contain the latest COVID-19 outbreak have weighed on services activity, which has been otherwise propped up by brisk construction.

The construction activity subindex rose to 59.1 in November from 56.9. 
China's official October composite PMI, which includes both manufacturing and services activity, stood at 52.2, up from October's 50.8.

TOKYO (Reuters) -Japan's industrial output rose in October for the first time in four months as re-opening of Asian factories eased supply constraints for automakers, offering some hope for the export-reliant economy as it struggles to mount a solid recovery.
The increase was smaller than market expectations, underscoring the lingering impact of global supply chain disruptions. Analysts, however, see signs of an improving outlook.
""Weak outputs among automakers have put a lid on Japan's overall production for the past three months, but the situation is easing,"" Takeshi Minami, chief economist at Norinchukin Research Institute.
Factory output grew 1.1% from the previous month in October, government data showed on Wednesday, marking the first increase since June. It compared with a 1.8% gain forecast in a Reuters poll of economists and followed a 5.4% decline in the previous month.
Auto production rose 15.4% month-on-month in October for its first increase in four months thanks to the waning impact of parts shortages in Asia, a Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) official told a briefing. 
Carmakers offset shrinking production in sectors such as chemical, steel and electronic components and devices.
The outlook suggested some stabilisation was in store, with manufacturers surveyed by the government expecting output to jump 9.0% in November, led by a 35.8% surge among automakers, followed by a 2.1% gain in December, the data showed.
Automakers - which account for 15% of Japan's industrial output, according to METI - including  Toyota  Motor (NYSE:TM) Corp and Honda Motor Co announced earlier this month their plans to return to normal production in December.
""While other sectors' production predictions seem optimistic, carmakers output plans are reliably solid,"" Minami said, attributing it to the automakers' lean production processes that affect a wide variety of parts suppliers. 
Still, he believes it will likely take until early 2022 for companies to make up the multi-month production losses.
Manufacturers' plans reflect eased impacts of chip and parts shortages, a government official said, though he warned of risks in firms' supply chains, including any fallout associated with COVID-19's Omicron variant.
Separate data on Tuesday showed Japan's jobless rate stood at 2.7% in October, down from the previous month's 2.8% to the lowest level since March, while an index gauging job availability fell to 1.15 from 1.16 in September.
After a contraction in July-September, economists polled by Reuters expect the world's third-largest economy to rebound an annualised 5.1% in the current quarter thanks to an uptick in consumption, as the pandemic-induced state of emergency curbs have been lifted.
The Bank of Japan's Dec. 16-17 rate-review is set to see no change in its ultra-easy policy but it may decide whether to extend pandemic-relief lending programmes beyond the current March 2022 deadline.

""In summer 2020, a rapid rebound amid automakers after a dip contributed to the overall industrial output growth,"" said Minami. 
""If the scene successfully replays, then Japan's output can return to an upward trend with the make-up production plans toward next year.""

Higher output of cars and factory equipment lifted overall production 1.1% from September, the economy ministry reported Tuesday. Manufacturers said they plan to boost output again this month and next, a good sign for Japan’s recovery this quarter. Analysts had expected a 1.9% increase in October. 
A separate report showed continued resilience in the labor market, with the unemployment rate ticking down to 2.7% and a measure of demand for workers showing positions on offer still outnumbering job seekers. 
While Japan’s manufacturing gains and positive production forecasts offer more evidence that Asia’s supply chain shortages may be easing, the omicron variant of the coronavirus has reignited fears that a worst-case scenario could necessitate a return to growth-crippling lockdowns. 
Japan on Tuesday closed its borders to new foreign arrivals, a move coming only weeks after the country managed to loosen restrictions amid plummeting case counts. 
“If omicron is found within Japan and triggers more restrictions, it could shift the recovery trajectory, but so far that doesn’t seem to be happening,” said economist Atsushi Takeda at Itochu Research Institute. “September appears to have been the bottom for production.”
Economists Game Out How Omicron Will Hurt the Global Recovery
Bank of Japan Governor Haruhiko Kuroda on Monday said he expects Japan’s economy to return to growth in coming months, signaling that the emergence of omicron hadn’t changed his outlook much. Analysts have been forecasting Japan’s recovery to resume this quarter, now that restrictions on the service sector have mostly been lifted and the vaccination rate is above 75%. 
What Bloomberg Economics Says...     
“We expect production to accelerate in November, spurred by a gradual recovery in factory operating rates as a drop in virus cases in Asean starts to ease supply chain problems. Still, shortages of chips may remain a drag. China’s slowdown is also likely to continue weighing on exports and production.”
--Yuki Masujima, economist

October’s production gain came as parts shortages from Asia began to ease and car output increased for the first time in four months, a ministry official said. 
Reports from  Toyota  Motor (NYSE:TM) Corp. show the group raised domestic output by about 22% last month, although the automaker’s global output is still down by more than a quarter from 2020’s level. 
Manufacturers surveyed in Tuesday’s report said they plan to increase output 9% this month and another 2.1% in December, but the reported plans tend to be overly optimistic and the survey was taken before omicron was discovered.
Semiconductor supplies also continue to be a problem. Nissan (OTC:NSANY) Motor Co. President Makoto Uchida, in an interview with Bloomberg Television this week, said the company had expected to recover from the shortages in the second half of the fiscal year, but he’s less optimistic now. The firm this month cut its sales plan for the current year by 600,000 units due to continuing parts shortages.

The official manufacturing purchasing managers index rose to 50.1, the first time in three months it exceeded the 50 mark that signals an expansion in production. The non-manufacturing gauge, which measures activity in the construction and services sectors, fell slightly to 52.3. Both measures beat economists’ expectations.
November usually sees a seasonal rebound as there are more working days compared to October when China closes for a week-long national holiday. Energy shortages, which ravaged factory production in September and October, also eased during the month as coal producers boosted output and inventories rose.
“The data signal a stabilization of the current slowdown,” said Raymond Yeung, chief economist for Greater China at Australia & New Zealand Banking Group (OTC:ANZBY) Ltd. The construction sub-index increased to 59.1 from 56.9, which suggests “activity seems to be reactivated, thanks to government relaxation measures supporting property projects,” he said.
Zhao Qinghe, a senior statistician at the National Bureau of Statistics, said recent measures to strengthen energy supply and stabilize prices took some effect. Export orders also improved, mainly due to global economic recovery and the approaching of holiday season overseas, Zhao said.
The economy continues to be undermined by a housing market crisis and frequent Covid-19 outbreaks, which are weighing on next year’s outlook. Several economists expect growth to slow to under 5% in 2022, with more fiscal and monetary support likely to follow. 
China Faces More Growth Risks, Increased Policy Support in 2022
Policy makers are trying to moderate the sharp downturn in the property market, while providing targeted support to areas such as small businesses and green technology. More clues on policy action will likely come next month, when the Communist Party holds its Central Economic Work Conference.
A set of early indicators showed China’s economy continued to slow in November with car and homes sales dropping again as the housing market crisis dragged on. Strong export demand ahead of the year-end holiday season partly helped offset the property slump.

SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea's factory output in October shrank at its sharpest pace in nearly 1-1/2 years, government data showed on Tuesday, as global chip shortages continued to weigh on car production.
Industrial output last month unexpectedly fell by a seasonally adjusted 3.0% month-on-month, Statistics Korea data showed, following a 1.1% decline in September and logging the biggest decline since May 2020.
That also missed the 0.4% growth tipped in a Reuters poll of analysts, by a large margin.
""Continued global supply chain disruption is one main factor behind the sluggish data,"" Finance Minister Hong Nam-ki said, referring to the auto chip shortage.
A breakdown of data showed production of cars shrank 5.1%, while that of primary metal fell 5.9%.
""We expect better data in November, reflecting strong exports and a recovery in domestic demand and as the impact from high base fades,"" Hong said.
On an annual basis, output grew 4.5%, sharply rebounding from a 1.8% contraction in September and beating 3.0% growth forecast in the poll.
Car production contracted 13.5% year-on-year, but that was offset by 38.7% growth in semiconductors output.

The global spread of Omicron coronavirus variant may further risk production going forward, with many countries closing their borders to prevent fresh outbreaks.
Meanwhile, Tuesday's data also showed service sector output last month shrank 0.3% month-on-month, while retail sales grew 0.2%.

The Confederation of British Industry said its quarterly survey of the services sector showed the quickest growth in costs for both business and consumer services companies since the survey began in 1998.
Separate data from Lloyds (LON:LLOY) Bank showed a record 50% of businesses plan to raise prices and a quarter of them expect to raise pay by 3% or more over the next 12 months.
""Record growth in costs is threatening to put a winter freeze on the service sector recovery next quarter,"" CBI economist Charlotte Dendy said.
Both surveys took place in the first half of November, before news of the Omicron variant of COVID-19 dented the confidence of financial market investors who now see a roughly 60% chance that the BoE will raise rates in December.
British consumer price inflation hit a 10-year high of 4.2% in October and the BoE expects it to reach nearly 5% next year.
In the short run, higher interest rates will not reduce pressure from a global surge in energy prices and supply chain difficulties. But they may reduce knock-on effects that would come if companies increase prices, and workers ask for higher pay, in anticipation of permanently higher inflation.
Tuesday's CBI data showed businesses already think they will be unable to pass on higher costs in full. Although average selling prices are expected to rise by a record amount, profit growth is expected to stall over the coming three months for services firms, due to the rise in costs.

The CBI reported the fastest hiring since 2015 by business and professional services companies.
Data from recruitment website Indeed, also released on Tuesday, showed vets, optometrists, auditors, animators and truck technicians were the roles that their customers were finding it hardest to fill.

Consumer prices, harmonised to make them comparable with inflation data from other European Union countries, rose 6.0% year-on-year following an increase of 4.6% in October, the Federal Statistics Office said.
The reading was the highest rate recorded since January 1997, when the EU-harmonised series began.
The national consumer price index (CPI) rose by 5.2% year-on-year, which was the highest rate since June 1992.
ECB board member Isabel Schnabel told ZDF television the rise did not come as a surprise to the central bank although its earlier forecasts had not predicted such a strong one.
Schnabel said the central bank believes inflation peaked in November, meaning it would be premature to raise rates as price increases look likely to slow gradually next year.
Preliminary euro zone inflation data due on Tuesday is expected to show a rise to 4.5% in November from 4.1% in the previous month.
The ECB targets an inflation rate of 2%.
DOWNWARD TREND COMING?
The recent surge in inflation is caused by a mix of several factors, including base effects, higher energy prices, a pandemic-related temporary VAT rate in the previous year and material shortages in the course of the recovery.
""Although inflation rates will remain at a relatively high level in the coming months, a downward trend should be discernible,"" VP Bank analyst Thomas Gitzel said.
""If there are no second-round effects, the ECB target of 2% should already be reached again by mid-2022,"" Gitzel said, adding that the ECB would react calmly to the latest data.
Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) economist Joerg Kraemer was more alarmed by the fresh figures, calling it a worrying sign that seasonally adjusted consumer prices rose unusually strongly on the month.
""In addition, prices are now increasing on a broader front, it is no longer just about energy and some goods particularly affected by the coronavirus pandemic,"" Kraemer added.

While he agreed that inflation was likely to fall again after the turn of the year due to some special factors, Kraemer said there was too much money circulating in the euro zone because of high budget deficits and the ECB's bond purchases.
""The ECB should take its foot off the accelerator, stop its bond purchases and end the negative interest rate policy,"" Kraemer said.

BOGOTA (Reuters) - Colombia's inflation in November is forecast to have stepped up a gear compared to the previous month as supply chain issues weigh on local and international prices, an effect forecast to roll into next year, a Reuters' poll revealed on Monday. 
According to a median estimate of 16 analysts, consumer price growth in November is forecast at 0.20%, up from 0.01% in October. Consumer prices contracted 0.15% in the same month in 2020.
Analysts' forecasts fluctuated between 0.06% and 0.35%.
If inflation rises in line with the median forecast, November's 12-month consumer price growth will hit 4.94%. 
The biggest pressure on inflation is expected to come from food prices, which in turn would impact the hospitality and hotel sectors, while transport and housing will also weigh on consumer prices, the analysts forecast. 
A second sales-tax (VAT) free day took place in Colombia during November, which is expected to result in inflation in the telecommunications and fashion sectors falling, according to Itau bank economist David Cubides.
Analysts now expect inflation to hit 4.90%, down from a forecast of 4.97% last month, but still far beyond the central bank's 3% target. 
Consumer prices are expected to grow 3.80% during 2022, up from a forecast of 3.50% in October's poll. 
The central bank previously extended its 3% inflation target to 2022, with a range of between 2% and 4%, as prices rise amid greater-than-expected economic growth. 
Colombia's monetary policy authority has begun a cycle of raising interest rates to combat growing inflation, increasing its benchmark rate by 25 basis points in September and 50 basis points in October, taking the current rate to 2.50%.

Analysts forecast the bank could hike the interest rate to 4.50% by the close of next year.
The government will publish November's inflation data on Saturday, Dec. 4.

The National Association of Realtors (NAR) said on Monday that its Pending Home Sales Index, based on signed contracts, rose 7.5% last month to 125.2. Pending home sales increased in all four regions.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast contracts, which become sales after a month or two, would rise 0.9% in October. Pending home sales declined 1.4% in October on a year-on-year basis. Limited inventory has led to double-digit growth in home prices.
""Motivated by fast-rising rents and the anticipated increase in mortgage rates, consumers that are on strong financial footing are signing contracts to purchase a home sooner rather than later,"" said Lawrence Yun, NAR's chief economist.
Demand for housing shot up early in the coronavirus pandemic as Americans decamped from city centers to suburbs and other, less densely populated areas in a hunt for larger homes to accommodate online schooling and working from home.

The buying spree has cooled somewhat as workers return to offices, and schools reopened for in-person learning, thanks to COVID-19 vaccinations.
But total existing home sales for 2021 are now set to top six million, which would be the most in 15 years, NAR also reported.

921,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 29, 2021 09:07AM ET</span>",Food and fuel costs drive Spanish inflation to 29-year high,"MADRID (Reuters) -Spanish inflation hit its highest in nearly three decades in November as increases in food and fuel costs pushed consumer prices up 5.6% year-on-year, National Statistics Institute (INE) data showed on Monday. 
The rate accelerated from October's 5.4% to reach its highest level since September 1992's 5.8%. Inflation has been rising across the euro zone in recent months, with Spain particularly hard hit.
Rising food costs were the main driver, followed by vehicle fuels and lubricants. However, a months-long acceleration in electricity costs reversed in November, according to the INE.
On a EU-harmonised basis, Spanish inflation also rose by 5.6% in November, up from 5.4% in October, the INE data showed.

Core inflation, which strips out food and energy prices and is used by central banks as a monetary policy determinant, rose to 1.7%, its highest since July 2013.
The European Central Bank believes euro zone inflation will have peaked in November and is set to gradually slow next year as supply bottlenecks and the energy crunch ease, according to board member Isabel Schnabel.

German inflation surged more than expected in November, complicating the European Central Bank’s mission to convince consumers that the current spike will soon ease.
Prices increased an annual 6% under a European-Union harmonized measure. A national gauge rose to 5.2%, the highest since 1992. 
German bonds extend declines slightly, pushing the 10-year yield four basis points higher to minus 0.30%.
Earlier on Monday, Spain reported a rate of 5.6% that was bolstered by more expensive food. Prices in Belgium jumped 5.6%. Data for the euro area due Tuesday are set to show a 4.5% gain.
Inflation rates far exceeding the ECB’s 2% goal across vast parts of the region have prompted officials including President Christine Lagarde to reassure citizens that price pressures won’t run out of control. A large portion, they argue, is due to temporary factors that will fade with time.
Executive Board member Isabel Schnabel attempted to assuage concerns in Germany this morning, explaining in a TV interview that “November will prove to be the peak.” 
The Bundesbank warned last week that inflation could climb to just under 6% this month, and attributed about 1 1/2 percentage points to a temporary cut in value-added tax and very low prices for travel-related services in 2020.
While the central bank predicts price pressures will retreat in coming months, it said inflation could remain well above 3% for a longer period of time.
Price Spiral
Employees of Germany’s federal states won a 2.8% raise and a tax-free one-time payment of 1,300 euros ($1,467.1) on Monday, in a deal that will ultimately cover nearly 3.5 million people. Meanwhile, Olaf Scholz’s new government is planning to lift the country’s minimum wage to 12 euros toward the end of next year. 
Both could have consequences that might be difficult to ignore. One reason officials have been able to classify the current inflation spike as “temporary” is that secondary effects have failed to materialize so far. 
Schnabel, a contender to succeed Jens Weidmann at the helm of the Bundesbank when he leaves at the end of the year, told Bloomberg last week that inflation risks are “skewed to the upside.” It’s a signal she might push for a faster than currently anticipated reduction in monetary stimulus when the ECB gathers in December.
Both the Council of Economic Advisers and Germany’s national tabloid Bild have issued warnings on ultra-loose monetary policy.
The ECB is set to determine next month whether its pandemic bond-buying program will end in March as planned, and how an older asset-purchase plan might need to be adjusted to address lingering uncertainty. The emergence of the new Omicron coronavirus strain risks new containment measures after the Netherlands and Germany already imposed new curbs and Austria and Slovakia went into lockdown.

Preliminary data from North-Rhine Westphalia, Bavaria, Hesse, Brandenburg and Saxony showed that consumer price inflation (CPI) rose in a range between 5.0-5.7% on the month in November.
The pan-German inflation data for Europe's largest economy is due later on Monday (1300 GMT).
A Reuters poll of analysts points to an overall CPI increase of 5% for Germany in November, which would be the highest rate since September 1992.

""There is no sign of the hoped-for relief,"" said Klaus Wohlrabe, director of the Munich-based institute, warning that the constraints would feed through into prices.
""Never have so many companies said they plan to raise prices,"" Wohlrabe added. 

The Munich-based institute said its survey of German companies had found sharper supply constraints in all sectors except the electrical equipment sector, where the share of firms reporting problems slipped from 90% to 85%.
It remained one of the most severely affected sectors, along with the machine building sector, where 86% reported problems, and the auto sector, where 88% had problems. The sector least affected was drinks manufacturing, where only 40% reported bottlenecks.

The official manufacturing Purchasing Manager's Index (PMI) is expected to rise to 49.6 in November, up from 49.2 in October, according to the median forecast of 29 economists polled by Reuters on Monday. A reading below 50 indicates contraction from the previous month.
Analysts have attributed the shallower contraction to the post-holiday uptick in production and the easing power cuts across most parts of the nation, although factors such as high raw material prices, a slowdown in the property sector and supply shortages continue to hamper the post-COVID recovery.
""We expect the NBS manufacturing PMI to stay in contraction territory at 49.6 in November versus 49.2 previously, as evidenced by still weak heavy industry manufacturing operation rates,"" said Jian Chang, chief China economist at  Barclays  (LON:BARC), in a note on Friday.
The world's second-largest economy, which staged an impressive rebound from last year's pandemic slump, has lost momentum since the second half as it grapples with a slowing manufacturing sector, debt problems in the property market and COVID-19 outbreaks. Analysts expect a further slowdown in fourth quarter gross domestic product (GDP) growth.
Power cuts have eased after policymakers moved to crack down on record-high coal prices. The State Grid Corporation said on Nov. 7 that power rationing has ended in most parts of the nation, except for temporary curbs on high-emission industries in some provinces.
Premier Li Keqiang last week acknowledged that China's economy faces new downward pressures but said authorities should avoid an ""aggressive"" one-size-fits-all approach.
China's central bank will likely move cautiously on loosening monetary policy to bolster the economy, as slowing economic growth and soaring factory inflation fuel concerns over stagflation, policy sources said.
Factory gate inflation hit a 26-year high in October, further squeezing profit margins for producers and heightening stagflation concerns.

The official PMI, which largely focuses on big and state-owned firms, and its sister survey on the services sector, will be released on Tuesday.
The private Caixin manufacturing PMI will be published on Wednesday. Analysts expect the headline reading will edge down slightly to 50.5 from 50.6 the previous month.

927,By Bloomberg,"<span>Nov 28, 2021 09:45PM ET</span>",China’s Economy Likely Remained Weak as Factories Slump,"(Bloomberg) -- China’s manufacturing activity likely remained subdued in November, with weak domestic demand in the economy outweighing any relief that came from an easing in energy shortages.
The official manufacturing purchasing managers’ index is forecast to improve slightly to 49.7 from 49.2 in October when it’s released Tuesday, according to the median estimate in a Bloomberg survey of economists. That would be the third month it stays below the key 50-mark, indicating a contraction in production. 
The non-manufacturing gauge, which measures activity in the construction and services sectors, is forecast to fall to 51.5 from 52.4 in the previous month. 
China’s energy shortages, which ravaged factory production in September and October, likely eased this month as coal producers boosted output and inventories rose. However, the housing market crisis shows no signs of ending, and frequent Covid-19 outbreaks continue to curb consumption.
“Supply-side restrictions have improved marginally, so production likely rebounded somewhat,” said Xing Zhaopeng, senior China strategist at Australia & New Zealand Banking Group (OTC:ANZBY) Ltd. But there’s “not much positive signal on domestic demand,” which continued to weigh on activities, he said.
Economic growth is forecast to slow to 5.3% next year, according to a Bloomberg survey median, with some economists seeing expansion as low as 4%. Bloomberg Economics forecast growth will come in at 5.7%, as the government will likely target a 5-6% range.
What Bloomberg Economics Says...
“In 2021, policy played a secondary role in setting the growth trajectory. In 2022, it will be pivotal. The extent of the slowdown will hinge largely on what balance China strikes between supporting short-term growth and advancing long-term reforms.
...We see the People’s Bank of China cutting the interest rate on its one-year medium-term lending facility by 20 basis points and the reserve requirement ratio by 100-150 bps by end-2022.”

Authorities are trying to moderate the sharp downturn in the property market, while providing targeted support to areas such as small businesses and green technology. Officials will reveal more clues on how much policy easing they plan to provide during two key political meetings in December by the Politburo and the Central Economic Work Conference.
China will adopt a more proactive macroeconomic policy next year to respond to the challenges from an uneven recovery of the global economy and instability in containing the pandemic, the Securities Times, run by the People’s Daily, said in a front-page commentary Monday. 
Authorities have exercised restraint in using monetary and fiscal tools amid an economic slowdown this year, thus creating sufficient space for policy maneuvering next year, according to the commentary.
The slowdown is being cushioned by strong export demand, which likely remained solid in November, judging by latest shipment figures from South Korea.
Consumption and travel continues to be affected by a resurgence in virus cases and the country’s growing determination to stick to its strict Covid Zero strategy. Subway passenger traffic in six major cities of China declined less than 10% in November from October, though the plunge is smaller than that over the August outbreak, according to Xing.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's retail sales rose for the first time in three months in October, though less than expected, and the underlying private consumption trend pointed to persistent strains on a fragile economic recovery despite an easing of COVID-19 curbs.
Following a larger-than-expected contraction in July-September, analysts expect the world's third-largest economy to rebound this quarter thanks to an upturn in household spending, while supply-side concerns still loom for export-reliant businesses.
""However, as people are still wary of another virus wave, they're not going out and spending actively,"" said Masato Koike, senior economist at Dai-ichi Life Research Institute, adding that stagnant wage growth is an additional headwind to fostering solid consumption growth.
Retail sales rose 0.9% in October from a year earlier, government data showed on Monday, versus the median market forecast for a 1.1% increase. It followed an upwardly revised 0.5% drop in September.
A 25.9% surge in fuel sales due to rising petroleum product prices boosted the headline retail figure, while sales of goods other than fuel fell 1.2% year-on-year. Worryingly, car sales were down 19.5% from a year earlier, the biggest monthly drop since January 2011, dragged down by supply constraints, according to a government official.
Compared with the previous month, retail sales grew 1.1% on a seasonally adjusted basis in October, following an upwardly revised 2.8% gain in September.
Japan has eased coronavirus restrictions on restaurant hours, large-scale events and border controls as infections have fallen dramatically and more than three-fourths of its population is fully vaccinated.
Private-sector statistics, however, had shown the comeback of consumer spending was gradual in October, and analysts said a full recovery in sectors hit hard by the pandemic such as face-to-face services will take longer time.

""Indeed, there are signs that consumers are finally shedding their caution as mobility only started to surpass its 2020 level in November,"" said Marcel Thieliant, senior Japan economist at Capital Economics. ""Spending on services should finally start to recover in earnest now.""
To boost Japan's lukewarm economic recovery, the government earlier this month announced a record $490 billion stimulus package, including cash payouts to households with children and subsidies to COVID-hit businesses.

A survey by the HDE retail association showed that only 20% of 350 companies asked were satisfied with Christmas sales so far. November and December are normally the strongest months of the year for retailers 
""The retail sector managed to defy increasingly difficult conditions, including higher inflation, rising infection numbers and supply bottlenecks until November,"" said HDE Managing Director Stefan Genth. 
""However, the consequences of the dramatic worsening of the coronavirus crisis have hit the retail trade in the past week,"" he added. 
Controls in shops, such as checks of vaccination certificates, were putting customers off, said Genth, adding he wanted fewer restrictions in shops as masks and air filters were effective.
Earlier this month, the HDE said it expected Christmas sales to rise 2% from last year to 111.7 billion euros.

Germany is struggling to contain a fourth wave of the coronavirus with 44,401 new cases registered on Sunday, according to the Robert Koch Institute for infectious diseases.

Profits in October rose 24.6% from a year earlier to 818.7 billion yuan ($128.1 billion), the official data showed, quickening from a 16.3% gain reported in September.
For the January-October period, industrial firms' profits rose 42.2% year-on-year to 7.2 trillion yuan, slower than a 44.7% rise in the first nine months of 2021.
The industrial profit data covers large firms with annual revenues of over 20 million yuan from their main operations.
Government efforts to ensure supply and stabilize prices helped companies mitigate difficulties, which in turned helped improve production conditions and profits, said Zhu Hong a senior statistician at the National Bureau of Statistics.
However, he said profit differentiation between upstream and downstream industries had not significantly improved, with downstream industries still facing pressures on their profitability. 
Prices in China have surged amid a power crunch and Beijing has been trying to cool a red-hot market for coal, the country's main fuel for power generation.
However, an official from China's state planner said last Sunday that ""energy prices including, coal prices have fallen significantly"" and have pushed down prices for steel, aluminium, pulp, PVC and coal chemical products.
The world's second-largest economy staged an impressive rebound from last year's pandemic slump, but has since lost momentum as it grapples with a slowing manufacturing sector, debt problems in the property market and COVID-19 outbreaks.
China's industrial output grew faster than expected in October but remained the second lowest print this year.
On Friday, China's Ministry of Industry and Information (MIIT) Technology held a meeting with representatives from industry associations and companies including Aluminium Corp of China and China Minmetals Corp to discuss issues in the raw materials industry, it said in a Saturday statement https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s?__biz=MjM5OTUwMTc2OA%3D%3D&chksm=bcceef758bb96663e8cba531059c8e1213df7038f152d88160993661a7aed8e0bf8d8adc1588&idx=1∣=2650850770&sn=6ad1c65239e97b019f1d62b58fe7f9cd#rd on its official WeChat account. 
The development of the upstream and downstream should be better coordinated to ensure the stability of the supply chain, and the industry's risk response capabilities should be strengthened to prevent ""grey rhino"" and ""black swan"" incidents, it quoted MIIT vice minister Wang Jiangping as saying.

ZURICH (Reuters) -The Swiss economy grew by a weaker-than-expected 1.7% during the third quarter, the government said on Friday, as it braces for a further downturn from the widening COVID-19 pandemic and ongoing supply chain shortages.
Growth between July and September, before the recent surge in coronavirus cases, decelerated from the 1.8% increase during the second quarter, and was below the 2.0% estimate in a Refinitiv forecast. [S8N2NQ00T]
A worsening situation at home, increased restrictions abroad and the difficulty for companies to get parts and raw materials because of jammed supply chains, means economic development is likely to decelerate further during the fourth quarter.
The catch-up effect from previous months is also starting to fade, said Ronald Indergand, an economist at the State Secretariat for Economic Affairs (SECO), which released the figures on Friday.
""There are significant headwinds, particularly related to the pandemic development in other countries which have triggered new lockdowns and also if Switzerland would substantially tighten its own restrictions,"" Indergand told Reuters.
Earlier this week, the government decided to hold off on new national restrictions, instead appealing to common sense and local measures to stem the rise in cases. 
So far, the Swiss economy had recovered relatively well, with GDP now 1% higher in the third quarter than in fourth quarter of 2019, SECO said.
The government agency is due to give its latest forecasts for 2021, 2022 and 2023 on Dec. 9. Previously it has forecast economic growth of 3.2% for 2021 and 3.4% in 2022.

Big risks remain, particularly related to the pandemic, Indergand said. Supply chain problems are expected to weigh for a few more quarters.
""We think the recovery is going to continue in 2022, but it's going to be bumpy,"" said Indergand. ""Up to this current moment, I don’t think we have to revise our forecast down massively, but the risk is clearly downward for 2022.""

The prices eased 0.9% in October from September, compared to a revised 0.03% fall in September. 
Home prices had risen for eight months before that to hit historical highs, levels that were last seen in May 2019 before the pandemic and anti-government mass protests in the city. 
Property agents said buyers turned more cautious before the policy address delivered in October, worried that some drastic housing policy would be introduced to curb the sky-high property prices. 
But after little substantial was announced, buyers became active again, with transaction volume in November increasing up to 40%, they added. 
At the centre of plans to tackle the city's housing shortage announced by leader Carrie Lam last month was a long-term goal to build a Northern Metropolis on the border with the mainland's technology hub of Shenzhen, covering 300 square kilometres.
""Afterall, supply is still limited in Hong Kong, and the economic and employment recovery has helped to support the property market,"" said Derek Chan, head of research at realtor Ricacorp.

He expected November home prices would be flat or post a small gain, and the gain may extend in December if the border with mainland China reopens. 
Investors have been envisioning a much delayed reopen of border will boost local economy and property demand. Local media reported the reopening could likely to come in early December but the Hong Kong government has not given a precise timing.

Sales surged 4.9% in October from a month earlier, when they rose 1.3%, and more than doubled economists’ forecast of a 2.2% gain, Australian Bureau of Statistics data showed Friday. That was the biggest rise since November 2020.
“Australians coming out of lockdown have well and truly hit the pavement, ditching the loungewear, refreshing their wardrobe and heading out to enjoy cafes and restaurants,” said Jo Masters, chief economist at Ernst & Young LLP. The result “is yet another sign that the economy is roaring back,” she said.
 
Strong consumer spending, together with high job vacancies and firms boosting investment intentions help explain why markets believe the Reserve Bank’s first interest-rate increase is only a matter of months away. Traders are pricing in an initial 15 basis-point hike to take the cash rate to 0.25% in May and then at least two more quarter-point increases over the rest of 2022.
The central bank is also optimistic about the outlook for the A$2 trillion ($1.4 trillion) economy, predicting a brisk 5.5% expansion next year. But it sees price pressures taking longer to build, with core inflation only expected to reach the 2.5% midpoint of the RBA’s target in late-2023. 
That’s a key reason why Governor Philip Lowe has repeatedly dismissed aggressive market pricing and signaled the tightening cycle is only likely to begin in about two years’ time.
“It looks like a sharp rebound is unfolding in the fourth quarter,”  said Andrew Ticehurst, a rates strategist at  Nomura Holdings  (NYSE:NMR) Inc. in Sydney. He reiterated his view that the RBA’s first rate hike will come in November 2022, while bringing forward his expectation on the timing of the central bank ending quantitative easing to May from August previously.
The RBA will review its bond buying program -- currently running at A$4 billion a week -- at its Feb. 1 meeting. 
Some economists see the potential for the bank to scrap the program altogether in February, particularly with the Federal Reserve expected to begin scaling back its asset purchases at a faster pace as it contends with escalating U.S. inflation.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australian retail sales rebounded with a bang in October as the lifting of many stay-at-home restrictions unleashed a wave of pent-up shopping, further evidence the economy is recovering rapidly from a pandemic-induced slump.
Data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics out on Friday showed retail sales jumped 4.9% in October to A$31.1 billion ($22.31 billion), extending September's already strong 1.7% bounce.
That was almost double market forecasts of a 2.5% rise, with clothing stores boasting gains of almost 28%; department stores 22% and restaurants 12%.
The cash splash means the A$360 billion retail sector will make a major contribution to economic growth.
""Real consumer spending could bounce back by 10% this quarter, leaving it very close to its pre-Delta peak,"" said Marcel Thieliant, a senior economist at Capital Economics. 
""And with the household savings rate still very high, consumption will continue to expand at a rapid pace next year.""
Signs are the splurge has continued as national vaccination rates of 86% allowed Sydney and Melbourne to reopen with almost no restrictions.
Spending on bank cards this month is running around 10 percentage points above pre-pandemic levels and online retailers are flagging a bumper Black Friday as the Christmas shopping season gets into full swing.
""With reopening rebounds in full swing and risks of shortages and delivery delays encouraging people to shop early, this year looks set to be stronger still,"" said Matthew Hassan, a senior economist at Westpac.
That is a welcome boost to the economy given household consumption accounts for around 55% of gross domestic product and was the main casualty of lockdowns in the third quarter.
The official GDP report is out next week and could show a fall of around 3% in the third quarter, though Australia's strong export performance will offset some of the pain.
Analysts at CBA estimate the economy shrank 3.5% in the quarter, which would be the second-largest fall on record, while Westpac has upgraded its forecast to a contraction of 2.5% from a previous prediction of a 4.0% dive.
""The GDP report will be another release for the history books as around half the country was in lockdown,"" said Gareth Aird, CBA's head of Australian economics.

""Yet the landscape has changed markedly as vaccination rates are exceptionally high, lockdowns are over and the economy is once again starting to fire on all cylinders.""

938,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 25, 2021 07:25PM ET</span>",Tokyo core consumer prices rise at fastest pace in more than a year,"TOKYO (Reuters) - Core consumer prices in Tokyo rose at the fastest pace in over a year in November, data showed on Friday, as electricity and fuel costs surged due to higher global energy prices and the costs of overnight stays jumped.
The uptick in prices highlights the chance nationwide inflation will pick up in coming months as pressures from raw material shortages gradually pass through to retailers to consumers.
The core consumer price index (CPI) for Japan's capital, which includes oil products but excludes fresh food prices, rose 0.3% in November compared with a year earlier, government data showed.
That marked the fastest year-on-year rise since July last year, when the index gained 0.4%, but was slightly weaker than a median market forecast for a 0.4% gain.
The Tokyo index, which is considered a leading indicator of nationwide price trends, was pushed up by the biggest year-on-year jump in energy prices in over eight years as well as the fastest rise in fuel costs in more than four decades.
It was also impacted by a 57.6% year-on-year increase in accommodation costs, which was flattered by the low base effects of various travel-related discounts offered by the government last year.

The cost of tuna and other fresh fish also rose, likely due to soaring fuel costs as well as stronger domestic demand, a government official said, though they are not included in the core consumer price index.
Nationwide consumer inflation in Japan has barely risen even as other major economies, such as the United States, are worrying about the risk of too-high inflation after their economies opened up from pandemic-induced lockdowns.

A total of 64,729 cars rolled off British production lines, data from the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) showed on Friday.
The fall reflected the global supply chain problems and Honda's permanent closure of its factory in late July. 
Car output in the first 10 months of the year stood at 721,505 vehicles, down 2.9% on 2020 when sites were closed for months as the coronavirus pandemic hit Britain.

BERLIN (Reuters) - A surge in coronavirus infections in Germany is weighing on consumer morale in Europe's largest economy, dampening business prospects in the Christmas shopping season and threatening to kick away its last remaining pillar of growth.
The GfK institute said on Thursday its consumer sentiment index, based on a survey of around 2,000 Germans, fell to -1.6 points heading into December, from a revised 1.0 points a month earlier.
The December reading was the lowest since June and compared with a Reuters forecast for a smaller drop to -0.5.
The survey was followed by detailed gross domestic product data which showed household spending was the sole driver of a weaker-than-expected economic expansion in the third quarter, more than offsetting a drop in company investments and state consumption over the summer.
Gross domestic product in Europe's largest economy grew by 1.7% quarter-on-quarter in adjusted terms from July to September, the Federal Statistics Office said. That fell short of a flash estimate of 1.8% published last month.
The data marked a slowdown in German growth from an upwardly revised expansion of 2% from April to June. The economy shrank by 1.9% on the quarter in the first three months of the year.
A 6.2% jump in consumer spending in July-September from the prior three months contributed 3 percentage points to the overall growth rate in the third quarter.
""This is due to catch-up effects in the service sector. Restaurants, bars and the hotel industry in particular benefited,"" VP Bank Group analyst Thomas Gitzel said.
But Gitzel added that persistent supply bottlenecks in manufacturing were holding back overall growth, which could be seen in weaker investment activity by companies in machinery and buildings in the third quarter.
State spending also fell on the quarter, further pushing down the headline GDP figure.
A jump in new coronavirus infections over the past weeks is now threatening to kick away Germany's last remaining pillar of growth in the final quarter.
""The consequences of the pandemic are causing a kind of stop-and-go growth,"" Gitzel said.
GfK economist Rolf Buerkl said the fourth wave in the COVID-19 pandemic, with infection rates rising rapidly and hospitals reaching capacity limits, was causing concerns that more restrictions for shops and restaurants would follow.
Inflation rates of more than 4% were also hurting the purchasing power of consumers, he said.

""Together, this is all dampening the business prospects for the upcoming Christmas shopping season,"" Buerkl said.
Consumers' expectations for their personal income and the development of the economy both deteriorated. This pushed down the propensity to buy to a nine-month low.

The CBI said its monthly retail sales balance - which looks at whether retailers think annual sales growth is rising or falling - rose to a three-month high of +39 in November from +30 in October.
But a separate measure of sales for the time of year leapt to +35 from -1, its highest since September 2015.
""Christmas seems to have come early for retailers, with clothing and department stores in particular seeing a big upward swing in sales volumes in November,"" CBI economist Ben Jones said.
Although the survey of retailers indicated stock levels were adequate for the first time in seven months, previous shortages of some goods appeared to have made shoppers want to make their purchases earlier this year, he added.
The most recent official data, for October, showed retail sales rose on the month for the first time since April. British retail sales surged in March and April when shops reopened after a lockdown, but then fell steadily as other businesses reopened and consumers faced a wider range of spending options. 
The data also add to evidence of surging price pressures in Britain, which may push the Bank of England to raise interest rates next month for the first time since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Retailers reported the most widespread rise in prices since May 1990, and expected a similar increase for the following month.

Employment in the sector - which has been under long-term pressure from online retail - also rose for the first time since November 2016.
""Overall, retailers are becoming more optimistic, with both employment growth and investment intentions picking up strongly. Cost pressures remain a very real concern, however,"" Jones said.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australian business investment slipped in the third quarter as pandemic lockdowns shut many firms, though future spending plans proved surprisingly resilient and a rapid recovery is expected now that most restrictions have been lifted.
Figures from the Australian Bureau of Statistics out on Thursday showed capital expenditure fell a real 2.2% in the third quarter to A$32.7 billion ($23.57 billion), in line with market forecasts of a 2.0% drop.
Spending plans for the year to end June 2022 were upgraded to A$138.6 billion, above most analysts' estimates and a sign business confidence had weathered the disruptions well.
""It suggests that spending this financial year will be over 10% higher than fiscal 2021, comfortably outstripping the levels seen in the three years prior to the pandemic,"" said Sarah Hunter, chief economist for BIS Oxford Economics.
""Construction, wholesale trade and transport, postal and warehousing led the way, reflecting the need to expand capacity to properly service the substantial shift to online retailing.""
For the third quarter, most of the pullback in investment came in plant and machinery with the retail and education sectors particularly hard hit by the lockdowns.
Data on gross domestic product (GDP) due next week is expected to show a sharp contraction given stay-at-home rules in Sydney and Melbourne hammered consumption during the quarter.
Yet with 86% of the adult population fully vaccinated, most restrictions are gone and spending has quickly ramped up as retailers count on a bumper Black Friday of sales this week.
Separate data on payrolls out on Thursday showed employment jumped sharply in the last two weeks of October, rounding out a strong month for the states of New South Wales and Victoria.
That pick up in jobs has yet to see much acceleration in wages growth which languished at an annual 2.2% in the third quarter, well short of consumer price inflation at 3%.
That is too slow for the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA), which wants to see wage growth running at 3%-plus before pulling the trigger on rate rises, something it doubts will happen until 2023 at the earliest.
Investors are wagering the bank is behind the curve on inflation and will actually have to hike the 0.1% cash rate by June next year, if only to keep up with other central banks.

The services producer price index hit 105.4 in October, the highest since November 2001, Bank of Japan (BOJ) data showed on Thursday.
But the gain was far smaller than an 8.0% spike in wholesale goods inflation in October, suggesting slow wage growth will moderate any rise in consumer prices.
The key driver behind the October services price rise was transportation fees, as robust global demand for raw materials allowed shipping firms to pass on higher fuel costs to clients.
The cost of ocean freight transportation spiked 52.0% in October from a year earlier after a 34.9% gain in September, the data showed.
The pace of declines in hotel fees slowed to 2.9% in October from 7.4% in September, a sign consumption was picking up after the Sept. 30 lifting of curbs to combat the COVID-19 pandemic.
""Corporate services prices are recovering gradually, with some sectors showing demand picking up due to the lifting of curbs. But the move hasn't broadened much on lingering caution over the pandemic,"" Shigeru Shimizu, head of the BOJ's price statistics division, told a briefing.

Japan's economy has lagged other advanced nations in recovering from pandemic doldrums, discouraging firms from passing on higher raw material costs to consumers.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits dropped to a 52-year low last week, suggesting economic activity was accelerating as a year ravaged by shortages, high inflation and an unrelenting pandemic draws to a close.
The plunge in claims reported by the Labor Department on Wednesday was, however, exaggerated by difficulties adjusting the data for seasonal fluctuations this time of the year. Still, the labor market is tightening, with jobless rolls shrinking in mid-November to the smallest since March 2020 when the economy was in the grips of the first wave of COVID-19 infections.
The economy's strengthening tone was confirmed by other data showing strong consumer spending in October as well as business orders for equipment, excluding transportation. The goods trade deficit narrowed sharply last month as exports surged. 
But prices remained stubbornly high, with annual inflation jumping by the most in nearly 31 years. The raft of solid reports ahead of Thursday's Thanksgiving holiday prompted economists to boost their fourth-quarter growth estimates to as high as an 8.6% annualized rate.
""There might be some seasonal adjustment problems, but the handwriting is on the wall and all the anecdotal reports on how companies cannot find the help they need are true,"" said Christopher Rupkey, chief economist at FWDBONDS in New York.
""The economy will finish the year with a bang, there is lots to give thanks for."" 
Initial claims for state unemployment benefits tumbled 71,000 to a seasonally adjusted 199,000 for the week ended Nov. 20, the lowest level since mid-November 1969. 
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast 260,000 applications for the latest week. 
Unadjusted claims rose 18,187 to 258,622 last week amid a surge in Virginia, which offset declines in California, Kentucky and Missouri. More volatility is likely over the holiday season. 
""The claims series can be noisy and especially choppy around holidays like Thanksgiving when the seasonal factors anticipate large swings in the underlying data,"" said Daniel Silver, an economist at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) in New York. ""But even so, initial claims fell by more than a half million over the year through Nov. 20, both before and after seasonal adjustment.""
Claims have declined from a record high of 6.149 million in early April 2020, and are now viewed as consistent with a healthy labor market, though an acute shortage of workers caused by the pandemic is hindering faster job growth.
But there is hope for an expansion of the labor pool. The number of people continuing to receive benefits after an initial week of aid dropped 60,000 to 2.049 million in the week ended Nov. 13, a 20-month low, the claims report showed. 
Graphic: Claims for jobless benefits hit 5-decade low: https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-ECONOMY/zjvqkwbklvx/chart_eikon.jpg 
There were 10.4 million job openings as of the end of September. The workforce is down 3 million people from its pre-pandemic level, even as generous federal government-funded benefits have expired, schools have reopened for in-person learning and companies are raising wages.
Stocks on Wall Street fell. The dollar gained versus a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices rose.
BRIGHTENING PICTURE
Signs the economy was regaining momentum after hitting a speed bump in the July-September quarter as coronavirus cases flared up over summer and shortages became more widespread could result in the Federal Reserve quickly winding up its bond-buying program. 
Indeed, minutes of the U.S. central bank's Nov. 2-3 policy meeting published on Wednesday showed some Fed officials would be open to doing so.
""We see the Fed accelerating tapering in January to clear the runway for a September rate liftoff,"" said Lydia Boussour, lead U.S. economist at Oxford Economics in New York.
A separate report from the Commerce Department on Wednesday showed gross domestic product rose at a 2.1% rate in the third quarter. That was a slight upward revision from the 2.0% pace estimated in October, but was still the slowest in more than a year. The economy grew at a 6.7% rate in the second quarter. 
But that is all in the rear-view mirror. A third report from the Commerce Department showed consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, jumped 1.3% in October after rising 0.6% in September. 
Consumers, buoyed by rising wages and massive savings, bought motor vehicles and traveled, showing no signs yet of holding back because of high inflation.

Global economies' simultaneous recovery from the pandemic, fueled by trillions of dollars in relief money from governments, has strained supply chains, unleashing inflation. 
President Joe Biden announced on Tuesday that the United States would release 50 million barrels of crude from the U.S. Strategic Petroleum Reserve to help cool oil prices, in coordination with China, India, South Korea, Japan and Britain.
The personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index, excluding the volatile food and energy components, increased 0.4% last month after gaining 0.2% in September. In the 12 months through October, the so-called core PCE price index accelerated 4.1%. That was the largest gain since January 1991 and followed a 3.7% year-on-year advance in September. 
The core PCE price index is the Fed's preferred inflation measure for its flexible 2% target.
Adjusted for inflation, consumer spending rose a solid 0.7%.
In another boost to the economy, orders for non-defense capital goods excluding aircraft, a closely watched proxy for business spending plans, rose 0.6% last month, the Commerce Department said in a fourth report.
With corporate profits hitting a record high last quarter, businesses are likely to keep spending.
More goods were exported in October, sharply narrowing the goods trade deficit by 14.6% to $82.9 billion. If the trend holds, trade could contribute to GDP growth this quarter.

Wholesalers continued to rebuild inventories last month though motor vehicle shortages stymied progress by retailers, a fifth report showed.
Inventory accumulation, the key driver of GDP growth last quarter, will likely continue to support the economy. The strong data flow led the Atlanta Fed to raise its fourth-quarter GDP growth estimate to an 8.6% rate from an 8.2% pace. JPMorgan boosted its forecast to a 7.0% pace from a 5.0% rate.

The Commerce Department said on Wednesday that consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, jumped 1.3% last month after rising 0.6% in September. Spending was partially boosted by higher prices as demand continues to outpace supply.

Consumer spending is accelerating after slowing sharply in the third quarter as COVID-19 infections driven by the Delta variant flared up and shortages of goods became more widespread. Fears of empty shelves and paying even more for scarce goods have encouraged Americans to start their holiday shopping early.
Retailers expect holiday sales will be the best in years, but some economists are cautioning about downside risks to the rosy forecast. Coronavirus infections are rising again, which could prompt some consumers to cut back on spending on travel and entertainment, including dining out.
""Moreover, continued clogged supply chains and port delays could lead to product scarcities on shelves as cargo ships remain anchored offshore waiting to be unloaded at the large ports in Southern California,"" said Scott Anderson, chief
economist at Bank of the West in San Francisco. 
""Both scenarios have the potential to put a damper on these optimistic holiday sales projections.""

New home sales increased 0.4% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 745,000 units last month, the Commerce Department said on Wednesday. September's sales pace was revised down to 742,000 units from the previously reported 800,000 units. 
Sales rose in the densely populated South, as well as in the Midwest, but fell in the West and Northeast. 
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast new home sales, which account for more than 10% of U.S. home sales, unchanged at a rate of 800,000 units. Sales fell 23.1% on a year-on-year basis in October. They peaked at a rate of 993,000 units in January, which was the highest since the end of 2006.
Sales soared over the summer of last year amid an exodus from cities to suburbs and other low-density locations as Americans sought more spacious accommodations for home offices and online schooling during the pandemic. With vaccinations allowing workers to return to offices and schools to reopen for in-person learning, the pandemic tailwind is fading.
Still, demand for new homes remains underpinned by an acute shortage of previously owned houses on the market. 
The median new house price soared 17.5% in October to $407,700 from a year ago. There were 389,000 new homes on the market, up from 378,000 units in September. Houses under construction made up 62.2% of the inventory, with homes yet to be built accounting for about 28%. Builders are being constrained by shortages of materials and labor. 

The government reported last week that the backlog of houses yet to be constructed in October was the largest in 15 years. 
At October's sales pace it would take 6.3 months to clear the supply of houses on the market, up from 6.1 months in September.

By Michael Nienaber
BERLIN (Reuters) -German business morale deteriorated for the fifth month running in November as supply bottlenecks in manufacturing and a spike in coronavirus infections clouded the growth outlook for Europe's largest economy, a survey showed on Wednesday.
The Ifo institute said its business climate index fell to 96.5 from 97.7 in October. A Reuters poll of analysts had pointed to a November reading of 96.6.
""Supply bottlenecks and the fourth wave of the coronavirus are challenging German companies,"" Ifo President Clemens Fuest said.
Company executives were less satisfied with their current business situation and their expectations for the next six months were more pessimistic, the survey showed.
Despite record high orders, German carmakers and other manufacturers are forced to scale back production due to a lack of raw materials and intermediate goods such as microchips.
""Industrial production is suffering from the shortage of materials, and with the brutal fourth coronavirus wave, a well-known stress factor for the service sector is now being added,"" VP Bank analyst Thomas Gitzel said.
Gitzel said all signs were now pointing to a decline in overall economic output in the final quarter of this year.
Ifo economist Klaus Wohlrabe was a bit less gloomy, saying the economy was set to stagnate in the fourth quarter as supply chain bottlenecks showed no sign of easing up.
Wohlrabe told Reuters that the hospitality and tourism sectors were facing a tough few months ahead due to new restrictions across the country to stop the spike in COVID cases and protect hospitals from reaching capacity limits.
The German central bank warned on Monday that the economy could stagnate in the final quarter of this year as a lack of goods and labour as well as new restrictions to fight the pandemic might put an end to its fragile recovery.
The Ifo figures contrasted with a purchasing manager survey which had suggested on Tuesday that growth in Germany's private sector picked up slightly in November despite persistent supply bottlenecks and unusually high inflation.

Ralf Umlauf, an economist with Helaba bank, said Germany seemed to be hit harder by the supply bottlenecks than neighbouring France where business morale improved in November.
The grim outlook would be viewed by the European Central Bank as a confirmation of its cautious stance to leave as many policy options as possible on the table, regardless of rising inflation rates, Umlauf added.

Orders for non-defense capital goods excluding aircraft, a closely watched proxy for business spending plans, rose 0.6% last month, the Commerce Department said on Wednesday. These so-called core capital goods orders gained 1.3% in September.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast core capital goods orders climbing 0.5%. Part of the increase last month likely reflected higher prices amid global shortages of goods.
Shipments of core capital goods increased 0.3% last month after advancing 1.3% in September. Core capital goods shipments are used to calculate equipment spending in the GDP measurement.
Business spending on equipment contracted in the third quarter after four straight quarters of double-digit growth. It was weighed down a shortage of motor vehicles. A global shortage of semiconductors is undercutting motor vehicle production. 
Unfinished work continues to pile up at factories as manufacturers struggle with snarled supply chains. This, together with strong demand for goods even as spending reverts back to services, should keep manufacturing, which accounts for 12% of the economy, humming.
Orders for durable goods, items ranging from toasters to aircraft that are meant to last three years or more, fell 0.5% last month after declining 0.4% in September. 

They were depressed by a 2.6% drop in orders for transportation equipment, which followed a 2.8% decline in September. Motor vehicle orders rebounded 4.8% after falling 2.2% in September
Orders for the volatile civilian aircraft category tumbled 14.5% after plunging 31.2% in September. Boeing (NYSE:BA) reported on its website that it had received only 10 aircraft orders last month compared to 27 in September.

Inflation-adjusted gross domestic product increased at a 2.1% annualized rate during the period, compared with an initially reported 2%, Commerce Department data showed Wednesday. Consumer spending, which accounts for the majority of the economy, grew 1.7%.
Inventories added more than 2.1 percentage points to overall growth in the quarter. The median GDP estimate in a Bloomberg survey of economists had forecast a minor upward revision to 2.2%.
The report underscores how a combination of a surge in Covid-19 infections, supply shortages and labor constraints induced a sharp slowdown last quarter in personal consumption. Recent data, including stronger-than-expected October retail sales, suggest a re-acceleration of spending in the final three months of the year.
Headwinds remain, however. Rising prices and a collapse in consumer sentiment threaten to constrain household spending, and any worsening of the persistent transportation bottlenecks and supply chain challenges seen in recent months could further stifle growth.
The report also included the first read on business earnings for the period. Pretax corporate profits increased an annualized 4.3% from the prior quarter and were up nearly 21% from a year earlier. Amid rising labor and materials costs, companies have had great success in raising prices.

Initial unemployment claims in regular state programs fell by 71,000 to a seasonally adjusted 199,000 in the week ended Nov. 20, Labor Department data showed Wednesday. The median estimate in a Bloomberg survey of economists called for 260,000 applications.
However, the larger-than-expected drop may be explained by how the government adjusts the raw data for seasonal swings. Wrightson ICAP chief economist Lou Crandall pointed out in a recent note that seasonal factors were anticipating a smaller increase in unadjusted claims compared with the same time last year as the labor market was struggling to recover.
Before seasonal adjustments, last week’s initial jobless claims rose by about 18,000.
Claims stood at 216,000 at the end of February 2020 leading up to the onset of Covid-19 in the U.S., which pushed applications up to a peak of 6.1 million in early April 2020. They’ve since declined as the economy reopened more broadly and Americans returned to work. Also, federal pandemic unemployment benefits ended by Sept. 6 in all states.
Even so, millions of Americans are still choosing to sit on the sidelines, frustrating employers who are desperate to fill a near-record number of positions. Child care remains a serious issue for working parents, especially as Covid cases pick up again in many states and disrupt in-person learning.
The October jobs report showed payrolls increased 531,000 after large upward revisions to the prior two months. Economists are calling for another half a million to be added in November, which will be reported on Dec. 3.

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Singapore's economy is expected to grow about 7% in 2021, at the top of the official forecast range, and will expand at a slower pace next year as an uneven recovery continues across sectors, the government said on Wednesday.
The Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI) forecast the economy to grow 3% to 5% next year.
""The recovery of the various sectors of the economy is expected to remain uneven in 2022,"" said Gabriel Lim, permanent secretary for trade and industry.
He expects outward-oriented sectors such as manufacturing and wholesale trade to remain strong, while activity in aviation- and tourism-related sectors would remain below pre-COVID levels throughout 2022.
Gross domestic product (GDP) grew 7.1% year-on-year in the third quarter, the MTI said, higher than the 6.5% expansion seen in the government's advance estimate and analysts' expectations in a Reuters poll.
On a quarter-on-quarter seasonally-adjusted basis, the economy expanded 1.3% in the third quarter.
The small and open economy, which has fully vaccinated about 85% of its 5.45 million population, eased some COVID-19 safety measures this week and has opened quarantine-free travel lanes with several countries.
""Recovery has definitely started, the reopening borders and easing of mobility restrictions could help consumer facing sectors,"" Maybank Kim Eng economist Lee Ju Ye. ""But it's still going to be a slow pace of normalisation.""
The MTI said protracted supply disruptions alongside a stronger pickup in demand, as well as rising energy commodity prices, could lead to more persistent inflation.
External inflationary pressures are likely to remain elevated, while wage growth is expected to strengthen as the domestic labour market continues to recover.
Around the world, policymakers have turned their attention to inflationary risks from supply constraints and a recovery in the global economy.
Singapore's central bank tightened its monetary policy in a surprise move at its last meeting in October. At least five economists expect the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) to act again at its next policy meeting in April.
The MAS will carefully watch inflation dynamics and stay vigilant on price developments when it decides its next policy move, expected in April, Edward Robinson, its deputy managing director, told a media briefing.
Singapore kept its forecast for headline inflation to come in at about 2% this year, and average 1.5-2.5% in 2022.
Data this week showed Singapore's key price gauge rose by the fastest pace in nearly three years in October, mainly driven by higher services and food inflation, while headline inflation rose at the fastest pace since March 2013.

""If we continue to see the inflation overshoot past the first quarter of next year, and if all these supply chain disruptions don’t ease, the question is then potentially how aggressive (the tightening) may be,"" said Selena Ling, head of treasury research and strategy at OCBC, adding that she sees a ""very high probability"" for tightening in April.
The economy shrank a record 5.4% due to the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020.

Activity in the services sector also accelerated, expanding at the fastest pace in more than two years as economic conditions stabilised after a sharp decline in COVID-19 cases and deaths thanks to soaring vaccinations.
The au Jibun Bank Flash Japan Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) rose to a seasonally adjusted 54.2, its fastest pace of expansion since January 2018.
The reading, which was lifted by a pickup in overall output and new orders, compared to a final 53.2 in the previous month.
""Activity at Japanese private sector businesses rose for the second month running in November,"" said Usamah Bhatti, economist at IHS Markit, which compiles the survey.
Manufacturers' optimism for the year ahead eased slightly from the previous month, according to the survey, which also showed firms across sectors faced soaring price pressures. 
""Input prices across the private sector rose at the fastest pace for over 13 years with businesses attributing the rise to higher raw material, freight and staff costs amid shortages and deteriorating supplier performance,"" Bhatti said.
The au Jibun Bank Flash Services PMI Index improved to a seasonally adjusted 52.1 from the previous month's final of 50.7, putting it more firmly into expansion territory.

The reading marked the fastest pace of growth since September 2019, which was just before a sales tax hike hit consumer confidence.

Data firm IHS Markit said on Tuesday its flash U.S. Composite PMI Output Index, which tracks the manufacturing and services sectors, fell to a reading of 56.5 in mid-November from 57.6 in October. A reading above 50 indicates growth in the private sector. 
The rate of growth remains above the survey's long-run pre-pandemic average, and is consistent with an economy that is regaining steam after a brief lull in the summer. 
The services sector accounted for the pull back in activity, with IHS Market noting ""some resistance to higher prices.""
Though many firms reported business was strong because of increased travel both domestic and international as well as the further easing of COVID-19 restrictions, the pace of growth slowed relative to previous months. 
""The U.S. economy continues to run hot,"" said Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit. ""However, the slowdown underscores how the economy is struggling to cope with ongoing supply constraints.""
The survey's measure of prices paid by businesses for inputs jumped to 78.1. That was the highest reading since the series started in 2009 and followed 74.1 in October. These higher prices are being passed on to consumers, indicating that inflation could remain uncomfortably high for a while.
Consumer prices surged in October, logging their biggest annual increase in 31 years.
A measure of employment at businesses was little changed in the first half of this month. There were 10.4 million job openings as of the end of September. 
Millions of Americans remain home even as generous federal government-funded unemployment benefits ended in early September, more people have been vaccinated against COVID-19 and companies are raising wages. The pandemic has also led to early retirements and career changes. 
The survey's flash services sector PMI fell to a reading of 57.0 early in the month from 58.7 in October. 
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast a reading of 59 in mid-November for the services sector, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity.
Unfinished work at the services industry businesses piled up at the second-fastest pace on record, IHS Markit said. 

Despite the supply constraints, manufacturing activity picked up, amid an influx of new orders. The survey's flash manufacturing PMI increased 59.1 from a reading of 58.4 in October. Economists had forecast the index for the sector, which accounts for 12% of the economy, climbing to 59. 
According to IHS Markit, difficulties securing inputs and finding affordable transportation for goods led to cost burdens rising at a record pace in mid-November. It noted that firms increased their selling prices at the second-steepest pace in more than 14-1/2 years.

LONDON (Reuters) -Euro zone business growth unexpectedly accelerated this month but another wave of coronavirus infections and new restrictions, alongside price pressures, are likely to put a dent in December's expansion, a survey showed on Tuesday.
IHS Markit's Flash Composite Purchasing Managers' Index, a good indicator of overall economic health, jumped to 55.8 in November from 54.2 in October.
That exceeded all forecasts in a Reuters poll which had predicted a drop to 53.2. Anything above 50 indicates growth.
""The flash PMI's for November surprised to the upside in the euro zone, France and Germany,"" said Rory Fennessy at Oxford Economics.
""However, with cases rising sharply in some euro zone countries, the near-term outlook is quickly turning more pessimistic as risks of another dangerous wave of coronavirus ramp up. A deterioration in sentiment in December is likely.""

French https://www.reuters.com/markets/europe/french-business-activity-stronger-than-forecast-nov-flash-pmi-2021-11-23 business activity also expanded faster than expected, initial estimates showed, as the services sector of the euro zone's second-biggest economy saw its quickest growth in almost four years.
But European stocks https://www.reuters.com/article/instant-article/idUSL4N2SE1KI slumped to three-week lows on Tuesday as the resurgence of COVID-19 cases and rate hike concerns knocked sentiment.

The BoE https://www.reuters.com/world/uk/bank-england-be-first-major-bank-hike-rates-probably-december-economists-2021-11-12 will be the first major central bank to raise interest rates but whether that initial increase comes as soon as next month or if it waits until early next year divided economists polled by Reuters earlier this month.
PRICE PRESSURES
Supply bottlenecks caused by the pandemic have made it a sellers' market for raw materials and the composite input prices index surged to 75.9 from 73.2, by far the highest since the survey began in mid-1998.
Still, a PMI for the bloc's dominant services industry rose to 56.6 from 54.6, well above all forecasts in a Reuters poll that had predicted a fall to 53.5.
But optimism waned as renewed lockdowns are likely to have a bigger impact on services. The business expectations index sunk to 66.6 from 69.0, its lowest reading since February.
Manufacturing activity remained robust and the factory PMI rose to 58.6 from 58.3. An index measuring output, which feeds into the composite PMI, increased to 53.8 from 53.3.
Demand remained strong and factories were able to pass on some of the record increase in raw material costs to customers. The output prices index jumped to 74.3 from 72.6, the highest since the IHS Markit began collecting the data 19 years ago.
""The surveys show price pressures remain intense, with the output prices PMIs for both manufacturing and services rising to their highest in almost two decades, consistent with our view that headline inflation will remain high for some time,"" said Jessica Hinds at Capital Economics.

The PMIs casts some doubt on the European Central Bank's claim the rise in inflation is transitory. Euro zone inflation expectations are at risk of continuing to overshoot the Bank's 2% target next year, according to a Reuters poll https://www.reuters.com/business/euro-zone-inflation-remain-above-ecbs-target-next-year-2021-11-12 earlier this month.
ECB board member Isabel Schnabel https://www.reuters.com/article/ecb-policy-schnabel-idUSKBN2I80FM told Bloomberg in an interview euro zone inflation would be higher next year than previously thought and there is a risk price growth could stay above the Bank's target in the medium term.

956,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 23, 2021 05:02AM ET</span>",UK business survey 'gives green light' for rate rise -IHS Markit,"By David Milliken
LONDON (Reuters) - British businesses reported the fastest growth in new orders since June this month alongside record cost pressures, according to a closely watched business survey that could pave the way for a Bank of England rate rise in December.
The IHS Markit/CIPS flash composite purchasing managers' index (PMI), published on Tuesday, edged down to 57.7 in November from October's final reading of 57.8. But that still indicated strong growth and was a shade higher than economists' average forecast in a Reuters poll.
""A combination of sustained buoyant business growth, further job market gains and record inflationary pressures gives a green light for interest rates to rise in December,"" Chris Williamson, chief business economist at financial data provider IHS Markit, said.
The Bank of England wrong-footed many investors at the start of this month by keeping rates at a rock-bottom 0.1%, after signalling an increase was on its way, because it wanted longer to assess the end of the government's furlough jobs support programme on Oct. 1.
Data since then has shown consumer price inflation hit a 10-year high of 4.2% in October, while businesses continued to hire strongly and vacancies rose to a record high.
The flash, or preliminary, PMI showed a drop in net hiring to its lowest since April, but IHS Markit said that reflected recruitment difficulties rather than a levelling-off of demand.
Rising wages, higher energy bills and other cost pressures caused input prices in the composite index to rise at the fastest rate since the series began in January 1998.
Separate, longer running PMIs for the services and manufacturing sectors also showed record rises in costs.
But some services businesses said clients were pushing back at the scale of price increases, and prices charged rose at a slightly slower pace than October's all-time high.
Orders rose, helped by reduced COVID-19 restrictions. While most coronavirus restrictions had been lifted in England by July, the more recent easing in travel restrictions was boosting services exports.

The BoE forecasts inflation will hit around 5% next year and its chief economist, Huw Pill, said on Friday that patience would be needed while it returned to its 2% target.
Higher interest rates will not mitigate the direct impact of a surge in energy prices and global supply-chain bottlenecks. But the BoE will hope they will reduce the chance of a spiral of wages and prices that could make higher inflation more permanent.

Data compiler IHS Markit said on Tuesday that its flash purchasing managers index (PMI) for the French services sector in November came in at 58.2 points, up from 56.6 in October.
The reading for the services sector beat a forecast for 56.0 points, and moved the index further above the 50-point threshold which marks an expansion in activity.
The flash PMI for the French manufacturing sector in November rose to 54.6 points, from 53.6 in October, also beating a forecast for 53.0 points.
The flash composite PMI index for November, which includes both the services and manufacturing sectors, rose to 56.3 points from 54.7 in October, beating a forecast for 53.6 points.
France's services industries benefited from new client contracts and higher workloads from existing customers, added IHS Markit, although supply-chain disruptions persisted.

""Having embarked on a clear period of slowing growth in the months leading up to October, the flash PMI data for November showed a fresh acceleration in French economic expansion,"" said IHS Markit senior economist Joe Hayes.
""However, the driving force behind improvements in the data is services. Manufacturers are still struggling with component shortages, long lead times and subdued demand conditions,"" added Hayes.

IHS Markit's flash Germany composite purchasing managers' index rose to 52.8, a two-month high, from 52.0 in October. This was stronger than a Reuters poll of analysts who had predicted a decline to 51.0 in November. A reading above 50 marks growth in activity.
IHS Markit economist Lewis Cooper said the data showed that the slowdown in economic growth seen across Germany's private sector over the previous three months was levelling off.
Export orders in Europe's biggest economy showed a more resilient trend, but overall new work increased at the weakest rate since February.
The flash PMI for manufacturing edged down to 57.6, a 10-month low, from 57.8 in the previous month.
The services sector showed signs of better growth prospects despite a recent surge in COVID-19 infections, with the services PMI activity index rising to 53.4, a two-month high, from 52.4 in October.
Material shortages and supply chain issues, combined with higher energy and wage bills, led to an unprecedented rate of cost inflation which in turn led many firms to raise their own charges to a record degree, the survey showed.

""This subsequently knocked on to business confidence in November, with sentiment the lowest for over a year as many firms cited concerns around the pandemic, supply problems and price pressures,"" Cooper said.
The German central bank said on Monday that the economy could stagnate in the final quarter of this year as a lack of goods and labour as well as new restrictions to fight the coronavirus pandemic might put an end to its recent recovery.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. home sales unexpectedly rose in October, reaching their highest level in nine months, though higher prices amid tight supply continued to sideline first-time buyers from the market.
The report from the National Association of Realtors on Monday also showed an increase in the share of investors buying homes last month, likely reflecting growing demand for rental accommodation as the economy reverts to normal, thanks to vaccinations against COVID-19. 
""Home sales remain resilient given the extremely tight supply of homes for sale,"" said Shannon Brobst, an economist at Moody's (NYSE:MCO) Analytics in West Chester, Pennsylvania. ""Potential home buyers will continue to find it challenging to find a home that meets their budget.""
Existing home sales rose 0.8% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 6.34 million units last month. The second straight monthly increase lifted sales to their highest level since January. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast sales falling to a rate of 6.20 million units. 
Sales rose in the most affordable Midwest region and the densely populated South, but fell in the Northeast and were unchanged in the West, which is the most expensive region.
Home resales, which account for the bulk of U.S. home sales, dropped 5.8% on a year-on-year basis. The annual decline was, however, distorted by the surge in sales in October 2020. 
Last month's sales pace was well above the 5.64 million units sold in 2020 and 5.34 million units in 2019.
First-time buyers accounted for 29% of sales, up from 28% in September and down from 32% a year ago. Individual investors or second-home buyers made up 17% of transactions. That compared to 13% in September and 14% a year ago.
Stocks on Wall Street were trading higher, with the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq hitting record highs after President Joe Biden picked Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell to lead the U.S. central bank for a second term. The dollar rose against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices fell. 
Existing home sales: https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-STOCKS/dwvkremzepm/ehs.png 
EXPENSIVE HOMES 
Sales soared over the summer of last year amid an exodus from cities to suburbs and other low-density locations as Americans sought more spacious accommodations for home offices and online schooling during the pandemic. 
With vaccinations allowing workers to return to offices and schools to reopen for in-person learning, the pandemic tailwind has subsided. Sales have declined from a peak 6.73 million unit-pace in October 2020, but demand for housing remains strong and continues to run against modest supply. 
The median existing house price increased 13.1% from a year earlier to $353,900 in October. Sales were concentrated in the $250,000-$500,000 price range.
""While competition for homes has eased somewhat since the mania months earlier this year, competition is still fierce and prices are still rising at double-digit rates,"" said Robert Frick, corporate economist at Navy Federal Credit Union in Vienna, Virginia. ""The problem is especially acute for lower-income buyers given prices and home availability are still skewed toward higher-priced homes.""
There were 1.25 million previously owned homes on the market in October, down 12% from a year ago. Last month, properties typically stayed on the market for 18 days. That compared to 17 days in September and 21 days a year ago. Eighty-two percent of homes sold in October were on the market for less than a month.

Government data last week showed a sharp decline in single-family homebuilding in October and the largest backlog of houses yet to be constructed in 15 years because of shortages of materials and labor. That could boost housing inventory when the supply constraints ease.
At October's sales pace, it would take 2.4 months to exhaust the current inventory, down from 2.5 months a year ago. A six-to-seven-month supply is viewed as a healthy balance between supply and demand.

In its latest quarterly monetary policy report published Friday, the People’s Bank of China removed a few key phrases cited in previous reports, including sticking with “normal monetary policy.” That suggests a shift in stance toward more supportive monetary policy, according to economists at  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C).,  Nomura Holdings  (NYSE:NMR) Inc. and  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS).  
The report also dropped the phrase to “control the valve on money supply,” which suggests a step-up of monetary easing, according to Macquarie Group (OTC:MQBKY) Ltd.’s Larry Hu.
Any easing steps would likely be targeted toward small businesses and green finance, according to economists, similar to measures the PBOC has already taken in recent weeks, including 200 billion yuan ($31 billion) of financing for coal projects announced last week. 
Goldman Sachs’ Hui Shan and colleagues said policy interest rates would likely remain unchanged, while Nomura’s Lu Ting said the chance of a reduction in the reserve requirement ratio will rise in coming months.
“We expect Beijing to soon significantly step up its monetary easing and fiscal stimulus to counteract the increasing downward pressure,” Lu said.  
The PBOC’s quarterly report came on the same day that Premier Li Keqiang told a seminar China still faces “many challenges” in keeping the economy stable, although this year’s goals will likely be achieved.

Hungarian inflation surged to an annual 6.5% in October, above expectations and driven in part by a 30.7% increase in fuel prices, which prompted Prime Minister Viktor Orban's government to impose a three-month price cap.
Hungary's central bank, which expects inflation to exceed 7% in November, was forced to ramp up the pace of its monetary tightening campaign to rein in inflation and shore up the forint, which skirted its April 2020 all-time lows last week.
""All participants of the economy expect price rises,"" GKI said in its monthly survey, which showed business confidence rising to a 2-1/2-year-high, driven by stronger optimism in most branches of the economy except for services.
""However, consumer (confidence) fell to an extent rarely seen over the course of a single month, sending it to levels last seen in the spring,"" GKI said.
It said worries about unemployment increased significantly, even as the share of companies planning to boost hiring exceeded those of planning layoffs in all branches of the economy.
Companies were planning price rises, while consumer inflation expectations also jumped, the survey said. It said households as well as industrial and service sector businesses turned gloomier about prospects for the economy.

Customers were also more pessimistic about their financial and savings prospects in November, breaking a six-month period of improvement, the survey said.
Facing a closely fought election next year, Orban's government has showered the electorate with handouts, including a $2 billion income tax rebate for families and an extra month's worth of pensions.

The value of government land sales in October declined 13.14% from a year earlier to 573.7 billion yuan ($89.90 billion), after suffering a drop of 11.15% in September, according to Reuters calculations of data released by the finance ministry on Friday.
Many developers including China Evergrande Group have grown desperately short of cash since authorities last year unveiled the ""three red lines"" - a policy of President Xi Jinping that imposes limits on liabilities-to-assets, net debt-to-equity, and cash-to-short-term borrowing ratios.
Poor demand among developers at urban land auctions risks squeezing regional finances, pressuring local governments to scramble for other income to fund investment and support the economy, including the issuance of more bonds that increase their debt obligations, say some analysts.
""Declining land sales will constrain fiscal funding for infrastructure, leading Chinese regional and local governments to temporarily shift to debt-funded growth,"" Moody's (NYSE:MCO) said in a recent report.
Not all provinces and regions are equally dependent on land-sale revenue.
""The unevenness in regional growth will persist, with developed provinces continuing to perform better than less-developed ones,"" Moody's said.
China's government land-sale revenue grew 6.1% to 5.9371 trillion yuan ($930.29 billion) in January-October from a year earlier，data from the finance ministry showed, slowing from the 8.7% rise in the first nine months.
In February, the land regulator imposed restrictions on sales, allowing up to three auctions a year in 22 key cities including Beijing, Shanghai and Shenzhen, with the rules aimed at reining in rising land prices that could otherwise lead to higher home prices.
Private developers have bought at least 140.6 billion yuan of land in a completed round of auctions held by 22 major cities, down about 75% from 553.1 billion yuan in the first round of sales this year in March-June, according to a Reuters analysis of public notices on the sales.

China's property woes have worsened in recent months, with prices lower in both new and resale homes in October amid deeper contractions in construction starts and investment by developers, weighing on the overall economic outlook.

Norway began lifting its coronavirus lockdown measures in the second quarter and removed the final domestic restrictions by the end of September, allowing businesses to thrive and setting the stage for a sharp economic recovery.
""The growth in the third quarter is mainly due to service industries which have been hit hard during the pandemic,"" SSB economist Paal Sletten said in a statement.

The Norwegian central bank in September raised interest rates for the first time in two years and plans a series of rate hikes in the coming years.
The second-quarter mainland GDP reading was revised to 1.1% from 1.4% originally.

The unemployment rate edged up to 8.1% in the third quarter - the same rate seen at the end of 2019 - up from 8.0% in the previous three months, the INSEE statistics agency said.
Analysts polled by Reuters had forecast an unemployment rate of 7.8% for the third quarter.
As the French economy rebounds from the pandemic, a shortage of labour has emerged in some sectors as firms struggle to meet booming consumer demand.

However, the unemployment rate has not fallen in sync since there are also more people looking for work as people who sat on the sidelines during the crisis return to the labour market.
As consumer spending has bounced back following a mass vaccination campaign, the French government has raised its growth forecast several times this year and is currently expecting growth of 6.25%.

LONDON (Reuters) -Auction houses and shoppers seeking new clothes for the Christmas holidays lifted British retail sales last month by more than expected, adding to recent signs that a slowdown in the economy might have abated slightly.
Retail sales volumes rose by 0.8% month-on-month in October, the Office for National Statistics said. A Reuters poll of economists had pointed to a 0.5% increase.
Retail sales are now 5.8% above the level of February 2020, before the COVID-19 pandemic.
Auction houses were an especially strong driver of retail sales growth in October, the ONS said.
Last month a Banksy picture by British artist Banksy - which in 2018 was half-sliced by a shredder concealed in its frame when it was sold at auction - fetched 18.6 million pounds ($25.1 million) when it went back under the hammer in the same room in London.
Separate data showed the government borrowed more than expected last month although borrowing for the year to date is more than 100 billion pounds below its level in April-October 2020, when the economy felt the full force of the pandemic.
""The rebound in retail sales in October and the further improvement in the public finances will add to expectations that the Bank of England will raise interest rates from 0.10% to 0.25% in December,"" said Paul Dales, chief UK economist at consultancy Capital Economics.
With inflation surging, the BoE has said it will raise rates in the coming months if the evidence shows Britain's economy has not been impaired by the end of the COVID-19 job job-protecting furlough scheme, which closed last month.
The retail sales data - and an improvement in the GfK measure of consumer confidence this month - suggested the economy has not worsened of late after slower-than-expected growth in the third quarter.
The ONS said clothes sales rose by 6.2% in October, helped by an early Christmas trading boost to sales. Sports, games and toy stores also had a good month.
Separate data showed British public borrowing was higher than expected in October at 18.8 billion pounds, 200 million pounds lower than a year earlier and above economists' forecasts in a Reuters poll of a fall to 13.8 billion pounds.
Britain's government received record stamp duty land tax revenues from a surge in property purchases as a tax break came to an end, but corporation tax receipts were down due to a new investment incentive, the ONS said.

Monthly debt interest payments were also triple their level a year earlier at 5.6 billion pounds, reflecting higher payments on index-linked bonds due to a surge in inflation.

The median forecast from a poll of 13 economists expects export orders to jump 22% from the year-ago period. Forecasts for growth ranged from 15.8% to as high as 29%.
Taiwan's export orders are a leading indicator of demand for hi-tech gadgets and Asia's exports, and typically lead actual exports by two to three months.
The island's export orders, a bellwether of global technology demand, leapt 25.7% year-on-year to $62.9 billion in September, a historic high and stronger than expected on demand for new smartphones and chips.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Core consumer prices in Tokyo, a leading indicator of Japan's nationwide inflation, likely rose in November at the fastest pace in more than a year, a Reuters poll showed, a sign firms were starting to pass on higher energy and raw material costs.
The core consumer price index (CPI), which includes energy but excludes fresh food prices, was seen rising 0.4% in Japan's capital city in the year to November, the fastest pace of increase since July 2020, the poll of 17 economists showed. Tokyo's core CPI index rose 0.1% in October.
While such data would suggest a pick-up in Japan's nationwide core CPI, the latest reading of 0.1% in October was still well below the central bank's 2% target.
""Unlike in Europe and the United States, Japan hasn't seen a sharp rebound in demand after the lifting of COVID-19 curbs,"" said Takeshi Minami, chief economist at Norinchukin Research Institute. ""The inflation rate will likely accelerate, but only at a modest pace.""
Analysts expect Japan's consumer inflation to pick up in coming months due to rising fuel costs, but not as steeply as in other countries as weak household spending discourages firms from raising prices.
Bank of Japan Governor Haruhiko Kuroda said on Monday inflation will accelerate to around 1% in the first half of 2022 as the economy recovers to pre-pandemic levels.

That will still leave inflation well below the BOJ's target, suggesting the central bank is likely to maintain monetary policy ultra-loose.
The government will release the November Tokyo CPI data on Nov. 26 at 8:30 a.m. (Nov. 25, 2330 GMT).

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's core consumer prices rose for the second straight month in October, as fuel costs accelerated at the fastest pace in more than a decade and pressures from raw materials shortages gradually passed through to retailers.
Consumer inflation is expected to pick up in coming months due to higher fuel costs, though any price rises in the country will likely be moderate compared with other advanced economies as weak wage growth limits firms from passing on hikes.
The core consumer price index (CPI), which excludes volatile fresh food prices but includes fuel costs, rose 0.1% year-on-year in October, government data showed on Friday.
That matched the median forecast in a Reuters poll and followed a similar rise in September, which was the first uptick since March last year.
Overall energy prices soared 11.3% from a year earlier in October, posting their biggest rise since September 2008, thanks largely to a jump in fuel costs, which surged 21.4% year-on-year, their largest gain since August 2008.
The data will be among factors the Bank of Japan will scrutinise at its last policy meeting of the year, scheduled for the middle of next month.
""This is different from the stable price rises that the Bank of Japan is looking for,"" said Ayako Sera, market strategist at Sumitomo Mitsui (NYSE:SMFG) Trust Bank.
The soaring fuel prices were leading to cost pressures in daily life, she said. ""It's having absolutely a negative impact on the economy.""
Japan has found itself exposed to soaring global commodity prices, which led to the fastest rise in wholesale inflation in four decades in October. But core CPI has stayed near zero as weak consumption and wage growth keep firms from raising prices.
The government is set to unveil a record $488 billion spending package which is expected to include support for the agriculture, forestry and fisheries sectors and logistics firms to help them cope with soaring fuel costs.
BOJ Governor Haruhiko Kuroda said this week he expected inflation to accelerate to around 1% in the first half of next year as the economy recovers to pre-coronavirus levels, still far off its 2% target.

The central bank has stuck to massive monetary stimulus in its quest to have inflation reach that illustrious target, despite worries about the side-effects of prolonged low interest rates to banks' bottom lines.
Friday's data showed processed food and accommodation prices also rose, though the gain was more than offset by a record 53.6% year-on-year plunge in telecommunication fees as cellphone carriers cut charges.

Consumer prices, excluding those for fresh food, increased 0.1% compared with a year earlier, maintaining September’s pace, the ministry of internal affairs reported. The result matched the median forecast from analysts.
While Japan’s price gains are far less dramatic than those confronting consumers and central banks elsewhere, surging oil costs have become an issue. Chief Cabinet Secretary Hirokazu Matsuno last week signaled the country’s new government would offer support to fishing and transport businesses coping with higher fuel bills as part of its first economic package. The overall size of the package will total about $690 billion, according to a draft of the plan seen by Bloomberg.
Japan’s Kishida Eyes Record Fiscal Power in Economic Stimulus
Falling fees for phone service, which have dropped this year under government pressure, continue to weigh on prices. The fees fell 54% from 2020’s level, shaving 1.5 percentage point from overall prices.
Meanwhile, gasoline prices have climbed in recent weeks to the highest level in seven years. That adds a burden on households especially outside Japan’s big cities, who tend to drive more and are an important constituency of the ruling party.
More details:
Soaring commodity prices amid supply chain bottlenecks and a weaker yen are also squeezing many Japanese businesses, which are facing the strongest cost pressure in four decades. 
While most firms remain reluctant to pass their costs on to the country’s shoppers, who are known for being extremely sensitive to price increases after years of deflation and stagnant wages, there are some exceptions. Soy sauce maker Kikkoman Corp. last week announced a 10% hike on some products, citing higher costs for materials and logistics.

Kishida’s aid package is aimed at putting the economy back on track after it shrank last quarter on a resurgence of Covid and a shortage of semiconductors. Measures will likely include cash handouts for children and tax breaks for companies raising pay.
Bank of Japan Governor Haruhiko Kuroda this week told local business leaders he sees core inflation increasing gradually to about 1% around the middle of next year. With no immediate prospect of reaching the bank’s 2% inflation target, though, he said the BOJ needs to stick with its easing, even as other central banks change direction.

973,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 18, 2021 11:51AM ET</span>",U.S. economy regaining speed as unemployment claims fall; manufacturing surges,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits fell close to pre-pandemic levels last week as the labor market recovery continues, though a shortage of workers remains an obstacle to faster job growth.
The weekly unemployment claims report from the Labor Department on Thursday, the most timely data on the economy's health, also showed jobless benefits rolls declining to a 20-month low in early November. The economy is regaining momentum following a lull over the summer as a wave of COVID-19 infections driven by the Delta variant battered the nation.
""Demand for labor is very strong and workers are in short supply, so layoffs are very low right now,"" said Gus Faucher, chief economist at PNC Financial (NYSE:PNC) in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. 
Initial claims for state unemployment benefits slipped 1,000 to a seasonally adjusted 268,000 for the week ended Nov. 13. That was the lowest level since the start of the coronavirus pandemic in the United States more than 20 months ago.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast 260,000 applications in the latest week. The smaller decline was because the model that the government uses to strip out seasonal fluctuations from the data was less generous last week.
Unadjusted claims dropped 18,183 to 238,850. The decrease was led by Kentucky, likely due to automobile workers returning to factories after temporary layoffs as motor vehicle manufacturers deal with a global semiconductor shortage. There were also big declines in Michigan, Tennessee and Ohio, states that also have a strong presence of auto manufacturers. 
The decreases offset a surge in filings in California.
The seventh straight weekly decline left claims just above the 256,000 level in mid-March 2020, and in a range that is associated with a healthy labor market. Claims have declined from a record high of 6.149 million in early April 2020. 
Jobless claims: https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-STOCKS/egpbkaebgvq/joblessclaims.png 
The improving economic tone was matched by other data from the Philadelphia Federal Reserve on Thursday showing an acceleration in manufacturing activity in the mid-Atlantic region this month.
Factories in the region that covers eastern Pennsylvania, southern New Jersey and Delaware, reported strong order growth. They were upbeat about business conditions over the next six months and anticipated maintaining a strong pace of capital expenditures in 2022. But labor and raw material shortages persisted, leading to a rapid piling up of unfinished work, even as manufacturers increased hours for workers. 
Factories continued to face higher prices for inputs, which they passed on to consumers.
""We look for voracious goods demand and a plethora of unfilled orders to keep factories pumping out goods at a very healthy pace,"" said Oren Klachkin, lead U.S. economist at Oxford Economics in New York. ""We also expect that businesses will continue to face major supply-chain problems next year, though headwinds should start to ease in the second half of 2022.""
Stocks on Wall Street were lower. The dollar slipped against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury yields dipped.

TIGHT LABOR MARKET
The reports added to a surge in retail sales in October and a sharp rebound in production at factories in suggesting that economic activity accelerated early in the fourth quarter after gross domestic product increased at its slowest pace in more than a year in the July-September period.
Stronger growth could spill over into 2022, with a third report from the Conference Board showing its index of Leading Economic Indicators jumped 0.9% in October after gaining 0.1% in September. 
Leading indicators: https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-STOCKS/byvrjknbbve/leadingindicators.png 
The labor market is getting tighter. The number of people continuing to receive benefits after an initial week of aid dropped 129,000 to 2.080 million in the week ended Nov. 6, the claims report showed. That was also the lowest level since the mid-March in 2020. 
A total 3.185 million people were collecting unemployment checks under all programs during the week ended Oct. 30. Shrinking unemployment rolls raise hopes that more people will return to the labor force soon. 
Millions of unemployed Americans remain at home even after the expiration of generous federal government-funded benefits, the reopening of schools for in-person learning and companies raising wages.
The claims data covered the period during which the government surveyed business establishments for the nonfarm payrolls component of November's employment report. 
Claims have dropped since mid-October, which would suggest stronger employment growth this month. But workers are scarce, with 10.4 million job openings as of the end of September.

""There is some uncertainty as a key to monthly job growth is labor supply and the Delta variant,"" said Ryan Sweet, a senior economist at Moody's (NYSE:MCO) Analytics in West Chester, Pennsylvania. ""The good news is that the Delta variant's impact on the labor market in November will be less than that seen during the teeth of the recent wave."" 
The economy created 531,000 jobs in October. Employment growth has averaged 582,000 jobs per month this year and the labor force is down 3 million from its pre-pandemic level.

974,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 18, 2021 04:16AM ET</span>",Column: Forecasting fog as thick as ever,"By Jamie McGeever
ORLANDO, Fla. (Reuters) - If we still can't trust the numbers, should economic policymakers and investors just sit tight?
In early September, the New York Federal Reserve suspended its real-time, GDP growth tracker because the wildly distorted economic data of the immediate post-COVID world was simply unreliable. 
""The uncertainty around the pandemic and the consequent volatility in the data have posed a number of challenges to the Nowcast model,"" the New York Fed posted on its site.
While other major institutions have yet to follow suit, the world of economic forecasting remains largely in a state of suspended animation.
A government-mandated world recession is without modern historical precedent. There are no truly comparable models for economists, investors and policymakers to draw on, leaving huge uncertainties about the new world that emerges.
And the biggest casualties have been cyclical or trend-driven analysis which investors have been wedded to for decades.
Put bluntly, you have take any confident prediction of where employment, growth, and inflation are headed over the next year or two with a large pinch of salt.
A look at Citi's economic surprises indexes, which measure the extent to which incoming data is either beating or missing consensus forecasts, shows how erratic the numbers are. 
Between 2003 and February last year - before the onset of the pandemic - the average weekly change in the aggregate G10 surprises index was just 0.03 points. Since March 1 last year, that average change jumped to 0.3 - 10 times larger. 
The index's peaks and troughs have been far more extreme too, meaning the standard deviation of weekly surprises has more than doubled to 17 from 7.5. A low standard deviation shows that data are clustered around the average, and a high reading shows they are dispersed much more widely.
It's a similar pattern across individual economic areas. Comparable figures for the U.S. economic surprises index are lower, but are significantly higher for the euro area, where pandemic-era weekly surprises are 20 times greater than the average over the previous 17 years.
ACTION OR PATIENCE?
Of course, these numbers are heavily skewed by the initial lockdowns in the months following March 2020, which brought large parts of economic activity across the world to a juddering halt, and the surprisingly strong and quick rebound.
Willem Buiter, adjunct professor of international and public affairs at Columbia University and former Bank of England policymaker, agrees forecasting is far trickier now. 
""We have information, even if it is sometimes difficult to interpret. You just have to be more careful interpreting it because the normal cyclical patterns are up in the air, as indeed is our understanding of economic trends,"" he says.
That doesn't mean the textbooks should be rejected entirely, nor should it prevent policymakers from turning to them for guidance on where to turn next. Economic fundamentals still apply.
As Buiter puts it: ""We have to look up words that we haven't had to use before. But we know how to pronounce them.""
But the effects of the pandemic are still skewing the data, nowhere more so than inflation. It is the highest in decades and well above central bank targets in many parts of the world, elevated by supply bottlenecks, shortages, high food and energy prices, and yes, rising demand.
Buiter is part of a fast-growing phalanx of leading academics, financial market heavyweights and former policymakers urging the Fed to rethink its position that inflation is still ""transitory."" 
Before the Great Financial Crisis, the Fed would almost certainly be raising interest rates with annual inflation running at a 30-year high. But the scarring from 2007-09 runs deep, meaning the gap between rock-bottom policy rates and inflation has never been bigger. 

Similarly, the fog of uncertainty clouding visibility of post-pandemic economic data and the policy outlook has rarely been thicker either.
""Acting without clarity is risky,"" said San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly on Tuesday. ""In the face of unprecedented uncertainty, the best policy is recognizing the need to wait. Although this can be hard, in the end, patience is the bravest action we can take.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. single-family homebuilding tumbled in October while the number of houses authorized for construction but not yet started jumped to a 15-year high, underscoring the disruption to the housing market from an ongoing shortage of materials and labor.
Though the report from the Commerce Department on Wednesday showed an increase in permits for future homebuilding, the rise was concentrated in the volatile multi-family housing segment. This will do little to alleviate an acute shortage of houses on the market, which has led to record annual gains in home prices.
""Residential housing construction activity continues to flounder,"" said Christopher Rupkey, chief economist at FWDBONDS in New York. ""There are zoning problems, higher land costs, a lack of labor, and inflation has inflated the cost of raw building materials.""
Single-family housing starts, which account for the largest share of the housing market, dropped 3.9% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.039 million units last month. The fourth-straight monthly decline pushed starts to the lowest level since August 2020. Homebuilding fell in all four regions, with large decreases in the Northeast, Midwest and West.
The densely populated South, where the bulk of homebuilding occurs, reported a 1.8% drop in single-family starts. 
Graphic: Housing starts and building permits - https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-STOCKS/gkplgdqqjvb/hsbp.png 
Homebuilding has essentially been treading water this year as builders battle shortages and higher prices of raw materials. A survey from the National Association of Home Builders on Tuesday showed confidence among single-family homebuilders rose for the third straight month in November, but noted that ""supply-side challenges, including building material bottlenecks and lot and labor shortages, remain stubbornly persistent.""
Lumber, which is used for framing, remains expensive and prices for copper, another essential material in homebuilding, are high. In addition, there were about 333,000 job openings in the construction industry as of the end of September. Some household appliances are in short supply. 
Graphic: Construction job openings and hires - https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-ECONOMY/klvykdjlgvg/chart_eikon.jpg 
Construction costs jumped a record 12.3% year-on-year in October, according to producer price data published last week. 
The materials squeeze could ease during winter, a typically slow season for homebuilding in the Northeast and Midwest. Slowing demand for houses because of reduced affordability could also help to lessen the pressure on supply.
Residential investment contracted for a second consecutive quarter in the third quarter. It is likely to remain subdued in the final three months of the year.
""Supply-chain bottlenecks will likely limit construction activity in the short term, but the supply picture should look better in 2022,"" said Abbey Omodunbi, a senior economist at PNC Financial (NYSE:PNC) in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. ""Declining affordability and rising mortgage rates will soften demand in the next year.""
Stocks on Wall Street were trading lower. The dollar dipped against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices were higher.
BUILDING PERMITS RISE
Starts for buildings with five units or more increased 6.8% to a rate of 470,000 units last month. Workers returning to offices and schools reopening for in-person learning, thanks to COVID-19 vaccinations, are fueling demand for rental apartments.
With single-family homebuilding declining, overall housing starts slipped 0.7% to a rate of 1.520 million units in October.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast starts rebounding to a rate of 1.576 million units. 
Starts have declined from the 1.725 million unit-pace scaled in March, which was a more than 14-1/2-year high.
Still, homebuilding remains underpinned by a severe shortage of previously owned homes on the market, which has resulted in double-digit house price growth. 
The backlog of single-family houses authorized for construction but not yet started jumped 4.8% to a rate of 152,000 last month, the highest since August 2006. Permits for future homebuilding increased 4.0% to a rate of 1.650 million units in October. Single-family permits rose 2.7% to a rate of 1.069 million units, leaving them just above starts. 
Graphic: Delayed building starts - https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-ECONOMY/znvnekqqmpl/chart_eikon.jpg 
Permits for buildings with five units or more surged 6.5% to a rate of 528,000 units. Housing completions were unchanged at a rate of 1.242 million units. Single-family home completions dropped 1.7% to rate of 929,000 units.
The stock of single-family housing under construction increased 1.4% to a rate of 726,000 units last month, the highest since May 2007. Multi-family homes under construction rose to the highest level in more than 47 years. 

Over time the housing backlogs and more inventory could help to bring more homes on to the market and cool the house price inflation, which has sidelined some first-time buyers. A lot will, however, hinge on the supply of building materials and other inputs as well as labor.
""The recent slowdown in project completions has limited home sales in new communities,"" said Mark Vitner, a senior economist at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) in Charlotte, North Carolina. ""That said, the growing backlog of projects should keep builders busy for the next couple of years.""

OTTAWA (Reuters) -Canada's annual inflation rate accelerated again in October, matching a February 2003 high, led by sharp rises in gasoline and housing prices, data showed on Wednesday, with analysts expecting more heat ahead.
Inflation rose to 4.7%, in line with expectations, up from 4.4% in September, Statistics Canada data showed. It was the seventh consecutive month in which headline inflation topped the Bank of Canada's 1-3% control range.
Prices rose in all eight major component groups for the second month in a row. Analysts said that trend was likely to continue.

Rail access to Canada's largest port, the Port of Vancouver, has been cut off by deadly flooding and landslides in the West Coast province of British Columbia.
CPI common, which the central bank calls the best gauge of the economy's underperformance, was unchanged at 1.8%. 
""This doesn't change anything for the Bank of Canada. This is in line with their forecast,"" said Andrew Kelvin, chief Canada strategist at TD Securities, noting that while inflation is hot, economic growth has fallen short of the central bank's expectations.

977,By Bloomberg,"<span>Nov 17, 2021 09:27AM ET</span>",Americans Buy Goods Over Services as Virus Lingers,"(Bloomberg) -- American consumers are showing little sign of returning yet to their normal balance of spending on services over goods, with a heavy reliance on imported products, according to two indicators based on shipping data.
Flexport Inc.’s Post-Covid Indicator shows a reading of 123 for December, up from 122 in November and the 11th straight month above 100 -- the baseline set in mid-2020 to show how consumer spending patterns shifted after the initial coronavirus outbreaks and lockdowns.
For six decades before the pandemic, U.S. household spending on goods declined proportionately as Americans spent more on services. That trend flipped last year amid lockdowns and travel restrictions.
The Flexport index aims to pinpoint the return to pre-pandemic consumer behavior. It anticipates the goods-and-services shares of U.S. personal consumption expenditures as released by the Bureau of Economic Analysis, and also factors in data from the company’s shipper customers. Goods’ share of PCE averaged about 31% for four years preceding the Covid-19 pandemic, climbing to an average of 34% from June to October 2020.
Conventional wisdom holds that as the pandemic subsides, people will shift back to their usual amount of spending on services like leisure travel and restaurants, relieving pressure on strained global supply chains. Until that happens, the current demand patterns are “likely to leave spending on goods versus services well above pre-pandemic levels, contributing to continued logistics network congestion,” Flexport said on Wednesday.
Separately, the San Francisco-based company said its Trade Activity Forecast calls for growth of U.S. merchandise imports of 15% in the fourth quarter compared with a year earlier. “Looking further ahead, a slowdown in January and February linked to normal seasonality and the Lunar New Year holiday is expected to be followed by a renewed expansion in demand,” it said.

Seven of the 11 major markets rose, led by a 0.9% gain in Hamilton, Ontario. Prices were flat in Winnipeg and fell in Montreal, Vancouver and Ottawa-Gatineau. 

On an annual basis, the index was up 15.8%, decelerating for the second consecutive month after it notched record annual growth in August. Halifax led the annual index with a 30.3% gain, while Hamilton registered a 26.5% gain.
Canada's real estate agents on Monday reported higher home sales and prices in October from September, with hot buyer demand outpacing available supply.

LONDON (Reuters) - British inflation has hit a 10-year high as household energy bills rocket, bolstering expectations the Bank of England will raise interest rates in December just weeks after it rocked markets by keeping borrowing costs on hold.
Consumer prices rose by 4.2% in annual terms in October, leaping from a 3.1% increase in September, the Office for National Statistics said on Wednesday. 
The BoE and a Reuters poll of economists - none of whom predicted such a big jump - had pointed to a reading of 3.9%.
""Today's inflation data will reinforce the Bank of England's resolve to act,"" Yael Selfin, chief economist at KPMG UK, said.
The pound climbed briefly to a one-week high versus the U.S. dollar and a 21-month high against the euro. [GBP/]
Finance minister Rishi Sunak said rising inflation was not just a British problem and the government was taking action to offset the hit to spending power, even as it scales back most of its coronavirus emergency support.
Britain's inflation rate puts it in the middle of the pack among G7 countries, with annual U.S. consumer price inflation now running north of 6%.
Household energy bills were the biggest driver of inflation following the lifting of a regulatory cap on bills last month, with gas prices paid by consumers up 28.1% in the year to October.
British energy suppliers are grappling with soaring wholesale gas prices that have led to the collapse of a number of energy companies, forcing more than 2 million customers so far to switch providers - often on higher tariffs.
But prices rose across the board with second-hand cars among the biggest drivers of the inflation acceleration.
The BoE - which has a target of 2% inflation - has said higher borrowing costs can do nothing to influence energy prices. But some of its policymakers are concerned that high inflation could harm its credibility in the eyes of the public.
Forecasts by the BoE show it expects inflation to hit around 5% in the coming months before falling back.
The BoE looks poised to become the first of the world's major central banks to raise rates since the coronavirus pandemic swept the global economy. Investors and economists are increasingly predicting that will happen on Dec. 16.
On Monday BoE Governor Andrew Bailey said he was ""very uneasy"" about the inflation outlook and that his vote to keep rates on hold earlier this month had been a very close call.
Futures markets now fully price in a 15 basis-point rate hike in December, and show a roughly two-thirds chance of another 25 basis-point hike in February, taking Bank Rate to 0.5% from its current all-time low of 0.1%.
On Tuesday, data suggested Britain's labour market was withstanding the end of the government's job-protecting furlough scheme, a key factor for the BoE and its decision on rates.
Robert Alster, chief investment officer at wealth manager Close Brothers Asset Management, cautioned, however, against assuming a BoE rate hike next month was a done deal.
""Ultimately, the impact of rising inflation on consumer spending and confidence will be a critical measure of stability, and determine how hawkish the Bank needs to be,"" he said. ""We may well see the rate rise kicked into 2022.""
Ben Lord, a portfolio manager at M&G Investments, said tax rises and less pandemic emergency spending by the government in early 2022, combined with the end of the BoE's bond-buying stimulus programme, posed risks for Britain's economy.

There were signs in Wednesday's data of further inflation pressure in the pipeline. Prices charged by factories rose by more than expected, up 8% compared with October 2020, the sharpest increase since 2011.
Manufacturers' input costs jumped by 13%, the most since 2008, the ONS said.

980,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 17, 2021 05:20AM ET</span>",Euro zone Oct inflation confirmed at 4.1% y/y on energy spike,"BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Euro zone inflation surged to more than twice the European Central Bank's target in October, the European Union's statistics office Eurostat confirmed on Wednesday, with more than half of the jump due to a spike in energy prices.
Eurostat said inflation in the 19 countries sharing the euro rose 0.8% month-on-month in October, for a 4.1% year-on-year surge, in line with an earlier Eurostat estimate. 
The ECB wants to keep inflation at 2.0% over the medium term and has said the inflation surge was temporary. The bank expects price growth to slow during 2022, but admitted it would take longer than initially expected.
Breaking down the year-on-year total, more expensive energy added 2.21 percentage points, services added 0.86 points, food alcohol and tobacco added 0.43 points and non energy industrial goods 0.55 points, Eurostat said.
Without the volatile energy and unprocessed food prices, a measure the ECB calls core inflation, prices rose 0.3% on the month for a 2.1% year-on-year gain. 
An even narrower measure, looked at by many economists, that additionally excludes alcohol and tobacco showed prices rising 0.3% on the month, but only 2.0% on the year.

With inflation already twice its target and likely rising further later this year, the ECB is coming under increased pressure to abandon its ultra easy monetary policy and tackle price growth that is eroding households' purchasing power.
But tightening monetary policy now could choke off the post-pandemic economic recovery, ECB President Christine Lagarde said on Monday, pushing back on calls and market bets for tighter policy.

TOKYO (Reuters) -Japan's exports snapped seven months of double-digit growth in October due to slowing car shipments, as global supply constraints hit the country's major manufacturers.
The slowing growth shows Japan's vulnerability to supply chain bottlenecks that have been particularly disruptive for the car industry and have clouded the outlook for trade.
Exports rose 9.4% year-on-year in October, Ministry of Finance data showed on Wednesday, slightly below a median market forecast for a 9.9% increase in a Reuters poll. It followed 13.0% growth in the prior month and was the weakest expansion since a decline in February. Car shipments fell 36.7%.
""While carmakers are planning 'revenge production' in November and December, clouds still loom - semiconductor shortages will last until year-end at least, and no one knows if carmakers' plans to avert the impact of chip shortages by adjusting their supply chains would succeed,"" said Ryosuke Katagi, market economist at Mizuho Securities.
""Dragged down by staple cars, sluggish export growth will last for the rest of 2021.""
By region, exports to China, Japan's largest trading partner, increased 9.5% in the 12 months to October, slowing from 10.3% in the previous month as car shipments to the country fell 46.8%.
U.S.-bound shipments, another key market for Japanese goods, grew just 0.4% in October, also weighed by declining car exports, which fell 46.4%.
Imports rose 26.7% in the year to October, below forecasts for a 31.9% increase, bringing the trade balance to a deficit of 67.4 billion yen ($586.60 million), compared with the median estimate for a 310.0 billion yen deficit.
Separate government data showed core machinery orders, which serve as a leading indicator of capital spending in the coming six to nine months, were flat in September from the prior month, missing an expected 1.8% gain.
The weaker-than-expected core orders signal corporate Japan's reluctance to commit to firmer capital spending as supply bottlenecks pose a risk to the outlook.
Manufacturers expected core orders to rise 3.1% in October-December, after a 0.7% gain in the previous quarter.
Japan's economy shrank faster than expected in the third quarter due to declining consumption, business spending and exports, which suffered from a resurgence in COVID-19 infections and chip and parts supply disruptions.

The government is expected to announce a fiscal stimulus package worth ""several tens of trillion yen"" on Friday, aimed at easing the pain of the COVID-19 pandemic and reviving the economy.

982,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 16, 2021 08:51PM ET</span>","U.S. retail sales surge as Americans kick off holiday shopping, brighten economic outlook","By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. retail sales surged in October as Americans eagerly started their holiday shopping early to avoid empty shelves amid shortages of some goods because of the ongoing pandemic, giving the economy a lift at the start of the fourth quarter.
The solid report from the Commerce Department on Tuesday suggested high inflation was not yet dampening spending, even as worries about the rising cost of living sent consumer sentiment tumbling to a 10-year low in early November. Rising household wealth, thanks to a strong stock market and house prices, as well as massive savings and wage gains appear to be cushioning consumers against the highest annual inflation in three decades.
""It's more important to look at what consumers do than what they say,"" said Gus Faucher, chief economist at PNC Financial (NYSE:PNC) in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. ""They are concerned about higher inflation, but they are still in good shape and are continuing to spend."" 
Retail sales jumped 1.7% last month, the largest gain since March, after rising 0.8% in September. It was the third straight monthly advance and topped economists' expectations for a 1.4% increase. Sales soared 16.3% year-on-year in October and are 21.4% above their pre-pandemic level.
Several of the top U.S. retailers this week have noted an earlier start to holiday shopping. While this could lead to declines in November and December, economists and retailers expect holiday sales this year will be the best in a while. 
""Today's numbers show that consumers are getting a jump on their holiday shopping,"" said Matthew Shay, president of the National Retail Federation in Washington. ""We continue to urge consumers to shop early and shop safely, and we fully expect this holiday season to be one for the record books.""
Retail sales are mostly made up of goods, with services, including healthcare, education and hotel accommodation, making up the remaining portion of consumer spending. The nearly two-year long COVID-19 pandemic has caused an acute shortage of labor, delaying deliveries of raw materials to factories as well as shipments of finished goods to markets.
October's broad increase in sales partly reflected higher prices as monthly consumer inflation surged 0.9% in October, which boosted the annual rate to 6.2%. 
Stocks on Wall Street were trading higher on the data and also as Walmart (NYSE:WMT) forecast a strong holiday quarter. The dollar rose against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices fell. 
Retail sales: https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-STOCKS/movanldarpa/retailsales.png 
BROAD GAINS
Sales were led by motor vehicles, with receipts at auto dealerships advancing 1.8% after gaining 1.2% in September. The rise reflected the first increase in unit sales in six months, as well as higher prices. The tight supply of automobiles because of a global semiconductor shortage is driving up prices.
Sales at service stations increased 3.9%, boosted by more expensive gasoline. Online retail sales rebounded 4.0%. Receipts at building material stores advanced 2.8%. There were also increases in receipts at furniture outlets as well as sporting goods, hobby, musical instrument and book stores. Sales at electronics and appliance stores rebounded 3.8%. 
But sales at clothing stores fell 0.7%. Sales at restaurants and bars were unchanged despite an ebb in COVID-19 infections, driven by the Delta variant. Restaurants and bars are the only services category in the retail sales report. These sales were up 29.3% from last October. 
Economists speculated that either high inflation was forcing consumers to cut back on eating out or that spending had permanently shifted in favor of goods.
""If services spending has largely recovered, strong goods demand increasingly looks to be a structural shift in consumer preferences, rather than a temporary COVID-related outcome,"" said Andrew Hollenhorst, chief U.S. economist at  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) in New York.
Excluding automobiles, gasoline, building materials and food services, retail sales shot up 1.6% last month after rising 0.5% in September. These so-called core retail sales correspond most closely with the consumer spending component of gross domestic product. Adjusting for inflation, retail sales are up at a roughly 5% annualized rate from the third-quarter average. 
Core retail sales: https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-STOCKS/gkvlgdayzpb/retailcore.png 
Consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity rose at a tepid 1.7% rate last quarter. Economists at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) boosted their fourth-quarter GDP growth estimate to a 5% rate from a 4% pace. Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) raised its estimate by 0.5 percentage point to a 5.0% rate. The economy grew at a 2% rate in the third quarter. 
The economic picture was further brightened by a separate report from the Federal Reserve on Tuesday showing manufacturing output surged 1.2% last month to its highest level since March 2019, after falling 0.7% in September.
""The economy has thrown off whatever lethargy it might have had in the summer, and it is growing quite strongly,"" said Joel Naroff, chief economist at Naroff Economics in Holland, Pennsylvania.

Businesses are also making steady progress replenishing depleted inventories, which should help to keep factories humming and support the economy. Business inventories increased 0.7% in September, a third report from the Commerce Department showed.

The value of Japan’s overseas shipments increased 9.4% from a year earlier, according to the Ministry of Finance on Wednesday. Economists had expected a gain of 10.3%. 
The figures come just a couple of days before Prime Minister Fumio Kishida is expected to unveil a package of measures to get the economy back on track, including some steps to shore up Japan’s supplies of semiconductors.
What Bloomberg Economics Says...
“Looking ahead, we expect exports to drop in November, pressured by softer Chinese demand. Chip shortages also remain a downside risk for exports.”

A weakening export trend places more importance on Kishida coming up with ways to help boost consumer spending in support of the economy rather than relying on external demand. The economy shrank an annualized 3% from July to September, with exports dropping 8.3% from the previous quarter. 
The premier is looking to take steps to normalize activity in the economy now that about three quarters of the population is fully vaccinated. 
 Toyota  Motor (NYSE:TM) Corp. offered a glimmer of hope last week that global supply chains were recovering from the recent squeeze. After a series of output cuts, Japan’s biggest automaker said all of its domestic production lines will be operating normally in December for the first time in seven months, according to a statement by the company.

984,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 16, 2021 10:11AM ET</span>",U.S. manufacturing output races to 2-1/2-year high,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Production at U.S. factories rebounded more than expected in October as the drag from Hurricane Ida faded and motor vehicle output picked up, but manufacturing continues to be constrained by shortages of raw materials and labor.
Manufacturing output surged 1.2% last month to its highest level since March 2019, after falling 0.7% in September, the Federal Reserve said on Tuesday. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast manufacturing production rising 0.7%.
Output increased 4.5% compared to October 2020. Manufacturing, which accounts for 12% of the U.S. economy, is being underpinned by businesses desperate to rebuild depleted inventories.
Spending shifted to goods from services over the course of the COVID-19 pandemic, straining global supply chains. Raw materials such semiconductors are in short supply. Workers are also scarce, hampering the delivery of materials to factories as well as the shipment of finished goods to markets.
Even with spending rotating back to services as coronavirus infections driven by the Delta variant subside, demand for goods remains strong.
Production at auto plants rebounded 11.0% last month after declining for two straight months. Excluding autos, manufacturing output rose 0.6% in October.
Consumer goods production rebounded 1.4%. But machinery production dropped 1.3% because of an ongoing strike at John Deere (NYSE:DE). Last month's jump in manufacturing output combined with a 4.1% rebound in mining and a 1.2% rise in utilities to boost industrial production by 1.6%. That followed a 1.3% drop in September.

Capacity utilization for the manufacturing sector, a measure of how fully firms are using their resources, increased 0.9 percentage point in October to 76.7%, the highest since January 2019. Overall capacity use for the industrial sector rose to 76.4% from 75.2% in September. It is 3.2 percentage points below its 1972-2020 average.
Officials at the Fed tend to look at capacity use measures for signals of how much ""slack"" remains in the economy — how far growth has room to run before it becomes inflationary.

The value of overall retail purchases increased 1.7% last month, the most in seven months, following a upwardly revised 0.8% advance in September, Commerce Department figures showed Tuesday. Excluding gas and motor vehicles, sales gained 1.4% in October. The figures aren’t adjusted for price changes.
The median estimate in a Bloomberg survey of economists called for a 1.4% advance in overall retail sales.
The broad-based gain in spending highlights how elevated savings and rising wages have helped Americans sustain a robust pace of merchandise spending. Though total retail sales are well-above pre-pandemic levels, a recent inflation-driven collapse in consumer sentiment risks a future tempering in demand.
U.S. prices are rising at the fastest pace in 30 years as businesses pass on growing labor and input costs to customers, but it’s hard to tell just how much that’s impacting demand since the figures aren’t adjusted for inflation. Inflation-adjusted consumer spending data for October will be released next week.
Results from Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc. and  Home Depot  Inc.

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's job market withstood the end of the government's furlough scheme last month, according to data which could ease lingering concerns at the Bank of England about the risks of raising interest rates from their pandemic low.
Sterling strengthened as the number of staff on businesses' payrolls in October rose to 0.8% above levels in February 2020, before the coronavirus pandemic hit, and increased by 160,000 on the month.
The Bank of England has been watching closely in case unemployment rose after the job-protecting furlough scheme expired at the end of September.
""Now that today's labour market data shows that hurdle has been cleared, we think the Bank of England has the green light for interest rate lift-off at their December meeting,"" Ambrose Crofton, a global market strategist at J.P. Morgan Asset Management, said.
The BoE's next monetary policy announcement is scheduled for Dec. 16.
But Andrew Goodwin at Oxford Economics, a consultancy, said the BoE might need more time to assess the strains facing many consumers from inflation set to hit almost 5% in April, when workers will also have to pay more tax.
""Given the cost of living challenges facing households and a full assessment of furlough's end arguably needing several months' worth of data, we narrowly think the MPC will delay rate lift-off until February,"" Goodwin said.
The Office for National Statistics said it was possible that people made redundant at the end of the furlough scheme would continue to appear as in work in the data for a few further months, while they worked out their notice period. 
""However, responses to our business survey suggest that the numbers made redundant were likely to be a small share of those still on furlough at the end of September 2021,"" the ONS said.
UNEMPLOYMENT RATE DOWN
Official data published by the ONS on Tuesday showed the unemployment rate fell by more than expected to 4.3% for the three months to September from 4.5% before, its lowest since the three months to July 2020. 
Employment rose by 247,000 in the July-September period, more than a predicted increase of 185,000 in the Reuters poll, while the number of unemployed fell by 152,000.
The ONS said average weekly earnings in the July-September period were 5.8% higher than in the same three months of 2020, the smallest annual increase since April.
Excluding bonuses, earnings were 4.9% higher than a year earlier, the smallest rise since the three months to March. 
The ONS estimated the underlying pace of growth in wages - taking into account workers going back on full pay after furlough and how job losses during the coronavirus lockdowns fell most heavily on lower-paid workers - stood between 3.4% and 4.9% for pay excluding bonuses.
BoE Governor Andrew Bailey has said Tuesday's jobs data and another release due in four weeks' time will be critical for the central bank's thinking about whether to raise the Bank Rate for the first time since the pandemic struck.
""The anecdotes suggest the transition out of the furlough scheme has not raised unemployment but we don't really know the full story,"" Bailey told lawmakers on Monday. But he added that he thought the labour market was ""considerably tighter"".
Tuesday's data showed job vacancies hit an all-time high of 1.172 million in the three months to October, almost 400,000 more than before the pandemic, although the pace of growth slowed again.
The Resolution Foundation, a think tank, said it was taking only one-and-a-half months on average for an employer to fill a vacancy, matching a record-quick time seen before the pandemic.

""This shows that record vacancies are being driven by the economy reopening, rather than it being impossible to hire staff as some have suggested,"" it said.
Employers in some sectors such as food processing and road haulage say post-Brexit restrictions on workers from the European Union are making it harder for them to fill positions.

TOKYO (Reuters) -Japan's economy contracted much faster than expected in the third quarter as global supply disruptions hit exports and business spending while new COVID-19 cases soured the consumer mood, undermining efforts to stoke a virtuous growth cycle.
While many analysts expect the world's third-largest economy to rebound this quarter as virus curbs ease, worsening global production bottlenecks pose increasing risks to export-reliant Japan.
""The contraction was far bigger than expected due to supply-chain constraints, which hit car output and capital spending hard,"" said Takeshi Minami, chief economist at Norinchukin Research Institute.
""We expect the economy to stage a rebound this quarter but the pace of recovery will be slow as consumption did not get off to a good start even after COVID-19 curbs were eased late in September."" 
The economy shrank an annualised 3.0% in July-September after a revised 1.5% gain in the second quarter, preliminary gross domestic product (GDP) data showed on Monday, much worse than a median market forecast of a 0.8% contraction.
The weak GDP contrasts with more promising readings from other advanced countries such as the United States, where the economy expanded 2.0% in the third quarter on strong pent-up demand.
In China, factory output and retail sales unexpectedly rose in October, data on Monday showed, despite supply shortages and new COVID-19 curbs.
On a quarter-on-quarter basis, Japan's GDP fell 0.8% compared with market forecasts for a 0.2% decline.
Some analysts said Japan's heavy dependence on the auto industry meant its economy was more vulnerable to trade disruptions than other countries.
Shinichiro Kobayashi, principal economist at Mitsubishi UFJ (NYSE:MUFG) Research and Consulting, said automakers make up a large part of Japan's manufacturing sector with a wide range of subcontractors directly affected.
STIMULUS PLAN
Prime Minister Fumio Kishida announced plans to compile a large-scale economic stimulus package worth ""several tens of trillion yen"" on Friday, but some economists were sceptical about its impact on growth near-term.
The package will feature a plan to urgently strengthen the chip industry while the government will also formulate a strategy for storage batteries, key to the green and digital growth areas, trade minister Koichi Hagiuda said.
However, some analysts were sceptical about the impact of the stimulus.
""The package will likely be a mixed bag of near-term and long-term growth measures, and the focus may be blurred, so it won't have much impact near-term,"" Norinchukin's Minami said.
Consumption fell 1.1% in July-September from the previous quarter after a 0.9% gain in April-June.
Capital expenditure also decreased 3.8% after rising a revised 2.2% in the previous quarter.
Domestic demand shaved off 0.9% point to GDP growth.
Exports lost 2.1% in July-September from the previous quarter as trade was hurt by chip shortages and supply-chain constraints.
Analysts polled by Reuters expect Japan's economy to expand an annualised 5.1% in the current quarter, as consumer activity and auto output pick up.
However, Japanese firms still face risks from higher commodity costs and supply bottlenecks, which threaten to undermine the economic outlook over the short- to mid-term.
Real GDP, which factors in the effects of inflation, won't return to pre-pandemic levels until the second half of 2023, said Takahide Kiuchi, a former Bank of Japan board member who now serves as chief economist at Nomura Research Institute.

""China's slowdown, supply constraints, rising energy prices and a slowdown in inflation-hit Western countries will reduce the pace of growth towards mid-2022,"" Kiuchi said.
""As exports remain severe, Japan's economy will likely undergo moderate growth of around 1%-2% annualised in the second quarter onwards, even taking effects of stimulus into account.""

BEIJING (Reuters) -China's industrial output and retail sales grew more quickly than expected in October, despite fresh curbs to control COVID-19 outbreaks and supply shortages, but the slowing property sector weighed on the economic outlook.
Output grew 3.5% in October from the same period a year ago, official data showed on Monday, accelerating from a 3.1% increase in September. Retail sales growth also picked up.
The industrial output growth beat expectations of a 3.0% year-on-year increase in a Reuters poll of analysts, but remained the second lowest print this year.
The world's second-largest economy had staged an impressive rebound from last year's pandemic slump, but has since lost momentum as it grapples with a slowing manufacturing sector, debt problems in the property market and COVID-19 outbreaks.
""Economic momentum remained weak in October, with the real estate downturn weighing on industry,"" said Louis Kuijs, head of Asia economics at Oxford Economics, in a note.
The National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) data also showed retail sales accelerated even as China imposed fresh restrictions to fight a new wave of COVID-19 cases in the north.
Retail sales rose 4.9% year-on-year in October, beating expectations for 3.5% growth and after a 4.4% increase in September.
""Growth will likely weaken in the rest of this year,"" said Zhiwei Zhang, chief economist at Pinpoint Asset Management. 
""The COVID outbreak has forced more cities to tighten travel restrictions, which will likely affect the service sector adversely in November. The property sector slowdown is getting worse,"" Zhang said, adding this was ""the key risk for the macro outlook in the next few quarters.""
NBS data showed property investment and sales growth continued to slow over January-October compared with the first nine months, and new construction starts measured by floor area fell.
Sentiment in China's property market has been shaken by a deepening debt crisis, with property giant China Evergrande and Kaisa Group grappling with looming defaults.
POLICY MEASURES
China's sprawling manufacturing sector has slowed this year after a blistering recovery from the COVID-19 slump, with electricity shortages and production cuts hampering production in recent months. 
""We expect policymakers to take more easing measures to prevent growth from falling too much,"" said Oxford's Kuijs, adding that weaker demand is driving the broader industry slowdown rather than just supply constraints.
Easing measures should start to have an effect early next year, he said. 
Policy sources and analysts have told Reuters that China's central bank will likely move cautiously on loosening monetary policy to bolster the economy, as slowing economic growth and soaring factory inflation fuel concerns over stagflation.
Signs of stagflation are caused by short-term factors like high international commodity prices, said Fu Linghui, an NBS spokesman, at a briefing in Beijing on Monday. 
Fixed asset investment continued to slow, the NBS data showed, rising 6.1% in the first 10 months from the same period a year earlier, compared with the 6.2% increase tipped by a Reuters poll and the 7.3% rise in January-September.

""We think macro policies are close to a turning point. We expect the government will boost fiscal spending around year end to stabilize the weakening trend in investment,"" said Zhang.
The more upbeat output data stood in contrast to the country's official manufacturing survey for October. China's official purchasing managers' index https://www.reuters.com/world/china/china-factory-activity-contracts-second-month-official-pmi-2021-10-31 showed factory activity declined for a second straight month in October, hurt by persistently high raw material prices and softer domestic demand.

Investing.com – China’s industrial output grew surprisingly faster in October, despite the latest wave of COVID-19 cases in the country and supply shortages.
Data from the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS), released earlier in the day, showed that industrial production grew 3.5% year-on-year. Forecasts prepared by Investing.com predicted a 3% growth while a 3.1% growth was recorded in September.
Retail sales also picked up, with a growth rate of 4.9%, higher than forecasts prepared by Investing.com predicting a 3.5% growth. A 4.4% growth was recorded in September.
The unemployment rate was unchanged at 4.9%.
However, fixed asset investment grew 6.1% year-on-year in October, slower than the 7.3% growth recorded in September as well as forecasts prepared by Investing.com predicting a 6.2% growth.
China’s manufacturing sector has slowed down in 2021 due to power shortages and higher raw material prices. But October saw a rebound as power shortages, a key constraint on industrial output in September, eased, with power supply climbing 11.1% in October from a year earlier, according to Bloomberg.
“The national economy was generally stable and maintained the trend of recovery,” the NBS said in a statement. “However, we must be aware that the international environment is still complicated and severe with many unstable and uncertain factors.”
Retail sales benefited from pre-sales ahead of the Single’s Day shopping festival, also, the National Holiday in October drove the catering and accommodation sales, NBS spokesman Fu Linghui said at a briefing.
Meanwhile, concerns about China’s property market remained, as property giants China Evergrande Group and Kaisa Group continue to steer towards looming defaults.
The government is expected to maintain curbs, which might lead to weaker growth into 2022, and GDP growth is also expected to slow down. GDP growth is expected to slow to 3.5% in the fourth quarter of 2021, hit 8% for 2021, and weaken to 5.4% in 2022, according to a Bloomberg survey.
“Growth will likely weaken in the rest of this year,” said Zhang Zhiwei, chief economist at Pinpoint Asset Management Ltd. “The slowdown in the property sector continued, which is the key risk for the macro-outlook in the next few quarters.”"

Online property portal Rightmove (OTC:RTMVY) said the average asking price, which is not adjusted for seasonal variations, stood at 342,401 pounds ($459,057) in November - up 6.3% in annual terms.
Asking prices have fallen in each November since 2007 as the market enters an end-of-year slowdown before activity picks up again after the holidays.
""That is likely to push prices higher again, and increase the competition from other buyers,"" said Tim Bannister, Rightmove director of property data.
A survey of chartered surveyors last week showed house price inflation in Britain picked up last month, propelled by a shortage of sellers that also suggested further price rises lay ahead.
Other surveys have similarly pointed to continued house price growth since July when a year-long exemption from the stamp duty tax on house purchases was halved in scale in England and Northern Ireland and expired altogether in Wales.

Scotland ended the incentive in April and it expired in its entirety in England and Northern Ireland at the end of September.

994,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 12, 2021 04:38PM ET</span>","U.S. workers quitting reaches record high, job openings edge down in September","By Lindsay (NYSE:LNN) Dunsmuir
(Reuters) - The number of Americans voluntarily quitting their jobs rose to a record high in September while job openings stayed stubbornly above pre-pandemic levels, a sign that businesses may have to continue to raise wages in order to attract workers.
The Labor Department's monthly Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey, or JOLTS report, released on Friday, reflects an uneven economy with strong demand grinding against labor and goods shortages, driving overall inflation to its biggest annual gain in 31 years.
Wage inflation shows few signs of abating even as the daily case rate of coronavirus infections ebbs, with employers in almost every industry competing to lure workers and three million fewer people in the labor force compared to pre-pandemic levels.
The scramble for workers boosted wage growth to an annual increase to 4.9% in October, although this has been outstripped by overall inflation, leading to a fall in real earnings. 
A separate survey by the University of Michigan, also on Friday, showed consternation among consumers with sentiment on the economy falling to a decade low, with few believing policymakers are taking sufficient steps to tackle inflation.
Quits rose by about 164,000 in September, lifting the total to a record high of 4.4 million. The quits rate is seen as a good measure of labor market confidence as workers leave when they are more secure in their ability to find a new job.
There were 56,000 people who quit in the arts, entertainment and recreation industry while 47,000 left in the other services category. State and local government education saw 30,000 departures.
""The continued surge in quits points to wage growth of between 4.5%-5.0%, well above rates that would be consistent with inflation falling sustainably back towards the Fed's 2% target,"" said Michael Pearce, senior U.S. economist at Capital Economics in New York, following the report.
The Federal Reserve has so far resisted calls to take stronger action to combat higher-than-expected inflation, arguing that it remains transitory even if it persists well into next year. The central bank announced at its last meeting that it will begin to taper its massive bond buying program this month, seen as precursor move to raising interest rates from their current level near zero. Investors currently expect a rate liftoff in mid 2022.
Job openings, a measure of labor demand, edged down by 191,000 to 10.4 million on the last day of September. Hiring also remained largely unchanged at 6.5 million in September. The number of job openings was little changed in all four regions with vacancies increasing most in healthcare and social assistance, and state and local government, excluding education. 
The government reported last Friday that nonfarm payrolls increased by 531,000 in October after posting gains of 312,000 in September. Job growth has averaged 582,000 per month this year. 
(GRAPHIC: JOLTS - https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-STOCKS/myvmnkbdapr/jolts.png) 
Labor shortages could persist a while longer even as the Delta wave of COVID-19 infections slide from their mid-September high. All-time high savings fueled by government aid, as well as a strong stock market and record house price gains, look set to continue to provide a short-term buffer as workers weigh up when to re-enter the jobs market. Higher-than-normal early retirements are also playing a role.
That said, there is hope that with infections declining and schools fully reopened for in-person learning, more people will rejoin the labor force once excess savings helped by the generous government aid, some of which has ended, is depleted.
CONSUMER SENTIMENT AT DECADE LOW
Fewer Americans are feeling better about the economics outlook, at least in the short term. U.S. consumer sentiment plunged in early November to the lowest level since November 2011 as surging inflation cut into households' living standards, the University of Michigan's consumer sentiment survey showed. Its index dropped to 66.8 in its preliminary November reading from October's final reading of 71.7. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast a reading of 72.4. 
(GRAPHIC: UMich - https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-STOCKS/gkplgdjmdvb/umich.png) 
""One-in-four consumers cited inflationary reductions in their living standards in November, with lower income and older consumers voicing the greatest impact,"" Richard Curtin, the survey's director, said in a statement.
There is a ""growing belief among consumers that no effective policies have yet been developed to reduce the damage from surging inflation,"" he added. 
(GRAPHIC: UMich inflation expectations - https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-STOCKS/gkvlgdbrbpb/umich-inflation.png) 

Consumers see inflation in the year ahead accelerating at a 4.9% pace, the fastest since 2008, though they continue to expect it to abate over the medium term, with the five-year outlook at 2.9%, the survey showed.
The survey's consumer expectations index fell to 62.8 - the lowest since October 2013 - from 67.9 in October. Its gauge of current conditions slid to 73.2 - the lowest since August 2011 - from 77.7.

The University of Michigan's Consumer Sentiment Index plunged to 66.8 in its preliminary November reading from October's final reading of 71.7. That was the lowest level since November 2011 and was far short of the median estimate among economists of 72.4 in a Reuters poll.

KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) -Malaysia's economy shrank 4.5% in the third quarter, contracting by more than expected after its rebound in the second quarter, but the central bank expects a quick recovery as coronavirus restrictions are eased and economic activities resume. 
The third quarter performance was markedly worse than the median forecast for a 1.3% year-on-year contraction from a Reuters poll of economists.
But Bank Negara Malaysia (BNM) said recent indicators suggested a more positive momentum going forward.
A pickup in production and construction activities, an improved labour market, and strong external demand would all support a recovery, the central bank said, projecting economic growth between 5.5%-6.5% in 2022. 
""The growth outlook remains subject to COVID-19 risk factors globally and domestically, stability in global financial markets and gradual easing of supply chain disruptions,"" BNM Governor Nor Shamsiah Mohd Yunus cautioned during a news conference.
Malaysia is also set to benefit from strong growth among its major trading partners such as China and the United States, higher commodity prices, and robust demand for semiconductors to cater for remote work equipment and business digitalisation, she said. 
A surge in COVID-19 cases and the reimposition of movement curbs have weighed on consumption and investment activity, with the central bank cutting https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/malaysia-cbank-slashes-2021-growth-outlook-covid-19-surge-lockdowns-2021-08-13 the country's growth outlook for 2021 to 3%-4% in August. 
Coronavirus infection rates, however, have slowed drastically in recent weeks amid a ramped-up vaccination programme, boosting hopes of a turnaround. More than three-quarters of Malaysia's 32 million population are fully vaccinated.
The Southeast Asian country will likely see a strong rebound in the fourth quarter, with a resumption in international travel expected to boost recovery, Capital Economics analyst Alex Holmes said in a note. 
Malaysia this week announced quarantine-free travel lanes with neighbouring Singapore and Indonesia, and expects to reopen https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/malaysia-reopen-international-visitors-by-jan-1-govt-council-2021-11-11 its borders further by Jan. 1 at the latest. 
'NO STAGFLATION' 
Since last year, the government has rolled out 530 billion ringgit ($127.66 billion) in stimulus packages, while BNM has slashed its policy rate by 125 points to help the economy withstand the fallout of the pandemic.
BNM said its monetary policy stance would continue to be determined by new data and information, and that it was ""mindful of a premature withdrawal of policy support.""
Nor Shamsiah stressed that Malaysia was not facing any stagflation and that price pressures will remain moderate in 2022. 
Headline inflation is expected to average between 2%-3% this year, with core inflation remaining subdued amid spare capacity in the economy and slack in the labour market. 

The central bank is not expected to hike its overnight policy rate until the third quarter of next year at the earliest, according to economists polled by Reuters.

998,By Bloomberg,"<span>Nov 11, 2021 05:09PM ET</span>",Japan’s Economy Likely Shrank Ahead of Kishida’s Stimulus Plan,"(Bloomberg) -- Sign up for the New Economy Daily newsletter, follow us @economics and subscribe to our podcast.
Japan’s economy continues to sputter and is expected to have shrunk for the fifth quarter in two years as Prime Minister Fumio Kishida puts the finishing touches on a stimulus package aimed at shoring up the recovery.
Economists estimate gross domestic product contracted an annualized 0.7% in the three months to September, dragged down by private consumption as the country battled a Covid resurgence and global supply-chain constraints that hit production at automakers Toyota and Honda.
After the data’s release on Monday, Kishida is expected to unveil his stimulus measures at the end of the week. A bigger-than-expected contraction could inflate their size.
The economic package will give the clearest indication yet of how aggressively the premier aims to bump up growth over the short run and realize a fairer form of capitalism over the longer term. 
Economists had long expected the wave of infections that occurred around the time of the Tokyo Olympics to weigh on the economy’s performance over the summer as emergency restrictions were extended through September. 
Japan’s recovery has been weaker than all other Group of Seven countries and is expected to stay that way through next year, according to the International Monetary Fund.
Still, the consensus view of an overall contraction stems from recent figures showing that, outside the peak of the pandemic, factory production slumped in the summer quarter by the largest margin since the 2011 tsunami. That shows the impact of supply-chain constraints and chip shortages that prompted Toyota to cut output by around 40% in September.
“There was the big negative impact of the state of emergency, as well as a large decline in car-related production,” said economist Harumi Taguchi at IHS Markit. 
An underwhelming performance will set the backdrop for the stimulus package expected on Nov. 19. Surveyed economists expect it to be around 30 trillion yen ($260 billion) in size though much of it could be recycled cash from previous stimulus.
Among the key measures expected are handouts of around $880 for those 18 years old and under, a pay increase for caregivers, and bigger tax incentives for companies that raise pay. Domestic travel subsidies that briefly revived the hospitality sector last year are also likely to be relaunched despite lingering concerns over their potential to spread Covid.
Kishida hopes his measures will also encourage stronger wages that spread the benefits of growth to a wider segment of the population, while nudging firms to take a longer-term perspective.
Economists expect the stimulus package to be helpful, but not a game changer that transforms Japan’s capitalist model. 
“If you look at the suggestions of Kishida’s new capitalism panel, apart from the wage hike efforts, it’s really just a rehashing of past policies dating back to the previous Suga administration and earlier,” said economist Takashi Miwa at Nomura Securities Co.

The Commission said gross domestic product in the 19 countries sharing the euro would grow 5.0% this year after a 6.4% recession in 2020. It forecast growth of 4.3% in 2022 and 2.4% in 2023. Its forecast in May for 2021 growth was only 4.3%.
""Our measures to cushion the blow of the pandemic and to ramp up vaccinations across the EU have clearly contributed to this success,"" European Commission Vice President Valdis Dombrovskis said.
The Commission said inflation would reach 2.4% in 2021, up from 0.3% in 2020, before slowing to 2.2% in 2022 and 1.4 in 2023. The peak in price increases is to come in the last four months of this year, and then slow gradually throughout 2022. 
The fast growth and the gradual withdrawal of emergency government support for the economy will help reduce the aggregate budget deficit of the euro zone to 7.1% of GDP this year from 7.2% in 2020 and then to 3.9% in 2022 and 2.4% in 2023, the Commission forecast.
Public debt, which is to peak at an aggregate 100% of GDP for the euro zone this year, is to fall to 97.9% in 2022 and 97.0% in 2023 -- a faster reduction than forecast in May.

""There are three key threats to this positive picture: a marked increase in COVID cases, most acute in areas where vaccinations are relatively low; rising inflation, driven largely by a spike in energy prices; and supply-chain
disruptions that are weighing on numerous sectors,"" European Economic Commissioner Paolo Gentiloni said.

LONDON (Reuters) -Britain's economic recovery from the coronavirus pandemic lagged behind that of other rich nations in the July-September period, according to official data on Thursday which underscored the interest rate dilemma facing the Bank of England.
Gross domestic product grew by 1.3%, the weakest three-month growth since Britain was under lockdown in early 2021. 
The Bank of England and a Reuters poll of economists had forecast an expansion of 1.5%.
The Office for National Statistics said Britain's economy remained 2.1% smaller than it was at the end of 2019, a bigger shortfall than in fellow Group of Seven countries Germany, Italy and France. 
The United States has already surpassed its pre-crisis size. Canada and Japan, the other G7 members, have yet to report third quarter growth data but had already regained more ground by the second quarter than Britain had achieved by the third quarter. 
Thursday's data showed British GDP grew by 0.6% in September - stronger than a forecast of 0.4% in the Reuters poll - but estimates for previous months were revised lower.
GDP in July fell by 0.2%, a bigger decline than a previously estimated fall of 0.1%, while output in August was shown rising by just 0.2%, weaker than an originally reported 0.4%.
""Although monthly output rebounded through the quarter from July's contraction this is more likely to reflect a temporary boost from restrictions easing,"" said Suren Thiru, head of economics at the British Chambers of Commerce. 
INTEREST RATES
The BoE said last week, as it kept interest rates on hold, that recent economic growth had been weaker than it had expected and it would keep a close eye on the state of the labour market after the government's job protection scheme ended on Oct. 1.
Paul Dales, an economist at Capital Markets, a consultancy, said he expected the 0.6% growth recorded in September to quickly fizzle out.
""That's one reason why we doubt the Bank of England will raise interest rates above 0.50% next year,"" he said.
The BoE last week shocked financial markets when it kept its benchmark rate at an all-time low of 0.1% even as it forecast inflation to hit almost 5%, more than double its 2% target.
September's GDP growth was helped by stronger output in the health sector as people got back to visiting their doctors after falling during the pandemic, leading to a 0.7% rise in the services sector from August.
But industrial output fell by 0.4% as gas distribution shrank for a fourth month in a row.
The world's fifth-biggest economy shrank by nearly 10% in 2020, more than most other big rich nations.
But the International Monetary Fund forecast in October that it was on track to have the fastest expansion of any G7 country in 2021 when it was expected to grow by 6.8%.
However, the quick bounce-back from lockdown seen in the spring gave way to slower growth over the summer due to a combination of rising COVID-19 cases, global supply chain problems and post-Brexit shortages of some workers.

The ONS reported a fall in underlying inventories for manufacturers in the July-September period, which it said reflected some of the recent supply chain challenges.
Separate data showed Britain's trade in goods deficit widened by 9 billion pounds in the third quarter to 42.3 billion pounds, driven by rising imports from EU and non-EU countries as exports fell - especially to non-EU countries.

TOKYO (Reuters) -Japan's wholesale inflation hit a four-decade high in October, following a similar spike in China's factory gate prices as supply bottlenecks and rising commodity costs threatened Asian corporate profits.
The rising cost pressures, coupled with a weak yen that inflates the price of imported goods, adds to pain for the world's third-largest economy as it emerges from the consumer slump caused by the pandemic.
""Rising costs are certainly negative for corporate profits,"" said Atsushi Takeda, chief economist at Itochu Economic Research Institute. ""If the economy continues to recover, firms may be able to pass on costs (to consumers) at some point,"" he said.
The corporate goods price index (CGPI), which measures the prices companies charge each other for their goods and services, surged 8.0% in October from a year earlier, exceeding market expectations for a 7.0% gain, Bank of Japan data showed on Thursday.
The increase, which exceeded a revised 6.4% rise in September, was the fastest pace since comparable data became available in January 1981.
Wholesale prices rose for a range of goods including fuel, which spiked 44.5% in October from a year earlier, and timber goods, which saw prices surge 57.0%.
An index gauging yen-based wholesale import prices jumped a record 38.0% in October from a year earlier, a sign recent yen declines were pushing up already high raw material costs.
Japanese firms have so far been cautious about passing on higher costs to consumers on concern cost-sensitive households may hold back on spending. That has kept core consumer prices rising just 0.1% in September from a year earlier.
However, a slim majority of Japanese firms say they do plan to pass on or have passed on commodity costs to customers, a Reuters poll showed, a sign inflationary pressures are increasing.
That could deal a heavier blow to Japanese consumers than those in other countries given weak wage growth, heightening challenges for Prime Minister Fumio Kishida in achieving his pledge to distribute more wealth to households.
""With the burden on firms and households increasing, the rise in wholesale prices has a big negative impact on the economy,"" said Toru Suehiro, an economist at Daiwa Securities.
With upper house elections expected next year, Kishida vowed to deliver a range of cash payouts to households as part of a fresh stimulus package to be compiled next week.
Commodity inflation has hit countries across the globe. China's factory gate inflation hit a 26-year high in October, further squeezing profit margins for producers and heightening stagflation concerns.

In the United States, consumer prices posted their biggest rise in 31 years in October, amid signs that inflation could stay uncomfortably high well into 2022.
Despite the new price pressures, Japan has lagged the global shift by central banks to dial back crisis-mode policies with BOJ Governor Haruhiko Kuroda pledging to keep monetary settings ultra-loose until consumer inflation hits the elusive 2% target.

1002,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 10, 2021 08:36PM ET</span>","Australia jobs take shock fall in Oct, unemployment jumps","By Wayne Cole
SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australian employment suffered a shock fall in October and the jobless rate jumped as coronavirus lockdowns continued to plague the labour market, though all signs point to a rapid recovery now that the economy is reopening.
Data on Thursday from the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) showed employment fell by 46,300 in October, confounding analysts forecasts of a 50,000 increase.
The unemployment rate climbed to 5.2%, from 4.6%, well above the 4.8% forecast, while participation rose by less than expected to 64.7% with many still unable to look for work.
The surprise likely had much to do with the timing of the jobs survey which was taken from Sept. 26 to Oct. 9 when restrictions in New South Wales were just being eased and Victoria state was still locked down.
As a result, while employment rose by 22,000 in NSW, it fell 50,000 in Victoria and dragged the national result down. Other indicators of the labour market have been much stronger as stay-at-home restrictions were steadily removed.
""The spike in the unemployment rate confirms that there will be some frictional unemployment through the next couple of months,"" said Sarah Hunter, Chief Australia Economist for BIS Oxford Economics.
""But with vacancies still running at record highs this fallout should be largely transitory.""
The soft report knocked the local dollar down 20 ticks to $0.7322 and the market slightly pared bets on an early hike in interest rates from the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA).
Futures have been pricing in a first rise to 0.25% by June and rates of at least 0.75% by the end of next year, even though the central bank says any move in 2022 is ""extremely unlikely"".
FOCUS ON WAGES
Business surveys show demand for workers running strongly in the past month, while a survey of consumers out this week showed concerns about unemployment were at their lowest since the mid-1990s.
Online job site SEEK reported a 10% jump in ads in October, putting them a whopping 54% above where they were in December 2019 before the pandemic hit.
The number of applications for each job was almost 49% below pre-pandemic levels, an indicator of the tightness of the labour market as international migration has yet to re-start.
While this imbalance had produced pockets of wage heat, there was little sign as yet of the broad-based pick up that policy makers would like to see.
Key data on wages for the third quarter are due on Nov. 17 and any surprise on the high side would support the case for an earlier start to policy tightening.

Analysts look for annual wage growth to pick up to around 2.1%, from 1.7% in the second quarter, but remain well short of the 3%-plus levels the RBA is looking for.
The central bank argues further progress will be slow given the last time wages grew at 3% or more was in early 2013 and liaison with firms show an ingrained reluctance to pay more.

1003,By Bloomberg,"<span>Nov 10, 2021 08:09PM ET</span>",Australian Unemployment Jumps to 5.2% in Lockdown Hangover,"(Bloomberg) -- Australian unemployment rose in October as the economy shed more jobs, signaling a delay in the labor market’s bounce-back back from a protracted lockdown across the nation’s eastern states. 
The jobless rate advanced to 5.2% from 4.6% in September and above economists’ forecast of 4.8%, Australian Bureau of Statistics data showed Thursday. Employment fell by 46,300 roles, its third monthly decline, compared with economists’ estimate for a 50,000 increase. The participation rate edged up to 64.7% in October from 64.5%.
Australia’s benchmark three-year bond yield trimmed an earlier gain to be up 13 basis points at 1.02% while the 10-year yield was up 8 basis points at 1.81%. The Australia dollar erased its advance and dropped 0.1% to 73.20 U.S. cents.
The weaker jobs result is something of a reprieve for the Reserve Bank of Australia, under pressure from the bond market over faster consumer-price growth against a backdrop of rising global inflation concerns. That narrative was only reinforced when U.S. consumer prices rose last month at the fastest annual pace since 1990.
“It may seem counterintuitive for unemployment to rise as conditions are about to improve,” said Bjorn Jarvis, head of labor statistics at the ABS. “However, this shows how unusual lockdowns are, compared with other economic shocks, in how they limit being able to work and look for work.”
The result suggests a hiring hangover from months-long lockdowns in Sydney and Melbourne, with restrictions only lifting in recent weeks. The RBA is running ultra low interest rates to support the economy and ultimately aiming to push down unemployment in order to spark faster wages growth.
The RBA sees this as its best means to return inflation sustainably to the midpoint of its 2-3% target, which policy makers expect will take about two years. Markets are more optimistic on the recovery and are challenging that view by pricing in a tightening cycle beginning next year. 
Today’s jobs report, while only one month, is likely to add ballast to Governor Philip Lowe’s (NYSE:LOW) view that rates are only likely to rise from the current 0.1% in 2024.

1004,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 10, 2021 07:06PM ET</span>","UK house prices soar again, fuelled by dearth of sellers: RICS","LONDON (Reuters) - House price inflation in Britain picked up last month, propelled by a shortage of sellers that suggested further price rises lie ahead, a closely watched survey showed on Thursday.
The Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors said a net balance of 70% of its members reported an increase in house prices last month, up from a revised 69% in September.
A Reuters poll of economists had pointed to a reading of 65%.
The October survey showed the first increase in the house price balance since May.
Other surveys have also pointed to continued house price growth since July when a year-long exemption from the stamp duty tax on house purchases was halved in scale in England and Northern Ireland and expired altogether in Wales. 
Scotland ended the incentive in April and it expired in its entirety in England and Northern Ireland at the end of September. 
RICS Chief Economist Simon Rubinsohn said expectations of higher Bank of England interest rates were a sideshow to the lack of supply of homes coming to the market. 
Last week the BoE refrained from raising rates at its November policy decision, against the expectations of many investors, but top officials at the central bank have said borrowing costs are likely to go up soon.
""The inventory on agents' books appears to have slipped back towards historic lows and this seems to be underpinning both the current price trend and expectations for the next year,"" Rubinsohn said. 

""Meanwhile although there is likely to be some drop in activity in the immediate aftermath of the expiry of the stamp duty break, most activity indicators currently remain solid. Indeed, the main challenge for buyers looking forward may once again be a lack of choice of property on the market.""
More than two-thirds of surveyors said they expected house prices to continue rising over the next 12 months, the survey showed.

1005,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 10, 2021 02:13PM ET</span>",U.S. budget gap narrows more than expected from a year earlier in October,"(Reuters) - The U.S. government on Wednesday posted a $165 billion budget deficit for October, 42% lower than the $284 billion shortfall a year earlier as personal and corporate income tax receipts surged on the back of the rebounding economy.
The October deficit was $14 billion below the median estimate among economists polled by Reuters of $179 billion.
Receipts for the first month of the federal government's fiscal year totaled $284 billion, up 19% and a record for the month of October. Individual tax receipts rose 18% to $214 billion, and corporate taxes rose 39% to $21 billion.

A Treasury official said the increases stem from the improvement in the economy after last year's widespread shutdowns from the COVID-19 pandemic, which triggered a short but sharp recession. Rebounding employment is driving the increased individual taxes, while improved corporate earnings are fueling the rise in business tax receipts.
Spending also slowed notably from a year earlier, with total outlays of $449 billion, down 14% from October 2020's $522 billion. Lower Medicare outlays, which tumbled by $56 billion, or 44%, were the biggest driver, while the end of enhanced federal unemployment benefits in September was behind a 91% drop in Labor Department spending.

1006,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 10, 2021 01:42PM ET</span>","Surging gasoline, food prices fan U.S. inflation; labor market tightening","By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. consumer prices accelerated in October as Americans paid more for gasoline and food, leading to the biggest annual gain in 31 years, more signs that inflation could stay uncomfortably high well into 2022 amid snarled global supply chains.
Inflation pressures are also brewing in the labor market, where an acute shortage of workers is driving wages higher. The number of Americans filing claims for unemployment benefits fell to a 20-month low last week, other data showed on Wednesday. 
But high inflation is eroding the wage gains, adding to political risk for President Joe Biden, whose approval rating has been falling as Americans grow more anxious about the economy. Broadening inflationary pressures could also complicate the Federal Reserve's communication. The Fed last week restated that high inflation is ""expected to be transitory.""
Both the White House and the Fed have maintained that prices will fall once supply bottlenecks start easing.
""Risks are clearly shifting toward U.S. inflation remaining elevated longer than previously thought, but that doesn't mean that it's permanent,"" said Ryan Sweet, a senior economist at Moody's (NYSE:MCO) Analytics in West Chester, Pennsylvania. ""The Fed could face a situation where higher consumer prices begin to weigh on consumer spending, reducing GDP growth."" 
The consumer price index jumped 0.9% last month after climbing 0.4% in September, the Labor Department said. The largest gain in four months hoisted the annual increase in the CPI to 6.2%. That was the biggest year-on-year rise since November 1990 and followed a 5.4% advance in September.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the CPI shooting up 0.6%. The broad-based increase in prices last month was led by gasoline prices, which surged 6.1% after rising 1.2% in September. Brent crude oil has gained over 60% this year as a recovering global economy is heating up demand. 
Food prices advanced 0.9%, mostly driven by meat, eggs, fish, vegetables, cereals and bakery products. It also cost more to eat away from home. But prices for alcoholic beverages fell.
The government reported on Tuesday that producer prices increased strongly in October, reversing a slowing trend in the monthly PPI that had become entrenched since spring. 
Inflation is heating up again as the economic drag from the summer wave of COVID-19 infections, driven by the Delta variant, fades and supply bottlenecks persist. Trillions of dollars in pandemic relief from governments across the globe fueled demand for goods, leaving supply chains overstretched. 
The nearly two-year long pandemic has upended labor markets, causing a global shortage of workers needed to produce raw materials and move goods from factories to consumers.
Biden in a statement blamed the inflation surge on energy prices and said he had directed the White House National Economic Council ""to pursue means to try to further reduce these costs, and have asked the Federal Trade Commission to strike back at any market manipulation or price gouging in this sector.""
Stocks on Wall Street fell. The dollar gained versus a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury yields rose.
BROAD-BASED INCREASE
Excluding the volatile food and energy components, the CPI gained 0.6% last month after climbing 0.2% in September. The so-called core CPI was boosted by rents, with owners' equivalent rent of primary residence, which is what a homeowner would receive from renting a home, rising a solid 0.4%. 
The cost of hotel and motel accommodation rose 1.5%. Prices for used cars and trucks rebounded 2.5% after declining for two straight months. New motor vehicle prices increased 1.4%, marking the seventh consecutive month of gains. A global semiconductor shortage has undercut motor vehicle production. 
Healthcare costs increased 0.5%, the largest gain in 17 months. Consumers also paid more for household furnishings, recreation and grooming. The costs of motor vehicle insurance and apparel were unchanged. Air fares fell 0.7%. 
The so-called core CPI jumped 4.6% on a year-on-year basis, the largest increase since August 1991, after being steady at 4.0% for two straight months. 
The Fed's preferred inflation measure for its flexible 2% target increased 3.6% year-on-year in September. The U.S. central bank this month started reducing the amount of money it is injecting into the economy through monthly bond purchases.
Economists expect the Fed to start raising interest rates in late 2022.
""The heat seen in rents and across services could make the Fed begin to sweat as they wait out the return in the labor supply and easing of supply constraints over the coming months,"" said Alexander Lin, a U.S. economist at Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) Securities in New York. ""Clearly the risks are for the timing of rate hikes to be pulled forward."" 
In another report on Wednesday, the Labor Department said initial claims for state unemployment benefits fell 4,000 to a seasonally adjusted 267,000 for the week ended Nov. 6.
That was the lowest level since the middle of March in 2020, when the economy almost ground to a halt under the onslaught of mandatory business closures aimed at slowing the first wave of COVID-19 infections. 
Claims, which have now dropped for six straight weeks, are within striking distance of their pre-pandemic level.
The government reported last Friday that the economy added 531,000 jobs in October, with annual wage growth the largest in eight months. The labor force is down 3 million from its pre-pandemic level, making it harder to fill the 10.4 million job openings as of the of August.

Wages are, however, lagging inflation, eroding households' purchasing power. A third report from the Labor Department showed average weekly earnings adjusted for inflation fell 0.9% in October and were down 1.6% year-on-year. 
Supply constraints and high inflation helped to restrict economic growth to its slowest pace in more than a year in the third quarter.

Core inflation meanwhile increased to 5.2% year-on-year last month from 4.8% in September, central bank data showed.
Allen Sandeep of Naeem Brokerage said the monthly increase was driven by a hike in education fees of 12.7% and a 1% rise in the food index, which makes up 32.7% of the inflation index. 
""The inflation reading for October, in our view, is also reflective of the worldwide supply chain distortions, which were obvious on meat, fish, milk, cheese and eggs,"" Sandeep wrote. 
Red meat and poultry prices jumped by 4.6%, milk, cheese and eggs by 2.9%, and fish and seafood by 1.3%, he added.
Non-food inflation dropped to an annual 3.7% in October, its slowest in more than a decade, from 4.6% in September, Capital Economics said in a research note, although it warned that higher energy prices could push inflation higher again. 

""The surge in global energy prices forced the government to hike industrial gas prices by as much as 28% last week,"" the note said. 
""These prices are unlikely to feed through to consumers immediately, but if firms cannot absorb them into profit margins, they may be forced to pass on extra costs up the production chain.""

The Commerce Department said on Wednesday that wholesale inventories increased 1.4%, instead of 1.1% as estimated last month. Stocks at wholesalers rose 1.3% in August. Wholesale inventories jumped 13.1% in September from a year earlier.
Motor vehicle inventories declined 1.8% after falling 0.3% in August. Inventories are a key part of gross domestic product. Wholesale inventories, excluding autos, shot up 1.7% in September. This component goes into the calculation of GDP.
A slower pace of inventory decline in the third quarter accounted for all of the 2.0% annualized increase in GDP growth last quarter. Inventories were depleted in the first half of the year, but COVID-19 pandemic-related shortages are making it difficult to rebuild stocks.
Restocking is expected to underpin manufacturing and economic growth in the fourth quarter. But some economists are starting to worry that the inventory imbalance could derail the economic expansion.

""The current supply-chain disruptions are making it difficult for businesses to manage their inventories,"" said Ryan Sweet, a senior economist at Moody's (NYSE:MCO) Analytics in West Chester, Pennsylvania. ""Therefore, it's possible that businesses are caught with excess inventories in a couple of years as they over-order today to compensate for the delays. This has caused recessions in the past and is a symptom of a boom-bust cycle.""
Sales at wholesalers rose 1.1% in September after falling 0.9% in August. At September's sales pace it would take wholesalers 1.23 months to clear shelves, unchanged from August.

The consumer price index increased 6.2% from October 2020, according to Labor Department data released Wednesday. The CPI rose 0.9% from September, the largest advance in four months. 
The median estimate in a Bloomberg survey of economists called for a 5.9% gain from a year earlier in the overall CPI and a 0.6% increase from the prior month.
Against a backdrop of solid demand, businesses have been steadily raising prices for consumer goods and services at the same time supply chain bottlenecks and a shortage of qualified workers drive up costs. Many economists, including some at the Federal Reserve, expect those price pressures to persist into next year, keeping inflation elevated. 
A report on Tuesday showed prices paid to U.S. producers also accelerated last month, largely due to higher goods costs, and adding to concerns about persistent price pressures across the globe. In China, inflation at the factory level last month increased by the most in 26 years, while consumer prices in Brazil sped up by more than forecast.

BEIJING (Reuters) - New bank lending in China fell sharply in October from the previous month, but not quite as badly as forecast by analysts who expect the central bank to ease monetary policy cautiously due to risks of stagflation.
Data released on Wednesday by the People's Bank of China showed banks extended new loans of 826.2 billion yuan ($129.27 billion) in October, down sharply from 1.66 trillion in September but better than the 800 billion expected in a Reuters poll of analysts.
The new loans were higher than 689.8 billion yuan a year earlier.
""There are some signs that PBOC policy is turning more supportive in response to strains in the property sector. As such, we think this might be the trough in credit growth,"" Capital Economics said in a note. 
""But the usual lags mean that tight credit conditions will remain a headwind to economic activity for a while.""
Outstanding yuan loans grew 11.9% from a year earlier, in line with expectations and hovering at the lowest since May 2002.
Last month, central bank Governor Yi Gang said growth of China's money supply and total social financing were largely in line with nominal GDP growth, and liquidity was ample.
The PBOC is likely to move cautiously on loosening monetary policy to bolster the economy, as slowing economic growth and soaring factory inflation fuel concerns over stagflation, policy sources and analysts said. 
MORTGAGES PICKING UP 
Wen Bin, a senior economist at Minsheng Bank, said he expected the central bank to rely on targeted policy tools in the near term to support small firms and some other sectors.
On Monday, the PBOC said it would provide low-cost loans to financial institutions to help firms cut carbon emissions, supporting China's long-term carbon-neutrality goals.
Analysts at Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) estimated the PBOC could provide funding support of about 1.2 trillion yuan over the coming year.
Household loans, mostly mortgages, fell to 464.7 billion yuan in October from 788.6 billion yuan in September, while corporate loans dipped to 310.1 billion yuan from 980.3 billion yuan, central bank data showed.
""Medium- to long-term household loans exceeded medium- to long-term corporate loans, indicating the pace of housing loan issuance is accelerating,"" said Zhou Hao, senior economist at Commerzbank (DE:CBKG).
New mortgage loans reached 348.1 billion yuan in October, up by 101.3 billion yuan from September, the central bank said.
Growth of outstanding total social financing (TSF), a broad measure of credit and liquidity in the economy, was at 10.0% in October, unchanged from September. 
TSF includes off-balance sheet forms of financing outside the conventional bank lending system, such as initial public offerings, loans from trust companies and bond sales.
In October, TSF fell to 1.59 trillion yuan from 2.9 trillion yuan in September. Analysts polled by Reuters had expected October TSF of 1.6 trillion yuan.

Broad M2 money supply grew 8.7% from a year earlier, the central bank data showed, above the Reuters poll forecast of 8.3%. M2 rose 8.3% in September.
China's factory gate inflation hit a 26-year high in October as coal prices soared amid a power crunch in the industrial heartland, further squeezing profit margins for producers and heightening stagflation concerns.

Overall sales in the world's biggest car market were 2.33 million vehicles in October, data from the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers (CAAM) showed.
This time of year, known as ""Golden September, Silver October"", is usually a high point in sales for the industry, with consumers making purchases after staying away from showrooms during the stifling summer months.
One bright spot in the data was the strong sales of new energy vehicles (NEV), which grew 135% in October to 383,000 units, thanks to the government's promotion of greener vehicles to cut pollution. These include battery-powered electric vehicles, plug-in petrol-electric hybrids and hydrogen fuel-cell vehicles.
Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc sold 54,391 China-made vehicles in October, slightly less than 56,006 the previous month when it hit the highest monthly sales in China since it started production in Shanghai about two years ago, according to data of export, the China Passenger Car Association (CPCA) released on Monday.

CAAM official Chen Shihua said chip supply is easing in the fourth quarter which is helping the country's auto production to grow gradually.
Chinese EV makers Nio (NYSE:NIO) Inc sold 3,667 cars last month and Xpeng (NYSE:XPEV) Inc delivered 10,138 vehicles. Volkswagen AG (OTC:VWAGY) said it sold over 12,000 ID. series EVs in China in October.

Investing.com – Chinese inflation rose in October, with factory gate prices rising at their fastest pace in 26 years.
National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) data released earlier in the day showed that the producer price index (PPI) grew 13.5% year-on-year. Forecasts prepared by Investing.com predicted a 12.4% growth and a 10.7% growth was recorded in the previous month.
The jump in PPI growth was due to imported inflation and tight domestic supply of major energy and raw materials, NBS senior statistician Dong Lijuan said in a statement accompanying the data release.

The CPI grew 1.5% year-on-year in October, with Investing.com forecasts predicting a 1.4% growth and a 0.7% growth recorded in the previous month. This pickup was due to factors such as weather conditions, tight supply of some goods, and rising costs, the NBS statement said.
The higher CPI also suggests that the inflation pass-through from producers to consumers has on the whole been subdued. However, there are signs that cost pressures are increasingly impacting households.
The data “implies broad-based inflation pressure on both the production side and the consumer side,” China Renaissance Securities Hong Kong Ltd. head of macro and strategy research Bruce Pang told Bloomberg.
“Inflationary pressure and the more hawkish stance of monetary policy in other major economies will likely limit China’s room to maneuver for monetary easing.”

The producer price index (PPI) climbed 13.5% from a yearearlier, faster than the 10.7% rise in September, the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) said in a statement.
It matched a pace not seen since July 1995 and was faster than the 12.4% forecast by analysts in a Reuters poll.
Consumer price rises also quickened, although at a slower pace than factory gate prices. The consumer price index (CPI) rose 1.5% in October year-on-year, compared with September's 0.7% rise.
The mounting price pressures complicate deliberations for the People's Bank of China, which may now be wary of injecting monetary stimulus too quickly https://www.reuters.com/article/china-economy-policy-idUSL4N2RY0AM amid concerns about fanning inflation, even as growth in the world's second-largest economy slows.
""We are concerned about the pass-through from producer prices to consumer prices,"" said Zhiwei Zhang, chief economist at Pinpoint Asset Management, in a note.
Consumer prices will likely speed up in coming months as firms faced depleted inventories and are forced to pass higher costs onto customers, he added.
""The risk of stagflation continues to rise.""
Slowing economic growth and soaring factory inflation have fuelled concerns over stagflation, which could mean China has to move cautiously on loosening monetary policy.
""Rising CPI inflation and elevated PPI inflation reduces the probability of a PBoC policy rate cut,"" said Ting Lu, Chief China Economist at Nomura.
POWER STING
Upstream industries drove factory gate price rises, with coal mining and washing prices surging 103.7% from a year earlier and prices in the oil and gas extraction industry rising 59.7%.
Restrictions on carbon emissions and soaring prices of coal, a key fuel for electricity generation, led to power rationing and production cuts in recent months, although coal prices have since fallen after government intervention.
""Factory gate inflation is probably close to a peak,"" said Julian Evans-Pritchard, senior China economist at Capital Economics, in a note, citing coal price falls.
Several Chinese food giants have announced increases in retail prices in recent weeks, as rising production costs erode profit margins. Foshan Haitian Flavouring And Food, vinegar producer giant Jiangsu Hengshun and frozen food firm Fujian Anjoy Foods have all hike prices.

The PPI inched up 2.5% on a monthly basis, compared with the 1.2% uptick in September.

Producer prices in China have been rising rapidly in the past few months, first due to the global commodity price rally and then output curbs caused by a power crunch nationwide.

1016,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 09, 2021 06:11PM ET</span>",Japan manufacturers' mood falls to 7-month low in November - Reuters Tankan,"By Kantaro Komiya
TOKYO (Reuters) - Japanese manufacturers' business confidence fell to a seven-month low in November due to ongoing supply shortages, while sentiment in the services sector hit a three-month high on easing coronavirus curbs, the Reuters Tankan poll showed.
The mood among manufacturers deteriorated for the third month in November, but they became more optimistic about the outlook, according to the monthly poll, which tracks the Bank of Japan's (BOJ) closely watched Tankan quarterly survey next due on Dec. 13.
The sentiment index among service-sector firms picked up slightly in November, while their three-month outlook also improved, as the government eased coronavirus restrictions from the end of September due to falling COVID-19 cases, the poll found. 
The poll of 502 big and mid-sized companies conducted between Oct. 26 and Nov. 5, of which 254 responded, showed managers remained worried about supply issues and commodity inflation.
""Carmakers' output cuts due to chip shortage and soaring steel prices kept our revenue and profits below expectations,"" said a manager at a machinery company.
The Reuters Tankan sentiment index for manufacturers fell to 13 in November from 16 in October - matching its lowest since April - while the service index rose to a three-month high of 1 from minus 1. 
(For a detailed table of the results, click)
While Japan's economic recovery from the COVID-induced slump has been driven by exports, with consumption hit by coronavirus restrictions, semiconductor shortages and other supply constraints have hurt manufacturers in recent months. Meanwhile, the services sector is being underpinned by a reopening economy.
But services companies in the poll said they had not seen a clear boon for their businesses, with demand lost during the prolonged period of COVID-19 curbs yet to return.
The government lifted its COVID-19 state of emergency restrictions at the end of September, and has since eased some other curbs which remained in place in October in Tokyo and other big cities.
""The economy appeared to have reopened after the lifting of state of emergency,"" said a wholesale company manager. ""But the recovery in demand is still sluggish.""
The BOJ's latest tankan survey released in October showed an unexpected improvement in big manufacturers' business mood thanks to solid global demand.
However, some BOJ board members flagged ongoing supply chain constraints as a downside risk to the Japanese economy at its October policy meeting, where they decided to keep the ultra-easy monetary policy unchanged.
Looking forward, both manufacturers and services companies were more optimistic about their prospects, with the three-month reading among manufacturers rising to 19 from 14 and for services companies to 15 from 14.
Manufacturers' improved outlook was mainly driven by optimism among automakers, who produce Japan's No. 1 export item, even as the industry has been particularly hard hit by supply shortages.
The three-month forward-looking reading among the autos/transport equipment sector rose to +29, from 0 in October.

Manufacturers at large, except those in sectors heavily affected by rising commodity prices, were also more upbeat about their business prospects in February 2022.
""Although our performance hasn't recovered to pre-pandemic levels yet, the impact from COVID-19 has bottomed out,"" a precision machinery maker manager said. ""It's on a path to recovery.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. producer prices increased solidly in October, driven by surging costs for gasoline and motor vehicle retailing, suggesting that high inflation could persist for a while amid tight global supply chains related to the pandemic.
The Federal Reserve last week restated its belief that current high inflation is ""expected to be transitory."" A tightening labor market as millions remain at home is adding to price pressures, which together with shortages of goods sharply restrained economic growth in the third quarter. 
The Fed this month started reducing the amount of money it is injecting into the economy through monthly bond purchases. 
""The acceleration in inflation may not fade as quickly as previously thought, particularly for businesses because of the global supply-chain issues,"" said Ryan Sweet, a senior economist at Moody's (NYSE:MCO) Analytics in West Chester, Pennsylvania. ""Elevated inflation is turning up the heat on the Fed but they haven't shown signs of buckling as they will stomach higher inflation to get the labor market back to full employment quickly."" 
The producer price index for final demand rose 0.6% last month after climbing 0.5% in September, the Labor Department said on Tuesday. That reversed the slowing trend in the monthly PPI since spring. In the 12 months through October, the PPI increased 8.6% after a similar gain in September. 
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the PPI advancing 0.6% on a monthly basis and rising 8.7% year-on-year.
More than 60% of the increase in the PPI last month was due to a 1.2% rise in the prices of goods, which followed a 1.3% jump in September. A 6.7% surge in gasoline prices accounted for a third of the rise in goods prices. There were increases in the prices of diesel, gas and jet fuel as well as plastic resins. 
Wholesale food prices dipped 0.1% as the cost of beef and veal tumbled 10.3%. Prices for light motor trucks fell as the government introduced new-model-year passenger cars and light motor trucks into the PPI. 
Exorbitant motor vehicle prices have accounted for much of the surge in inflation as a global semiconductor shortage linked to the nearly two-year long COVID-19 pandemic has forced manufactures to cut production, leaving virtually no inventory.
Services gained 0.2% last month after a similar rise in September. An 8.9% jump in margins for automobiles and parts retailing accounted for more than 80% of the increase in services. The cost of transportation and warehousing services jumped 1.7%, also reflecting snarled supply chains.
Surveys from the Institute for Supply Management this month showed measures of prices paid by manufacturers and services industries accelerating in October. Manufacturers complained about ""record-long raw materials lead times, continued shortages of critical materials, rising commodities prices and difficulties in transporting products.""
Data on Wednesday is expected to showed strong gains in consumer prices in October, according to a Reuters survey of economists. Stocks on Wall Street retreated from record highs. The dollar was steady against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices rose.

PORT CONGESTION 
There is congestion at ports and widespread shortages of workers at docks and warehouses. There were 10.4 million job openings as of the end of August. The workforce is down 3 million from its pre-pandemic level.
Worker shortages were underscored by a report from the NFIB on Tuesday showing almost 50% of small businesses reported job openings they could not fill in October. 
Also on Tuesday, Fed Chair Jerome Powell emphasized the U.S. central bank's commitment to maximum employment, telling a virtual conference on diversity and inclusion in economics, finance and central banking that ""an economy is healthier and stronger when as many people as possible are able to work.""
Wholesale prices of apparel, footwear and truck transportation of freight also rose last month as did the costs of food and alcohol retailing, hospital outpatient care as well as machinery, equipment parts and supplies.
Excluding the volatile food, energy and trade services components, producer prices shot up 0.4%. The so-called core PPI gained 0.1% in September. In the 12 months through October, the core PPI rose 6.2%. That followed a 5.9% advance in September.
Construction prices surged 6.6%, the largest gain since the series was incorporated into the PPI data in 2009.
""As companies feel the squeeze from higher energy and labor costs, as well as persistent logistics issues, producer price increases should be robust in the coming months,"" said Will Compernolle, a senior economist at FHN Financial in New York. 
Details of the PPI components, which feed into the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index, excluding the volatile food and energy component, were mixed. The core PCE price index is the Fed's preferred measure for its flexible 2% target. Healthcare costs increased 0.4%. Airline tickets rebounded 0.3%, but portfolio management fees dropped 2.2%. 

Though the October CPI data is still pending, economists believed that the core PCE price index moved higher last month after increasing 3.6% year-on-year in September. 
""For now, we think the core PCE price index will be up 3.8% year-on-year in October,"" said Daniel Silver, an economist at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) in New York.

1018,By Bloomberg,"<span>Nov 09, 2021 08:54AM ET</span>","U.S. Producer Prices Climb 0.6%, Adding to Inflation Concerns","(Bloomberg) -- Prices paid to U.S. producers accelerated in October, largely due to higher goods costs, fueling concerns about the persistence of inflationary pressures in the economy.  
The producer price index for final demand increased 0.6% from the prior month and 8.6% from a year earlier, matching forecasts, Labor Department data showed Tuesday. Excluding the volatile food and energy components, the so-called core PPI rose 0.4% and was up 6.8% from a year ago.
The report underscores how transportation bottlenecks, materials shortages and increasing labor costs have sent prices soaring across the economy in recent months. And with ongoing supply-chain challenges anticipated to linger into 2022, sustained price increases at the producer level presage additional consumer price increases in the coming months.
More than 60% of the headline increase was due to goods, which jumped 1.2%. Higher energy costs, including that for gasoline, drove the gain. The cost of services rose 0.2%.
Other data point to growing price pressures. Compensation surged by the most on record in the third quarter, and a gauge of prices paid by service providers rose to the highest level in 16 years last month. A record 32% of small-business owners said in October they plan to raise compensation in the next three months.
Companies are passing those costs onto consumers in the form of higher prices, fueling inflation further. On recent earnings calls, executives at companies including 3M Co.,  Masco Corp  (NYSE:MAS). and Stanley Black & Decker Inc (NYSE:SWK). have spoken about raising prices, or plans to do so, to offset higher costs. 
That may be reflected in a report due Wednesday. The consumer price index is forecast to post its strongest advance on an annual basis since 1990.
‘Very Difficult’
The rapid and sustained increase in inflation has put the Federal Reserve in a challenging position. The central bank announced plans last week to begin tapering asset purchases this month, though Chair Jerome Powell noted balancing high inflation with a labor market that still needs to heal is “very difficult.”
Energy prices rose by the most since March, while the index for food prices declined for the first time in three months. 
Producer prices excluding food, energy, and trade services -- a measure often preferred by economists because it strips out the most volatile components -- rose 0.4% from the prior month. Compared with a year earlier, the gauge increased 6.2%.

1019,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 09, 2021 05:52AM ET</span>",German investor morale rises as price pressures seen easing,"BERLIN (Reuters) -Investor sentiment in Germany rose unexpectedly in November on expectations that price pressures will ease at the start of next year and growth will pick up in Europe's largest economy, a survey showed on Tuesday.
The ZEW economic research institute said its economic sentiment index increased to 31.7 from 22.3 points in October. A Reuters poll had forecast a fall to 20.0.
""Financial market experts are more optimistic about the coming six months,"" ZEW President Achim Wambach said in a statement.
A fall in a current conditions index to 12.5 from 21.6 - compared with a consensus forecast for 18.0 - showed investors expected that supply bottlenecks and inflationary pressures would hold back the economy in the current quarter, he said.
""For the first quarter of 2022, they expect growth to pick up again and inflation to fall both in Germany and the euro zone,"" Wambach added.
Supply bottlenecks for raw and preliminary materials have weighed down industrial production https://www.reuters.com/business/german-industrial-production-drops-september-supply-chain-shortages-2021-11-05 in Germany. Exports fell https://www.reuters.com/business/german-exports-fall-second-consecutive-month-september-2021-11-09 for a second consecutive month in September.
German consumer goods group Henkel trimmed its full-year earnings outlook https://www.reuters.com/article/henkel-ag-results/update-1-henkel-takes-earnings-hit-from-raw-material-prices-idUSL8N2RZ0W6 on Monday, saying it could not fully compensate for a spike in raw materials prices.

1020,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 09, 2021 02:55AM ET</span>",German exports fall for second consecutive month in September,"BERLIN (Reuters) -German exports fell for a second consecutive month in September while imports nearly stagnated, the statistics office said on Tuesday, in a further sign that supply chain disruptions are complicating the recovery of Europe's largest economy.
Seasonally adjusted exports dropped 0.7% on the month to 112.3 billion euros ($129.75 billion), compared to economists' expectations for no change.
Imports were up 0.1% to 99.2 billion euros, weaker than the 0.6% rise predicted.
Compared to February 2020, the month before the coronavirus pandemic hit Germany, exports were still down 0.3% whereas imports were up 7.8%, the seasonally adjusted data showed.
""Supply bottlenecks are weighing on production, which in turn is holding back exports,"" Bankhaus Lampe economist Alexander Krueger said, adding that this trend would likely continue for the rest of the year.
The trade surplus stood at 13.2 billion euros in September, much lower than during the period before the pandemic, when it often exceeded 20 billion euros each month.
A breakdown of year-on-year trade data showed that German exports to the United Kingdom fell by 10% to 5.7 billion euros and imports from Britain dropped by 20% to 2.3 billion euros.
German exports to China edged down by 0.2% on the year to 8.5 billion euros and exports to the United States jumped 16.2% on the year, to 10.8 billion euros.
""Weaker demand from China is also a cause for concern. A growth spurt will only happen when supply chains function more smoothly. But that will take some time,"" Krueger said.
The weak trade data chimed with a survey of the Ifo economic institute that showed October export expectations fell to the lowest since February as supply bottlenecks have been affecting the industrial sector.

Germany's economy ministry last month cut its exports growth forecast for the year to 8.6% from the 9.2% it had predicted in April, citing a ""historically unique shortage of intermediate goods"" that the manufacturing sector is facing.

1021,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 09, 2021 02:34AM ET</span>","Saudi Q3 GDP growth at 6.8%, highest since 2012","DUBAI (Reuters) -Saudi Arabia's economy grew 6.8% in the third quarter from a year earlier, the fastest expansion since 2012, official data showed on Tuesday, as the world's top oil exporter benefits from rebounding global energy demand.
""This positive growth was due to the high increase in oil activities by 9.0% as a result of rising world demand for crude oil and the increase of Saudi production in 2021,"" said the General Authority for Statistics, based on flash estimates.
Seasonally adjusted real gross domestic product (GDP) grew 5.8% quarter-on-quarter on the back of 12.9% growth in oil activities, it said.
The largest Arab economy was hit hard last year by the twin shocks of the COVID-19 pandemic and record-low oil prices.
The economy has rebounded this year, however, amid easing coronavirus-related restrictions, a vaccine roll-out and higher crude prices.
Non-oil activities posted 6.2% annual growth in the third quarter, the flash estimates showed.
""Saudi Arabia’s economic recovery looks to have picked up speed in Q3 and should remain strong over the rest of this year and 2022, underpinned by rising oil output"", London-based Capital Economics said in a report last week.

""Looking ahead, as oil production rises, virus restrictions are relaxed further, and the government leans towards loosening fiscal policy, the recovery is likely gather momentum"", it said.
The Saudi government forecast in September economic growth of 2.6% this year and 7.5% in 2022, saying projections for 2022 were based on expectations of increased oil production starting in May next year as part of an OPEC+ agreement, global demand recovery and improvements in global supply chains.

1022,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 09, 2021 02:16AM ET</span>","Philippines Q3 GDP slows less than expected, putting 2021 target in reach","By Neil Jerome Morales and Karen Lema
MANILA (Reuters) - The Philippines' annual economic growth slowed less than expected in the third quarter, putting the country on course to meet its target this year, but it was unlikely to persuade the central bank to move interest rates off their record lows. 
Gross domestic product expanded for a second straight quarter in July-September, although at a much slower pace of 7.1%, after the government reimposed strict curbs to contain a Delta-variant driven surge in COVID-19 cases.
The third quarter growth figure, while weaker than the previous quarter's upwardly revised 12% expansion, easily beat economists forecast of a 4.8% expansion, and made this year's downwardly revised 4.0%-5.0% GDP target well within reach.
""We contained the Delta variant and sustained our economic expansion even as stringent quarantines were in place,"" Socioeconomic Planning Secretary Karl Kendrick Chua told a media briefing. 
On a quarter-on-quarter basis, the economy grew 3.8% in September period, versus a 1.4% contraction in the June quarter.
As growth has yet to return to pre-pandemic levels, economists expect the central bank to leave its benchmark rate at a record low of 2.0% for some time despite faster inflation. 
A sluggish recovery ""will keep a lid on underlying price pressures and means that the central bank is unlikely to begin tightening policy until 2023"", said Alex Holmes, economist at Capital Economics.
The central bank has two more policy meetings this year, with the penultimate one to be held on Nov. 18.
Annual growth in household spending slowed to 7.1% in the third quarter from the previous quarter's 7.3% growth, but government spending reversed the previous quarter's slump and climbed 13.6% in July-September, government data showed.
Unemployment rose to an eight-month high of 8.9% in September following the reimposition of strict lockdown measures in August. 
In terms of sectoral output, industry and services grew 7.9% and 8.2%, respectively, while agriculture, forestry and fishing declined 1.7% partly due to bad weather and African swine fever outbreaks.

Domestic demand should pick up in the coming months as a decline in COVID-19 cases and rise in vaccination rates should pave the way for a further easing of mobility restrictions, Chua said.
Easing COVID-19 curbs should improve sentiment in the country of 110 million people ahead of an election in May to choose a successor to President Rodrigo Duterte.

The British Retail Consortium said retail spending rose by 1.3% compared with October 2020, recovering some momentum after growth slowed to just 0.6% in September when a lot of spending shifted away from shops to panic-buying of fuel caused by a shortage of tanker drivers.
""The much-reported squeeze on household spending has yet to materialise as consumers seem happy to carry on shopping,"" said Paul Martin, UK head of retail at KPMG, which produces the data with the BRC.
Last week the Bank of England predicted rising prices would eat into consumer demand as it forecast that inflation would hit almost 5% in April next year, due in large part to post-lockdown supply chain bottlenecks and surging energy prices. 
Martin said the limited availability of stocks was creating ""strong pricing dynamics"" and meant discounts were unlikely in the Christmas season. 
A separate survey of broader household spending by card payments firm Barclaycard showed consumers increased their spending by 14.2% compared with October 2019.

Spending on entertainment jumped as cinema-goers flocked to see the latest James Bond film and there were also increases in spending on digital subscriptions and on travel as restrictions lifted, Barclaycard said.
Its surveys currently do not compare sales with 2020 because of distortions caused by pandemic lockdowns.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's service sector sentiment index in October rose to its highest level in nearly eight years after state-of-emergency curbs were eased last month and new COVID-19 cases slid.
The economy watchers' index advanced 13.4 points to 55.5 in October, the highest level since January 2014, the government data showed. It was the second straight month of increase and marked the biggest gain since June 2020.
The index is based on a survey of workers such as taxi drivers, hotel workers and restaurant staff who are called ""economy watchers"" for their proximity to consumer and retail trends.

The outlook index - based on the watchers' view of the economy for two to three months ahead - gained 0.9 points in October to 57.5, the highest level since November 2013.

In September Japan's core consumer price index (CPI) posted 0.1% growth from a year earlier, the first positive figure since March 2020, driven by rising energy and raw material costs.
Inflation-adjusted real wages, a key gauge of households' purchasing power, fell 0.6% in September compared with the same month a year earlier, the labour ministry said on Tuesday.
It was the first decline in three months after a downwardly revised 0.1% gain in August, due to accelerating consumer price inflation.
The CPI measurement now used by the labour ministry to calculate real wages is different from one closely watched by the Bank of Japan, as the former index still sets its base year to 2015, not 2020, and includes volatile fresh foods but excludes owners' equivalent rent.
This version of CPI posted 0.9% year-on-year growth in September, the fastest pace since December 2019.
Nominal total cash earnings rose for the seventh straight month, up 0.2% in September from a year earlier. It followed a downwardly revised 0.6% advance in August.
Regular pay, or base salary, which makes up most of total cash earnings, was up 0.3% after an upwardly revised 0.5% rise the previous month, the data showed.
Overtime pay, a barometer of strength in corporate activity, grew 4.4% year-on-year in September, gaining for the sixth straight month but slowing from double-digit figures in three months to July. The apparent slowdown came largely from a statistical effect reflecting narrower drops in the months toward the end of 2020, a government official said.
Special payments, which mainly consist of volatile one-off bonuses, fell 2.3% in September from a year earlier, according to the data.
The following table shows preliminary data for monthly incomes and numbers of workers in September:
----------------------------------------------------------------
Payments (amount) (yr/yr % change)
Total cash earnings 270,019 yen($2,382.17) +0.2
-Monthly wage 263,276 yen +0.3
-Regular pay 245,835 yen +0.1

""High levels of saving and strong consumer sentiment point to a forgiving end to the year after what was for many retailers a difficult first six months due to lockdowns that threatened their existence,"" said HDE chief executive Stefan Genth. 
Online sales, which are expected to grow by 17.3%, to 23.1 billion euros ($26.69 billion), are expected to save Christmas.
The positive outlook comes even as German retailers are staring down the same factors that are hampering other industries: About three-quarters of the companies surveyed by HDE for their forecast said supply bottlenecks could hurt their sales.
Consumer electronics and household appliances may feel the pinch of the global chip shortage, but Genth said that beyond popular video game consoles, it will not lead to empty shelves.
Inflation, which at 4.5% is at its highest level in nearly three decades, could also take a bite out of German customers' gift-giving budget. 
Genth added that how the pandemic plays out over the coming months and the associated safety measures will affect whether the HDE's forecast will be borne out.
Many retailers had to close their doors last winter as the German government tried to stem the pandemic. 
""No one can afford that anymore,"" said Genth, who added that retail stores are not hotspots for the coronavirus' spread.

Output fell for a second straight month and drove the trend of lower output in central European economies heavily reliant on the car sector. On Friday, Hungary reported its first year-on-year industrial output decline since January.
Czech production slipped a bigger-than-expected 4.0% year-on-year and by 3.3% month-on-month.
The statistics office said that in the third quarter industrial production growth slowed to 0.2% year-on-year.
""September results reflect especially the reduction of production of cars and their parts,"" said Radek Matejka from the statistics office. ""However, that doesn’t alter the fact that many other (economic activities) in manufacturing continue to be rather successful and their production is on the rise.""
Car production dropped by a third in September, according to the data. 
Toyota and Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p)'s Skoda Auto both faced production halts in the month due to a shortage of chips.

1029,By Investing.com,"<span>Nov 08, 2021 12:18AM ET</span>","Chinese Exports Slow Down, but Remain Above Forecasts, in October","By Gina Lee
Investing.com – Chinese export growth beat forecasts but slowed down in October. Increasing global demand ahead of Christmas, a power crunch that is easing and improving supply chains that had been badly disrupted by COVID-19 all contributed to the growth.
Data released on Sunday showed that exports grew 27.1% year-on-year, with forecasts prepared by Investing.com predicting a 24.5% growth and a 28.1% growth reported in September.
However, the overall weakness in domestic demand cast a shadow on imports, which grew 20.6% year-on-year. Forecasts prepared by Investing.com had predicted a 25% growth, while a 17.6% growth was recorded during the previous month.
The strong exports would help to mitigate the weakening domestic economy and give the government greater room for maneuver on economic policy, Pinpoint Asset Management chief economist Zhiwei Zhang told Reuters.
""The government can afford to wait until the year-end to loosen monetary and fiscal policies, now that exports provide a buffer to smooth the economic slowdown,"" he added.
Some recent supply constraints, including a power crunch that had been triggered by a shortage of coal, tougher emission standards, and strong industrial demand, have started easing in recent weeks thanks to heavy government intervention.
Premier Li Keqiang said last week the government would take measures to support the industrial sector as the economy faces renewed downward pressures.
Meanwhile, the data also showed that the trade surplus for October was $84.54 billion, above the $65.55 billion figure in forecasts prepared by Investing.com and September’s $66.76 billion surplus."
1030,By Bloomberg,"<span>Nov 07, 2021 08:54PM ET</span>",China Trade Surplus Can Cushion But Can’t Stop Economic Slowdown,"(Bloomberg) -- China’s record trade surplus is cushioning the economy from weakening domestic demand and giving policy makers room to delay stimulus. But it won’t be enough to keep growth from slowing further.
Export growth has exceeded analyst estimates for three straight months, and the trade surplus reached $84.5 billion in October, data on Sunday showed. Problem is, gross domestic product is now so large that overseas demand can’t replace easing investment and consumer spending.
China’s economy has slowed sharply in recent months as efforts to rein in the property market ripple through industries from construction to commodities. A power crunch has forced factories to slow output, while stringent measures to curb virus outbreaks have damped consumption. 
“The government can afford to wait till the year-end to loosen monetary and fiscal policies, now that exports provide a buffer to smooth the economic slowdown,” Zhang Zhiwei, chief economist at Pinpoint Asset Management Ltd., said in a note. 
Premier Li Keqiang said last week the economy is facing “new downward pressures” and policies need to be fine-tuned to provide targeted support to areas that need it.
China’s role as the world’s largest exporter meant it benefited as demand for goods rose in the wake of the pandemic. The World Trade Organization raised its projection for global trade growth in 2021 to 10.8% from 8%, the biggest year-over-year jump since 2010. It estimates a 4.7% increase in 2022. 
The persistence of China’s export strength has surprised economists who predicted that global spending on made-in-China goods would ease as more countries re-open this year. That proved premature as the more infectious delta variant spread throughout the world. 
China’s factories won orders this year as large-scale coronavirus outbreaks in countries such as Vietnam, India and Malaysia caused factory closures. The country exported almost no vaccines pre-pandemic, but shipped vaccines worth $11.7 billion in the first nine months of the year. 
Automobile exports more than doubled so far in 2021 as the country emerged as a production hub for electric vehicle manufacturers including Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc.
Partly as a result of labor-intensive production of textiles and plastic toys relocating back to China, the nation increased its share of global trade to record levels of 14%-15% this year, according to the CBP World Trade Monitor, published on behalf of the European Commission. 
“Supply chain problems have seemingly been a blessing for China,” said Craig Botham, chief China economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.
Strong demand means China’s exporters have gained confidence to raise their prices by as much as 10%-20% year-on-year, multiple Chinese factory owners told Bloomberg News.
Economists polled by Bloomberg now expect China’s full-year export growth of over 24%. Still, trade has less of an impact now on China’s growth trajectory. 
In the first three quarters of the year, China’s exports grew 23%. Net exports contributed just 20% of China’s GDP growth over the period, a fraction compared to government and household spending on goods and services, which accounted for 65% of the expansion. 
What Bloombergs Economists Say...
China’s export growth will remain strong in the coming months, but will be “insufficient to counter domestic headwinds from power shortages and a cooling property sector.” 
--Eric Zhu
The surplus on China’s current account - a broad measure of trade - rose to its highest level since 2016 this year, but remained at just 2% of GDP in the latest quarter, well below levels of around 10% seen before the 2008 financial crisis.
While major global central banks are under pressure to roll back stimulus, the People’s Bank of China has had to balance the risk of rising inflation while boosting its economy weighed by power shortages and Covid-related curbs. The country’s Covid-zero approach had led to a tightening of restrictions around travel and social gatherings to contain frequent flare-ups of virus cases.
Fiscal policy will provide the main support to economic growth next year while significant monetary easing is unlikely, according to Huang Yiping, a former central bank adviser. The PBOC has refrained from cutting banks’ reserve requirement ratio since a reduction in July, and has kept policy interest rates steady since early last year.

1031,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 07, 2021 06:56PM ET</span>","China Oct exports beat forecasts, offer buffer to slowing economy","BEIJING (Reuters) -China's export growth slowed in October but beat forecasts, helped by booming global demand ahead of winter holiday seasons, an easing power crunch and an improvement in supply chains that had been badly disrupted by the coronavirus pandemic.
However, imports missed analysts' expectations, likely pointing to the overall weakness in domestic demand. 
Outbound shipments jumped 27.1% in October from a year earlier, slower than September's 28.1% gain. Analysts polled by Reuters had forecast growth would ease to 24.5%.
Zhiwei Zhang, chief economist at Pinpoint Asset Management, said the strong exports would help to mitigate the weakening domestic economy, and give the government greater room for manoeuvre on economic policy.
""The government can afford to wait until the year-end to loosen monetary and fiscal policies, now that exports provide a buffer to smooth the economic slowdown,"" he said.
Recent data has pointed to a slowdown in manufacturing. Factory activity shrank for a second month in October, an official survey showed, while growth in industrial output eased to the lowest since March 2020 - the first wave of the pandemic.
EASING CONSTRAINTS
However, under heavy government intervention, some supply constraints have started to ease in recent weeks, including a power crunch that had been triggered by a shortage of coal, tougher emission standards and strong industrial demand.
Premier Li Keqiang said on Tuesday the government would take measures to support the industrial sector as the economy faces renewed downward pressures.
Imports jumped 20.6% in October from a year earlier, accelerating from a 17.6% gain in September but well below expectations for a rise of 25%.
Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) data showed the value of crude oil imports grew 56.3% year-on-year, up from 34.9% in September, and the value of coal imports rose 292% on-year, accelerating further from a 234% gain in September, as the global energy crunch and post-COVID economic recovery drove up commodity prices.
China posted a trade surplus of $84.54 billion last month, the highest on record. It was also above the poll's forecast of $65.55 billion and September's $66.76 billion surplus.
The world's second largest economy grew 4.9% in the July-September quarter from a year earlier, the weakest reading since the third quarter of last year.

China's trade surplus with the United States was $40.75 billion in October, Reuters calculations based on customs data showed, down from $42 billion in September.
U.S. Trade Representative Katherine Tai pledged last month to exclude some Chinese imports from tariffs while pressing Beijing over its failure to keep some promises made in a ""Phase 1"" trade deal made under the Trump administration.

China's reserves, the world's largest, reached $3.218 trillion at the end of October, up 0.53% from a month earlier, according to data from the State Administration of Foreign Exchange (SAFE).
That was higher than the $3.197 trillion forecast in a Reuters poll of analysts and up from $3.128 trillion in October 2020. 
However, it remains lower than the $3.232 trillion at the end of August.

1034,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 05, 2021 01:36PM ET</span>",Strong U.S. payrolls brighten economic outlook; millions still missing from workforce,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. employment increased more than expected in October as the headwind from the surge in COVID-19 infections over the summer subsided, offering more evidence that economic activity was regaining momentum early in the fourth quarter.
But the brightening outlook was somewhat clouded by millions of unemployed Americans who remained at home even as companies are boosting wages, generous government-funded jobless benefits have ended and schools have reopened for in-person learning. The labor force is down 3 million from its pre-pandemic level.
""The dog days of summer are long gone and the U.S. economy is gearing up for an acceleration in growth and activity in the fourth quarter,"" said Brian Bethune, a professor of practice at Boston College. ""Demand for labor is strong, but there is an issue with matching people with the jobs that are available.""
The Labor Department's closely watched employment report's survey of establishments on Friday showed nonfarm payrolls increased by 531,000 jobs last month. Data for September was revised higher to show 312,000 jobs created instead of the previously reported 194,000. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast payrolls rising by 450,000 jobs.
Employment is 4.2 million jobs below its peak in February 2020. Job growth has averaged 582,000 per month this year.
 
(GRAPHIC: Nonfarm payrolls - https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-STOCKS/znvnekbmypl/nfpr.png)
 
President Joe Biden hailed the acceleration after two months of moderate gains, saying the nation needed to ""keep driving vaccinations up and COVID down,"" for ""our economy to fully recover."" Biden said vaccines had ""made the economy the envy of the world.""
Leisure and hospitality businesses led the broad-based increase in hiring last month, with 164,000 jobs created. Payrolls also rose in professional and business services, transportation and warehousing, healthcare, wholesale trade, financial activities as well as mining sectors.
Manufacturing added 60,000 jobs, with 28,000 of the positions at motor vehicle manufacturers, an encouraging sign for an industry that has been hobbled by a global semiconductor shortage. Construction payrolls increased by 44,000 jobs.
But state and local government education shed 65,000 jobs. The government said pandemic-related staffing fluctuations in education have distorted normal seasonal patterns, making the changes in employment in the sector challenging to interpret. Shortages of bus drivers and other support staff have been well documented. Overall government payrolls fell by 73,000 jobs.
The job gains joined rising consumer confidence and services sector activity in painting a more favorable picture of the economy, after the Delta variant of the coronavirus and economy-wide shortages of goods restricted growth in the third quarter to its slowest pace in more than a year.
The Federal Reserve on Wednesday announced it would this month start scaling back the amount of money it is pumping into the economy through monthly bond purchases.
Stocks on Wall Street rallied on the report, lifting the main indexes to record highs. The dollar rose against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury yields fell.
UNEMPLOYMENT RATE FALLS
""The solid gain in employment is consistent with a strong quarter for output growth,"" said Michael Feroli, an economist at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) in New York.
Details of the smaller survey of households, from which the unemployment rate is derived were mixed. The unemployment rate fell to a 19-month low of 4.6% from 4.8% in September. The number of people unemployed for 27 weeks or more dropped 357,000 to 2.3 million. They accounted for 31.6% of the 7.4 million people officially unemployed last month.
 
(GRAPHIC: Unemployment - https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-STOCKS/jnpwexyzepw/ue-duration.png)
 
 
But a modest 104,000 people entered the labor force last month, making it harder for employers to fill 10.4 million jobs that were open as of the end of August. The labor force participation rate, or the proportion of working-age Americans who have a job or are looking for one was unchanged at 61.6%.
It has remained within a narrow range of 61.4% to 61.7% since June 2020. A small rise in the participation rate among the prime age population and people below 24 years was offset by a drop in the 55 and over age group. Women's participation rate edged up and they took 57.3% of the jobs last month.
 
(GRAPHIC: Labor market participation - https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-STOCKS/mopanlkogva/participation.png)
 
The labor market disconnect has been blamed on caregiving needs during the pandemic, fears of contracting the coronavirus, early retirements, massive savings and career changes as well as an aging population and the recently ended expanded unemployment benefits. With many people who moved out of cities during the pandemic yet to return, there could also be a mismatch between the open jobs and location.
There are concerns that the White House's vaccine mandate, which comes into effect on Jan. 4 and applies to federal government contractors and businesses with 100 or more employees, could compound the worker shortages. There has also been a rise in strikes as workers take advantage of the tight labor market to demand more pay and better conditions.
The scramble for workers continued to boost wage growth, with average hourly earnings rising 0.4%. That lifted the annual increase to 4.9% in October, the largest gain in eight months, from 4.6% in September.

This, together with record savings should help to underpin consumer spending over the holiday session, though salaries are lagging inflation and shortages of goods abound. Some economists believe the economy is close to maximum employment.
""Unless people start flocking back into the labor market and the labor force starts to surge, we could very likely reach that level by the end of next summer, if not sooner,"" said Joel Naroff, chief economist at Naroff Economics in Holland, Pennsylvania. ""That means we could see the initial rate hike by early fall. Economists are starting to forecast two rate hikes next year and that is quite possible.""

1035,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 05, 2021 10:51AM ET</span>","Fewer U.S. workers sidelined as Delta cases began to fall, survey shows","(Reuters) - The number of U.S. workers unable to work at some point over the previous four weeks due to the COVID-19 pandemic dropped by more than a million in October, while fewer people reported not looking for jobs because of those health concerns as cases began to fall, a Labor Department survey showed on Friday.
The numbers reflect an economy that is now regaining momentum after a summer in which the Delta variant of the coronavirus dented the economy and renewed uncertainties in the labor market.
Approximately 3.83 million people were unable to work in October or reported reduced hours due to their business either closing entirely or cutting back operations, down from roughly 5.03 million in the prior month, according to the survey, resuming a downward trend that was interrupted by a rise in August. 
During the survey period, COVID-19 cases in the United States more than halved from their mid-September peak. The highly transmissible Delta variant now makes up more than 99% of cases. 
The number of people who said they did not look for work because of COVID-19 fears also declined to 1.29 million from 1.63 million the prior month, the lowest number since the pandemic began and an encouraging sign for an economy that is struggling with labor shortages.
The figures are derived from an ongoing additional survey of households carried out by the U.S. government that has accompanied the monthly jobs report since the beginning of the pandemic. 
Overall, U.S. job growth increased more than expected in October as the headwind from the surge in COVID-19 infections over the summer subsided, the main report showed, reversing two straight months of disappointing gains.

""It's a sigh of relief after the Delta variant dampened employment the past couple of months and now it’s behind us,"" said David Petrosinelli, a senior trader at InspereX in New York.
The number of people who said they teleworked recently due to the pandemic fell last month to 18.05 million from 20.35 million in September.

COMMENTS:
EDWARD MOYA, SENIOR MARKET ANALYST, OANDA, NEW YORK“Today’s number really goes to show that the US economy is accelerating and while the labor market recovery will be long it won't be lasting. You'll see this type of report be extremely positive for equities, but it doesn't really change the Fed’s thinking. Currency markets will be a little more difficult and you're going to see a lot more interesting divergences as we enter the realm of tapering.”
RICK MECKLER, PARTNER AT CHERRY LANE INVESTMENTS IN NEW VERNON, NEW JERSEY
“The positive aspect of it is that investors have been concerned about a slowdown in the economy. We've seen signs that it could be slowing, particularly given the supply chain interruptions, but the (nonfarm payrolls data) suggests that the economy is on track. Investors will take it as a positive sign to continue to invest in stocks. The other side of it, of course, is that it does nothing to cool the potential for inflation. But that seems to be a problem for another day for stock market investors where bond rates fail.
""It’s hard to understand how we can have a high unemployment rate and still have labor shortages. It suggests a real mismatch.”
DAVID PETROSINELLI, SENIOR TRADER, INSPEREX, NEW YORK
“The last couple of months the headline number was a bit disappointing, so this a catch-up number. I don't think it changes much in terms of thinking about what the Fed does in 2022 when rate lift-off is.  But it's a sigh of relief after the Delta variant dampened employment the past couple of months and now it’s behind us.
“I don't know that it changes the picture dramatically because we got tapering announced Wednesday. The one thing that's still a problem is labor participation. It's still a problem that people haven't necessarily fully re-emerged into the workforce. We will see participation go up, but that's still one of the Achilles heels of the job market. Participation is still lagging and that is going to be a headwind.
“This tells me we’re kind of hanging in this range, of 1.5% to 1.7% on the 10-year. Anything that's going to be breakout higher or lower is going to have to be an announcement or a series of announcements or data that leads us away from that. The market expected some bump in hiring. The market is comfortable with where rates are and we’ll have to wait for an inflection point.”
SIMON HARVEY, SENIOR FX MARKET ANALYST, MONEX EUROPE, LONDON
""The market's preconceptions for a strong payrolls report were vindicated with the release, which saw not only an upwards surprise in net employment in October, but a positive revision to September's disappointing reading as well."" 
""With the Fed's forward guidance on rates largely linked to the recovery in the labour market, today' s positive employment data resulted in the U.S. 2-year yield climbing over 2 basis points on the day before moderating somewhat. Widening front-end yield spread drove the reaction in FX markets, with the dollar going bid across the G10 space."" 
""We had warned of asymmetric risk heading into today's payrolls release, given the slip in September's data due to the early initial surveying window. Not only did we expect an upwards revision to last month's data for this reason, but also expected October's net employment figure to come in strong given the tailwinds from improving COVID conditions. Looking ahead, today's payroll release will likely keep the dollar elevated, until improving economic conditions and more hawkish central bank communications return towards the end of the year."" 
MICHAEL SHELDON, CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER, RDM FINANCIAL GROUP, WESTPORT, CONNECTICUT  ""The headline number is certainly quite positive for markets and gives the idea that the economy is in good shape heading into 2022 and also bestows confidence that the consumer is in a strong position to spend and support the economy."" 
""One alarming factor is the participation rate which has not improved and that indicates the job market might not be as tight as it appears on the surface.""
""The solid jobs report tells the market that the Fed made the right decision in its tapering plans and the time is right for the Fed to step away from the gas a little bit.""
JJ KINAHAN, CHIEF MARKET STRATEGIST, TD AMERITRADE, CHICAGO
“It’s hard not to like, this is a really good report overall, particularly when you look from a private sector point of view. It’s 531,000 but 73,000 jobs were lost in government so the private sector is absolutely killing it. The one number that just leaped out at me, which I think it really incredible is transportation, it is above its February 2020 level, so that is really amazing. All we hear about in transportation right now is all these supply chain issues, but at the same time we are hiring a hell of a lot more people here. Warehousing and storage up, transit and ground transportation up, air transport up, truck transport up, the only thing that decreased there was the couriers and messengers so it is truly the careers where you are gaining. That was far and away the best thing I saw in the report.” 
""Yes, there are some supply chain issues but there is so much demand they are still throwing people at that problem and you need to move goods, so at some point that bottleneck will figure itself out.” 
ZACHARY GRIFFITHS, MACRO STRATEGIST, WELLS FARGO, CHARLOTTE, NORTH CAROLINA
    ""I would think that this number would put some upward pressure, particularly on the belly of (the U.S. Treasury) curve as we sort of think the economic numbers are going to have a bigger impact from here now that (U.S. Federal Reserve) Chairman Powell has indicated they're willing to remain patient and struck a dovish tone earlier this week. They're kind of there on the inflation front and the focus is on maximum employment. So I would think that a number like this might bring back some of this market pricing that we saw yesterday as the Bank of England did the surprise hold on rates.""
PAUL NOLTE, PORTFOLIO MANAGER, KINGSVIEW INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT, CHICAGO
    ""It seems to be a very good report. Participation rate is up; it was certainly well above expectations. They revised up back months. Unemployment rate falls again. There's not a lot to complain about in the employment report.
    The knee-jerk reaction in the markets was not much. And I'm looking at the fixed income market, and I don't see a lot there, either. The 2/10 (yield) spread came in a little but not much.""
PETER CARDILLO, CHIEF MARKET ECONOMIST, SPARTAN CAPITAL SECURITIES, NEW YORK
“(The employment report) was basically inline and the unemployment rate dropped to 4.6%, but that was probably due to the participation rate ticking lower.
""Hourly wages are a little bit higher but nothing to take the wind out of this positive report. Shouldn’t have an impact on yields.
""Bottom line is it’s a good report, showing an acceleration from the previous month.
""It shows that we’re seeing the jobs market healing to the point where we could expect even larger gains next month as more people return to the labor force.""
""If these numbers continue at this pace, we could probably see full employment at the end of the first quarter.” 
TOM PORCELLI, CHIEF US ECONOMIST, RBC CAPITAL MARKETS, NEW YORK
“Everything moved in the direction you would want it to move. I think it shows some real underlying strength. What’s interesting is I don’t think you need this payroll report, though, to know that because there’s been a host of other labor market metrics that have really driven that point home, whether its ADP, or claims, or the measures of confidence that focus on the labor backdrop. I mean over the last couple of months we’ve seen some real strength here, so in some ways I almost view this payroll report as sort of a catch up, because it has been the laggard.”
JOE MANIMBO, SENIOR MARKET ANALYST, WESTERN UNION BUSINESS SOLUTIONS, WASHINGTON
""A welcome bounce back in hiring has punched the U.S. dollar's ticket to fresh highs for the year. Still, the buck could see limited upside mileage out of the data because the participation rate has not improved. The participation rate idled at 61.6% which is consistent with people being hesitant about returning to the workforce due to lingering health concerns. The market wants to see people come off the sidelines and return to the labor force.""

THOMAS HAYES, MANAGING MEMBER, GREAT HILL CAPITAL LLC, NEW YORK 
""We couldn't get more positive news. Obviously, the market was up a lot prior to this with the  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) news, but now this does feel like it's really the end of the pandemic. The next phase of improvement in the labor force is going to come from labor force participation rate increasing, and the Pfizer drug is going to be the catalyst for that.""

Nonfarm payrolls increased 531,000 last month after an upwardly revised 312,000 gain in September, a Labor Department report showed Friday. The unemployment rate fell to 4.6% while the labor force participation rate was unchanged.
The median estimate in a Bloomberg survey of economists called for a 450,000 payrolls gain and for the jobless rate to fall to 4.7%.
The faster pace of hiring shows that more Americans returned to workplaces as Covid-19 cases declined and employers offered higher wages. Some of the payroll growth may have also come after an estimated 7.5 million people lost federal expanded unemployment benefits on Sept. 6.

Retail sales, a proxy for consumer demand, in the 19 countries sharing the euro, fell 0.3% month-on-month in September and were up 2.5% from a year earlier, the European Union's statistics office said.
Economists polled by Reuters had expected a 0.3% monthly rise in retail sales and a 1.5% year-on-year increase.
Part of the month-on-month miss, however, may be down to revisions as retail sales in August were now estimated to be up 1% compared with a 0.3% rise reported earlier. 
With energy prices soaring, coronavirus infections rising and supply chain bottlenecks dragging on, consumers are expected to become even more cautious in the coming months, a trend already evident in PMI data that showed business growth slipping to a six-month low in October.
High petrol prices are also expected to curb household purchasing power, leaving families with less to spend on other goods. 

Eurostat said car fuel sales rose 1% on the month while food, drinks and tobacco sales rose 0.7%. But non food sales dropped by 1.5%, including a 1.4% decline in Internet and mail order sales.
Germany, the euro zone's biggest economy, recorded the largest, 2.5% drop in retail sales but Finland and the Netherlands were also deep in negative territory.

1040,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 05, 2021 05:55AM ET</span>",Chinese banks quicken home loan disbursement but caution prevails,"BEIJING (Reuters) - Some Chinese banks have sped up the disbursement of home loans in some cities, a relief to cash-strapped developers anxious to complete sales, but no wave of new credit is being unleashed just yet amid a heavy regulatory push to deleverage the sector. 
Authorities do not want genuine buyers to be shut out of the market or developers to face delays in receiving payments due to slow loan disbursements in a market whose health is key to the economy. 
Disbursement has also picked up after the People's Bank of China (PBOC) last month criticised some banks for their ""misunderstanding"" of its debt-control policies in the property sector.
Some lenders had held back issuance of home loans earlier in the year, concerned about being accused of creating debt bubbles at a time when the state was cracking down on new borrowing by developers that had binged on loans, bankers told Reuters. 
Loan issuance also fell after new central bank requirements capping property loans by banks in January.
A Beijing banker said banks that had not breached the caps on mortgage loan requirements had gained extra quotas to lend to home buyers recently, with regulators supportive of buyers with so-called rigid demand, referring to purchasing or renting by individuals who recently married or were seeking low-cost housing.
New home prices barely grew in October, weighed down by weak demand in major cities, a private survey showed on Monday.
A banker in Shanghai said his branch accelerated the hand-out of mortgages in the third quarter. Still, his bank was reminded by authorities that the regulatory stance remained very strict on illegal lending to the sector.
""The mortgage quota hasn't increased for us but the issuance of mortgage is speeding up,"" said another banker in Shanghai. 
The slowdown in mortgage approval has partly contributed to the financial stress faced by developers including the embattled China Evergrande Group. 
Amid ebbing cash-flows, some developers have failed to finish projects, drawing widespread complaints from home buyers and casting a chill on new purchases. 
SHORTER WAIT
""The waiting time for getting mortgages is shorter now, about three to four months compared with six months previously,"" said a realtor surnamed Liu in Shanghai.
Loan approval had also been faster due to fewer home buyers waiting in the queue, said Zhang Dawei, chief analyst with property agency Centaline.
In October, banks granted some 150 billion yuan to 200 billion yuan ($31 billion) more property loans than in September, according to a Thursday report from state-backed media outlet Cailianshe, citing unidentified sources.
Analysts also noted an acceleration in the issue of residential mortgage-backed securities (RMBS) by banks, implying banks are given another capital-raising route as they use up funds to lend to home buyers. 
""The issuance of local RMBS reached 77 billion yuan in September,"" said Huatai Securities. 
""Issuance resumed after a two-month halt and rose by a significant amount, which we see as a gesture of (regulatory) guidance.""

As of end-September, outstanding mortgage loans reached 37.37 trillion yuan ($5.84 trillion), central bank data showed.

1041,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 05, 2021 05:31AM ET</span>","Japan household spending falls, but year-end outlook less gloomy","By Kantaro Komiya
TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's household spending fell in September as consumers remained cautious about the COVID-19 pandemic, backing broad consensus that the world's third-largest economy shrank in the third quarter but pointing to an improvement towards year-end.
The data underscored the need for policymakers to shore up domestic consumption as the global supply crunch hits the export-reliant economy.
Spending fell 1.9% year-on-year in September, with the downturn easing slightly after a 3.0% decrease in August, government data showed on Friday. It was also less severe than a median market forecast for a 3.9% slide in a Reuters poll.
In seasonally adjusted month-on-month terms, spending jumped 5.0% in September, marking the first increase in five months, beating expectations for 2.8% growth.
""As the virus situation and foot traffic improved toward end of September, service spending such as entertainment and education recovered, catching up the earlier trend in goods spending,"" said Masato Koike, senior economist at Dai-ichi Life Research Institute.
Nationwide coronavirus cases decreased in September after hitting record levels in late August. The government lifted some COVID-19 curbs by end-September, but restrictions such as shorter restaurant hours and caps on large-scale events remained in place in Tokyo and other densely-populated cities until late October.
Many analysts expect the economy to have shrunk in the third quarter. The median forecast for July-September gross domestic product (GDP) growth stood at an annualised contraction of 0.8%, Reuters poll of 18 economists showed on Friday.
Beyond carmakers, supply shortages in semiconductors and other components produced in coronavirus-hit Southeast Asia have caused a ripple effect in other parts of the Japanese economy. Growth in exports has slowed while private consumption stagnated because of slumps in car sales.
The anticipated economic contraction in the third quarter ""will highlight Japan's growth lag"" compared with other major economies such as the United States and Europe, said Takeshi Minami, chief economist at Norinchukin Research Institute.
The government is due to release a preliminary estimate for July-September GDP on Nov. 15.
To prop up Japan's relatively tepid economic recovery, Prime Minister Fumio Kishida pledged earlier this week to compile a ""large-scale"" stimulus package in mid-November.
Kishida's government and ruling coalition have agreed to provide a cash payout of 100,000 yen ($879.58) to all children up to age 18 as part of the stimulus package, the Yomiuri newspaper reported on Friday.

""As consumption picks up thanks to eased virus curbs and car production cuts have bottomed out in October, the fourth-quarter GDP growth will be back to a positive territory,"" Minami said, adding the positive effect of the government's stimulus package will mostly be felt after January 2022.

It brought the average house price to 270,027 pounds ($364,374)- up 8.1% on October 2020 and marking the strongest annual growth rate for four months.
Although the Bank of England failed to raise interest rates as many investors expected on Thursday, Halifax said likely increases in borrowing costs over the coming months should dampen demand.
""That said, borrowing costs will still be low by historical standards, and raising a deposit is likely to remain the primary obstacle for many,"" said Russell Galley, managing director of Halifax.

""The impact on property prices may also be tempered by the continued limited supply of properties available on the market.""
Like other countries, Britain experienced a stampede for bigger houses outside of city centres during the COVID-19 pandemic, pushing prices higher. Temporary tax breaks on property purchases added to the boom.

1043,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 05, 2021 04:00AM ET</span>",German industrial production drops in September on supply chain shortages,"BERLIN (Reuters) - German industrial production unexpectedly fell in September, official data showed on Friday, as supply bottlenecks for raw and preliminary materials continued to take a toll on output in Europe's biggest economy.
The Federal Statistics Office said industrial output fell by 1.1% on the month after an upwardly revised drop of 3.5% in August. A Reuters poll had pointed to a rise of 1% in September.
Compared with the previous quarter, production in the manufacturing sector fell by 2.4% in the third quarter and is currently 9.5% lower than in February 2020, before measures to curb the coronavirus pandemic in Germany began.
The fall in September was driven by a drop in the production in the mechanical engineering, electrical equipment and data processing equipment sectors, the economy ministry said.
""Supply bottlenecks for raw materials and intermediate products that have been going on for a long time are being reflected on a broader front,"" the ministry said.
Thomas Gitzel, an economist at VP Bank, said Germany's industrial production outlook was bleak as companies expect material shortages to persist until the end of next year.
Rising gas and electricity prices were additional negative factors that would weigh on production, he said.

""The coming quarters will remain difficult,"" Gitzel said, adding that Germany's economic output was set to stagnate in the fourth quarter. 
""But it is also clear that when the flow of materials is up and running again, the current situation will turn into its opposite,"" he said.

JAKARTA (Reuters) - Indonesia's economic growth slowed more than expected in the third quarter as restrictions to control a deadly wave of COVID-19 weighed on activity, although recent data suggests growth may be getting back on track in the current quarter.
Southeast Asia's largest economy grew 3.51% in the July-September quarter from the same period last year, below the previous quarter's 7.07% expansion, Statistics Indonesia data showed.
Analysts polled by Reuters had expected growth to slow to 3.76%, while government officials had predicted 4.5%.
The main stock index slipped to be 0.15% down in morning trade after rising 0.3% at the open, while the rupiah weakened.
Authorities in Indonesia imposed strict mobility restrictions in July to August in response to a spike in COVID-19 infections.
The virus containment measures hit household consumption, which slowed to 1% in the third quarter from 6% in the previous three months. Private consumption accounts for more than half of the country's gross domestic product.
Exports contributed the most to GDP expansion on the back of an upcycle in commodity prices.
""3Q likely marked the trough for the year, with 4Q growth likely to strengthen as the caseload has since receded and vaccination ramped up, allowing for restrictions to be unwound,"" said Radhika Rao, economist with DBS.
More recent data has shown the economic recovery has regained momentum after curbs were gradually eased in late August, with the manufacturing purchasing managers' index (PMI) at an all-time high last month as business disruptions eased.
However, Finance Minister Sri Mulyani Indrawati has warned that rising global inflation, China's economic slowdown and the prospect of monetary tightening in the United States and the European Union could affect Indonesia's growth outlook.
A drop in coal prices could also dampen the contribution to GDP from exports in the fourth quarter, said Josua Pardede, economist at Bank Permata.
""Going forward, economic growth has to come from the private sector, given that the government is planning to reduce its fiscal deficit level,"" said Fakhrul Fulvian, economist of Jakarta brokerage Trimegah Sekuritas.
The government has said it plans to narrow the budget deficit to 4.85% of GDP in 2022 from about 5.4% this year.
The central bank has also announced plans to unwind its ultra loose monetary policy by gradually reducing the size of excess liquidity in the banking system next year and consider a rate hike at end-2022.

DBS's Rao said Bank Indonesia may have to tighten monetary policy sooner if the Federal Reserve frontloads U.S. rate hikes.
Before the data release, Sri Mulyani had expected full-year GDP growth of 4%, while the central bank's latest forecast was 3.5% to 4.3%. Indonesia's economy shrank 2.07% last year, the first contraction since 1998, due to the impact of the pandemic.

MANILA (Reuters) - Philippine annual inflation slowed to a three-month low in October, giving the central bank room to keep its policy accommodative for some time to support economic recovery.
The Consumer Price Index rose 4.6% last month from a year earlier, decelerating from 4.8% in September as lower food inflation offset higher energy costs, government data on Friday showed.
October inflation came in near the bottom end of the central bank's 4.5%-5.3% forecast, and below the 4.9% median estimate in a Reuters poll.
Core inflation, which excludes volatile food and fuel prices, picked up to 3.4% from 3.3% in September.
Inflation averaged 4.5% in January-October, above the year's 2%-4% target range of the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP).
While inflation is likely to remain elevated and driven by supply-side pressures for the remaining months of 2021, the BSP expects the headline number to return to the same target band in 2022 and 2023.
BSP Governor Benjamin Diokno, in a statement, reiterated the central bank would keep policy accommodative for as long as necessary to guide the economy to recovery.
The BSP has kept its benchmark rate steady at a record low 2.0% since November.
""We are still, for core inflation, within the 2%-4% and that gives the central bank the space to still keep the accommodative policy,"" BDO Unibank chief market strategist Jonathan Ravelas told news channel ANC.
The BSP, meanwhile, said the schedule of its policy announcement will move to 3 p.m. (0700 GMT) from 4 p.m. to align practices with other central banks, which typically announce decisions during trading hours.

The new scheduled takes effect starting with the Nov. 18 policy meeting.
Separately, the statistics agency said the country recorded a trade deficit of nearly $4 billion in September, the biggest since January 2019, as imports rose faster than exports.

OTTAWA (Reuters) -Canada's exports fell in September as a semi-conductor chip shortage weighed on motor vehicle and parts production, though that decline was partially offset by record high crude oil exports, Statistics Canada data showed on Thursday.
Imports were down 3.0%, also hit hard by the worsening supply chain issues for motor vehicle and parts. Canada's trade surplus with the world, meanwhile, rose to C$1.86 billion ($1.50 billion), beating expectations of C$1.55 billion.
""The real message here is not demand, demand is very strong. The real issue here is supply chains, and now they're starting to bite on overall trade activity really hard,"" said Peter Hall, chief economist at Export Development Canada.
Hall added that those issues were likely to continue weighing on Canada's manufacturers, particularly the auto sector, for months to come.
""This is just creating chaos,"" he said. ""The best indication that we got (of when) things would actually start to settle down is mid of next year. That's a long way away.""
Exports of motor vehicles and parts fell 17.9% in September from August, while exports of energy products rose 6.1%, buoyed by high crude prices. Imports of motor vehicles and parts were down 13.6% on the month. 
While the decline in imports is technically positive for economic growth, economists noted that the two-way trade slump shows the direness of the supply chain bottlenecks.
""The slump in trade in both directions is a concern as it demonstrates just how big an impact that supply constraints are having, particularly on the motor vehicle sector,"" said Paul Ashworth, chief North America economist for Capital Economics.

Capital Economics expects third-quarter annualized GDP growth of little more than 2%, well below the Bank of Canada's 5.5% projection. 
The Canadian dollar was trading 0.3% lower at 1.2425 to the greenback, or 80.48 U.S. cents as the U.S. dollar rallied against a basket of major currencies.

1047,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 04, 2021 12:26PM ET</span>",U.S. labor market tightening; wage costs accelerating,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits fell to the lowest level in nearly 20 months last week, suggesting the economy was regaining momentum amid a significant improvement in public health, though supply constraints remain.
The tightening labor market is driving up wages as companies scramble for workers, contributing to keeping inflation high. Labor costs surged in the third quarter, other data showed on Thursday, with productivity sinking at its steepest pace in 40 years. The Federal Reserve announced on Wednesday that it would this month start scaling back the amount of money it is pumping into the economy through monthly bond purchases. 
""Firms are reluctant to lay off workers with strong demand and labor in short supply,"" said Gus Faucher, chief economist at PNC Financial (NYSE:PNC) in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. ""The big open question is what is happening to the millions of people who lost their benefits in September, or saw their benefits drop.""
Initial claims for state unemployment benefits fell 14,000 to a seasonally adjusted 269,000 for the week ended Oct. 30, the Labor Department said. That was the lowest level since the middle of March in 2020, when mandatory business closures were being enforced to slow the first wave of COVID-19 infections. Claims have now declined for five straight weeks.
There were significant declines in filings in Missouri and Florida, which offset increases in California and Kentucky. 
Claims in Kentucky were likely boosted by temporary layoffs in the automobile sector as motor vehicle manufacturers cut production because of a scarcity of semiconductors. 
The summer wave of infections driven by the Delta variant has subsided, encouraging more Americans to travel, dine out, frequent sporting venues and engage in other activities that were curtailed by the resurgence in cases. The Delta variant and shortages of goods contributed to restricting economic growth to its slowest pace in more than a year last quarter. 
Claims, which have declined from a record high of 6.149 million in early April 2020, are now in a range that is generally viewed as consistent with a healthy labor market. 
The number of people continuing to receive benefits after an initial week of aid dropped 134,000 to 2.105 million in the week ended Oct. 23, also the lowest level since the middle of March in 2020. The number of people receiving aid has declined by about 75% since early September when enhanced government-funded benefits expired.
Falling claims augur well for October's employment report, which is due on Friday. According to a Reuters survey of economists, nonfarm payrolls likely rose by 450,000 jobs. The economy created 194,000 jobs in September, the fewest in nine months.
Stocks on Wall Street were mostly higher. The dollar rose against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury yields fell. 
(GRAPHIC: Jobless benefits rolls fall further - https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-ECONOMY/lgpdwnwabvo/chart_eikon.jpg) 
WORKER SHORTAGE
Expectations for an acceleration in job gains were bolstered by the ADP National Employment Report on Wednesday, which showed strong growth in private payrolls in October. The Conference Board's labor market differential - derived from data on consumers' views on whether jobs are plentiful or hard to get - hit a 21-year high.
But relentless worker shortages remain an obstacle. Caregiving needs during the pandemic, fears of contracting the coronavirus, early retirements and career changes as well as an aging population left businesses with 10.4 million unfilled jobs as of the end of August. 
Fed Chair Jerome Powell told reporters on Wednesday that ""these impediments to labor supply should diminish with further progress on containing the virus, supporting gains in employment and economic activity."" 
There are concerns that the White House's vaccine mandate, which comes into effect on Jan. 4 and applies to federal government contractors and businesses with 100 or more employees, could add to the worker shortages. 
A report on Thursday from global outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas showed job cuts announced by U.S.-based employers increased 27.5% in October to 22,822, the highest since May. It said 22% of the layoffs were people who refused to be vaccinated as required by their companies.
""The issue could push people out of the labor force or slow re-entry as people extend their searches for either employers not enforcing the mandate or workplaces where it doesn't apply,"" said Ryan Sweet, a senior economist at Moody's (NYSE:MCO) Analytics in West Chester, Pennsylvania.
With workers scarce, companies are raising wages. A second report from the Labor Department on Thursday showed unit labor costs, the price of labor per single unit of output, accelerated at an 8.3% annualized rate in the third quarter after rising at a 1.1% pace in the April-June quarter. 
(GRAPHIC: Labor costs surge, but inflation taxes worker earnings - https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-ECONOMY/zgpomkmyzpd/chart_eikon.jpg) 
Labor costs rose at a 4.8% rate compared to a year ago. The government reported last week that wage growth in the third quarter was the largest on record. Strong wage gains, together with rising rents, pose a challenge to the Fed's narrative that high inflation is transitory.
""The rise will add to concerns about inflation becoming more entrenched and/or the growing risk to profits, as businesses are not able to offset higher wage costs via productivity gains,"" said Sarah House, a senior economist at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) in Charlotte, North Carolina.

Worker productivity fell at a 5.0% rate last quarter, the biggest drop since the second quarter of 1981.
A third report from the Commerce Department showed the trade deficit surged 11.2% to a record $80.9 billion in September.

The Commerce Department said that the trade gap surged 11.2% to a record $80.9 billion. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast an $80.5 billion deficit. 
Exports tumbled 3.0% to $207.6 billion in September. Goods exports plunged 4.7% to $142.7 billion. The decline was led by industrial supplies, with crude oil exports decreasing $1.0 billion. Capital goods exports also fell. But consumer goods exports were the highest on record. 
Imports rose 0.6% to a record $288.5 billion. Goods imports rose 0.8% to $240.9 billion, also a record high. Imports of industrial supplies and materials were the highest since April 2014. Capital goods imports set record highs, as did non-petroleum imports and imports of other goods. 

Imports are likely to remain high as businesses rebuild depleted inventories.
Trade subtracted from gross domestic product growth in the third quarter, helping to restrain economic growth to a 2% annualized rate, the slowest in more than a year. The trade gap has been a drag on GDP growth for five straight quarters.

The Labor Department said on Thursday that unit labor costs, the price of labor per single unit of output, increased at an 8.3% annualized rate last quarter after rising at a 1.1% pace in the April-June quarter. Outside the coronavirus distortions in 2020, the jump in labor costs last quarter was the largest since the first quarter of 2014. 
Labor costs advanced at a 4.8% rate compared to a year ago.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast unit labor costs accelerating at a 7.0% pace. 
The report followed on the heels of news last month that wage growth in the third quarter was the largest on record. The pandemic has upended labor market dynamics, leading to 10.4 million job openings as of the end of August.
Strong wage gains, together with rising rents, challenge the Federal Reserve's narrative that high inflation is transitory.
Inflation is well above the Fed's 2% target. The U.S. central bank announced on Wednesday that it would start trimming its monthly bond purchases this month, but held to its belief about high inflation being transitory. 

Hourly compensation increased at a 2.9% rate in the third quarter after rising at a 3.5% pace in the prior period. The surge in labor costs came at the expense of worker productivity, which fell at a 5.0% rate last quarter. That was the biggest drop since the second quarter of 1981 and followed a 2.4% growth pace in the April-June period. 
Economists had expected productivity would drop at 3.0% rate. Compared to the third quarter of 2020, productivity fell at a 0.5% rate. Hours worked increased at a 7.0% rate last quarter, up from the 5.9% pace logged in the second quarter.

1051,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 04, 2021 06:31AM ET</span>",Euro zone business growth slipped to six-month low in Oct as price pressures soared,"By Shrutee Sarkar and Jonathan Cable
BENGALURU/LONDON (Reuters) - Euro zone business growth slipped to a six-month low in October as supply chain bottlenecks and logistical issues related to the COVID-19 pandemic pushed input prices to rise at the fastest rate in over two decades, a survey showed.
Government restrictions are being lifted in the currency bloc but shortages of raw materials in the manufacturing sector are impacting growth and the pent-up demand unleashed across the services industry is waning.
IHS Markit's Flash Composite Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI), a good gauge of overall economic health, fell to a six-month low of 54.2 in October from 56.2 in September, just below an earlier 54.3 ""flash"" estimate.
""The PMIs suggest the euro zone's economic recovery will slow markedly in Q4 as supply shortages intensified throughout the region, especially for manufacturers,"" said Jessica Hinds at Capital Economics.
""They also show that price pressures are building, even in the periphery.""
A Reuters poll last month suggested growth in the bloc would slow to 1.1% this quarter after expanding 2.0% in Q3.
The services PMI index fell to a six-month low of 54.6 in October from 56.4, a notch lower than the preliminary estimate of 54.7 but still comfortably above the 50 mark separating growth from contraction.
Demand weakened though and the new business index dropped to 55.1 from 55.3.
While euro zone manufacturing activity remained strong last month it was curtailed by supply chain bottlenecks, a survey showed on Tuesday. 
Those bottlenecks have caused the costs of raw materials to soar and the composite input prices index climbed to 73.2 from 70.9, by far the highest since the survey began in mid-1998.
""Inflation will peak at 4.5%. That is very high but likely to abate over the course of next year, we already see promising signs in container shipping for instance,"" said Holger Schmieding at Berenberg.
The supply constraints meant growth slowed in Germany, Europe's largest economy, for a third month and it was a similar picture in France, Spain and Italy.
In Britain, outside the currency union, businesses reported faster growth, data showed on Wednesday, but the Bank of England is likely to be worried about record rises in the costs faced by businesses, which are being passed on to consumers.

The BoE will deliver its most eagerly awaited policy decision in years on Thursday. The bank must choose whether to nudge borrowing costs up from an all-time low or say it is waiting to ensure the post-lockdown economy is ready for a rate hike.
In the United States, a measure of services industry activity surged to a record high last month as declining COVID-19 cases boosted demand although businesses remained burdened by snarled supply chains and the resulting exorbitant prices.

The European Union's statistics office Eurostat estimated that prices at factory gates in the 19 countries sharing the euro rose 2.7% month-on-month in September for a 16.0% year-on-year jump, in the biggest increases ever recorded for the bloc.
The jump also exceeded expectations, as economists polled by Reuters had forecast a 2.2% monthly rise and a 15.2% surge on the year.
Producers' prices rose sharply amid a fast economic recovery after the most acute phase of the COVID-19 pandemic, a tightening of global supply chains, and a jump in gas prices.
Energy prices rose 7.7% month-on-month for a 40.7% year-on-year surge, accelerating their increase. However, total industry prices excluding energy rose only 0.6% on the month, slowing from previous months.

The rise in industrial prices mirrors the surge of consumer prices which increased in the bloc annually 3.4% in September, according to Eurostat, which has estimated a 4.1% surge in October.
Producer price rises usually translate into higher prices for consumers that the European Central Bank wants to keep rising at around 2%. The bank and euro zone finance ministers expect the inflation spike to pass in coming months and inflation to slow in 2022.

The IHS Markit/CIPS UK Construction Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) rose to 54.6 in October from 52.6 in September, which was its lowest reading since January. A Reuters poll of economists had pointed to a decline to 52.0.
""There were widespread reports that shortages of materials and staff had disrupted work on site, while rising fuel and energy prices added to pressure on costs. Nonetheless, the worst phase of the supply crunch may have passed,"" IHS Markit economics director Tim Moore said.
The proportion of construction companies reporting delays from suppliers dropped to 54% from 63%, and growth quickened across the housing, commercial and civil engineering sectors, the survey showed.
It added to signs ahead of the Bank of England's interest decision on Thursday that the slowdown in Britain's economy may have moderated last month, with a similar survey of services companies on Wednesday showing a pick-up in growth.
A separate survey from the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors showed strong orders - especially for infrastructure projects - but construction firms in the third quarter grappled with rising cost pressures and skill shortages.

The IHS Markit survey also pointed to widespread reports of cost increases among construction companies in October, but to the smallest extent for six months.
The all-sector PMI - a combined reading of this week's manufacturing, services and construction surveys - rose to a three-month high of 57.5 in October, up from 54.7 in September.

The Food and Agriculture Organization's (FAO) food price index, which tracks international prices of the most globally traded food commodities, averaged 133.2 points last month compared with a revised 129.2 for September.
The September figure was previously given as 130.0.
The October reading was the highest for the index since July 2011. On a year-on-year basis, the index was up 31.3% in October.
Agricultural commodity prices have risen steeply in the past year, driven by harvest setbacks and strong demand.
The FAO's cereal price index rose by 3.2% in October from the previous month. That was led by a 5% jump in wheat prices, which climbed for a fifth consecutive month to reach their highest since November 2012, FAO said.
""Tighter availability in global markets due to reduced harvests in major exporters, especially Canada, the Russian Federation and the United States of America, continued to put upward pressure on prices,"" FAO said of wheat.
Wheat futures started November at new peaks, with U.S. prices at fresh highs since 2012 and Paris front-month futures at a record high as import demand remained brisk. [GRA/] [GRA/TEND]
World vegetable oil prices jumped 9.6% on the month to set a record high, supported by further strength in palm oil prices as labour shortages in Malaysia continued to hamper production, FAO said. [POI/]
In contrast, global sugar prices eased 1.8% in October, ending a run of six straight monthly rises, according to FAO.
Rome-based FAO cut its projection of global cereal production in 2021, to 2.793 billion tonnes from 2.800 billion estimated a month ago, according to its cereal supply and demand outlook.
That mainly reflected reduced wheat output estimates for Iran, Turkey and the United States, offsetting an increased forecast for coarse grain production.

Expected world cereal output would still represent a record, but would trail projected demand, leading to a fall in forecast cereal stocks, FAO said.
Demand was supported by a raised projection of global cereal trade to a new record, bolstered by increased wheat trade.

IHS Markit's final Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) for services showed activity in the sector dropped to a six-month low at 52.4 in October from 56.2 in the previous month.
The composite PMI index, which comprises both the services and manufacturing sectors, fell to 52.0 from 55.5 in September.
The figures suggest the economy is likely to lose further momentum in the final three months of the year after gross domestic product expanded by a weaker-than-expected 1.8% quarter-on-quarter from July through September, IHS Markit economist Phil Smith said.
In addition to supply problems, service providers reported staffing capacity constraints which were also holding back activity, though overall job creation remained robust in the sector.

Price pressures intensified further in the services sector, propelled by a jump in energy costs.

Data compiler IHS Markit said its Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) for the country's dominant services sector rose to 56.6 points in October from 56.2 in September, in line with an initial ""flash"" forecast of 56.6.
But a composite PMI index, which includes the services and manufacturing sectors, fell to 54.7 points in October from 55.3 in September as supply-chain issues caused partly by strict COVID-19 controls which have affected ports hit manufacturing. 
That PMI was also in line with an initial estimate of 54.7.
The PMIs remained above the 50-point threshold dividing an expansion in activity from a contraction. But IHS Markit senior economist Joe Hayes warned that the economic recovery was becoming highly disjointed due to supply issues.

""Services output is still rising at a relatively sharp rate by historical standards as activity levels within the economy return to pre-pandemic levels,"" Hayes said. ""Demand conditions are still robust, and firms are adding more staff to the payroll.""
""However, we cannot ignore what's happening over in the manufacturing sector,"" he added.

Some 52% of the more than 3,200 companies with offices abroad said they were satisfied with their business abroad, and 56% said they expected conditions to improve over the next 12 months.
Despite reporting improved business conditions, 50% of surveyed firms cited higher energy and raw material prices as risks to the global economy over the next 12 months.

1060,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 04, 2021 04:13AM ET</span>",German industrial orders rebound less than expected in September,"BERLIN (Reuters) -Higher demand from abroad drove a weaker-than-expected rise in German industrial orders in September following a plunge in the previous month, suggesting that factories in Europe's largest economy could hike output once supply bottlenecks ease.
Orders for goods ""Made in Germany"" were up 1.3% on the month after a revised fall of 8.8% in August, seasonally adjusted figures from the Federal Statistics Office showed on Thursday.
A Reuters poll of analysts had pointed to a rise of 2% on the month.
Excluding orders for large-ticket items, bookings were up by only 0.2% on the month in September.
Demand from countries outside the euro zone jumped by nearly 15%, more than offsetting weaker orders from domestic and other clients in the euro zone.
The economy ministry said the industrial orders data of the past months had been distorted by unusually large orders for goods such as planes and ships which massively pushed up the headline figure in June and July.
""All in all, orders in manufacturing were at a high level and exceeded their pre-crisis level of the fourth quarter of 2019 by roughly 13% in the third quarter,"" the ministry said. 
Analysts said the supply chain problems in manufacturing and the lack of microchips in the automobile industry in particular were dampening recent orders activity.
""Without the persistent material shortages, the rise would probably have been higher,"" Alexander Krueger from Bankhaus Lampe said.

With backlogs remaining high and demand still strong, the outlook for the industry remained good, but factories could only process orders if supply logistics improved, he added.
The government has cut its growth forecast for this year to 2.6% but raised its estimate for next year to 4.1% as the supply bottlenecks for semiconductors and rising energy costs delay Germany's recovery.

The government in September ended state of emergency curbs imposed to contain the health crisis, as new cases and deaths came down rapidly that month and the burden on the medical system eased.
""Japanese service sector firms reported that activity returned to expansion territory for the first time in nearly two years,"" said Usamah Bhatti, economist at IHS Markit, whichcompiled the survey.
""Firms continued to build capacity in anticipation of a gradual recovery in demand, despite the rate of job creation easing to a three-month low.""
The final au Jibun Bank Japan Services Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) rose to a seasonally adjusted 50.7 from the previous month's 47.8, matching a flash reading.
That meant services sector activity stayed above the 50.0 threshold that separates contraction from expansion for the first time since January 2020, before the economy went through its deep COVID-19 slump.
The 20 months of decline was the longest such streak since a 27-month run through March 2010, during the global financial crisis.
Some economists hope a stronger recovery in service sector sentiment will offset a slowdown in output and exports, which are being hit by a persistent global chip and parts supply shortage.

The PMI survey showed the services sector saw the biggest jump in input prices since November 2019, while new and outstanding business remained in contraction despite the expansion in overall business activity.
The composite PMI, which is calculated using both manufacturing and services, expanded for the first time in six months, rising to 50.7 from September's final of 47.9.

1062,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 03, 2021 08:37PM ET</span>",Small UK factories say staff shortages are raising pay pressure,"By Andy Bruce
LONDON (Reuters) - More than half of small British manufacturers feel under pressure to pay staff more because of labour shortages caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and Brexit, a survey showed on Thursday.
The report from consultancies South West Manufacturing Advisory Services (SWMAS) and the Manufacturing Growth Programme (MGP) showed most small- and medium-sized manufacturers had lost skilled staff during the pandemic.
With only a small minority able to find replacement workers, 60% of manufacturers said they either had or would have to increase pay to attract staff.
The Bank of England has been watching pay pressures carefully ahead of Thursday's interest rate decision - a task made more difficult by distortions to official pay data caused by the pandemic.
While wages have risen sharply in some industries like haulage, construction and manufacturing, most workers have not seen significant increases in pay. 
Around 40% of respondents in Thursday's survey cited a shortage of European Union workers after Brexit as a key driver behind the scarcity of labour.
British Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said Brexit will help to build a high growth, high pay economy, aided by new restrictions on immigration. 
But economists have warned that pay increases caused by labour shortages will only hurt the competitiveness of British companies - unless a way can be found to raise productivity, a goal that has proved elusive over the last decade.
There were already signs that the cost of supply chain problems and labour shortages had started to hurt profit margins, even though companies expect future sales to improve, Thursday's survey showed.
The ongoing supply chain challenges meant many businesses have had to reallocate and add additional resources to address these issues, said Nick Golding, managing director at SWMAS.

""In fact, respondents are currently having to commit an average of two full-time employees to manage suppliers and customers, a number that often equates to between 5-10% of a SME manufacturer's workforce,"" he said.
Still, 64% of respondents said they expected to expand over the next six months and 52% said they would invest more in equipment.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A measure of U.S. services industry activity surged to a record high in October likely as declining COVID-19 cases boosted demand, but businesses remained burdened by snarled supply chains and the resulting exorbitant prices.
The significantly improved public health picture appears to be lifting the labor market, with other data on Wednesday showing an acceleration in private payrolls growth last month. The reports suggested the economy was regaining momentum early in the fourth quarter after being restrained by the Delta variant of the coronavirus and shortages last quarter. 
""The recovery is continuing in the fourth quarter, but supply-chain disruptions and hiring difficulties will continue to constrain growth,"" said Gus Faucher, chief economist at PNC Financial (NYSE:PNC) in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. ""Labor supply should pick up in the months ahead, but it will take months for supply chains to return to normal.""
The Institute for Supply Management said its non-manufacturing activity index vaulted to a reading of 66.7 last month. That was the highest since the series started in 1997 and followed a 61.9 reading in September. A reading above 50 indicates growth in the services sector, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast that the index would edge up to 62.0. The summer wave of infections driven by the Delta variant has subsided, encouraging more consumption of services like air travel and dining out. 
""Demand shows no signs of slowing,"" said Anthony Nieves, chair of the ISM services business survey committee. ""However, ongoing challenges, including supply chain disruptions and shortages of labor and materials, are constraining capacity and impacting overall business conditions.""
The ISM survey's measure of new orders received by services businesses soared to a record last month. Spending is shifting from goods to services. Strengthening demand for services boosted hiring in the leisure/hospitality sector, leading to a pick-up in private payrolls. 
Private employment increased by 571,000 jobs last month after advancing by 523,000 in September, the ADP National Employment Report showed. Businesses in the leisure/hospitality industry added 185,000 jobs. Manufacturing employment increased by 53,000 jobs, while construction hiring rose by 54,000. 
Economists had forecast private payrolls would rise by 400,000 jobs. The ADP report is jointly developed with Moody's (NYSE:MCO) Analytics and was published ahead of the Labor Department's employment report for October, which is due on Friday. But it has a poor record predicting the private payrolls count in the Bureau of Labor Statistics' more comprehensive and closely watched employment report because of methodology differences.
Still, the report was consistent with an improvement in other labor market indicators in October, leaving economists confident that overall job growth picked up in October, though persistent worker shortages remain a challenge. There were 10.4 million job openings at the end of August. 
According to a Reuters poll of economists, private payrolls likely increased by 400,000 jobs in October. With government hiring anticipated to have rebounded by 50,000, that would lead to overall payrolls rising by 450,000 jobs. The economy created 194,000 jobs in September, the fewest in nine months.
U.S. stocks were trading mixed. The dollar slipped against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices fell.
WORSENING SHORTAGES
Part of the jump in the ISM services sector index in October reflected longer delivery times. The survey's measure of supplier deliveries accelerated to a reading of 75.6 from 68.8 in September. A reading above 50 indicates slower deliveries. 
A lengthening in suppliers' delivery times is normally associated with a strong economy and increased customer demand, which would be a positive contribution to the ISM non-manufacturing index. In this instance, however, slower supplier deliveries indicate perennial pandemic-related shortages.
That was underscored by the survey's measure of prices paid by services industries, which raced to 82.9 from a reading of 77.5 in September. Longer delivery times and higher prices mirrored the findings of the ISM's manufacturing survey published on Monday and added to signs that high inflation could be persistent.
The Federal Reserve announced on Wednesday that it would start trimming its monthly bond purchases this month, but held to its belief about high inflation being transitory. Inflation is well above the Fed's flexible 2% target. 
The government reported last week a record surge in wage growth in the third quarter. A report on Tuesday showed the residential rental vacancy rate fell last quarter. Wages and rents are the most sticky components of inflation. 
With raw materials and labor in short supply, unfinished work at services industries continued to pile up.
Though the ISM survey's measure of services industry employment dropped for a third straight month, it remained in expansion territory. At face value, that suggests national job growth remained moderate in October.

But signs the labor market recovery is regaining traction are mounting. Initial claims for unemployment benefits have dropped below 300,000 for the first time since the coronavirus pandemic barreled through the United States about 20 months ago. 
The Conference Board's labor market differential - derived from data on consumers' views on whether jobs are plentiful or hard to get - hit a 21-year high.

The Commerce Department said on Wednesday that factory orders increased 0.2% in September. Data for August was revised down to show orders rising 1.0% instead of 1.2% as previously reported. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast factory orders unchanged. Orders gained 17.6% on a year-on-year basis.
Manufacturing, which accounts for 12% of the economy, is being driven by still-strong demand for goods despite spending shifting back to services. Businesses are rebuilding depleted inventories, but shortages of labor and raw materials stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic remain challenges. 
The widespread shortages restrained economic growth to its slowest pace in more than a year in the third quarter.
An Institute for Supply Management survey on Monday showed manufacturing activity slowed in October, with all industries reporting record-long lead times for raw materials.
The rise in factory goods orders in September was led by machinery, primary metals and fabricated metal products. But orders for computers and electronic products, transportation equipment as well as electrical equipment, appliances and components fell, likely because of a global chip shortage.
Shipments increased 0.6% after gaining 0.1% in August. Inventories at factories shot up 0.8% in September. Unfilled orders at factories increased 0.7% after rising 0.9% in August.
The Commerce Department also reported that orders for non-defense capital goods, excluding aircraft, which are seen as a measure of business spending plans on equipment, increased 0.8% as reported last month.

That suggests a potential rebound in business spending on equipment after it contracted in the third quarter after four straight quarters of double-digit growth, though inflation could cut into the gains. 
Shipments of these so-called core capital goods, which are used to calculate business equipment spending in the GDP report, rose 1.4% as previously reported.

Businesses’ payrolls increased by 571,000 last month, after a revised 523,000 gain in September, according to ADP Research Institute data released Wednesday. The median forecast in a Bloomberg survey of economists called for a 400,000 rise.
Companies are desperate to hire workers as labor shortages continue to plague production and boost prices. Still, total employment measured by ADP remains well below its pre-pandemic level, suggesting higher wages and sign-on bonuses aren’t doing enough to attract and retain talent in a labor market where jobseekers are increasingly choosy.
The data precede Friday’s monthly employment report from the Labor Department, which is forecast to show that private payrolls increased by 408,000 in October. While the ADP figures don’t always follow the same pattern as the Labor Department’s data, the acceleration could point to a strong October report.
Broad Advances
Service-provider employment increased 458,000 in October, the most since June, led by payrolls at leisure and hospitality companies and professional and business firms.
Payrolls at goods producers rose by 113,000, reflecting the biggest advances in construction and manufacturing hiring since September 2020.
“The job market is revving back up as the Delta-wave of the pandemic winds down,” Mark Zandi, chief economist of Moody’s Analytics, said in a statement. “As long as the pandemic remains contained, more big job gains are likely in coming months.
Companies with more than 1,000 workers added 305,000 people to payrolls, while small businesses posted a gain of 115,000.

The hospitality sector led job creation, accounting for just over 25,000 of the 102,474 positions added over the month, Social Security Ministry data showed, continuing a hiring spree at bars and restaurants seen in the third quarter.
After a dismal summer for tourism last year, widespread vaccinations and looser restrictions allowed for a tentative recovery this year. 
Some 4.7 million foreign travellers visited in September, up four-fold from last year but around half pre-pandemic levels, with numbers continuing to hold up later into the season as restrictions also ease elsewhere making holidays more appealing.
Speaking on Cadena Ser Radio, Economy Minister Nadia Calvino described the latest employment statistics as ""very positive"".
""We expect this trend to continue to accelerate over the course of November,"" she said, adding that employment had recovered to pre-pandemic levels.
The number of registered jobseekers edged down 0.02% from September, Labour Ministry data showed, slowing sharply from previous months' declines but marking the first time unemployment has fallen in October since 1975.
By sectors, joblessness fell in services, construction and industry but jumped by 5.1% in agriculture, the data showed.
Overall, some 3.26 million people remain out of work, about 570,000 fewer than a year ago. Third-quarter jobs data released last week showed more than 20 million people were working in Spain for the first time since 2008.

Despite optimism over the solid employment figures, Spain's economic recovery appears shakier than previously thought. 
Third-quarter economic growth missed expectations after an weak second quarter and inflation is at its highest rate in three decades, potentially jeopardising the government's target to return to pre-pandemic output levels by the end of the year.

Mortgage lender Nationwide said house prices rose by 0.7% in monthly terms in October after a 0.2% rise in September. A Reuters poll of economists had pointed to another 0.2% increase.
The increase left house prices 9.9% higher than a year previously, although this marked the weakest annual growth rate since April.
Overall the survey underlined the strength of Britain's housing market during the COVID-19 pandemic. Even the gradual withdrawal of tax breaks on property purchases over the last few months has failed to seriously dampen momentum.

""There were growing concerns among firms that supply disruption will intensify in the coming months and potentially limit the economic recovery, leading to a substantial fall in output expectations from September's record high,"" IHS Markit said.
""Difficulty acquiring a vast array of raw materials and components forced non-oil companies in Egypt to reduce their output levels."" 
Input stocks fell by their fastest since June 2020 as firms drew down inventories to support business activity, IHS Markit added. 
The sub-index for future output expectations tumbled to 65.0 from 85.7 in September with the worsening supply chain disruption apparently weighing heavily on firms. 
""Firms were particularly concerned that high inflation could lead to a slump in demand and reverse the economic recovery,"" IHS Markit economist David Owen said.

""New order growth ticked down from September's recent high but remained strong, particularly compared to those seen since the start of the pandemic.""
Non-oil private firms in Saudi Arabia continued to have a positive outlook for future business, with hopes pinned on expectations of further improvement in demand. The sentiment was the second highest of the year but slightly weaker than in September and still below the series average since April 2012.

""The rate of purchase cost inflation sharpened during October, giving further signs that rising commodity prices are feeding through to firms' balance sheets.

The seasonally adjusted IHS Markit UAE Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI), leapt to 55.7 in October from 53.3 in September on the back of higher spending and tourism. 
It was above the 50.0 mark that separates expansion from contraction and the first reading since the start of the pandemic that was above the series average, now at 54.1.
""The Expo 2020 finally began in the UAE at the start of October and brought a highly welcome upsurge in growth across the non-oil private sector,"" said David Owen, economist at survey compiler IHS Markit. Expo was delayed for a year due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
The output sub-index rose to 61.1 in October from 57.1 in September while new orders also rose markedly compared to September's reading.
""The increases in both output and new business were sharp and the most marked since July 2019. In addition, the boost to sales led more companies to predict a rise in activity over the next 12 months, as optimism jumped to the highest level since the beginning of the pandemic,"" Owen said.
Business capacity in the non-oil sector was under renewed pressure due to rising new orders, leading to a fourth consecutive month of growing backlogs of work, albeit expanding at a marginally softer pace than in September.

Growth in the employment sub-index was slight and only a notch higher than in September, remaining below the series average.
""The key test for the UAE economy will be whether this initial uplift in demand from the Expo can be sustained over the coming months.

Investing.com – China’s services sector activity expanded at a faster pace in October as demand remained strong. However, rising inflation weighed on business confidence for the year ahead.
Data released earlier in the day showed that the Caixin services purchasing managers index (PMI) was 53.8, higher than the 53.4 recorded during the previous month. The index remained above the 50-mark indicating growth.
The data from the private survey, which focuses more on small firms in coastal regions, contrasted with the National Bureau of Statistic’s non-manufacturing PMI, which was a lower-than-expected 52.4. In the manufacturing sector, the Caixin manufacturing PMI was 50.6, and the manufacturing PMI was 49.2.
The services sector has made a slower recovery from COVID-19 than its manufacturing counterpart as it remains more vulnerable to virus outbreaks, with the associated mobility curbs clouding the outlook for a rebound in consumption in the months to come.
The “Zero Covid” strategy pursued by China has hit leisure and tourism businesses hard as the country deals with its latest COVID-19 outbreak. Cities with cases, or those with concerns about the virus’ spread, have closed entertainment venues, restricted tourism, and delayed cultural events.
Input prices also rose for the 16th month in a row, and at the fastest pace since July 2021, thanks to rising labor and raw material costs. However, solid demand allowed firms to pass some of the costs to consumers.
But persistent inflationary pressures and concerns about supply chains also drove business confidence to its lowest level in four months.
""Supply and demand recovery both retained momentum. Employment was more or less stable. Gauges for prices were high,"" Caixin Insight Group senior economist Wang Zhe told Reuters.
""Policymakers should not only take effective measures to stabilize commodity supplies and prices, but also pay close attention to downstream firms, especially small and midsize ones."""

The Caixin/Markit services Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) rose to 53.8 in October - the highest since July - from 53.4 in September. The 50-point mark separates growth from contraction on a monthly basis.
The improved readings in the private survey, which focuses more on small firms in coastal regions, stood in contrast with an official survey, which showed the expansion in the services sector lost some steam.
Analysts say the services sector, which has been slower to recover from the pandemic than manufacturing, is more vulnerable to sporadic COVID-19 outbreaks in the country, clouding the outlook for the much anticipated rebound in consumption in the months to come.
China's leisure and tourism businesses have been feeling the heat from the country's zero tolerance COVID-19 strategy to contain infections since late October. Cities with cases, or those with concerns about the virus, have closed entertainment venues, restricted tourism or delayed cultural events.
A sub-index for new business edged up to 54.1 from 53.1 in September, bolstered by rising export orders that contracted the month before. 
Input prices also expanded for the 16th month in a row and at the fastest pace since July due to rising labour and raw material costs. Solid demand allowed firms to pass some of the costs to consumers, driving an uptick in prices that charged to the highest in three months. 
However, persistent inflationary pressures and concerns about supply chains drove business confidence to the lowest in four months, the survey showed.
Caixin's October composite PMI, which includes both manufacturing and services activity, edged up to 51.5 from 51.4 the previous month. 

""Supply and demand recovery both retained momentum. Employment was more or less stable. Gauges for prices were high,"" said Wang Zhe, senior economist at Caixin Insight Group.
""Policymakers should not only take effective measures to stabilise commodity supplies and prices, but also pay close attention to downstream firms, especially small and midsize ones.""

The unemployment rate fell to 3.4% in the quarter ending September, Statistics New Zealand data showed, far lower than a forecast of 3.9% by economists polled by Reuters. 
""The strong decline in unemployment brought the rate down to New Zealand's lowest rate on record, matching December 2007, when it was also 3.4%,"" work and wellbeing statistics senior manager Becky Collett said. 
Wage growth was strong in the quarter with the private sector labour cost index (LCI) recording a 0.7% lift, though just below a forecast 0.8% increase. 
The seasonally adjusted employment jumped 2.0% in the quarter, beating forecasts of a 0.4% increase. The participation rate rose to 71.2%, higher than the 70.6% forecast. 
The New Zealand dollar rose more than 0.2% after the data to top $0.7125, as markets forecast the tightening labour market would force another interest rate hike this month. 

The Reserve Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ) will meet on Nov. 24 to review monetary policy settings after hiking rates for the first time in seven years last month.

The Commerce Department said on Tuesday that the rental vacancy rate fell to 5.8% last quarter, the lowest since the second quarter of 2020. That was down from 6.2% in the April-June period and 6.4% a year ago.
The collection of data was affected by the coronavirus last year and part of 2021. The Census Bureau, which compiles the report, said the pandemic-related restrictions on data collection had ended in almost all areas in the third quarter, adding that less than 0.5% of cases were affected.
The rental vacancy rate is being closely watched as the debate over whether the current phase of high inflation is transitory heats up. Rents increased by the most since 2001 in September, helping to boost consumer prices that month. 
Rents are one of the sticky components of inflation, which is running well above the Federal Reserve's flexible 2% target. Workers returning to offices and schools reopening for in-person learning, thanks to COVID-19 vaccinations, are boosting demand for rentals following a slump as Americans fled cities for suburbs and other lower-density locations early in the pandemic.
In the third quarter, the median asking rent for vacant units was $1,203. That was down from $1,228 in the second quarter, but up from $1,160 a year ago. Rental vacancy rates were lowest in the Northeast and West and higher in the South and Midwest. 

The homeownership rate was little changed at a seasonally adjusted 65.4% last quarter. In the third quarter, the median asking sales price for vacant homes was a record $285,500. 
High home prices amid tight supply could keep demand for rentals elevated.

LONDON (Reuters) - Euro zone manufacturing activity remained strong last month but was curtailed by supply chain bottlenecks and logistical problems which sent input costs soaring, a survey showed on Tuesday.
Ongoing disruptions caused by the coronavirus pandemic, alongside a shortage of heavy goods vehicle drivers, has caused product shortages and left factories struggling to get the raw materials they need.
IHS Markit's final manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) dipped to an eight-month low of 58.3 in October from September's 58.6, shy of an initial 58.5 ""flash"" estimate but still comfortably above the 50-mark separating growth from contraction.
An index measuring output, which feeds into a composite PMI due on Thursday and seen as a good guide to economic health, dropped to 53.3 from September's 55.6, its lowest reading since June last year.
""Overall, the demand side continues to be very strong so that's a positive sign,"" said Bert Colijn at ING.
""But input shortages and transportation problems are continuing to hurt the manufacturing sector and those issues appear to be here to stay for the foreseeable future.""
Supply chain issues and rising inflation hit French, German and Spanish factories but Italian manufacturing recorded healthy expansion, growing at its strongest rate since June, earlier surveys showed.
And in the United States manufacturing activity slowed, a survey showed on Monday, with all industries reporting record-long lead times for raw materials, indicating stretched supply chains continued to constrain economic activity in the world's largest economy.
However, Asia's factory activity stepped up a gear in October as emerging economies saw COVID-19 infections subside, although rising input costs, material shortages and slowing Chinese growth clouded the outlook, Monday data showed. 
Those shortages meant suppliers were able to jack up their charges, and the input prices index for the euro zone climbed to 89.5 from 86.9, the highest since the survey began in mid-1997.
Although the bloc's economy continued to boom over the summer as activity rebounded after coronavirus lockdowns, inflation is also blowing past expectations, official data showed last week.

European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde acknowledged last Thursday that inflation would be high for even longer but pushed back against market bets that price pressures would trigger an ECB interest rate hike as soon as next year.
""There are huge upward pressures on input prices and costs more generally, and these are likely to lead to high prices for consumers over time,"" said Andrew Kenningham at Capital Economics.

IHS Markit's Final Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) for manufacturing, which accounts for about a fifth of Europe's largest economy, reached 57.8, slightly down from an initial ""flash"" reading of 58.2. The index stood at 58.4 in September.
The outlook for factories has been clouded by shortages of semiconductors and raw materials that are hitting the German auto industry particularly hard.
The shortages, coupled with rising energy prices, have forced manufacturers to pass the added costs on to consumers, raising fears of an inflation spiral that dampens both cosumption and growth.
""According to surveyed businesses, the well-documented slowdown in autos production is dragging down other parts of the manufacturing economy with it, as firms in that sector scale back orders for components and materials,"" said Phil Smith, Economics Associate Director at IHS Markit.

""Worryingly, the supply problems took a turn for the worse in October, with lead times on purchases lengthening to the greatest extent for three months,"" he said, adding that cost inflation has crept up towards record highs seen in the summer.
""Manufacturers lost further confidence that these issues will be resolved sooner rather than later, with business expectations now at their lowest since August 2020,"" he said.

Data compiler IHS Markit said its final purchasing managers' index for French manufacturing in October fell to 53.6 points from 55.0 in September, up a notch from an initial ""flash"" estimate of 53.5.
The index remained above the 50-point line dividing expansions in activity from contractions, but IHS Markit senior economist Joe Hayes said supply chain problems could continue to weigh on the sector.
IHS Markit added that manufacturing output had declined in France for the first time since January as a result of problems with supplies of key goods, caused partly by strict COVID-19 controls which have affected ports.

""Because firms cannot secure the inputs needed to make their products, orders are now also falling as clients are facing lengthy delays on orders or are unable to get components and other items needed to turn semi-finished goods into finished goods,"" said Hayes.
""It's difficult to imagine the situation improving any time soon. Prudent inventory management will be crucial for businesses hoping to keep production lines going,"" he added.

LONDON (Reuters) - The end of Britain's furlough programme has not led to a surge in new job-seekers, according to data that suggests unemployment is unlikely to rise sharply and could bolster the case for a Bank of England interest rate hike.
Research by recruitment website Indeed, seen by Reuters ahead of publication, shows only a small increase in the proportion of British workers who say they are urgently looking for a new job.
So far there have been no official figures on what has happened to workers who were still on furlough when the scheme ended on Sept. 30. Britain's Office for National Statistics estimates between 900,000 and 1.4 million employees were furloughed in late September, up to 700,000 of them full-time.
Uncertainty about how the end of furlough will affect Britain's economy is a key reason why some BoE policymakers think it would be better to wait than to raise interest rates this week.
Last week, government budget forecasters predicted unemployment would rise to 1.8 million people or 5.25% of the workforce in the final quarter of this year, up from 4.5% in the three months to August. 
But Indeed's survey of 5,000 working-age British people, conducted in mid-October, showed no big jump in job-seekers.
The proportion of people who said they were ""actively looking, urgently"" for a job rose to 7.7% of the workforce in October from 7.0% in September and 6.8% in July, when Indeed started the survey. The share of people ""actively looking, not urgently"" for a new job rose to 17.9% from 17.3%.
Indeed said the increase in active job-seekers between October and September was not statistically significant.
""The fact that urgent job search hasn't shot up suggests that the hopes many people had on the employers' side that the end of furlough would flood the labour market with candidates is probably not going to materialise,"" Indeed economist Pawel Adrjan said.
WORKERS RETURN TO EMPLOYERS
British employers reported record job vacancies in September. An inability to fill job vacancies in sectors with tough working conditions - such as lorry driving and food processing - led to empty fuel pumps last month and gaps on supermarket shelves.
Lloyds (LON:LLOY) Bank said on Monday that 60% of firms planned to bring back all their remaining furloughed staff, while 30% would reinstate more than half.
Separate research by Indeed shows Britain is in the middle of the pack internationally in terms of the rebound in job postings after the pandemic.
Job postings in Britain as of Oct. 22 were 35% above their level in February 2020. Australia had the biggest increase in job postings, up 71%, and the United States was in third place with a 48% rise. Belgium, Switzerland and Spain saw single-digit increases and recruitment in Israel was flat.
Sectors that remained in the doldrums included aviation, tourism and beauty, as well as some accountancy and sales jobs.

The timing of increases in job ads closely tracked the relaxation of COVID-19 restrictions, which in turn followed vaccination rates in most countries.
""Public health is absolutely critical for economic recovery and labour market health,"" Adrjan said.

SEOUL (Reuters) -South Korea's consumer inflation accelerated to a near 10-year peak in October, forcing the central bank to revise up its 2021 price projections and reinforcing the case for another interest rate hike this year.
The consumer price index (CPI) jumped 3.2% from a year earlier in October, government data showed on Tuesday, the fastest growth since January 2012 and sharply higher than a 2.6% rise in September.
That matched a 3.2% increase tipped by analysts in a Reuters survey and remained above the central bank's 2% target for a seventh straight month.
The breakdown of data showed the cost of petroleum surged 27.3%, while that of housing rentals and outdoor dining increased 1.8% and 3.2%, respectively, on year.
That puts the Bank of Korea's (BOK) monetary policy board under pressure to raise the base rate further at the Nov. 25 meeting, following its first rate hike in almost three years in August.
Governor Lee Ju-yeol last month flagged further tightening could come as soon as November to curb rising inflation and household debt.
Hours after the data release, the BOK said it expects annual CPI growth for the whole of 2021 to hover above its 2.1% forecast released in August.
The central bank will announce the revision of forecasts at its November meeting.
Meanwhile, the finance ministry said it will buy back 2 trillion won ($1.70 billion) of treasury bonds to stabilise local bond markets, after rate hike bets led to a selloff in bonds, pushing up the benchmark 10-year treasury bond yield to the highest since August 2018 last week.
Tuesday's data also showed core CPI rose 2.4% year-on-year, the fastest growth since December 2015 and up from 1.5% in September.
Month-on-month inflation rose 0.1%, slowing from September's 0.5% rise but in line with forecasts.
New rules aimed at moving South Koreans toward ""living with COVID-19"" came into effect on Monday and are expected to boost consumer spending, with curfews on restaurants and cafes being lifted.

The government also decided to temporarily cut domestic tax on key oil products by 20%, which is expected to help consumers save up to 2.5 trillion won over a six-month period.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. manufacturing activity slowed in October, with all industries reporting record-long lead times for raw materials, indicating that stretched supply chains continued to constrain economic activity early in the fourth quarter.
The Institute for Supply Management (ISM) survey on Monday also hinted at some moderation in demand amid surging prices, with a measure of new orders dropping to a 16-month low. Still, demand remains strong as retail inventories continue to be depressed, which should keep manufacturing humming. 
According to the ISM, ""companies and suppliers continue to deal with an unprecedented number of hurdles to meet increasing demand."" The government reported last week that the economy grew at its slowest pace https://www.reuters.com/business/us-economy-slows-sharply-third-quarter-weekly-jobless-claims-new-19-month-low-2021-10-28 in more than a year in the third quarter because of widespread shortages tied to the COVID-19 pandemic. 
""Stress in U.S. supply chains isn't abating, lending downside risk to our forecast for GDP growth in the near term and a clear upside risk to the forecast for inflation,"" said Ryan Sweet, a senior economist at Moody's (NYSE:MCO) Analytics in West Chester, Pennsylvania. 
The ISM's index of national factory activity slipped to a reading of 60.8 last month from 61.1 in September. A reading above 50 indicates expansion in manufacturing, which accounts for 12% of the U.S. economy. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the index would fall to 60.5.
The ISM reported 26 commodities were in short supply in October, some for as long as 13 straight months. That compared to 24 in September.
The economy is struggling with shortages across industries as global supply chains remain clogged. Supply constraints were worsened by a wave of coronavirus infections driven by the Delta variant over the summer, especially in Southeast Asia. Congestion at ports in China and the United States was also causing delays in getting materials to factories and retailers.
The motor vehicle industry has been the hardest hit amid a global semiconductor shortage. Transportation equipment manufacturers in the ISM survey said they had diverted chips ""to our higher-margin vehicles and stopped or limited the lower-margin vehicle production schedules."" 
Other industries are also hurting. Manufacturers of computer and electronic products reported ""extreme delays"" and that ""getting anything from China is near impossible."" Food manufacturers said ""rolling blackouts in China starting to hurt shipments even more."" Makers of electrical equipment, appliances and components said though demand remained strong, production continued ""to be held back by supply chain issues."" 
The ISM survey's measure of supplier deliveries increased to a reading of 75.6 last month from 73.4 in September. A reading above 50% indicates slower deliveries. Economists and businesses expect supply chains could remain tight through 2022.
Longer waits for materials meant high inflation at the factory gate persisted. The survey's measure of prices paid by manufacturers accelerated to 85.7 from a reading of 81.2 in September. Prices increased for 48 commodities last month, with only prices for wood falling. Prices for products like steel have increased for 15 consecutive months.
These higher costs are being passed on to consumers which, together with surging wage growth, is raising concerns that high inflation could be more persistent rather than transitory as Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has repeatedly argued. The government reported on Friday that wage growth in the third quarter was the strongest on record.
Fed policymakers are due to meet on Tuesday and Wednesday. The U.S. central bank is expected to announce that it will start reducing the amount of money it is injecting into the economy through monthly bond purchases.
Stocks on Wall Street were trading higher. The dollar fell against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury yields rose.
'SHIFTING PARADIGM'
The ISM survey's forward-looking new orders sub-index dropped to 59.8 last month, the lowest reading since June 2020 when COVID-19 lockdowns were in effect, from 66.7 in September. Factories have plenty of unfinished work. 
""One interpretation of this dramatic fall could be manufacturers facing a shifting paradigm that accepts supply constraints as a new reality,"" said Kurt Rankin, an economist at PNC Financial (NYSE:PNC) in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. 
""Demand does not appear to be abating, raising the question of whether businesses' patience and profitability potential is becoming exhausted and that new inventory management techniques and the promise of fewer goods on offer could be emerging.""
Factories hired more workers, with employment expanding for a second straight month. Though manufacturers said they were still struggling to find workers, there were hopeful signs.
According to the survey, ""an increasing percentage of comments noted improvements regarding employment, compared to less than 5% in September."" It also noted that ""an overwhelming majority of panelists indicate their companies are hiring or attempting to hire."" 
This, combined with a jump in consumers' perceptions of the labor market last month, suggests employment gains accelerated in October after the economy created the fewest jobs in nine months in September. Worker shortages, however, remain a constraint. There were 10.4 million unfilled jobs at the end of August.
The Labor Department is scheduled to publish its closely watched employment report for October on Friday.

A separate report from the Commerce Department on Monday showed construction spending dropped 0.5% in September, which was blamed on shortages and Hurricane Ida in late August.
Still, the spending composition was not as weak as the government had assumed in its advance third-quarter GDP estimate last week. That led some economists to anticipate that third-quarter GDP growth could be revised up to about a 2.2% rate from the published 2.0% pace when the government releases its second estimate later this month.

Construction spending increased 7.8% on a year-on-year basis in September. The government reported last week that gross domestic product increased at a 2.0% annualized rate, stepping down from the April-June's robust 6.7% pace.
Spending on private construction projects decreased 0.5% in September after falling 0.3% in August. Outlays on residential construction dropped 0.4% after nudging up 0.1% in August. Single-family homebuilding spending declined 0.6% and outlays on multi-family housing projects slipped 0.3%.
Shortages and more expensive building materials are holding back homebuilding. Residential investment contracted for a second straight quarter in the third quarter, weighed down by declines in home improvements and single-family homebuilding.

Investment in private non-residential construction like gas and oil well drilling fell 0.6% in September. Spending on structures declined for a second straight quarter in the July-September period, led by commercial and healthcare structures.
Spending on public construction projects tumbled 0.7% in September after increasing 1.2% in August. Outlays on state and local government construction projects fell 0.4%, xxx federal government spending plunged 4.3%.

The IHS Markit Canada Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) rose to a seasonally adjusted 57.7 in October from 57.0 in September, its highest reading since March when it notched a record-setting level of 58.5.
It was the 16th straight month that the PMI was above the 50 threshold marking growth in the sector.
""Latest PMI data revealed that Canada's manufacturing sector performed strongly,"" Shreeya Patel, an economist at IHS Markit, said in a statement. ""New orders rose at a quicker pace in October, and firms continued hiring activity to meet their existing orders.""
The new orders index rose to 55.3 from 54.5 in September, while the employment measure was up at 53.2 from 52.8.
Canada has regained all the jobs it lost in the pandemic, while the Bank of Canada last week became the first central bank from a G7 country to exit quantitative easing and signaled it could hike interest rates as soon as April.
Price measures stayed at elevated levels and lead times lengthened, with the index of suppliers' delivery times falling to its lowest level in the 11-year history of the data.

But stocks of purchases rose at the fastest pace on record as firms sought to protect against future supply shocks and manufacturers remained upbeat, with the future output index climbing to the highest since April 2018.

The seasonally adjusted manufacturing PMI slipped to 65.4 points in October from 68.1 in September but remained well within growth territory.
""Procurement problems are likely to be among the factors
contributing to a slowdown in output. Suppliers' delivery times
are still rising, albeit somewhat less broadly than in the previous months. Moreover, purchase prices are widely increasing, with 82% of the respondents facing higher costs for input materials,"" said economist Claude Maurer at  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN), which helps compile the index.
Procurement uncertainties have prompted businesses to
replenish inventories, with stocks of finished goods now
being topped up as well as stocks of purchases, he added. 
""Higher inventories are something of a double-edged sword for companies, as while they allow goods to be dispatched quickly when demand rises, they become a burden when demand drops. Given the generally positive momentum at present, the trend in inventories is probably a favourable sign for the time being,"" Maurer said.
The pace of workforce expansion was relatively muted despite solid levels of capacity utilisation and widespread scarcity problems. Only a quarter of businesses were recruiting staff. 

The service sector PMI, which is more focused on domestic
consumption, also edged lower in October, but momentum remained higher than average and prices were climbing on a broad scale.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Asia's factory activity stepped up a gear in October as emerging economies saw COVID-19 infections subside, but rising input costs, material shortages and slowing Chinese growth cloud the outlook, business surveys showed on Monday.
Policymakers in the region face pressures on multiple fronts as they steer their economies out of the pandemic-induced doldrums while also trying to keep prices under control amid rising commodity costs and parts shortages.
China's factory activity expanded at its fastest pace in four months in October, the private sector Caixin/Markit Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) showed on Monday, as dwindling COVID-19 cases drove up domestic demand.
But a sub-index for output showed production shrank for the third straight month due to power shortages and rising costs, falling in line with Sunday's official PMI that showed factory activity in October shrinking.
""Shortages of raw materials and soaring commodity prices, combined with electricity supply problems, created strong constraints for manufacturers and disrupted supply chains,"" said Wang Zhe, senior economist at Caixin Insight Group.
Factory activity in October expanded in Vietnam, Indonesia and Malaysia as operations gradually normalised after being hit by shutdowns caused by a spike in COVID-19 infections.
Taiwan saw manufacturing activity growth accelerate on robust chip demand, while Japan's factory activity expanded at the fastest pace in six months in October in an encouraging sign for the world's third-largest economy.
India's factory activity expanded at its quickest pace in eight months in October, pointing to an extended business recovery in Asia's third-largest economy.
In a sign of the patchy nature of the region's recovery, however, South Korea's factory activity rose at the slowest pace in 13 months in October on shrinking output and softer demand.
Material shortages and delivery disruptions drove up Japan's input prices by the most in over 13 years.
""While October Manufacturing PMIs point to a strong rise in manufacturing output, industry is likely to be working through huge backlogs of orders for many months to come and resulting supply shortages further afield are set to persist,"" said Alex Holmes, emerging Asia economist at Capital Economics.
The final au Jibun Bank Japan PMI in October rose to 53.2 from 51.5 in the previous month, expanding for the ninth consecutive month.
South Korea's PMI, by contrast, fell to 50.2 in October from 52.4 in September, though it managed to stand above the 50-mark threshold that indicates expansion in activity, for a 13th straight month.

Vietnam's PMI rose to 52.1 from 40.2 in September, while that of Indonesia increased to 57.2 from 52.2, the surveys showed. Malaysia's index stood at 52.2, up from 48.1.
Asia's emerging economies have lagged advanced economies in recovering from the pandemic's pain as delays in vaccine rollouts and a spike in Delta variant cases hurt consumption and factory production.

The Caixin/Markit Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) rose to 50.6 in October - its highest level since June. Economists in a Reuters poll had expected the index to remain unchanged from September at 50.0. The 50-mark separates growth from contraction on a monthly basis.
The relative strength in the Caixin PMI contrasts with an official survey released on Sunday which showed China's factory activity shrank for a second month.
Analysts attributed the divergence to the different samples and survey periods. But even the more bullish Caixin survey, which focuses on smaller firms in coastal regions, showed a sub-index for output showed production shrank for the third consecutive month and at a faster rate than in September.
New export orders fell for a third straight month, countering a rise in a sub-index for new orders to 51.4 from 50.8 in September.
""The Caixin manufacturing PMI managed to reflect the partial normalisation of power supply in October,"" said Ting Lu, chief China Economist at Nomura, although he added it failed to capture the massive power blackouts in September. 
""We need exercise caution when interpreting both the official and Caixin PMI due to their imperfect performance."" 
This year, China's sprawling manufacturing sector has been tested by COVID-19 outbreaks, higher costs, production bottlenecks, and more recently, power rationing.
A power crunch triggered by a shortage of coal, tougher emissions standards, and strong industrial demand had led to widespread curbs on electricity usage, hurting factory output. 
But the situation began to improve in October under heavy government intervention. 
Still, input prices rose at their fastest pace since December 2016, partly due to higher energy and transport costs, while gains for price charged also accelerated to the highest since May, adding to concerns about the emergence of stagflation.
To help struggling manufacturers, China's cabinet said on Wednesday that the government will defer some taxes for manufacturers for three months from November.
Wang Zhe, senior economist at Caixin Insight Group, warned that a new wave of COVID-19 outbreaks in many central and western regions since late October could deal a fresh blow to economic activity. 

""It is critical to balance the goals of controlling the outbreaks and maintaining normal economic activity,"" said Wang. 
China's economic growth is likely to slow to 5.5% in 2022 from an expected expansion of 8.2% this year, a Reuters poll showed.

SEOUL (Reuters) -South Korean exports marked an eighth straight month of double-digit growth in October, propelled by post-lockdown recoveries in major markets, which pushed up demand for Korean chips and petrochemical products.
Exports surged 24.0% in October from a year earlier, faster than the 16.7% growth from September but missing the 27.0% growth seen in a Reuters poll.
Asia's fourth-largest economy is widely considered a bellwether for global trade as it is the first to release export data among major trading economies.
Imports jumped at a faster 37.8% on-year, also accelerating from a 31.0% expansion in September.
The $55.83 billion of exports logged in September was a record in terms of monthly shipments, but the pace of growth will slow in the coming months with the post-lockdown recovery now past its peak, said Park Chong-hoon, an economist at Standard Chartered (OTC:SCBFF) Bank of Korea.
""Export growth will slow to between 10% and 20% in the coming months, as the base effect fades,"" Park said. ""Having said that, demand for South Korean products will remain strong as we see in shipment volume.""
By destination, exports to all nine major trade partners including China, the United States and Europe, increased for a seventh month in a row, a statement from the trade ministry showed.

A breakdown by items showed exports of semiconductors soared 28.8% in October from a year earlier while petrochemical products surged 138.1%. 
Exports of cars, however, declined 4.7% on-year, due to chip shortages and base effects from last year, the statement said.

1091,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 31, 2021 11:30PM ET</span>",Australia home price boom piles on pressure for RBA pullback,"(Corrects typographical error in paragraph 3)
By Wayne Cole
SYDNEY (Reuters) -Australian home prices raced to fresh heights in October, piling pressure on the country's central bank to open the door to an interest rates rise well before the current projection of 2024.
The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) holds its monthly policy meeting on Tuesday and speculation is rife it will soften or drop a commitment to keep yields on its April 2024 target bond at 0.1%, effectively signalling an earlier hike in cash rates.
""Yield curve control (YCC) is extraordinary policy that semi-ties the central bank’s hands, limiting forward flexibility,"" said Nomura economist Andrew Ticehurst. ""With the pandemic crisis passing, the case for extraordinary forward guidance naturally weakens.""
Highlighting those pressures were figures from property consultant CoreLogic on Monday, which showed home prices rose 1.5% in October, up a steep 21.6% on last year. That was the fastest pace since 1989, while Sydney boasted an annual gain of 25%.
Ticehurst thought the RBA would likely bring forward the guidance date to, say April 2023, and perhaps shift from a fixed target of 0.1% to a range of 0.1-0.5%. 
""A range is easier to hit than a target point, and the RBA could regard this as a somewhat-elegant and partial exit,"" argued Ticehurst. ""The more aggressive option would be to simply drop it entirely, ripping the band-aid off in one go.""
Such a move would be a drastic course change given the RBA was only recently chastising market for pricing in any risk of a rate rise this side of 2024.
Investors have since gone far further, as futures imply a real chance of a hike to 0.25% by April next year and rates above 1.0% by year end.
The yield on the April 2024 bond is all the way up at 0.81% after the market suffered its worst routs in decades as the RBA declined to defend the 0.1% target.
The selloff was triggered last week by data showing annual core inflation rose a surprisingly strong 2.1% in the third quarter, taking it back into the RBA's 2-3% target band almost two years earlier than policy makers expected.
Much of the jump was due to the surging cost of housing construction, fuelled by global supply bottlenecks and a rush to build in a red-hot market.
The property boom has been a windfall for household wallets and consumer confidence, but has also stirred concerns about affordability and debt as prices run far ahead of wages.
Australia's main banking regulator responded last month by announcing a modest tightening of lending standards, with the threat of more action if the market failed to cool.
The RBA had resisted pressure to raise rates to restrain the market, arguing it would only slow the economy and cost jobs, but some pullback in stimulus now seems certain.
""We expect YCC to be removed on Tuesday and a full pivot to outcomes-based guidance in its absence,"" said Tapas Strickland, a director of economics at NAB.
NAB also expects the RBA to end its A$4 billion-a-week ($3.01 billion) bond buying campaign in February and now sees a first rate rise in mid 2023, rather than in 2024.
The central bank will also update its economic forecasts in a report to be released on Friday, which should see an upward shift in inflation and economic growth for next year.
While coronavirus lockdowns almost certainly caused a sharp contraction in the economy in the third quarter, world-beating rates of vaccinations have allowed most restrictions to be lifted.

Figures from ANZ on Monday showed job advertisements had already rebounded by 6.2% in October to be almost back to where they were in June, auguring well for a tighter labour market and higher wages growth.

Investing.com – Chinese factory activity grew at its fastest pace in four months in October, according to a business survey. Stronger demand contributed to the growth, but power shortages and rising costs hampered production.
The Caixin manufacturing purchasing managers index (PMI) was at 50.6, higher than the 50-figure in both forecasts prepared by Investing.com and reported during the previous month. The index was at its highest level since June 2021 and above the 50-mark indicating growth.
Data released by the National Bureau of Statistics on Sunday showed that the manufacturing and non-manufacturing PMIs were at a lower-than-expected 49.2 and 52.4 respectively in October.
However, growth in China’s manufacturing sector has slowed down thanks to COVID-19 outbreaks, higher costs, supply-chain bottlenecks, and power rationing. The rationing also led to a power crunch, thanks to a coal shortage, tougher emissions standards, and strong industrial demand, further denting factory output.
""To sum up, manufacturing recovered slightly in October from the previous month. But downward pressure on economic growth continued,"" Caixin Insight Group senior economist Wang Zhe told Reuters.
""Supply strains became the paramount factor affecting the economy. Shortages of raw materials and soaring commodity prices, combined with electricity supply problems, created strong constraints for manufacturers and disrupted supply chains.""
In an effort to provide some relief, China's cabinet said on Wednesday that the government will defer some taxes for manufacturers for three months from November 2021.
The latest wave of COVID-19 outbreaks in China since late October 2021 could also deal a fresh blow to economic activity, warned Wang. ""It is critical to balance the goals of controlling the outbreaks and maintaining normal economic activity,"" he said.
Meanwhile, the Caixin services PMI is due on Wednesday."
1093,By Bloomberg,"<span>Oct 31, 2021 09:27PM ET</span>","China’s Economy Weakens as Power Crunch, Covid Rules Hurt","(Bloomberg) -- Sign up for the New Economy Daily newsletter, follow us @economics and subscribe to our podcast.
China’s economy showed signs of further weakness in October as power shortages and surging commodity prices weighed on manufacturing, while strict Covid controls put a brake on holiday spending.
The official manufacturing purchasing managers’ index fell to 49.2, the National Bureau of Statistics said Sunday, the second month it was below the key 50-mark that signals a contraction in production. The non-manufacturing gauge, which measures activity in the construction and services sectors, dropped to 52.4, well below the consensus forecast.
The PMIs show the economy is under pressure from both the supply and demand side. Manufacturers are struggling with electricity shortages and rising costs, while consumer spending remains weak as the government’s Covid-zero approach means a tightening of restrictions around travel and social gatherings to contain frequent flare-ups of virus cases.
“Looking forward to November, the non-manufacturing PMI could drop significantly on the new wave of Covid-19 and China’s increasingly harsh zero-Covid policy, while the manufacturing PMI could remain weak due to shocks from both the supply and demand sides,” Ting Lu, chief China economist at  Nomura Holdings  (NYSE:NMR) Inc., wrote in a note.
Another worrying sign in the data was the pick-up in inflationary pressure in October. Both input and output prices for manufacturers jumped, suggesting producers are passing on higher costs to customers. Producer-price inflation is already at its highest level in almost 26 years. 
“The jump of output price index in October is alarming,” Zhang Zhiwei, chief economist at Pinpoint Asset Management Ltd., said in a note. “This could lead to higher pressure on CPI inflation, and limit the space of monetary policy easing.”
The turmoil in the property market is another big drag on the economy. Housing sales have dropped, home prices are falling and the debt crisis at property developer China Evergrande Group is spilling over to the industry. 
Economists have been gradually downgrading their growth forecasts for the fourth quarter and the full year as risks mount. The consensus is for growth of 3.5% this quarter, with Nomura saying there could be further cuts closer to its prediction of 3%.
What Bloomberg Economics Says...
Given the supply driven nature of the slowdown, the authorities are likely to continue an approach of modest and sector-specific growth support. 
There could be further liquidity support -- we still see possibility of a another cut in the reserve requirement ratio by the year-end, on top of accommodation via open market operations.
-- Chang Shu, chief Asia economist

A set of earliest available indicators tracked by Bloomberg also showed the economy remains under pressure. 
The slowdown turns the focus back to the People’s Bank of China and whether it will take any action to spur growth. The central bank has refrained from cutting the reserve requirement ratio since a surprise reduction in July and has kept policy interest rates unchanged since early last year.
At the same time, it’s injected almost a trillion yuan of funds into the banking system in the past two weeks through open-market operations to cope with month-end demand for cash.
Ping An Securities Co. Ltd. chief economist Zhong Zhengsheng said there’s less room for monetary easing given higher inflation pressure and more hawkish signals from the Federal Reserve and Bank of England. Fiscal and industrial policies will be the focus going forward, while monetary policy will provide stable liquidity and support targeted sectors, Zhong said in a report Sunday.
The NBS’s senior statistician, Zhao Qinghe, said in a statement that manufacturing demand and production both weakened in October. Smaller businesses, which are mostly in downstream sectors, face greater pressure, with the sub-index for these companies remaining below the 50 mark for a sixth month.
Consumers in general chose to spend the seven-day National Day public holiday in October at home or in nearby places due to virus and weather factors, according to Zhao. 
On the plus side, exports have boomed, with recent South Korean trade data signaling ongoing strong global demand that’s helped to underpin manufacturing. The new export orders index increased to 46.6 from 46.2, gaining for the first time since March. The sub-index has been below 50 since May.
Trade conditions still need further monitoring as the recovery from the pandemic in major economies has slowed recently, Zhao said.

1094,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 31, 2021 08:50PM ET</span>",S.Korea factory activity growth hits 13-month-low on supply crunch,"SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea's factory activity grew at its slowest pace in 13 months in October, led by a contraction in output and softer demand as shortages of chips and supply chain disruption weighed on the sector.
The IHS Markit purchasing managers' index (PMI) for October fell to 50.2 from 52.4 in September, though managed to stand above the 50-mark threshold that indicates expansion in activity, for a 13th straight month.
""October data provided proof that ongoing raw material shortages and supply chain issues began to bite in the South Korean manufacturing sector ... (pointing) to a broad stagnation in operating conditions,"" said Usamah Bhatti, economist at HIS Markit.
Output returned to contraction in just two months, with the sub-index at 46.6, having shrunk at the sharpest rate since July 2020 due to significant shortages of materials, notably semiconductors and other electrical components.
Total new orders and export orders barely grew, with respondents highlighting slowing international demand and difficulties in sourcing freight and container capacity.
Sharp (OTC:SHCAY) rises in raw material costs amid severe shortages resulted in further rises in costs at South Korean manufacturers, with input prices rising at the sharpest pace in three months.
That led firms to pass higher costs on to clients, also pushing factory gate inflation to a three-month high.
In an effort to protect margins, firms were seen reducing staffing levels for the first time in eight months.

Meanwhile, firms continued to worry about the ongoing shortages and disruptions, with business confidence easing to its weakest level since September 2020.
""This is broadly in line with current IHS Markit estimates for industrial production to grow just 0.2% in 2022 following a 6.2% increase in 2021,"" Bhatti said.

Manufacturers said the material shortages and delivery disruptions continued to affect their operations, resulting in the sharpest jump of input prices in more than 13 years, a private-sector survey showed.
The final au Jibun Bank Japan Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) in October rose to 53.2 on a seasonally adjusted basis from 51.5 in the previous month, expanding for the ninth consecutive month.
The headline figure, which was slightly better than a 53.0 flash reading, was helped by a return to growth in output and overall orders, though their rate of expansion was modest and supply problems remained a drag. 
""Manufacturers continued to note concern regarding significant supply chain disruption which dampened output and demand,"" said Usamah Bhatti, economist at IHS Markit, which compiled the survey.
""Material shortages and delivery delays induced sharp rises in input prices... This contributed to higher charges for clients in attempts to cover margins, with factory gate inflation quickening to a 13-year high.""

On the brighter side for consumption, the PMI survey's the headline figure for consumer goods rose to its highest since May 2019, HIS Markit said, as firms were helped by the waning impact of the coronavirus pandemic at home.

Manufacturers also remained optimistic regarding the outlook for production for the 12 months ahead, suggesting firms had high hopes of better conditions.
The overall level of positive sentiment came in at its highest since the data was first collected in July 2012.

LONDON (Reuters) - British business sentiment fell slightly in October after touching its highest since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic the month before, a survey by Lloyds (LON:LLOY) Bank showed on Monday.
Lloyds said its business confidence barometer fell to 43% in October from 46% in September but was well above its long-run average of 28%, despite rising energy bills and supply chain difficulties.
The survey chimed with the relatively upbeat flash purchasing managers' index published on Oct. 22 and may give Bank of England policymakers confidence to raise interest rates on Thursday for the first time since the start of the pandemic.
""While economic optimism saw a slight dent in October due to rising costs and the on-going supply chain issues, it is clear that firms are still feeling relatively buoyant,"" Hann-Ju Ho, senior economist at Lloyds Bank Commercial Banking, said.
The BoE's chief economist, Huw Pill, has said he expects inflation to reach 5% in the coming months - more than twice the BoE's target - and that a rate rise would be a live question at the central bank's meeting this week.
But other policymakers have said the BoE can do little to tame the short-term surge in energy costs that is pushing up inflation, and they are more concerned about residual weakness in the job market as the government ends its furlough programme.

Britain's Office for National Statistics estimates that between 900,000 and 1.4 million employees were still partly or fully on furlough when the programme ended on Sept. 30.
Lloyds said 60% of the firms it surveyed between Oct. 1 and Oct. 15 planned to bring all their remaining furloughed staff back to work, while 30% intended to bring back over half.

The official manufacturing Purchasing Manager's Index (PMI) was at 49.2 in October, down from 49.6 in September, data from the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) showed on Sunday. 
The 50-point mark separates growth from contraction. Analysts had expected it to come in at 49.7. 
China's sprawling manufacturing sector has steadily slowed this year, with output in September growing at its most feeble pace since March 2020 due to environmental curbs, power rationing and higher raw material prices. 
In line with the softer headline PMI, a subindex for production slipped to 48.4 in October from 49.5 in September. A subindex for new orders also contracted for a third month, coming in at 48.8. 
""About one-third of the surveyed companies listed insufficient demand as their biggest difficulty, indicating inadequate demand had restricted their production,"" said Zhang Liqun, an analyst at the China Logistics Information Center. 
More worryingly, a subindex for output prices rose to 61.1, the highest since 2016 when the statistics bureau started publishing the indicator, suggesting rising inflationary pressures while broader economic growth slows. 
""The production index has dropped to the lowest level since it was published in 2005, excluding the global financial crisis period in 2008/09 and the COVID outbreak in February 2020,"" said Zhiwei Zhang, chief economist at Pinpoint Asset Management. 
""The output price index rose to the highest level since it was published in 2016. These signals confirm that China's economy is likely already going through stagflation.""
POLICY TIGHTROPE
Factory gate inflation rose to a record last month on soaring commodity prices but weak demand capped consumer inflation, forcing policymakers to walk a tightrope between supporting the economy and further stoking producer prices.
Analysts polled by Reuters expect the People's Bank of China to refrain from attempts to stimulate the economy by reducing the amount of cash banks must hold in reserve until the first quarter of 2022.
""Production remains weak, indicating the demand problem may be relatively large, and some easing of policy is still needed,"" said Zhou Hao, senior economist at Commerzbank (DE:CBKG). 
The official non-manufacturing PMI in October eased slightly to 52.4 from 53.2 in September, when services swung back to expansionary at the end of a COVID-fraught summer. 
New clusters of COVID-19 returned in October, especially in the north, which could again disrupt economic activity and deal yet another blow to the services sector because of tough restrictions to contain the disease. 
""Due to the impact of the epidemic and weather, consumers were more inclined to spend their holidays at home or travel for short distances,"" said Zhao Qinghe, a senior NBS statistician, in an accompanying statement.

While the transport sector including air and railway services expanded, the growth was relatively weak, Zhao said.
China's official October composite PMI, which includes both manufacturing and services activity, stood at 50.8, down from September's 51.7.

The CBI's monthly growth indicator - which pulls together surveys of output from manufacturers, retailers and other services companies - rose slightly to +29 from +27 in September, after hitting its highest since 2014 in August at +34.
""Given the headwinds business has faced, achieving above average growth for the past six months shows real resilience in the UK economy,"" CBI lead economist Alpesh Paleja said.
Many British petrol stations ran dry at the start of October, the most visible example of bottlenecks in the economy as it emerges from the COVID-19 pandemic and faces shortages of workers such as tanker drivers and rising energy prices.

Britain's Office for Budget Responsibility upgraded its growth forecast last week to predict an expansion of 6.5% this year and 6.0% in 2022, as the economy recovers from its historic slump of nearly 10% in 2020.
Many investors expect the Bank of England to raise interest rates this week for the first time since the start of the pandemic, although some economists expect it to hold fire until there is clearer news on the health of the job market.

1100,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 29, 2021 04:22PM ET</span>",U.S. consumer spending strong; robust wage gains hint at long spell of high inflation,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. consumer spending increased solidly in September, but was partly flattered by higher prices, with inflation remaining hot as shortages of motor vehicles and other goods persisted amid global supply constraints.
Inflation pressures are broadening out, with other data on Friday showing employers boosted wages by the most on record in the third quarter as they competed for scarce workers. The industry-wide surge could undercut Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's long-held view that high inflation is transitory. 
The strength in consumer spending at the end of last quarter, together with falling COVID-19 infections and recovering consumer confidence bode well for a pickup in economic activity in the final three months of the year, though shortages and more expensive goods pose risks. The economy grew at its slowest pace in more than a year in the third quarter.
""The economy has a supply problem not a demand problem,"" said Christopher Rupkey, chief economist at FWDBONDS in New York. ""The economy has money to burn and that is why inflation will be hard to extinguish."" 
Consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, rose 0.6% last month after rebounding 1.0% in August, the Commerce Department said. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast consumer spending increasing 0.5%.
Spending was driven by demand for services such as healthcare, dining out as well as hotel and motel accommodation amid declining cases of the coronavirus Delta variant. A wave of infections over summer worsened worker shortages at factories, mines and ports, further stressing supply chains. 
Services spending increased 0.6% after advancing 0.7% in August. That offset a 0.2% drop in outlays on long-lasting manufactured goods, which largely reflected a decrease in new motor vehicle sales. 
Outside the shutdown in spring 2020, which severely depressed output, the third quarter was the worst period for motor vehicle production since early 2009 because of a global shortage of semiconductors. Auto inventories have been run down and some shelves are bare, curbing spending and boosting prices.
Price pressures remained strong in September, reducing consumers' buying power. The personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index, excluding the volatile food and energy components, climbed 0.2%. That was the smallest gain since February and followed a 0.3% rise in August. 
In the 12 months through September, the so-called core PCE price index increased 3.6% for a fourth straight month. The core PCE price index is the Fed's preferred inflation measure for its flexible 2% target. When adjusted for inflation, consumer spending rose 0.3% after gaining 0.6% in August.
Stocks on Wall Street were trading lower after dismal results from mega-cap firms Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) reignited concerns of labor and supply shortages. The dollar rose against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices were mixed.
WAGES SURGING
The Fed is expected to announce at next week's policy meeting that it will start reducing the amount of money it is pumping into the economy through monthly bond purchases.
The consumer spending and inflation data was included in the advance gross domestic product report for the third quarter published on Thursday. 
Growth in consumer spending braked to a 1.6% annualized rate after double-digit gains in the previous two quarters. That restricted economic growth to a 2.0% rate, the slowest since the second quarter of 2020, when the economy suffered a historic contraction in the wake of stringent mandatory measures to contain the first wave of COVID-19 infections.
Strong inflation pressures were underscored by a separate report from the Labor Department on Friday showing the Employment Cost Index, the broadest measure of labor costs, surged 1.3% in the third quarter. 
The largest gain since the first quarter of 2001, when the government started tracking the series, reflected an increase across industries and followed a 0.7% rise in the April-June period. Labor costs powered ahead 3.7% on a year-on-year basis, the largest rise since the fourth quarter of 2004, after increasing 2.9% in the second quarter. 
The ECI is viewed by policymakers and economists as one of the better measures of labor market slack and a predictor of core inflation as it adjusts for composition and job quality changes. Economists had forecast the ECI advancing 0.9% in the third quarter.
Wages and salaries soared a record 1.5% last quarter after increasing 0.9% in the April-June quarter. They were up 4.2% year-on-year. Benefits gained 0.9% after rising 0.4% in the second quarter. The COVID-19 pandemic has upended labor market dynamics, creating an economy-wide acute shortage of workers. There were 10.4 million job openings at the end of August.
""While we expect wage growth to slow over the second half of 2022, as more workers return to the jobs market, the near-term pressure on labor costs will keep inflation elevated over the next few quarters and make it difficult to settle back to the Fed's 2% target anytime soon,"" said Sarah House, a senior economist at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) in Charlotte, North Carolina.
Solid wage growth and ample savings should help to support consumer spending and keep the economic expansion going. Though the Commerce Department data showed personal income tumbling 1.0% in September, that largely reflected the expiration of government-funded unemployment benefits. 

Wages increased by a strong 0.8% last month. The saving rate fell to a still-high 7.5% from 9.2% in August.
Household wealth is at record highs, thanks to a strong stock market and high house prices, positioning consumers to boost spending when supply improves. Consumers also accumulated at least $2.5 trillion of excess savings during the pandemic.

MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexico's economy shrank 0.2 percent in the third quarter from the previous three-month period, the first quarterly decline since recovery from the pandemic began, preliminary data from national statistics agency INEGI showed on Friday.
Service sector activity in the country was roiled during the summer from a resurgence in the coronavirus pandemic, while global supply chain disruptions have weighed on a recovery in manufacturing, notably in key sectors like carmaking.
The seasonally-adjusted contraction in gross domestic product (GDP) over the July-September period compared with a consensus forecast in a Reuters poll for growth of 0.1%, and followed surprisingly weak data for August.
Nikhil Sanghani, an analyst at Capital Economics, said the latest figures left GDP 2.3% below pre-pandemic levels, though he suggested the August data may be revised up and noted the economy was ""heading in the right direction"" going into October.
""But the bigger picture is that the recovery will still struggle from here,"" Sanghani said in a research note. 
""Global component shortages will keep auto production depressed in the near term, a slowdown in the U.S. will constrain external demand, and domestic demand will remain subdued owing to the lack of policy support,"" the note said.
The economy's sluggish performance risks creating a dilemma for Mexico's central bank, which has embarked on a series of rate increases as inflation surged well above its 3% target. However, its board has been split over whether to hike rates.
A breakdown of the GDP figures showed the contraction was led by weakness in the tertiary sector, which covers services, and which declined by 0.6% compared with the second quarter.
Secondary activities, which include manufacturing, rose by 0.7%, while primary activities such as farming, fishing and mining, also advanced by 0.7%, the data showed.
The dent to growth is a setback to Mexico, which during the pandemic suffered an economic contraction last year of 8.5%, its sharpest slump since the 1930s Great Depression.
The main hit came in the second quarter of 2020. Since then, Mexico had posted four consecutive periods of quarterly growth, including an increase of 1.5% during the April-June period.
Mexico's finance ministry said it was sticking to its forecast for growth of 6.3% this year despite the economy's third quarter performance.

Compared with the same quarter a year earlier, Mexico's economy grew 4.6 percent in unadjusted terms, INEGI said.
Final third-quarter GDP figures for Latin America's second-biggest economy are due to be published on Nov. 25.

1102,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 29, 2021 10:35AM ET</span>",Canada economy seen weaker than expected as supply chain woes weigh,"By Julie Gordon and David Ljunggren
OTTAWA (Reuters) -The Canadian economy most likely underperformed expectations in the third quarter amid ongoing supply chain woes and a brutal drought, official data suggested on Friday, prompting analysts to forecast the Bank of Canada could move slower on rate hikes.
The economy expanded by 0.4% in August, missing estimates, and looked set to show no growth in September, when supply chain issues crimped auto exports and retail sales declined, Statistics Canada said. 
The agriculture sector, hit hard by hot and dry conditions, is also weighing on economic activity.
Third quarter annualized GDP rose by just 1.9%, Statscan said in a flash estimate, much less than the 5.5% forecast by the Bank of Canada on Wednesday, when it signaled a rate hike could come as soon as April 2022.
Even though the central bank and Statistics Canada use slightly different ways of measuring GDP, analysts said the third quarter projections made an early hike less likely.
""This reduces the chance of the Bank hiking interest rates as soon as the second quarter next year,"" said Stephen Brown, senior Canada economist at Capital Economics. Economic activity, which remains about 1% below pre-pandemic levels, is unlikely to close that gap until early 2022, he added.
Avery Shenfeld, chief economist at CIBC Capital Markets, noted the preliminary third quarter data revealed the impacts of global supply chain difficulties on the ability of the goods sector to meet orders.
""The supply bottlenecks are both raising inflation and impeding growth at the same time,"" he said in a note, adding Canada could enjoy stronger growth and softer inflation in 2022 if the challenges eased. 
The Bank of Canada expects inflation, which touched an 18-year high at 4.4% in September, to rise further this year and then average 3.4% in 2022, above its 1-3% control range.

The Canadian dollar was trading 0.4% lower at 1.2387 to the greenback, or 80.73 U.S. cents. Investors continued to price in a first rate hike in March.
The August gain of 0.4% was behind analyst estimates of 0.7%, as agriculture weighed. Overall, 15 of 20 industrial sectors posted increases, with services-producing industries up by 0.6% while goods-producing industries declined 0.1%.

1103,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 29, 2021 09:26AM ET</span>",U.S. labor costs power ahead in third quarter as wages surge,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. labor costs increased by the most since 2001 as companies boosted wages and benefits amid a severe worker shortage, suggesting inflation could remain high for sometime.
The Employment Cost Index, the broadest measure of labor costs, surged 1.3% last quarter after rising 0.7% in the April-June period, the Labor Department said on Friday. The largest gain since 2001 reflected an increase across industries. 
Labor costs powered ahead 3.7% on a year-on-year basis, the largest rise since the fourth quarter of 2004, after increasing 2.9% in the second quarter.
""While wage increases were initially concentrated in lower wage industries, more recently wage pressures have been broadening across industries,"" said Veronica Clark, an economist at  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) in New York. ""Upward pressure on wages reaching relatively higher wage industries would suggest a greater chance that rising labor costs, along with rising prices for various other inputs, are passed on through higher consumer prices.""
The ECI is widely viewed by policymakers and economists as one of the better measures of labor market slack and a predictor of core inflation as it adjusts for composition and job quality changes. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the ECI advancing 0.9% in the third quarter.
Wages and salaries soared 1.5% after increasing 0.9% in the second quarter. They were up 4.2% year-on-year. Benefits gained 0.9% after rising 0.4% in the April-June quarter.
The COVID-19 pandemic has upended labor market dynamics, creating an economy-wide acute shortage of workers. There were 10.4 million job openings at the end of August. 

The Federal Reserve's preferred inflation gauge, the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index excluding food and energy, rose at a 4.5% rate in the third quarter after increasing at a 6.1% pace in the April-June quarter, the government reported on Thursday. The U.S. central bank has a flexible 2% inflation target.

1104,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 29, 2021 06:37AM ET</span>",Taiwan's economy grows slightly more slowly than expected in Q3 on COVID hit,"TAIPEI (Reuters) -Taiwan's economy grew at its slowest pace since the second quarter of 2020 in the July-September period as coronavirus curbs to contain a local COVID-19 outbreak hit consumption, but exports and investment remained strong.
Gross domestic product (GDP) grew 3.8% in third quarter from a year earlier after a 7.43% rise in the April-June period, preliminary data from the statistics agency showed on Friday, coming in just below the 4% increase forecast in a Reuters poll.
That was the smallest growth since the second quarter of 2020, when the economy gained 0.35%.
""(GDP growth was) mainly attributed to better-than-expected domestic investment as well as continuous expansion of exports,"" the agency said in a statement.
""But consumption was weak due to the impact from epidemic curbs, which partially offset growth.""
As a key hub in the global technology supply chain for giants such as Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), Taiwan's economy has outperformed many of its regional peers during the COVID-19 pandemic as it benefited from robust demand for its tech exports during the work-and-study-from-home trend.
Government restrictions to contain a rise in COVID-19 cases from mid-May helped trigger a 5.49% decline in consumption in the third quarter. But economists expect consumption to rebound as the government has since lifted most of those restrictions, having managed to contain the outbreak.
""With the recent COVID-19 outbreak under control and the vaccine rollout gaining momentum, consumption should recover,"" said Gareth Leather, senior Asia economist at Capital Economics.
Meanwhile, Taiwan's economy continues to benefit from strong global demand for its high-tech goods and chips, while domestic investment has also underpinned economic activity.
Total exports soared 30.12% year-on-year in U.S. dollar terms in the third quarter, the agency said, adding investment in manufacturing capacity expansion and renewable energy was increasing, without providing further details.
""A backlog of orders will keep Taiwan's exporters busy for some time yet. Meanwhile, the surge in demand for semiconductors is leading to a boom in investment, which will continue to support GDP,"" Leather added.
2021 OUTLOOK
ANZ said it had revised higher its GDP growth forecast to 6.0% in 2021 thanks to strong investment in the third quarter.
That was in keeping with official forecasts, with both the government and the central bank betting on 6.0% growth in 2021. The economy expanded 3.12% in pandemic-hit 2020.
Statistics official Wu Pei-hsuan said as long as international demand for the island's products persists, both Taiwan's exports and production could keep their ""strong growth momentum"" next year. 
Pent-up demand in countries emerging from lockdowns has boosted sales, while microchip prices are surging due to a global shortage.
A global shortage of chips for everything from cars to consumer electronics has also bolstered demand for made-in-Taiwan semiconductors, with producers rapidly expanding capacity.
One potential risk could be a slowdown in the economy of China, Taiwan's top trading partner. The world's second-largest economy grew at its slowest pace in a year in the third quarter, hurt by power shortages, supply bottlenecks and sporadic COVID-19 outbreaks.

Taiwan's central bank has kept interest rates at record lows since the last cut in March 2020, and analysts say it is unlikely to increase them until later next year at the earliest, and only after an eventual U.S. rate hike.
Taiwan's revised GDP figures, including growth estimates for the full year, will be released in November.

Heavy rains that flooded key northern producing regions pushed up the prices of vegetables, fuelling concern over food prices at a time when consumers must brace for a hike in energy costs ahead of winter.
Local authorities must ""strengthen responsibility and make ensuring stable production and supplies of vegetables an important task,"" the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs said on its website.
The prices of vegetables have jumped in some regions since late September, fuelled by factors such as disastrous weather, rising costs of production, coronavirus control measures and power curbs, the ministry added.
The call comes as Beijing focuses on food security after the COVID-19 pandemic, as the world’s top consumer struggles with an unpreceded power crunch that has pushed up production costs.

The ministry asked local governments to ensure sufficient emergency stockpiles of vegetables. It urged them to stabilise prices, and ensure supplies during autumn and winter, particularly during festive occasions such as the Lunar New Year, the Spring Festival and the Winter Olympics.
It also urged preparation of emergency plans to cushion against the impact of bad weather and diseases.

1106,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 29, 2021 06:12AM ET</span>",China's factory activity expected to shrink slightly in October - Reuters poll,"BEIJING (Reuters) - China's factory activity likely contracted slightly in October, a Reuters poll showed on Friday, as high raw material prices and power cuts continued to pressure manufacturers in the world's second-largest economy.
The official manufacturing Purchasing Manager's Index (PMI)is expected to rise to 49.7 in October, just above a reading of 49.6 in September, according to the median forecast of 23 economists polled by Reuters. A reading below 50 indicates contraction from the previous month.
China's economy rapidly recovered from a pandemic-induced slump last year, but momentum has weakened in recent months, with the vast manufacturing sector facing heightened costs and production bottlenecks, and more recently, electricity rationing.
Power curbs should have eased slightly after policymakers moved to bring down coal prices, although overall factory activity is still likely to have shrunk, said analysts at Standard Chartered (OTC:SCBFF) Bank.
""The authorities introduced steps to boost coal supply and raised the price cap for power supply to promote electricity production and contain demand from high-energy-consuming industries,"" they said.
September factory gate inflation rose to a record on soaring commodity prices, but weak demand capped consumer inflation, forcing policymakers to walk a tight rope between supporting the economy and further stoking producer prices.
China is also dealing with ongoing small-scale coronavirus outbreaks, which could disrupt economic activity. Health authorities reported 64 new confirmed coronavirus cases for Oct. 28, with local infections concentrated in the country's north.
Profits at China's industrial firms rose at a faster pace in September despite surging prices and supply bottlenecks, thanks mainly to stellar growth in mining and raw materials industries although some businesses struggled to shake off the high costs.
Analysts polled by Reuters expect the People's Bank of China to refrain from attempts to stimulate the economy by reducing the amount of cash banks must hold in reserve until the first quarter of 2022.

The official PMI, which largely focuses on big andstate-owned firms, and its sister survey on the services sector,will be released on Sunday.
The private Caixin manufacturing PMI will be published on Monday. Analysts expect the headline reading will stay at 50, the same as the month before, with activity stable.

1107,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 29, 2021 05:11AM ET</span>",Supply shortages hold back German third-quarter growth,"BERLIN (Reuters) - Supply bottlenecks hampering German manufacturers held back German output in the third quarter, data showed on Friday.
Europe's largest economy grew by 1.8% quarter on quarter in adjusted terms, the Federal Statistics Office said. That fell short of a forecast for 2.2% in a Reuters poll.
Growth in the second quarter was revised up to 1.9% from 1.6%, and the economy remains 1.1% below its pre-pandemic level.
Supply shortages are preventing some manufacturers with full order books from producing at full capacity, and rising energy prices are driving up consumer prices, raising concerns of weak growth as winter approaches.
But the economy is expected to remain in growth territory as sectors like gastronomy, tourism and entertainment shuttered for months during the pandemic cater to pent-up demand.

The 1.8% quarterly expansion reflects strong activity in the services sector during the summer months, Fritzi Kohler-Geib of KfW bank said.
""Without the stubborn material bottlenecks that restricted the producing sector in particular, the growth in economic output could have been even higher,"" she wrote in a note. ""Unfortunately, the supply-side distortions will probably only ease next year.""

Flash data from the National Statistics Institute (INE) showed gross domestic product expanded by 2% in the third quarter from the second and by 2.7% from the same period in 2020. Economists polled by Reuters expected a 2.7% quarter-on-quarter expansion and a 3.5% annual growth.
Crucially, private spending decreased 0.5% quarter on quarter as Spaniards held on to savings built up over a year of subdued consumption.
Despite strong growth from the hospitality and retail sectors over summer, key industries like real-estate and financial services slowed down.
Angel Talavera, head of European Economics at the Oxford Economics consultancy, said on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) that the growth was ""quite disappointing"" and that he expected future revisions.
At the start of the quarter Spain was still grappling with its most recent wave of COVID-19 infections, which it has since reined in through widespread vaccination. 
National statistics are still distorted by the effects of a strict lockdown imposed in the second and third quarters of 2020. 
In September the INE slashed its final second-quarter growth figure to 1.1%, less than half its initial estimate, prompting the central bank to say it would lower its forecasts for the full 2021 significantly.
Rising inflation, which reached a nearly 30-year high in October on soaring energy costs, has cast further doubt on the speed and scale of Spain's recovery from a historic 10.8% slump last year. 
However, the government has stuck to its bullish predictions for a return to pre-pandemic GDP levels by the end of the year and expects 6.5% annual growth in 2021, followed by an even higher 7% in 2022.

The Economy Ministry said the latest data put Spain in a good position to face up to a fourth quarter likely to be marked by rising energy prices and supply bottlenecks. 
Buoyant third-quarter jobs data released on Thursday, which saw Spain surpass 20 million people employed for the first time since 2008, provided some basis for optimism.

Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire told France Info radio the figure was an ""exceptional result"" that showed the economy was heading in the right direction.
A Reuters poll of 24 analysts had forecast a 2.1% expansion for the July-September period
The INSEE national statistics agency said the third-quarter growth meant France's economy was close to getting back to its level before the COVID-19 pandemic hit.
Analysts at investment bank ING hailed the third-quarter figures as ""excellent news"" but warned they could represent a peak for the year as the global economy battles inflationary concerns and supply chain problems.
""The peak has been reached and from now on, economic growth will start to slow,"" ING said.
Spiralling energy prices in October saw France's EU-harmonised rate of inflation jump to 3.2% year-on-year (vs 2.7% the previous month) as the cost of energy leapt 20.1%, INSEE reported.
Month-on-month prices rose 0.5%, it added.
Central banks around the world have been signalling tighter policy amid rising prices, though European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde on Thursday pushed back against market bets that price pressures would trigger an interest rate hike as soon as next year.
She identified higher energy prices, a global mismatch between recovering demand and supply, and one-off base effects such as the end of a cut in German sales taxes as the three main factors temporarily driving euro zone inflation.
INSEE has forecast the French economy to grow 6.25% for 2021.

The official manufacturing purchasing managers’ index was likely little changed at 49.7 this month from 49.6 in September, according to the median estimate in a Bloomberg survey of economists. Readings below the 50-mark signal contraction. The National Bureau of Statistics is scheduled to release the data at 9 a.m. Sunday in Beijing. 
An electricity crunch that began in September extended into this month, although probably eased as the government rolled out a slew of measures to contain the crisis. On top of that, consumer spending remains weak and manufacturers are battling higher prices. 
“The biggest problem for manufacturing is that domestic demand and consumption is still quite weak, and it’s been sluggish for the entire year,” said Zhou Hao, senior emerging markets economist at Commerzbank AG (OTC:CRZBY) in Singapore. 
Soaring commodity costs pushed up producer inflation to its highest level in almost 26 years in September, and a set of data tracked by Bloomberg Economics indicates a further pickup in prices this month. That’s squeezing profits of downstream producers, like consumer-goods makers.  
On the plus side, export demand remains strong, as recent South Korean trade data showed, providing a boost to manufacturing. China’s exports reached a monthly record of $306 billion in September. 
What Bloomberg Economics Says...
China’s October PMIs are likely to show mild cross-currents in a generally still-sluggish economy. The manufacturing sector may have avoided further weakening but likely remained in contraction with no signs of an imminent turnaround. The non-manufacturing sector probably slowed.

The non-manufacturing index, which measures activity in the construction and services sectors, likely softened to 53 from 53.2 in September. The repeated Covid outbreaks and tighter virus control rules have weighed on consumer sentiment, while construction activity is under pressure from a slowdown in government infrastructure spending and a crackdown on the property sector. 
Economists have cut their fourth-quarter growth forecasts sharply because of the property turmoil and power shortages, with a further slowdown expected next year. 
A set of earliest available indicators tracked by Bloomberg signaled the risk of a further downturn this month, with car and housing sales dropping again even as exports continue their strong performance and the government seeks to allay concerns over growth.

SEOUL (Reuters) -South Korea's factory output snapped 10 straight months of year-on-year growth in September, dashing expectations for continued expansion, as global chip shortages hit production.
Industrial production last month fell 1.8% year-on-year, Statistics Korea data showed on Friday, missing forecasts for 1.4% growth and down from a 9.7% expansion in August. On a seasonally adjusted monthly basis, output fell 0.8%, missing a median 0.3% decline forecast and following a 0.7% drop in August.
A breakdown of data showed production of cars shrank 9.8% from a month earlier, while that of semiconductors and electrical equipments also slumped 1.6% and 5.2%, respectively.
""September industrial output was weak as global supply chain disruptions were seen weighing on production in the manufacturing industry and on fewer working days,"" said Oh Chang-sob, an economist at Hyundai Motor Securities.
The country's biggest carmaker Hyundai Motor Co reported a lower-than-expected profits on Tuesday as the global chip crisis drove down vehicle shipments and said it will take a long time to get back to normal chip supplies.
That comes just weeks after its global chief operating officer said the automaker aims to develop its own chips to reduce reliance on chipmakers.
Separately, Samsung Electronics (OTC:SSNLF) Co Ltd on Thursday said it expects component shortages to affect chip demand in the current quarter, even as it reported the highest quarterly profit in three years.
On an annual basis, production for cars and metal products plunged 24.2% and 16.9%, respectively, offsetting a 30.6% expansion in semiconductors.

Friday's data also showed service sector output expanded 1.3% month-on-month in September, while retail sales jumped 2.5%, helped by the easing of COVID-19 restrictions at home.
South Korea unveiled on Monday a three-phase scheme to scrap all limits on distancing curbs gone by February, except for mask-wearing mandates.

The National Association of Realtors (NAR) said on Thursday its Pending Home Sales Index, based on signed contracts, decreased 2.3% last month to 116.7. Pending home sales fell in all four regions. 
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast contracts, which become sales after a month or two, would be unchanged. Pending home sales dropped 8.0% in September on a year-on-year basis. Scarce inventory has led to double-digit growth in home prices.
""Some potential buyers have momentarily paused their home search with intentions to resume in 2022,"" said Lawrence Yun, NAR's chief economist.

Demand for housing surged early in the coronavirus pandemic amid an exodus from cities to suburbs and other lower-density locations as Americans sought more spacious accommodations for home offices and online schooling. The buying frenzy has abated as workers return to offices and schools reopened for in-person learning, thanks to COVID-19 vaccinations.
The high cost of homes is squeezing first-time buyers out of the market. The NAR reported last week that the share of first-time buyers in September was the smallest since July 2015.

Madrid (Reuters) -Spanish inflation surged to a 29-year high in October as national consumer prices rose 5.5% year-on-year, flash data from the National Statistics Institute (INE) showed on Thursday, threatening the economic recovery.
Inflation sped up from 4.0% in September and is running at its fastest pace since September 1992, when the peseta weakened against the deutschmark and the rate reached 5.8%.
Driving the surge was an increase in energy costs and, to a lesser extent, in prices for package holidays and vehicle fuels and lubricants.
Soaring electricity prices play such a prominent role that the gap with core inflation, which excludes energy and food, is the highest since records began in 1986.
Inflation has risen across the euro zone in recent months, but to a lesser extent. The region's harmonised annual rate was 3.4% in September. 
Spanish core inflation, at 1.4% in October, is the indicator that most concerns experts and central banks in anticipating possible changes in monetary policy.
While the government argues price rises are transitory, economists fear they could trigger second-round effects on wages and erode corporate competitiveness.
Falling unemployment, driven by a sharp increase in hospitality hiring over the summer, is likely to exacerbate price pressure.
Industrial prices reached their highest level since 1977 after jumping 23.6% year-on-year in September, according to INE data published this week.
And, potentially compounding the effect, Spain is set to raise pensions in line with inflation and increase the minimum wage and public salaries in 2022.
Responding to elevated energy prices, the Funcas thinktank on Wednesday trimmed its 2021 economic growth forecast to 5.1% from 6.3%.
INE data also showed Spain's EU-harmonised consumer price index rose by 5.5% in October on an annual basis, the highest reading since the series began in 1997. Analysts polled by Reuters had expected a 4.8% price increase.
Spain's central bank expects relatively high inflation rates to continue over the coming months although the underlying causes are transitory, Governor Pablo Hernandez de Cos said on Monday.

Elevated energy costs could persist through the winter as cold weather boosts demand and oil and gas storage levels are relatively low, he said.
Spain recently approved a package of measures to mitigate the impact of rising gas prices on consumers, but watered down the bill after fierce opposition from utilities.

STOCKHOLM (Reuters) -Sweden's economy grew more quickly than expected in the third quarter, as a vaccine rollout accelerated and COVID-19 curbs were lifted, a preliminary estimate from the Statistics Office showed on Thursday.
GDP expanded by 1.8% in the third quarter from the previous three-month period, outperforming a forecast of 1.3% in a Reuters poll. The economy grew 4.7% compared to the third quarter last year.
The Swedish economy has bounced back more rapidly from the pandemic than many others in Europe, with activity returning to pre-COVID-19 levels in the second quarter.
Sweden, which never went to lockdown during the pandemic, lifted almost all remaining curbs and recommendations at the end of September.
Bottlenecks and global supply chain issues have hit some manufacturers and raised questions over how long the economy can keep going at full speed. Several Swedish car and truck makers were forced to halt production in August due to semi-conductor shortages.
""The growth numbers are strong, especially considering that shortages of goods hampered growth,"" Nordea wrote in a research note. ""Coupled with higher inflation, this makes a reduction of the Riksbank’s stimulus measures more likely.""
The pace of headline inflation in Sweden picked up to its highest level in more than a decade in September. The Riksbank, which believes price pressure will subdue next year, expects to hold its balance sheet unchanged in 2022 and for the benchmark repo rate to remain at 0% until at least the final quarter of 2024.

Separate figures from the National Institute of Economic Research showed Swedish consumer confidence fell to 103.1 in October from 106.6 in the previous month, but manufacturing confidence rose to a historically strong 128.5 from 126.1.
Retail sales fell 0.3% in September compared to the previous month but rose 4.8 percent compared to the same month last year.

On a monthly basis, crude oil imports increased 1.3% versus August. 
Earlier this month, data showed fuel consumption and refiners' crude oil throughput ticked higher in September from the preceding month.
Oil product imports jumped about 13% to 3.50 million tonnes from a year earlier and exports were up about 3%.

Overall exports to major trading partners also continued to expand over Oct. 1-20, with those to China, the United States and European Union rising 30.9%, 37.1% and 42.1% respectively.
Economists in Thursday's poll also saw South Korea's total imports growing 40.1% year-on-year in October. That would compare with 31.0% in September.
""We expect a decline in the trade surplus in October mainly due to a rise in imports ... as the recent surge in energy prices probably supported imports,"" Oh said.
The government will publish full-month trade data on Monday at 9 a.m. local time (0000 GMT).
In the same Reuters poll, 12 economists projected consumer price index (CPI) this month to jump 3.2% from a year earlier, the fastest rise since January 2012 and greater than September's 2.5%.
""Consumer inflation would have risen on soaring energy prices ... and low base last year due to the government's subsidies on phone bills,"" said economist Park Sung-woo at DB Financial Investment.
""Despite the oil tax cut, the fourth quarter CPI growth will remain high on upside pressures on energy prices during the winter season,"" he said.

South Korea decided to temporarily lower tax on key oil products by 20% for six months to mitigate impact from surging energy prices.
Some 17 economists also estimated industrial output in September shrank a median 0.7% from August.

1118,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 27, 2021 12:42PM ET</span>",U.S. business spending on equipment strong; auto shortages sink exports,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - New orders for U.S.-made capital goods increased to a record high in September and shipments surged, pointing to strong business spending on equipment, though stretched supply chains likely hampered overall economic growth in the third quarter.
Slower growth expectations were reinforced by other data from the Commerce Department on Wednesday showing the goods trade deficit widening sharply last month, with exports slumping. While wholesale inventories increased, stocks at retailers fell as supply at auto dealerships continued to decrease rapidly amid a global semiconductor shortage.
The reports, which came ahead of the government's snapshot of third-quarter gross domestic product on Thursday, had some economists ratcheting down their growth estimates. The economy is believed to have expanded at the slowest pace since the second quarter of 2020, when it suffered a historic contraction in the wake of stringent mandatory measures to contain the first wave of COVID-19 infections.
""The third quarter may be the weakest quarter for economic growth in over a year, but you would never know it looking at business capital spending setting records this month,"" said Christopher Rupkey, chief economist at FWDBONDS in New York. ""Business is looking past the slowdown in consumer spending in the third quarter and betting consumers will return to the shops and malls later this year and clear the shelves.""
Orders for non-defense capital goods excluding aircraft, a closely watched proxy for business spending plans, rose 0.8% last month to an all-time high. These so-called core capital goods orders advanced 0.5% in August. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast core capital goods orders gaining 0.5%.
There were increases in orders for machinery, primary metals and fabricated metals products. But orders for electrical equipment, appliances and components fell as did those for computers and electronic products, likely because of the worldwide chip shortage. 
Shipments of core capital goods shot up 1.4% last month after rising 0.6% in August. Core capital goods shipments are used to calculate equipment spending in the GDP measurement.
Business spending on equipment has recorded double-digit growth for four straight quarters. While economists expect another strong quarter in the advance third-quarter GDP report on Thursday, the pace probably moderated because of the acute motor vehicle shortage, which has undercut auto purchases. 
High inflation due to strained supply chains is seen eating into the growth in equipment investment.
""Squaring this nominal increase in shipments with the run-up in producer prices for private capital goods takes away some of the optimism,"" said Tim Quinlan, a senior economist at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) in Charlotte, North Carolina.
Stocks on Wall Street were mixed. The dollar slipped against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices rose.
SUPPLY BOTTLENECKS
The COVID-19 pandemic shifted demand towards goods as well as causing severe labor disruptions, resulting in unprecedented bottlenecks in the supply chain, which economists and businesses expect to persist through the first half of 2022.
The backlog of core capital goods hit a record high in September. That should keep manufacturing, which accounts for 12% of the economy, humming.
Orders for durable goods, items ranging from toasters to aircraft that are meant to last three years or more, fell 0.4% after advancing 1.3% in August. They were weighed down by a 2.3% decline in orders for transportation equipment, which followed a 3.8% jump in August. That largely reflected motor vehicle shortages, which resulted in orders declining 2.9% after tumbling 3.9% in August. 
Orders for the volatile civilian aircraft category plunged 27.9% after soaring 63.9% in August. Boeing (NYSE:BA) reported on its website that it had received 27 aircraft orders last month compared to 53 in August. Unfilled orders of durable goods rose 0.7% after advancing 0.9% in the prior month.
The flow of goods has also been disrupted by the supply constraints. In another report on Wednesday, the Commerce Department said the goods trade deficit increased 9.2% to a record $96.3 billion in September. Goods exports dropped 4.7%, with motor vehicle exports tumbling 2.0%. 
Outside the shutdown in spring 2020, September was the worst month for motor vehicle production since 2010. There were also sharp decreases in exports of capital goods and industrial supplies last month. Goods imports gained 0.5%. But motor vehicle imports plunged 7.7%. 
The wider goods trade deficit prompted economists at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) to lower their third-quarter GDP growth estimate to a 2.9% annualized rate from a 3.0% pace. Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) trimmed its forecast by half a percentage point to a 2.75% rate.
Those estimates are within the range of forecasts in a Reuters survey of economists, which predicted the economy growing at a 2.7% rate in the third quarter. That would be a step-down from the 6.7% rate notched in the second quarter. 
The Commerce Department report also showed wholesale inventories increased 1.1% last month. But retail inventories fell 0.2%, pulled down by a 2.4% plunge in stocks at auto dealerships. Retail inventories, excluding autos, which go into the calculation of GDP, rose 0.6%

Inventories were depleted in the first half of the year. Economists believe the pace of decline lessened in the third quarter, accounting for the bulk of expected GDP growth. Trade has been a drag on GDP growth for a year, while inventories have subtracted from output for two straight quarters.
""Trade flows will continue to see pandemic-related disruptions, broken supply chains, shortages as well as delays, but should eventually rebalance as these effects diminish and global economies come back online more completely,"" said Rubeela Farooqi, chief U.S. economist at High Frequency Economics, in White Plains, New York.

1120,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 27, 2021 05:59AM ET</span>",Vegetables pricier than pork worry Chinese consumers as costs swell,"By Dominique Patton
BEIJING (Reuters) - Vegetable prices are surging in China after heavy rain swamped crops this month, fuelling concern over food prices at a time when consumers must brace for a hike in energy costs in the run-up to winter.
Unusually heavy rains drenched northern swathes of China in September and early this month, flooding the top vegetable-growing province of Shandong.
""All the vegetables are dead in the ground,"" said Zhou Rui, a farmer who cultivates about 7 hectares (17 acres) in the Juancheng county of the province. 
There was little left to pick after fields of spinach, cabbage and coriander were flooded, she added, while some farmers had not replanted as the weather had already become too cold.
The price of spinach has jumped to 16.67 yuan ($2.61) per kg this week from 6.67 yuan in late September, a price index published in the provincial vegetable trading hub of Shouguang showed.
The prices of broccoli, cucumbers, and cabbage have also more than doubled in recent weeks.
The rocketing prices are a hot topic on China's Twitter-like Weibo (NASDAQ:WB), with many users saying vegetables now cost more than pork, the nation's staple meat.
""Coriander is now 17.8 yuan per half kilo, it really is more expensive than pork!"" wrote one user in the eastern province of Anhui. 
The rise, at a time of growing scrutiny for inflation, is worrying government officials in Beijing who are keen to ensure sufficient food supplies ahead of winter.
The average wholesale price of vegetables in the capital has jumped by 39.8% since last month, while some leafy vegetables rose more than 50%, the city government said on Tuesday. 
Authorities in Beijing have warned that prices could rise further in the next few weeks, as the city looks further south to source its vegetables when temperatures fall and high energy prices boost transport costs.
High vegetable prices are unlikely to push up overall consumer price inflation, but they come as soaring fuel costs look set to be gradually passed on to consumers.
""It's a very sharp increase, so it's very noticeable,"" said Darin Friedrichs, senior Asia commodity analyst at StoneX. ""We may see consumers budgeting purchasing of other things in response."" 
Higher energy prices are also pushing up operating costs for greenhouses, in addition to record prices this year for fertiliser.
""Our natural gas prices are up at least 100% and we think they could triple during Chinese New Year,"" said Xu Dan, manager of the HortiPolaris greenhouse in Beijing, referring to China's most important holiday, due next February. 
""I have to find a way to increase our energy efficiency. You can't ask consumers to pay three times the price.""

Chinese coal prices have gained nearly 190% this year on tight supplies following tough safety checks and graft investigations in key mining regions, while heavy rains flooded dozens of northern coal mines.

1121,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 27, 2021 04:10AM ET</span>",French consumer confidence falls in October as inflation worries grows,"PARIS (Reuters) -French consumer confidence in October fell back below its long-term average on Wednesday as households fretted about the impact of rising prices on their ability to save in the future.
Six months from a presidential election, the data will be closely watched by the government which has tried in recent weeks to cap energy and electricity prices and help lower income families pay winter heating bills and cope with inflation.
The INSEE official statistics agency said consumer sentiment fell 2 points to 99 in October from 101 in September. Fourteen analysts polled by Reuters had forecast a figure of 101 for the October reading.
Spiralling energy prices have led to a pick-up in inflation in Europe. Prime Minister Jean Castex last week announced a 100 euro grant to help lower income families cushion the pain of rising gas, electricity and gasoline prices.
The grant was on top of an expansion of France's voucher scheme to aid households with their heating costs during cold winter months and curbs on electricity rates. 
Even so, some families https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/bleak-houses-families-struggle-foot-frances-soaring-energy-bills-2021-10-26 say they are cutting back on groceries, refuelling their cars less and using the heating more sparingly to make ends meet. 

The INSEE data showed a sharp fall (-9 points) in household's confidence in their ability to save and a more moderate dip in sentiment about their future outlook.
On a more positive front for President Emmanuel Macron, consumer concerns about unemployment again fell heavily as the economy bounces back from the COVID pandemic.

1122,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 26, 2021 03:15PM ET</span>",U.S. consumer confidence rebounds; house price growth likely peaked,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. consumer confidence unexpectedly rose in October as concerns about high inflation were offset by improving labor market prospects, suggesting economic growth was picking up after a turbulent third quarter.
The survey from the Conference Board on Tuesday showed consumers eager to buy a home and big-ticket items such as motor vehicles and major household appliances over the next six months. The share of Americans planning to go on vacation was the largest since February 2020, just before the nation was slammed by the first wave of COVID-19 infections.
A resurgence in coronavirus cases over the summer, driven by the Delta variant, and supply-chain constraints related to the pandemic restrained economic activity last quarter. 
""Consumers are more upbeat after a rocky third quarter and this argues for a strong finish for the economy in 2021,"" said Christopher Rupkey, chief economist at FWDBONDS in New York. ""Consumers know the tight labor market has their backs. Those forecasting a recession from the drop in the confidence late in the summer will have to back off that call.""
The consumer confidence index increased to a reading of 113.8 this month from 109.8 in September, ending three straight monthly declines. The measure, which places more emphasis on the labor market, remains below its peak of 128.9 in June. The rise contrasted with the University of Michigan's survey of consumers, which showed sentiment falling early this month.
The rebound in confidence coincided with an ebb in coronavirus infections. Consumers were upbeat about both current conditions and the short-term outlook. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast that the index would dip to 108.3. 
The Conference Board's so-called labor market differential, derived from data on respondents' views on whether jobs are plentiful or hard to get, raced to a reading of 45 this month, the highest in 21 years, from 43.5 in September. 
This measure closely correlates to the unemployment rate in the Labor Department's closely watched employment report.
Combined with declining new claims for unemployment benefits, it raises hopes that job gains picked up this month after employers hired the fewest workers in nine months in September. Slower job growth has been blamed on pandemic-related labor shortages. There were 10.4 million job openings at the end of August.
""This is another sign that job growth reaccelerated in October,"" said Ryan Sweet, a senior economist at Moody's (NYSE:MCO) Analytics in West Chester, Pennsylvania. ""It points toward a decline in the unemployment rate in October.""
Stocks on Wall Street were trading mostly higher. The dollar rose against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices were mixed.
HITTING THE ROAD
Consumers' inflation expectations over the next 12 months jumped to 7.0%, the highest in 13 years, from 6.5% last month.
Despite perceptions of high inflation, consumers planned to step up spending. Buying intentions for motor vehicles rebounded from a nine-month low. More consumers intended to purchase household appliances like washing machines, television sets and refrigerators over the next six months. 
Some economists speculated that higher prices were forcing consumers to bring forward purchases to avoid paying even more for goods. The rebound suggested consumer spending would regain steam after an apparent sharp deceleration last quarter.
Economists believe the government's snapshot of third-quarter gross domestic product growth on Thursday will likely show that consumer spending stalled last quarter after growing at a robust 12% annualized rate in the April-June period. 
With spending weak, third-quarter GDP growth estimates are mostly below a 3% rate. The economy grew at a 6.7% pace in the second quarter. The anticipated slowdown would reflect widespread shortages, including for goods such as motor vehicles and some household appliances, as well as the Delta variant's hit to spending on services like air travel and hotel accommodation.
""Slower growth doesn't imply a weak economy,"" said Joel Naroff, chief economist at Naroff Economics in Holland, Pennsylvania. ""There is nothing soft about it, at least when it comes to demand.""  
Consumer spending this quarter is also likely to be boosted by increased demand for travel. The percentage of consumers saying they plan to take a vacation in the next six months increased to 47.6%. That was the highest figure since the pandemic started and was up from 42.3% in September. 
They mostly planned trips in the United States and intended to either drive or fly to their destinations.
There was good news on the housing market. In a separate report on Tuesday, the Commerce Department said sales of new single-family homes surged 14.0% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 800,000 units in September.
The Conference Board survey showed consumers more inclined to buying a home over the next six months. The housing market could get a lift from a moderation in house price inflation.
A third report on Tuesday showed the S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller's 20 metropolitan area home price index rose 19.7% on a year-on-year basis after a record 20% jump in July.

Signs that house price growth has peaked were evident in a fourth report from the Federal Housing Finance Agency that showed house prices rose 18.5% in the 12 months through August after surging by a record 19.2% in July.
""The slowing acceleration in home prices suggests that buyer fatigue is setting in, particularly among higher-priced homes where the acceleration in price growth from the previous month has been larger compared to low-tier homes,"" said Selma Hepp, deputy chief economist at CoreLogic.

(Reuters) - U.S. consumers, itching for a change of scene after more than a year-and-a-half of constricted pandemic life, are as eager to travel as at any time since COVID-19 sent the world into rolling waves of lockdowns, and now a record number of Americans plan to get out of the country in the next six months.
Nearly 48% of consumers plan a vacation in the next half year, a survey from the Conference Board released on Tuesday showed. That is the highest positive response rate to the every-other-month question included in the economic research group's benchmark consumer confidence survey since February 2020, the month before the coronavirus triggered a short but deep recession.
Travel and leisure activities were the hardest hit by coronavirus lockdowns. They began improving notably early this year on the back of COVID-19 vaccinations but tailed off over the summer and early fall as the Delta variant swept through the country, especially regions with the lowest inoculation rates such as the South that are also popular vacation destinations.

https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-ECONOMY/TRAVEL/znvnezoaopl/chart.png 
Lynn Franco, the Conference Board's senior director of economic indicators, said in a statement the increase this month was ""a reflection of the ongoing resurgence in consumers' willingness to travel and spend on in-person services.""
That indication came as consumer confidence overall rose unexpectedly in October, snapping a three-month skid that had been triggered largely by the summer's Delta wave and by concerns over rising inflation.
While by far most people plan a trip somewhere in the United States - and by car - a record 16.8% said they are headed to a foreign country between now and next April. That tops the previous record of just under 15% in the October 2017 survey and is roughly double the series historic average of 8.4% dating to the 1970s. 
For a graphic on Headed to distant shores:
https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-ECONOMY/TRAVEL/lgpdwleywvo/chart.png 
With fewer people planning to travel by air, the surge in foreign travel plans may in part reflect the pending relaxation of restrictions at the U.S. borders with Canada and Mexico https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-open-border-with-canada-starting-early-november-buffalo-news-2021-10-13, the two countries most easily reached by motor vehicle from the United States.
Indeed, nearly 35% of those planning a getaway of any sort say they will travel by automobile, the fourth-highest percentage since the Conference Board launched the vacation-plans supplement to its survey in 1978.
Of those planning to get away, just 19.6% plan to get aboard an airplane, the lowest percentage since the Conference Board's survey in February. That is more than 3 percentage points lower than the average over the past decade and 10 points below the record of greater than 30% in August 2019. 
The number of passengers proceeding through airport security over the latest weekend totaled roughly 5.8 million, more than double the volume from a year earlier but still only about 85% of the passenger volumes from the comparable period in 2019, the latest Transportation Security Administration data showed.

New home sales jumped 14.0% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 800,000 units last month, the highest level since March, the Commerce Department said on Tuesday. August's sales pace was revised down to 702,000 units from the previously reported 740,000 units. Sales increased in the populous South, as well as in the West and Northeast. They, however, fell in the Midwest. 
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast new home sales, which account for more than 10% of U.S. home sales, increasing to a rate of 760,000 units. Sales dropped 17.6% on a year-on-year basis in September. They peaked at a rate of 993,000 units in January, which was the highest since the end of 2006. 
Demand for housing surged early in the COVID-19 pandemic amid an exodus from cities to suburbs and other low-density locations as Americans sought more spacious accommodations for home offices and online schooling. The buying frenzy has abated as workers return to offices and schools reopened for in-person learning, thanks to COVID-19 vaccinations.
The median new house price accelerated 18.7% in September to $408,800 from a year ago. Sales continued to be concentrated in the $200,000-$749,000 price range. Sales in the under-$200,000 price bracket, the sought-after segment of the market, accounted for only 2% of transactions.
About 74% of homes sold last month were either under construction or yet to be built. There were 379,000 new homes on the market, unchanged from in August. Houses under construction made up 62.5% of the inventory, with homes yet to be built accounting for about 28%. 
Builders are being hamstrung by shortages of key inputs like copper and steel because of strained supply chains. Lumber for framing remains expensive, while labor and some household appliances are also scarce. 

The government reported last week that housing starts and building permits fell in September.
At September's sales pace it would take 5.7 months to clear the supply of houses on the market, down from 6.5 months in August.

1126,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 26, 2021 07:23AM ET</span>",UK annual pay data shows biggest rise since 2008,"By David Milliken
LONDON (Reuters) - Full-time earnings in Britain rose by the most since 2008 in April, up by 4.3% from a year earlier, although the government's furlough scheme and other distortions related to COVID-19 probably pushed up growth, official data showed on Tuesday.
The Office for National Statistics' annual earnings survey is normally the gold standard of British labour market data, covering many more workers than its monthly figures.
But both series have been affected by the government's furlough programme - under which millions of workers had temporarily reduced pay rather than becoming unemployed - and the fact that job losses were concentrated among the low paid.
Tuesday's data paints a robust picture for pay growth that is similar to that of the monthly figures which the Bank of England is watching closely for signs of longer-term inflation pressures as it considers whether to raise interest rates next week.
Median full-time weekly pay in April of 611 pounds was 4.3% above its level a year earlier in cash terms and 1.7% higher after adjusting for inflation.
However, median full-time annual earnings in the 12 months to April were 0.6% lower than in 12 months to the end of April 2020 at 31,285 pounds ($43,023), reflecting lower pay during the pandemic.
""Pay increased for most workers in 2021, but particularly those that were most affected by the pandemic in 2020, most notably younger employees, men and the lowest-paid occupations,"" the ONS said.
Pay for 'elementary occupations' such as cleaning and labouring jobs rose by 7.7%, while pay for managers and directors showed no change.
Another factor pushing up pay at the bottom of the wage scale was a 2% rise in the minimum wage to 8.91 pounds an hour in April. The government announced on Monday a 6.6% rise in the minimum wage to 9.50 pounds an hour from April 2022.
Britain's gender pay gap - the difference between average hourly earnings for men and women - widened to 7.9% for full-time workers in April 2021 from 7.0% in April 2020, but was below its pre-pandemic level of 9.0% the ONS said.
The gender pay gap does not measure the difference in pay between men and women doing the same job, and nor does it adjust for differences in average qualifications, experience or the sectors men and women work in.

The gender pay gap stayed close to zero for full-time workers aged under 40, but older women were paid around 12% less than men of the same age. Previous analysis had linked this to fewer women than men moving into high-paid managerial roles, the ONS said.

The CBI's monthly distributive trade survey showed the headline sales balance for retailers picked up to +30 in October from +11 in September which was its lowest level since March, when many retailers were closed during a COVID-19 lockdown.
Economists polled by Reuters poll had mostly expected a reading of +13.
Sales were expected to pick up a bit more in November although retailers were keeping an eye on the latest rise in coronavirus cases in Britain.
But the survey's measure of stock adequacy sank to -23 in October, the seventh month in a row that it hit an all-time low. The shortages were expected to ease only moderately in November.
""Disruption to supply chains, combined with staff shortages and uncertain public health conditions mean retailers are finding it difficult to plan for the winter ahead,"" CBI economist Ben Jones said.

Finance minister Rishi Sunak should help the sector by reforming the business rates tax system when he announces a half-yearly budget plan on Wednesday, Jones said.
The CBI has long argued that the system is out of date and penalises companies which invest in energy efficiency.

By Joori Roh
SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea's economy grew at a slower-than-expected pace in the third quarter, as subdued private consumption and weak construction and facility investment offset robust exports.
Gross domestic product (GDP) grew a seasonally adjusted 0.3% in the third quarter, the Bank of Korea (BOK) data showed on Tuesday, the slowest in five quarters and following a 0.8% rise in the preceding three months. It also fell short of the 0.6% growth tipped in a Reuters survey.
Private consumption, which generates nearly half of South Korean GDP, contracted 0.3% in the September quarter after a 3.6% rise in the second quarter, while construction and facility investments also swung to declines of 3.0% and 2.3%, respectively.
Exports grew 1.5%, recovering from the June quarter's 2.0% contraction, on strong sales of semiconductors and petroleum products.
""The toughened social distancing measures and impacts from the heat wave and rising raw material prices that continued over the third quarter seem to have limited the recovery in domestic demand ... but exports were seen propping up the economy,"" Finance Minister Hong Nam-ki said.
From a year earlier, the economy expanded 4.0%, in part because of the low base last year, while both exports and imports picked up further on global economic recovery.
That was, however, a significant slowdown from the second quarter's 6.0% growth, and missed market forecast growth of 4.2%.
""The data does not diverge much from the August projection. Annual growth of 4% will be possible should the economy expand 1.04% on a sequential basis during the fourth quarter,"" a senior BOK official Hwang Sang-pil told reporters.
The BOK currently sees the economy growing 4% for the whole of 2021 after shrinking 0.9% last year.
Economists, however, are concerned global supply chain disruptions and inflation pressures may pose risks to the fourth-quarter outlook.
""The near-term outlook for exports and manufacturing sector is likely to be clouded by sustained concerns about the global supply bottleneck,"" Societe Generale (OTC:SCGLY)'s economist Oh Suk-tae said.
But the economy could regain steam as the government aims to scrap the COVID-19 curbs by early 2022, which could add a further boost to consumption. The three-phase scheme begins on Nov. 1.

""With the transition to a new COVID-19 scheme in November, the expansion in private consumption will contribute to the economic recovery, while the oil tax cut announced earlier today will also help boost consumption,"" Hwang said.
The finance ministry said it will temporarily cut down domestic tax on key oil products by a record 20% to reduce pressures from surging oil prices.

The companies signed up for $9.2 billion in new loans, leases and lines of credit last month, up from $8.7 billion a year earlier. Borrowings rose 8% from August.
""Supply chain disruptions and inflation concerns continue, with the Fed poised to gradually ease its asset purchases in the near term,"" ELFA Chief Executive Officer Ralph Petta said in a statement.
""For now, liquidity is abundant and businesses are acquiring the productive equipment necessary to respond to customer demand in a variety of market sectors,"" he said.
Washington-based ELFA, which reports economic activity for the nearly $1-trillion equipment finance sector, said credit approvals totaled 76.3%, unchanged from August.
ELFA's leasing and finance index measures the volume of commercial equipment financed in the United States.

The index is based on a survey of 25 members, including Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC), CIT Group (NYSE:CIT) Inc and the financing affiliates or units of  Caterpillar  Inc (NYSE:CAT), Dell Technologies (NYSE:DELL) Inc, Siemens AG (OTC:SIEGY), Canon Inc and Volvo AB (OTC:VLVLY).
The Equipment Leasing and Finance Foundation, ELFA's non-profit affiliate, reported a monthly confidence of 61.1% in October, up from 60.5% in September in their index. A reading above 50 indicates a positive business outlook.

1131,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 25, 2021 08:40AM ET</span>",Supply headaches sink German business morale to six-month low,"By Michael Nienaber and Balazs Koranyi
BERLIN/FRANKFURT (Reuters) -German business morale deteriorated for the fourth month running in October as supply bottlenecks in manufacturing, a spike in energy prices and rising COVID-19 infections are slowing the pace of recovery in Europe's largest economy from the pandemic.
The Ifo institute said on Monday that its business climate index fell to 97.7 from an upwardly revised 98.9 in September. This was the lowest reading since April and undershot the 97.9 consensus forecast in a Reuters poll.
The weaker-than-expected business sentiment survey was followed by a grim outlook from Germany's central bank, which said in its monthly report that economic growth was likely to slow sharply in the fourth quarter.
The Bundesbank added that full-year growth was now likely to be ""significantly"" below its 3.7% prediction made in June.
""Supply problems are giving businesses headaches,"" Ifo President Clemens Fuest said, adding that capacity utilisation in manufacturing was falling.
""Sand in the wheels of the German economy is hampering recovery.""
Half of all industrial companies are planning to hike prices due to the continuing supply problems, which is a record high in the survey, Ifo economist Klaus Wohlrabe said.
The bottlenecks for intermediate goods and raw materials are spilling over from manufacturing to other sectors of the economy too, such as retailing, meaning not every Christmas present will be available for delivery in time, Wohlrabe added.
The supply problems would slow down growth to roughly 0.5% in the fourth quarter, Wohlrabe said.
The German economy expanded by 1.6% quarter-on-quarter in the three months from April to June.
The Federal Statistics Office will publish a flash estimate for GDP growth in the third quarter on Friday. Analysts predict a quarterly expansion of 2.2% from July to September.
The government on Wednesday is likely to slash its forecast for economic growth this year, after leading institutes cut their joint forecast to 2.4% from 3.7% last week. For 2022, the institutes predict 4.8% growth.
""The coronavirus crisis has turned into a scarcity crisis,"" VP Bank economist Thomas Gitzel said.
In addition to the supply problems, the spike in gas and energy prices is complicating the recovery, Gitzel added.
Other analysts pointed to rising COVID-19 infections in Germany, which could lead to renewed restrictions for retailers, bars and restaurants over the winter months.
Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) economist Joerg Kraemer said companies were expecting politicians to react to the latest increase in coronavirus infections with new restrictions.

In addition, the current coronavirus wave is leading to factory closures, especially in Asia, which will exacerbate the material shortages in Germany, Kraemer added.
""The German economy is unlikely to grow much in the fourth quarter. Stagflation is on the horizon for this quarter at least,"" he said.

1132,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 22, 2021 03:29PM ET</span>","U.S. 2021 fiscal year deficit below prior year's record, Treasury says","(Reuters) -The U.S. budget deficit totaled $2.772 trillion during fiscal 2021, below the prior year's record shortfall but still reflecting a second straight year of massive spending to support households and businesses through the coronavirus pandemic, the Treasury Department said on Friday.
The United States posted a deficit of $3.132 trillion in fiscal 2020, when the federal government first started spending frantically in response to the pandemic. The $360 billion drop in the deficit - the first decrease in six years - reflected the rebound in economic activity this year as rollouts of COVID-19 vaccines and relief payments to households helped to fuel a powerful recovery from last year's recession.
""Today's joint budget statement is further evidence that America's economy is in the midst of a recovery,"" Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said in a statement issued with the acting head of the Office of Management and Budget, Shalanda Young.
The U.S. economy is on track to grow by as much as 6% this year in a rebound spurred by the emergency measures enacted under the current administration of Democratic President Joe Biden and his predecessor, Republican Donald Trump. Combined with the launch of vaccines against COVID-19 late last year and an end to lockdowns over the course of this year, the federal programs have unleashed a wave of consumer spending that is powering the fastest growth since the 1980s.
Receipts for the full fiscal year, which runs from Oct. 1 through Sept. 30, totaled $4.046 trillion, an increase of $626 billion, or 18.3%, from fiscal 2020, with higher individual and business income taxes from an improving economy fueling the rise, Treasury said.
Fiscal 2021 outlays jumped by $266 billion, or 4.1%, to $6.818 trillion, with the increase driven by continued spending from legislation enacted to support the economy through the pandemic, the department said.
In September, the final month of the government's fiscal year, the U.S. budget deficit was $62 billion, roughly half the gap of the $125 billion in September 2020, the Treasury said. That was the smallest monthly deficit recorded so far during the pandemic and the lowest since January 2020.
Receipts last month totaled $460 billion, up 23% from $373 billion a year earlier. September outlays were $521 billion, a 5% increase from $498 billion last year.

The annual deficit reflected the toll inflation is inflicting on U.S. taxpayers. 
The cost to service the U.S. debt rose by $40 billion in fiscal 2021 but only because of an increase on inflation compensation outlays on Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities, or TIPS. With annual inflation as measured by the Consumer Price Index running above 5% for several months now, the Treasury paid out $113 billion above what it did in 2020 to compensate TIPS investors.

1134,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 22, 2021 11:57AM ET</span>",Euro zone inflation expectations hit ECB target of 2%,"By Yoruk Bahceli and Abhinav Ramnarayan
LONDON (Reuters) - A key market gauge of euro zone inflation expectations rose above the ECB's inflation target of 2% for the first time in seven years on Friday, just as the central bank weighs how to proceed with stimulus when its pandemic-era support ends.
The so-called five-year, five-year forward inflation swap jumped by as much as 10 basis points to 2.0528%, the highest since 2014.
Prices have soared this year on supply bottlenecks and spiking energy prices, with euro area inflation hitting a 13-year high in September.
Peter McCallum, rates strategist at Mizuho, said the ECB, which tracks the market inflation gauge, will probably be keen to talk down the rise at its policy meeting next Thursday.
""It's not in their interests to have (the breakeven) too high just because of what that implies for where outright yields are and where financial conditions are.""
After undershooting its inflation target of ""close to, but below 2%"" for years, the ECB adopted a 2%, symmetrical inflation target in July which will allow it to tolerate temporary overshoots.
Though market pricing suggests inflation will reach target over the longer term, the ECB maintains that the current rise in inflation is transitory and projects a fall to 1.5% by 2023.
That means it wouldn't be able to raise interest rates for years to come and policymakers have started to push back against the higher rates money markets are pricing in from next year.
Friday's spike in breakeven rates, which measure the difference between nominal and inflation-linked real bond yields, was driven by a fall euro area real yields to a record low around -1.87%.
In Germany, real yields also fell to a record low and the breakeven rate rose to around 1.91%, the highest since 2013.
Analysts said inflation fears were pushing real yields down, as inflation-linked bonds are bought by investors to hedge the risk.
But low real yields can also imply that investors expect a grim economic growth outlook down the line.
""The main question here is why real yields are so low, particularly taking into account the solid... growth outlook we have to think about,"" said Florian Spaete, senior bond strategist at Generali (MI:GASI) Investments.
Though growth is expected to be high this year, economic risks are rising and purchasing manager indices on Friday showed euro zone business activity slowed this month as firms grappled with soaring costs due to supply-chain constraints.
Germany's 10-year nominal yield briefly touched the highest since May 2019 at -0.069%, but by 1506 GMT was unchanged on the day at -0.10%, with the five-year five-year forward also retreating back below 2%.
Later on Friday, S&P Global (NYSE:SPGI) will review Greece's credit rating, with analysts expecting no change to the country's BB rating, which is two notches below investment-grade.

Greece's rating is particularly significant as without an investment-grade rating or ECB policy change it would fall out of the bank's bond purchases once its pandemic stimulus ends next year.

1135,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 22, 2021 09:56AM ET</span>","U.S. business activity accelerates in October, shortages hamper factories - IHS Markit survey","By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. business activity increased solidly in October, suggesting economic growth picked up at the start of the fourth quarter as COVID-19 infections subsided, though labor and raw material shortages held back manufacturing.
Data firm IHS Markit said on Friday its flash U.S. Composite PMI Output Index, which tracks the manufacturing and services sectors, rebounded to a reading of 57.3 in the first half of this month from 55.0 in September. A reading above 50 indicates growth in the private sector.
A resurgence in coronavirus infections, driven by the Delta variant, weighed on demand for services in consumer-facing businesses like restaurants, hotels and air travel. Together with shortages across nearly all industries, the flare-up in infections curbed economic activity. 
Gross domestic product growth estimates for the third quarter are mostly below a 3% annualized rate. The economy grew at a 6.7% pace in the second quarter. The government is due to publish its snapshot of third-quarter GDP next Thursday.
The pick up in business activity this month was driven by the services sector. The IHS Markit survey's flash services sector PMI rebounded to a reading of 58.2 from 54.9 in September. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast a reading of 55.1 this month for the services sector, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity.
Services industry businesses reported that unfinished work piled up at the fastest clip since the data firm started tracking the series 12 years ago. This was despite companies boosting hiring. Businesses still complained about difficulties finding workers. 
There were 10.4 million job openings at the end of August. About 7.7 million people were officially unemployed in September. The labor market disconnect has been blamed on the recently ended expanded unemployment benefits, people dropping out to become care givers because of the pandemic as well as fears of contracting the coronavirus. COVID-19 has also led to early retirements and career changes. 
With supply constraints showing no signs of abating, services businesses reported paying higher prices for inputs, supporting views that inflation was probably not as transitory as has been argued by Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell. 
Raw material shortages restrained manufacturing activity this month. The survey's flash manufacturing PMI fell to a seven-month low of 59.2 from a reading of 60.7 in September. Economists had forecast the index for the sector, which accounts for 12% of the economy, dipping to 60.3. 
Factory production rose at its slowest pace since July 2020. Like their services industry counterparts, manufacturers reported paying more for inputs, and are passing on the higher costs to consumers, which could keep inflation hot for a while. 

The Fed's preferred inflation measure, the personal consumption expenditures price index, excluding the volatile food and energy components, increased 3.6% year-on-year in August. The U.S. central bank has a flexible 2% target.
Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG) Co announced on Tuesday that it would raise prices of some of its grooming, oral and skin care products in the United States to defray higher commodity and freight costs. Unilever (NYSE:UL) warned on Thursday its prices would have to rise further because of rising costs, including surging energy prices.

1136,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 22, 2021 07:12AM ET</span>",UK recovery perks up despite consumer gloom and inflation surge,"By William Schomberg and David Milliken
LONDON (Reuters) -Britain's economy unexpectedly regained momentum in October, despite surging costs and mixed consumer signals, according to surveys on Friday that could tempt the Bank of England to raise interest rates for the first time since the pandemic.
The preliminary ""flash"" IHS Markit/CIPS Composite Purchasing Managers' Index rose by the largest amount since May to hit 56.8, up from 54.9 in September. By contrast, a Reuters poll of economists had pointed to a further slowdown to 54.0.
Sterling rose to the day's high so far against the dollar after the data, which contrasted with earlier figures showing a record fifth straight monthly fall in retail sales in September, despite panic-buying of petrol late in the month.
However, IHS Markit's chief business economist, Chris Williamson, said the unexpected rebound in the PMI should not be viewed as a green light for the BoE to raise rates on Nov. 4.
""The service sector is clearly in something of a sweet spot,"" he said. ""Rising COVID-19 case numbers pose a downside risk to growth in the coming months, potentially deterring some services-oriented activity ... and potentially leading to the renewed enforcement of health restrictions as winter draws in.""
Market researchers GfK said households this month were the gloomiest since the last lockdown in February, due to higher prices, shortages in shops and petrol stations and a big increase in the number of coronavirus cases.
Britain reported more than 52,000 new COVID-19 cases on Thursday alone, the highest since a wave of the Delta variant in July and more than anywhere else in Europe.
SERVICES STEP UP
IHS Markit said the rise in the PMI was driven by Britain's services firms as consumers and businesses spent more due to the rollback of pandemic restrictions. Travel firms in particular benefited from a relaxation of COVID-19 testing rules.
By contrast, retailers - who are not covered in Britain's PMI - have seen sales fall non-stop since a record high in April as supply-chain difficulties worsened and spending options widened as pubs, restaurants and hotels reopened.
Service sector activity outpaced manufacturing output by the widest margin since 2009 as factories struggled again with shortages of supplies and staff and recorded barely any growth.
The PMI for the services sector rose to 58.0, its highest in three months, while the manufacturing PMI's output component sank to its lowest since February at 50.6.
Higher wages and the worsening supply shortages resulted in the fastest increase in average costs since the combined composite index was launched in January 1998. Separate PMIs for the services and manufacturing sectors showed prices charged by firms rose by the most since these individual series began more than 25 years ago.
With inflation set to hit more than double its 2% target soon, the BoE is expected to raise borrowing costs soon as it tries to make sure that rising inflation expectations do not become embedded in British businesses' pricing decisions.
The Bank of England's new chief economist, Huw Pill, said in an interview published late on Thursday that the question of raising interest rates was ""live"" for the central bank's November meeting, and that he would not be surprised to see inflation exceed 5% early next year. 
The Confederation of British Industry said on Thursday that manufacturers were raising prices by the most since 1980 in the face of some of the biggest increases in costs and labour shortages since the 1970s.
September's retail sales data showed the biggest increase in prices since December 2011, and GfK said a record proportion of the public expected inflation to accelerate over the next 12 months.

But many economists think the BoE would still do better to wait until Britain's economy has returned to its pre-pandemic size before raising rates, especially as finance minister Rishi Sunak is expected to set out tighter budget rules next week.
""The risk is that by tightening monetary policy too quickly, some of the temporary economic damage from the pandemic becomes permanent,"" said Thomas Pugh, an economist at accountants RSM UK.

1137,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 22, 2021 06:10AM ET</span>",China's land sales slump for second month as property chill bites,"By Ryan Woo and Liangping Gao
BEIJING (Reuters) - China's government land sales slumped for a second month in a fast-cooling property sector as cash-strapped developers stayed on the sidelines, adding pressure on local authorities dependent on such auctions for income. 
The value of land sales nationwide fell 11.15% to 570.3 billion yuan ($89 billion) from a year earlier, according to Reuters calculations of finance ministry data released on Friday, after sinking 17.5% in August.
The slump comes as tighter regulations on borrowing by private developers since the summer of 2020 have increasingly eroded demand for land, after it reached a record high last year.
Private developers have bought at least 120.8 billion yuan of land in an ongoing round of land auctions held by 22 major cities, down about 80% from the first round in March-June, according to a Reuters analysis of public notices on the sales.
On average, land sales account for about a fifth of local government revenues. An extended sale slump could hurt local fiscal finances and investments as China's economy further slows while fending off contagion risks from the highly-indebted developer China Evergrande Group.
""The credit environment has rapidly declined since June, and financing for developers has been particularly difficult,"" said Lu Wenxi, chief analyst at property agency Centaline. 
Even for developers that have managed to sell homes, they have to wait for months before receiving the funds from buyers, as it typically takes three or four months before mortgage loans are disbursed, Lu said. 
Revenue from government land sales rose 8.7% to 5.36 trillion yuan in the first nine months of 2021, data from the finance ministry showed on Friday, slowing from 12.7% growth in January-August.
""The 31 provinces in (mainland) China are not equally dependent on land revenue,"" said Moody's (NYSE:MCO) analyst Amanda Du.
""The eastern coastal regions have high land values and low direct debt burdens, so even if there is a certain decline in land revenue, the impact is limited, because they have other relatively strong tax revenue or other incomes to compensate.""
But other regions that already have large funding gaps and high leverage, and are more dependent on land sales at the same time, will face pressure, she said.
Land sales hit 8.4 trillion yuan in 2020, equal to Australia's annual gross domestic product, helping to stabilise local economies in a pandemic year.
STATE SUPPORT
Heightened concern over the indebtedness of developers such as Evergrande Group led Beijing in August 2020 to introduce the so-called ""three red lines"" - financial requirements that developers must meet in order to get new bank loans.
The grim financing landscape has cast a pall over the sector this year, with capital-starved real estate companies putting a pause on new projects and scaling back on purchases of land from local governments.
Their retreat has paved the way for state-controlled developers to dominate sales. 
In Hefei, a populous eastern city in Anhui province targeted by speculative buyers and real estate companies in recent years, private developers bought 14.8% less land by value in the current round of auctions versus the first. 
By contrast, state developers increased their purchases by 75.9%, according to the Reuters analysis. 
But even cash-rich state developers have not yet managed to push monthly land sales back into positive territory. 
""In the fourth quarter, land revenue will continue to decline,"" Centaline's Lu said. 
""Now, the downward channel has obviously opened, and the market is already in a downward cycle.""
Prices of new homes stalled for the first time in September, according to Reuters calculations of official data released on Thursday. 
That bodes ill for the market in October, with autumn typically a peak season for sales.

LONDON (Reuters) - Nearly one in five vehicles sold in the European Union in the third quarter was an electrified model as sales continued to soar while fossil-fuel cars slumped, according to sales data released on Friday by a trade organization. 
The European Automobile Manufacturers' Association, or ACEA, which represents major European car, truck, van and bus makers, said that battery electric and plug-in hybrid model sales across the European Union made up just under 19% of all sales.
Battery electric vehicle sales jumped nearly 57% to more than 212,000 units, while plug-in hybrid models rose nearly 43% to more than 197,000 units. 
This is a slower pace of growth than in 2020 when sales almost trebled from a low base.
But it compares with a 35% drop in sales for petrol cars - which still are the biggest sellers and account for nearly 40% of overall sales - and a more than 50% drop for diesel cars during the quarter. 
Less than a decade ago, diesel cars made up more than 50% of sale in the EU, but accounted for under 18% of all cars sold in the third quarter.

As well as having to meet stringent new EU carbon emissions targets, car makers and consumers have benefited from government subsidies for electric vehicles. 
The European Commission has also proposed an effective ban on fossil-fuel vehicles from 2035, aiming to speed up the switch to zero-emission electric vehicles as part of a broad package of measures to combat global warming.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's core consumer prices rose in September for the first time since the early stages of the coronavirus pandemic in March 2020, a sign that rising energy and raw material costs are gradually pushing up inflation.
Analysts expect rising fuel costs to accelerate consumer inflation in coming months, though any increase will be modest compared with other advanced economies as sluggish wage growth weighs on consumption and keeps firms from hiking prices much.
""Looking through artificial distortions and one-off hits, we expect underlying inflation to peak just shy of +1.0% early next year before falling back,"" said Tom Learmouth, an economist at Capital Economics.
The core consumer price index (CPI), which excludes volatile fresh food prices but includes fuel costs, rose 0.1% in September from a year earlier, government data showed on Friday, matching a median market forecast. It was unchanged in August.
The gain was driven mostly by a 7.4% spike in energy costs, which was the biggest annual rise in nearly three years. Gasoline costs surged 16.5% in September from a year earlier.
Processed food and durable goods also saw prices perk up, though the increase was more than offset by a 44.8% plunge in telecommunication fees as cellphone carriers slashed charges.
Analysts expect core consumer inflation to head toward 1% in coming months as recent rises in crude oil costs are seen pushing up electricity bills with a lag of three to five months.
But many of them doubt such cost-push inflation will lead to broader, sustainable price growth.
""The reopening of Japan's economy could lift service spending and foster price rises,"" said Takeshi Minami, chief economist at Norinchukin Research Institute.
""But Japanese households tend to shift to cheaper goods when the price hike continues, which in turn may induce a price-cut battle among companies,"" he said.
The data will be among factors the Bank of Japan will consider at next week's policy meeting, when it releases fresh quarterly growth and inflation projections.

Japan has not been immune to global commodity inflation, with wholesale prices surging at a 13-year high of 6.3% in September, putting pressure on corporate profit margins and raising the risk of unwanted consumer price hikes.
But consumer inflation has been stuck around zero as firms remain reluctant to pass on costs to households, reinforcing expectations the BOJ's 2% target will remain elusive.

LONDON (Reuters) -Growth in euro zone business activity slowed this month as firms faced soaring costs due to supply-chain constraints, while the bloc's dominant service industry struggled amid ongoing COVID-19 concerns, a survey showed on Friday.
IHS Markit's Flash Composite Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI), a good gauge of overall economic health, fell to a six-month low of 54.3 in October from 56.2 in September.
That matched the lowest forecast in a Reuters poll which had predicted a more modest drop to 55.2 but was still comfortably above the 50-mark which separates growth from contraction.
""The October PMIs are consistent with our view that economic growth in the euro zone will slow markedly in the fourth quarter, and that inflation will rise further in the coming months,"" said Jack Allen-Reynolds at Capital Economics.
Supply chain bottlenecks caused by the coronavirus pandemic, alongside a shortage of heavy goods vehicle drivers, meant the input prices index jumped to 73.1 from 70.9, by far the highest since the survey began in mid-1998.
Growth in activity slowed in Germany, Europe's largest economy, while in France an expansion in the dominant services sector was offset by weakness among manufacturers, as supply chain issues impacted business.
In Britain, outside the euro zone, the economy unexpectedly regained momentum, although cost pressures rising there by the most in more than 25 years could encourage the Bank of England to raise interest rates for the first time since the pandemic. [GB/PMIS]
The BoE is expected to become the first major central bank to raise interest rates in the post-pandemic cycle, a recent Reuters poll found, but economists thought the first hike would not come until early next year, later than markets are pricing in. [ECILT/GB]
PRICE PRESSURES
A PMI for the euro zone services industry fell to 54.7 from 56.4, its lowest since April, and below a 55.5 Reuters poll forecast.
But firms took on staff at the fastest rate since in over 14 years. The employment index rose to 56.0 from 54.1.
Manufacturing activity remained robust and the factory PMI only inched down from September's 58.6 to 58.5 although an index measuring output, which feeds into the composite PMI, dropped to 53.2 from 55.6, its lowest since June 2020.
Prices for the raw materials factories need increased at a record pace, and while manufacturers passed some of those costs to customers, they were unable to transfer the whole burden. The output prices index climbed to 72.3 from 70.4, its highest since IHS Markit began collecting the data in late 2002.

That suggests the recent surge in inflation won't be dissipating anytime soon, raising question marks over the European Central Bank's view the upswing would be transitory.
""The combination of slowing growth momentum and building inflationary pressure could exacerbate divisions within the ECB's Governing Council ahead of next week's policy meeting, although the December meeting remains the one to watch,"" said Hussain Mehdi at HSBC Asset Management.

LONDON (Reuters) -British retail sales unexpectedly fell for a fifth month in a row last month, despite a rush of motorists filling their cars with fuel, adding to signs that Britain's economic recovery is losing momentum.
Sales volumes dropped by 0.2% in September, official figures showed on Friday, as supply-chain problems led to gaps on store shelves. It marked the longest run of consecutive monthly falls since the series began in 1996 and bucked economists' expectations in a Reuters poll for a rise of 0.5%.
This softness adds to the conundrum faced by the Bank of England over whether to counter rapidly rising inflation by raising interest rates next month, or instead to wait for the economy to recover more of the ground it lost to the pandemic.
""Overall, the data support our view that the economic recovery stalled in September,"" said Bethany Beckett, UK economist at Capital Economics.
Retail sales rebounded strongly in the first part of the year as lockdown restrictions eased first for shops. But they have fallen steadily since a peak in April, partly as people spent more on holidays and eating out after social-distancing restrictions were relaxed more generally.
In the three months to September sales fell 3.9%, which the Office for National Statistics said would reduce broader economic growth in the third quarter by 0.2 percentage points.
Compared with before the pandemic, sales volumes are 4.2% higher, but they are 1.3% below where they were a year ago.
EMPTY SHELVES
Supply-chain bottlenecks led to gaps on some supermarket shelves, and many petrol stations ran out of fuel in late September and early October as shortages of tanker drivers led to queues of cars trying to fill up.
""Labour shortages across the supply chains, on farms, factories, warehouses and lorry drivers, all threaten to derail this recovery,"" the British Retail Consortium's chief executive, Helen Dickinson, warned after the data.
Petrol sales in September exceeded pre-pandemic levels for the first time, but there was a sharp drop in sales of household goods such as furniture and lighting, the ONS said.
Consumer price inflation is also accelerating sharply, due largely to higher energy prices, and the BoE predicts it will exceed 4% around the end of this year, double its target level.
A narrower measure of inflation used in the retail sales data rose to 3.7% in September, its highest since December 2011.
The prospect of higher prices -- as well as a more recent upsurge in COVID-19 cases -- has dampened consumers' mood. GfK reported earlier on Friday that its long-running sentiment survey showed the lowest morale since February, when Britain was still in lockdown.
Retailers also face a dilemma over how much they should pass on cost rises to consumers. Discount chain Poundland and online fashion retailer Boohoo both warned of lower profit margins in recent weeks.
The BRC said three out of five retailers expected prices to rise before Christmas.

Another online fashion retailer, ASOS (LON:ASOS), parted ways with its chief executive last week amid fears that supply chain pressures and consumers returning to pre-pandemic behaviour would reduce profits by 40% next year.
Friday's ONS data showed online spending remained strong overall at 28% of total retail sales in September, up from 20% before the pandemic. But it is far below its peak of 37% in January when high-street shops were closed during lockdown.

LONDON (Reuters) -A record proportion of the British public thinks inflation will accelerate over the next 12 months, according to data that could further boost expectations that the Bank of England will raise interest rates next month.
Some 48% of people surveyed this month by consumer research firm GfK expected prices to increase more rapidly over the next 12 months, up from 34% in September, the figures seen exclusively by Reuters showed.
It marked the highest share since records began in January 1985, when Margaret Thatcher was prime minister and more than a decade before the BoE became operationally independent.
The surge in inflation expectations follows a month of rocketing gas prices that have caused the collapse of several British energy suppliers, leaving households faced with the prospect of hefty bills in 2022.
Global supply chain problems as the world economy reopens from COVID-19 lockdowns and labour shortages, exacerbated by Brexit, have added to Britain's recent inflationary tilt.
The BoE's new chief economist, Huw Pill, said inflation in Britain could surpass a ""very uncomfortable"" 5% and the question of whether to raise interest rates was a ""live"" one at its Nov. 4 meeting, the Financial Times reported.
Private sector economists increasingly expect the BoE will become the first major central bank to raise borrowing costs. [ECILT/GB]
""More and more shoppers expect that costs for goods and services will jump dramatically in the next 12 months,"" said Joe Staton, client strategy director at GfK.
""This rapid increase will impact our ability to shop and save, and our willingness to spend at a time when our incomes are outpaced by inflation.""
The public are generally poor predictors of inflation but central banks watch their expectations for signs that consumers are losing confidence in authorities' ability to keep price rises in check.
A similar surge in public inflation expectations in the euro zone in 2011 helped to persuade the European Central Bank to raise interest rates twice that year - although it quickly reversed course.
Economists say those rate hikes were a mistake and some think the BoE is at risk of doing the same amid signs of a slowing economic recovery. Retail sales fell unexpectedly in September for a fifth month running, data showed on Friday.
On Sunday BoE Governor Andrew Bailey said the BoE would have to act if it saw a surge in inflation expectations in the medium term. Last month the BoE defined medium-term inflation expectations as five to 10 years from now.
While the GfK's gauge of inflation expectations covers the only the next 12 months, the scale of the move is likely to catch the eye of members of the BoE's Monetary Policy Committee.
The data are collected as part of GfK's monthly Consumer Confidence Index, which dates back to the early 1970s. The overall confidence index fell in October to an eight-month low.
""Consumers are already nervous about the state of their personal finances. The spectre of rising costs can only add to that growing concern,"" Staton said.

Before Brexit, GfK's price expectation figures were freely available as part of the European Commission's monthly consumer surveys of EU countries, but have not been publicly available since the start of the year.
The survey of 2,000 Britons was conducted Oct. 1-13.

Manufacturers struggled with supply chain disruptions and surging raw material demand that fuelled the sharpest rise in input prices in more than 13 years, as the health crisis continues to impact the global economy.
The au Jibun Bank Flash Japan Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) rose to a seasonally adjusted 53.0 in October from a final 51.5 in the previous month.
Key survey components showed output and new orders expanded thanks in part due to stronger overseas demand.
""Private sector businesses... noted an increase in aggregate new business for the first time since April, assisted by a quicker rise in export orders,"" said Usamah Bhatti, economist at IHS Markit, which compiled the survey.
""That said, firms continued to highlight sustained supply chain pressures and material shortages.""
The au Jibun Bank Flash Services PMI Index rose to a seasonally adjusted 50.7 from the prior month's final of 47.8.
That meant services sector activity stayed above the 50.0 threshold that separates contraction from expansion for the first time since January 2020, before the economy went through its deep COVID-19 slump.

""Panel members commonly associated the slight recovery to a reduction in COVID-19 cases and looser pandemic restrictions,"" said Bhatti.
The au Jibun Bank Flash Japan Composite PMI, which is estimated by using both manufacturing and services, rose to 50.7 from September's final of 47.9, marking its highest since April.

1144,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 21, 2021 07:17PM ET</span>","Beset by bad news, UK consumers gloomiest since lockdown","LONDON (Reuters) - People in Britain are their most downbeat since they were under lockdown in February, and are increasingly worried about the year to come as prices and COVID cases rise, according to a long-running survey published on Friday.
The GfK Consumer Confidence Index fell for a third month in a row to -17 in October, its lowest since February, from -13 in September. A Reuters poll of economists had pointed to a reading of -16.
Fuel and food shortages, a jump in inflation, the prospect of higher interest rates and climbing COVID-19 cases were all making consumers gloomier, Joe Staton, GfK's client strategy director, said.
""Against a backdrop of cheerless domestic news ... it is not surprising that consumers are feeling down-in-the mouth about the chilly winter months ahead,"" he said.
Shoppers were also less keen to make big purchases in the run-up to Christmas, he added.
The loss of confidence among Britain's consumers complicates the job for the Bank of England as it weighs up when to raise interest rates for the first time since the start of the pandemic.

Inflation is on course to surpass 4%, more than double the BoE's target, but the pace of the economy's recovery from its pandemic shock has slowed and the number of COVID-19 cases is the highest in Europe.
The central bank is due to announce its next policy decision on Nov. 4.

1145,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 21, 2021 01:22PM ET</span>",U.S. weekly jobless claims hit 19-month low as labor market tightens,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits dropped to a 19-month low last week, pointing to a tightening labor market, though a shortage of workers could keep the pace of hiring moderate in October.
The weekly unemployment claims report from the Labor Department on Thursday, the most timely data on the economy's health, also showed unemployment rolls shrinking significantly early this month. There is cautious optimism that the expiration of federal government-funded benefits on Sept. 6 will broaden the pool of labor in the coming months.
""Hiring demands remain robust, and the short supply of potential workers should make employers think twice about cutting payrolls,"" said Jim Baird, chief investment officer at Plante Moran Financial Advisors in Kalamazoo, Michigan.
Initial claims for state unemployment benefits fell 6,000 to a seasonally adjusted 290,000 for the week ended Oct. 16, the lowest level since the middle of March in 2020, when the nation was in the early stage of the COVID-19 pandemic. 
It was also the second straight week that claims remained below 300,000 as employers hold on to workers in the face of an acute labor shortage. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast 300,000 claims for the latest week.
Unadjusted claims, which economists say offer a better read of the labor market, tumbled 24,293 to 256,304 last week. A jump of 17,570 in filings in California was offset by notable declines in Virginia, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Texas, New York, Kentucky and the District of Columbia. 
Claims have declined from a record high of 6.149 million in early April 2020. A 250,000-300,000 range for claims is seen as consistent with a healthy labor market. The number of people continuing to receive benefits after an initial week of aid dropped 122,000 to 2.481 million in the week ended Oct. 9. That was also the lowest level since the middle of March in 2020.
Stocks on Wall Street were mixed. The dollar was steady against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices fell.
The pandemic has upended labor market dynamics, leading to a staggering 10.4 million job openings as of the end of August even as about 7.7 million people were officially unemployed in September. A range of factors has been blamed for the disconnect, including lack of childcare, expanded unemployment benefits, early retirements and career changes.
Though schools have reopened for in-person learning and the expanded unemployment benefits ended, there was no boost to the labor force last month. About 183,000 people dropped out, leading to a decline in the labor force participation rate, or the proportion of working-age Americans who have a job or are looking for one.
WIDESPREAD SHORTAGES
But with the number of people receiving unemployment checks under state and federal government programs falling by about 9 million since early last month, economists are betting they will start trekking back to the labor market. The total number of people collecting unemployment checks under all programs dropped 369,992 to 3.279 million during the week ended Oct. 2. 
""Presumably many of these workers will be looking for work soon, if they haven't already started to, this will help alleviate some of the current labor shortages in the economy,"" said Gus Faucher, chief economist at PNC Financial (NYSE:PNC) in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.
The claims data covered the period during which the government surveyed employers for the nonfarm payrolls component of October's employment report. Filings dropped significantly between the September and October survey weeks, implying a pickup in employment growth this month. 
Claims data, however, has not been a reliable indicator of employment growth over the past year because of the upheaval caused by the pandemic. Nonfarm payrolls increased by just 194,000 jobs in September, the fewest in nine months. 
Labor shortages are occurring across all industries, and are causing congestion at ports and hurting production at factories as well as leaving shelves empty and fanning inflation.
The paucity of workers was echoed on Wednesday by the Federal Reserve's ""Beige Book"" report of anecdotal information on business activity collected from contacts nationwide, which showed ""employment increased at a modest to moderate rate in recent weeks, as demand for workers was high, but labor growth was dampened by a low supply of workers.""
Shortages of workers and raw materials have led economists to anticipate that gross domestic growth slowed to as low as a 0.5% annualized rate in the third quarter after accelerating at a 6.7% pace in the April-June quarter.
Slowing activity because of the inputs crunch was underscored by a separate survey from the Philadelphia Fed on Thursday that showed manufacturing in the mid-Atlantic regions grew at a moderate pace in October. 
Factories in the region that covers eastern Pennsylvania, southern New Jersey and Delaware, reported strong orders growth as well as a building up of unfinished work. They were upbeat about business conditions over the next six months and anticipated higher capital expenditures in 2022.
The soft growth patch was also highlighted by a third report from the Conference Board showing its index of Leading Economic Indicators rose 0.2% in September, the smallest gain in seven months, after increasing 0.8% in August. 
""Anecdotal evidence suggests that bottlenecks are not easing, and survey evidence indicates that many businesses anticipate disruptions to last throughout 2022,"" said Evan Karson, an economist at Moody's (NYSE:MCO) Analytics in West Chester, Pennsylvania.

There was, however, some good news from the housing market. A fourth report from the National Association of Realtors showed existing home sales jumped to an eight-month high in September. But the share of first-time buyers was the smallest in six years as tight inventory kept home prices elevated.
""Lack of homes for sale, compared with strong demand for owner-occupied residences, will continue to push house prices higher,"" said David Berson, chief economist at Nationwide in Columbus, Ohio. ""It will be difficult for existing home sales to rise significantly in coming months."" 
 
"
1146,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 21, 2021 10:06AM ET</span>",U.S. existing home sales surge to 8-month high in September,"WASHINGTON(Reuters) - U.S. home sales surged to an eight-month high September, but higher prices as supply remains tight are squeezing out first-time buyers from the housing market.
Existing home sales increased by 7.0% - the largest increase in a year - to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 6.29 million units last month, the highest level since January, the National Association of Realtors said on Thursday. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast sales rising to a rate of 6.09 million units. Sales rose in all four regions. 
Home resales, which account for the bulk of U.S. home sales, dropped 2.3% on a year-on-year basis. 
Demand for housing surged early in the coronavirus pandemic amid an exodus from cities to suburbs and other low-density locations as Americans sought more spacious accommodations for home offices and online schooling. The buying frenzy has abated as workers return to offices and schools reopened for in-person learning, thanks to COVID-19 vaccinations. 
Though house price growth appears to be slowing amid an ebb in bidding wars, it remains strong. The median existing house price increased 13.3% from a year ago to $352,800 in September. That was the smallest gain this year. The moderation in house price inflation was because more smaller homes were sold last month. First-time buyers accounted for 28% of sales, the smallest share since July 2015, and down from 31% a year ago.
The Federal Reserve's Beige Book report of anecdotal information on business activity collected from contacts nationwide on or before October 8 that was published on Wednesday said ""residential real estate activity was unchanged or slowed slightly but the market remained healthy, overall.""

There were 1.27 million previously owned homes on the market last month, down 0.8% from August and 13% from a year ago. There is a huge backlog of houses that are yet to be built because of shortages of inputs and labor. That could boost housing inventory when the supply constraints ease.
At September's sales pace, it would take 2.4 months to exhaust the current inventory, down from 2.7 months a year ago. A six-to-seven-month supply is viewed as a healthy balance between supply and demand.

1147,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 21, 2021 08:02AM ET</span>",Soaring prices dampen consumer mood in India's festival season,"By Manoj Kumar and Sunil Kataria
NEW DELHI (Reuters) - For Delhi resident Suman Milind, rising prices in India are casting a long shadow this year over the upcoming Diwali festival of lights.
The 33-year-old homemaker is tightening her purse strings and altering her spending habits, thanks to soaring costs of fuel, transport and many manufactured items, coupled with stagnant incomes due to the pandemic.
""Earlier we used to get four or five boxes of dry fruits during festivals, but now we hardly get one or two. Because of the high prices,"" said Milind, adding that her family has reduced spending on food too by cutting back on meat to just once a week compared to several times a week earlier.
Millions of Indian households are facing similar strains on their budgets ahead of Diwali, which this year falls in early November and marks the country's busiest shopping season for consumer goods.
Many are foregoing big-ticket purchases such as television sets and jewellery this festive season, according to half a dozen people Reuters spoke to and a consumer survey by Mumbai-based consultancy Axis My India, threatening to slow an economy recovering strongly from the worst of COVID-19. 
Pump prices of petrol and diesel are up nearly 35% from a year ago and cooking gas by more than 50%, severely hitting more than three-quarters of households, economists said. 
""The sky-rocketing prices of petrol, cooking gas are unbearable when our earnings are still down by nearly 30% from the pre-pandemic period,"" said Sultan Singh Tomar, 53, who supplies incense sticks and kitchenware to shops in New Delhi on his scooter.
He said his petrol bill was up by 600 rupees ($8) from a year ago and refilling the cooking gas cylinder was costlier by 400 rupees.
Tomar is among millions of people working in the informal sector who dipped into savings during the pandemic and are now forced to pare back household spending.
For months India's consumer-price-based inflation stayed above the central-bank's comfort level of 6% driven by a rise in food prices. 
In September the consumer price index eased to 4.35%, helped by a softening of food prices which make up nearly half of the index. Economists said that painted a better picture than what households are actually facing.
According to an October report by Axis My India on consumer spending trends, more than 88% of respondents in a survey said they will not be buying air conditioners, televisions, washing machines or jewellery this festival season and nearly half said they will make low-ticket purchases such as clothes.
There is not much that Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government can do to alleviate the pain as global crude oil prices hit a three-year high at $85 a barrel, piling up the pressure on a country that imports 80% of its oil.
Bidisha Ganguly, chief economist at industry chamber, Confederation of Indian Industries, said federal and state governments should cut fuel taxes, the highest among the major economies, as higher fuel prices posed a risk of building up of medium term inflationary pressures.
""(Otherwise) corporate earnings will be impacted in sectors where producers are unable to pass on the cost increases,"" she said, adding global shortages were already driving up commodity costs for many products. 
REDUCED FOOTFALLS
Private economists have warned that annual wholesale-price-based inflation - a proxy for producers' prices - staying in double digits for sixth months in a row could further fuel inflationary pressures as companies pass on rising costs to consumers.
Already some retailers said rising raw material costs were impacting their sales.
""Our sales are not even half of what we used to have during the festival period,"" said Kawaljit Singh, who sells utensils from a shop in Chandani Chowk in the old quarter of Delhi.
He said a rise in prices of metals like steel and copper had pushed up prices of utensils, cookers, festival lighting and gift items by 15%-20% in the last four-five months. 
Because of rising prices and other market uncertainties, Delhi-based company auditor Lalit Vats said his family had downgraded to non-branded products and visited the wholesale markets to hunt for bargains.

""Government can talk about easing of inflation, but people know that costs of every item has gone up,"" lamented his mother Anita Vats.

1148,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 21, 2021 07:48AM ET</span>",UK manufacturers raise prices by most since 1980 - CBI,"By David Milliken
LONDON (Reuters) -British manufacturers raised prices by the most since 1980 over the past three months as they sought to pass on rapidly rising costs for raw materials and manage acute labour shortages, a long-running survey showed on Thursday.
The figures from the Confederation of British Industry are likely to fuel concerns at the Bank of England that short-term inflation pressures risk getting entrenched and could force it to start raising interest rates as soon as next month.
Supply-chain bottlenecks have hit economies worldwide as they begin to emerge from the COVID-19 pandemic, but Britain has been harder hit due to new post-Brexit barriers to trade and immigration that took effect at the start of this year.
""From higher material costs to labour shortages, manufacturers continue to face a number of serious global supply challenges hampering their ability to meet strong demand,"" CBI deputy chief economist Anna Leach said.
Thursday's quarterly CBI survey showed manufacturers raised prices at the fastest rate since April 1980 in the three months to October. Expectations for price growth in the coming quarter also rose to their highest in more than 40 years.
Costs faced by manufacturers rose at the fastest pace since 1980 in the three months to July and slowed only slightly in the latest quarter. The survey's gauge of cost expectations for the quarter ahead rose to its highest since 1977.
Supply-chain bottlenecks mean manufacturers are reporting the lowest-ever level of stocks, and the proportion reporting that a shortage of skilled labour is holding back activity is its highest since 1974.
Last month the BoE warned inflation was likely to rise above 4% at the end of this year and stick there until the second quarter of 2022, largely due to a surge in natural gas prices that has hit manufacturers and consumers alike.
Energy prices have risen further since, and investors are betting the BoE will become the first major central bank to raise interest rates on Nov. 3 after its next meeting.
The picture for demand is more mixed. The CBI data showed the rate of growth in orders slowed in October to its lowest since April as well as a big fall in optimism.

Rising COVID-19 cases, the end of the government furlough programme and a higher cost of living mean many economists think consumer demand is set to weaken - and also that the BoE will defer a rate rise until early next year. 
But the quarterly figures from the CBI still show better-than-average optimism among manufacturers, alongside expectations that demand will pick up and that output will continue to grow at an above-average pace.

In its regular six-month report on the region, the lender estimated that the economies of Albania, Bosnia, Kosovo, Montenegro, North Macedonia and Serbia could grow 4.1% in 2022 and 3.8% in 2023.
""A faster-than-expected recovery is really driven by two main factors: domestic re-opening triggered by various robust recovery in domestic consumption and tourism-related demand and then very strong external conditions,"" said Richard Record, the lead country economist for the Western Balkans.
Record said that risks for maintaining the growth aligned with the same factors if they were reversed, meaning that consumption, remittances and tourism would be affected in the case of new pandemic-related lockdowns or international restrictions on movement. 
In addition, the Western Balkan countries lag European neighbours when it comes to COVID-19 vaccination, with rates below 40% in most countries, except for Serbia and Kosovo.
Record said that the depleted fiscal space and high debt levels will continue to weigh on the region, and that political uncertainty will delay a recovery in both domestic and foreign investment that the region needs to boost potential output.
The bank also said that the labour market was recovering at a slower pace than the economy, and that structural reforms were needed to address job creation and economic transformation, including green transition.

Record said the report focused closely on macro-fiscal challenges and drivers of greening the region's growth, which called necessary but not easy to manage.
""The reality is that business as usual is no longer an option, because we are seeing changing of external preferences,"" Record told Reuters.

1151,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 21, 2021 03:27AM ET</span>",UK borrowing down by half as Sunak readies budget,"By David Milliken and William Schomberg
LONDON (Reuters) -British public borrowing fell by almost half in the first six months of the current financial year from a post-World War Two high a year earlier, when the economy faced the full force of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Thursday's official data will be welcome news for finance minister Rishi Sunak, who is due to present fresh budget forecasts on Oct. 27. 
These are expected to show borrowing in the 2021/22 financial year is on track to come in around 40 billion pounds ($55 billion) below the last forecasts made in March, thanks to faster economic growth.
But Sunak is expected to squeeze spending for many government departments after last year's historic pandemic spending surge. 
""At the budget and spending review next week I will set out how we will continue to support public services, businesses and jobs while keeping our public finances fit for the future,"" Sunak said after Thursday's data.
Britain's budget deficit soared last financial year to its highest since World War Two at 15% of GDP, but is expected to drop to just over half that this year due to the end of emergency economic support and stronger tax revenues.
Some economists say Sunak's focus on keeping a lid on spending is a risk for the economy which, after a rapid recovery in the first half of this year, has slowed markedly in recent months. COVID-19 cases are also rebounding sharply. 
""The rumours are that the Chancellor will still keep a very tight grip on the public finances in next Wednesday's budget to try and bring down borrowing even quicker and build a fiscal war chest to deploy ahead of the 2024 election,"" said Paul Dales, chief UK economist at Capital Economics.
BORROWING TRIPLE PRE-CRISIS LEVEL
Public sector borrowing for the first six months of the 2021/22 year dropped to 108.1 billion pounds, down by 101.2 billion pounds from April-September 2020, but is still more than triple its level before the pandemic, the Office for National Statistics said.
Public borrowing for September alone fell to 21.778 billion pounds ($30.1 billion), slightly below the 22.6 billion pounds forecast by economists in a Reuters poll. 
August's reading was revised down by almost 4 billion pounds to 16.824 billion pounds, reflecting stronger corporation tax revenue and lower spending on public services and the job furlough support programme than initially estimated.
Compared with a year earlier, tax revenue in the past six months has risen by 20% while day-to-day spending is 6% lower.
Last month Sunak announced a 12 billion-pound tax rise on workers and employers, starting next year, to fund health and social care. Next week's budget will include further longer-term plans to bring the budget closer to balance.
Thursday's data showed public sector net debt totalled 2.219 trillion pounds, equivalent to 95.5% of gross domestic product and just below a peak of 96.7% in May and June, which was the highest since 1963.
While rock-bottom interest rates have kept debt servicing costs near record lows so far, Britain's large stock of index-linked bonds mean interest bills are now rocketing as inflation rises. Interest payments have risen by just over 50% compared with a year earlier, the ONS said. 

The Bank of England has signalled it is moving towards its first interest rate hike since the pandemic.

OTTAWA (Reuters) - Canada's annual inflation rate accelerated to an 18-year-high in September, driven by high gas prices, soaring housing costs and rising food prices, data showed on Wednesday, putting the focus on the Bank of Canada ahead of a rate decision next week.
Inflation increased to 4.4%, beating the average analyst estimate of 4.3%, to reach its fastest clip since February 2003, Statistics Canada data showed. It was the sixth consecutive month in which headline inflation topped the central bank's 1-3% control range.
""It suggests there is still momentum at the margin in terms of inflationary pressures that can't be just dismissed on base effects and other factors. So it's still a sustained overshoot,"" said Derek Holt, vice president of capital markets economics at Scotiabank.
Governor Tiff Macklem has said the Bank of Canada sees hot inflation as temporary, though last week he predicted supply chain bottlenecks meant it would probably take a bit longer than previously expected to come down. 
The last time annual inflation reached 4.4% was in February 2003, when it hit 4.7%. The Bank of Canada had hiked rates three times through 2002 to 2.75% and would raise the key rate to 3.0% in March 2003 and 3.25% in April.

CPI common, which the Bank of Canada calls the best gauge of the economy's underperformance, was flat at 1.8%, while the other two measures of core inflation posted gains. 
The Canadian dollar was trading 0.3% higher at 1.2319 to the greenback, or 81.18 U.S. cents, a near three-month high.

Countries around the world are grappling with hot inflation amid supply chain hurdles and labor shortages as restrictions are eased and tightened with each new wave of the coronavirus, leading to choppy demand and supply bottlenecks.
Bundesbank President Jens Weidmann said on Wednesday he would step down more than five years early, issuing a last warning about the risks posed by inflation.

1156,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 20, 2021 09:16AM ET</span>",U.S. mortgage rates surge to 6-month high -MBA,"(Reuters) - Interest rates on the most popular type of U.S. home loan shot to a six-month high last week as global rates continued their march higher against a bout of stiff inflation and expectations that central banks will back further away from their pandemic-era easy-money policies.
The contract rate on a 30-year fixed rate mortgage climbed to 3.23% in the week ended Oct. 15 from 3.18% the week before, the Mortgage Bankers Association reported on Wednesday in its weekly survey of conditions in the U.S. home lending market. That was the highest level since early April and is up by more than a quarter percentage point since the end of July.
The increase in rates helped drive overall mortgage-application volumes down by 6.3% to the lowest since July, led by a 7.1% drop in refinancing applications, the MBA said. Refinancing application volumes are also at their lowest since July, just fractionally above their lowest levels since early 2020.
Applications for loans to buy a home fell 4.9% to the lowest since early September.

""Purchase activity declined and was 12% lower than a year ago,"" said Joel Kan, MBA's Associate Vice President of Economic and Industry Forecasting. ""Insufficient housing supply and elevated home-price growth continue to limit options for would-be buyers.""
How quickly that situation is resolved remains the big unknown in the U.S. residential real estate market. On Tuesday, the Commerce Department reported that U.S. homebuilding unexpectedly fell in September and residential construction permits dropped to a one-year low amid acute shortages of raw materials and labor.
Meanwhile, global interest rates continue to grind upward as central banks like the U.S. Federal Reserve signal the days of crisis-era accommodation are nearing their end in the face of inflation rates running at their highest in decades due to supply bottlenecks and labor shortages. 

The Fed is broadly expected at its next meeting in two weeks to announce plans to start scaling back its purchases of $120 billion a month of U.S. Treasuries and mortgage-backed securities as a first step toward a normalization of policy.
The yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury note, the most influential benchmark security in determining mortgage interest rates, hit its highest since May on Wednesday and has climbed nearly half a percentage point since late July.

COMMENTARY
JIMMY JEAN, CHIEF ECONOMIST, DESJARDINS GROUP
""It's very likely to be close to the peak on CPI, given the pattern of base year effects that we're looking at. We think we're going to start to see moderation. It's gonna be slow, but we think we're gonna see a little bit of relief. At the same time the continued strong prints on inflation are seeping into expectations and we saw that pretty clearly in the Bank of Canada's business outlook survey this week - both businesses and consumers. So, this is something that still has... the Bank of Canada on alert. It's not like it's going to hike in a hurry, but they're watching that very closely to make sure that it doesn't get out of control.""
""There's the potential for them (the central bank) to adjust or tweak their forecasts higher on inflation and maybe signal something like we'd be looking at maybe more mid-2022 for the first hike, as opposed to sometime in the second half of the year. There are some ingredients. The labor market has also proved the COVID situation is better handled, so maybe (there is) less of a downside risk from that. I think (the Bank of Canada) might take that step. Do they do that now, or do they want to give themselves another couple months and maybe change their guidance in January? It's so up in the air. So I'd say it's a close call, but it's a live possibility."" 
DEREK HOLT, VICE PRESIDENT OF CAPITAL MARKETS ECONOMICS, SCOTIABANK
""It suggests there is still momentum at the margin in terms of inflationary pressures that can't be just dismissed on base effects and other factors. So it's still a sustained overshoot, in terms of the freshest evidence.""
""The average core reading, pushing up again to 2.7(%) on the month, getting uncomfortably into the upper end of the Bank of Canada's target range, overall reinforces expectations of a shift to reinvestment at the next meeting and set up rate hikes in the second half of next year.""
ANDREW KELVIN, CHIEF CANADA STRATEGIST, TD SECURITIES
""We do see these inflationary pressures continue to work through the economy. We did see the core measures tick up as well on average, which does speak to growing underlying pressures. But, the Bank of Canada has been pretty adamant that they think this current inflationary surge is transitory. I don't think this will change their mind.""

""If you look at the governor's comments recently, they do still believe that there is good reason to believe that this is all related to a complicated reopening process. They have signaled that they expect inflation to be elevated into the middle of next year and they are evidently comfortable with that.""
""It's a question of at what threshold would they start to become uncomfortable and that's not an obvious thing to figure out from the fundamentals if you think that the surge is transitory.""

1158,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 20, 2021 07:31AM ET</span>",UK inflation dip unlikely to deter Bank of England from rate hike,"By Andy Bruce
LONDON (Reuters) - British inflation slowed unexpectedly last month but the decline was probably only a temporary respite for consumers and is unlikely to deter the Bank of England from raising interest rates, possibly as soon as next month.
Consumer prices rose by 3.1% in annual terms in September, easing back from August's 3.2% increase, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said.
A Reuters poll of economists had pointed to inflation of 3.2% in September although 11 of the 34 analysts who took part predicted a slowdown.
Overall, the figures did little to change expectations that the BoE will become the first of the world's major central banks to raise rates, with investors increasingly betting it will do so on Nov. 4 after its next policy meeting.
Yael  Selfin, KPMG UK's chief economist, said despite the slight slowdown in inflation it had topped 3% for two months in a row, hurting the spending power of households some of whom could also face higher mortgage costs if BoE hikes rates.
""We expect further increases in inflation from October, which could reach around 4% by the end of the year, with the recent rise in wholesale energy prices passed on to households,"" Selfin said.

Hospitality was the largest drag on inflation last month - the result of the ""Eat Out to Help Out"" restaurant meal subsidy scheme launched in August 2020 dropping out of the annual comparisons. Prices for diners rose sharply in September last year after the scheme expired.
But prices for consumer goods continued to rise, while food prices fell more slowly than in September last year.
Last month the BoE said it expected inflation to rise slightly above 4% in the last quarter of 2021 but since then energy prices have continued to rise sharply. 
On Sunday, BoE Governor Andrew Bailey sent a latest signal that the British central bank was gearing up to raise rates for the first time since the onset of the coronavirus crisis as the risks from inflation mounted.
The ONS data suggested more inflation pressure on the way.
Prices of goods produced by factories rose again, led by a jump for metals and machinery as well as surging energy prices.
""Road freight costs for UK businesses also continued to rise across the summer,"" ONS statistician Mike Hardie said. 
ACT IN HASTE...
Some economists think the BoE risks making a mistake if it raises rates now because many of the inflation pressures in the British economy are global in nature and beyond its influence.
""Domestically generated inflation remains relatively weak in these data,"" said economist Benjamin Nabarro from Citi.
He said the strain on prices was likely to ease in the second half of 2022.
The increase in inflation in the year to September was driven by a relatively small number of items, with motor fuels and second-hand cars accounting for about a quarter of the annual inflation rate.

""The big questions for policymakers now are just how temporary these price pressures will be, and whether they'll translate into stronger pay growth,"" said Jack Leslie, senior economist at the Resolution Foundation think tank.
""Britain's recent history suggests that high inflation feeds through into real wage falls instead – a lesson families can ill-afford to learn for a third time in a decade.""

1159,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 20, 2021 05:17AM ET</span>","Energy, services boost euro zone inflation as expected in Sept","BRUSSELS (Reuters) - More expensive energy and services boosted euro zone inflation as expected in September, data showed on Wednesday, with core inflation also higher.
The European Union's statistics office Eurostat said consumer prices in the 19 countries using the euro rose 0.5% month-on-month in September for a 3.4% year-on-year rise, as earlier estimated by Eurostat.
While the headline number was well above the European Central Bank's target of 2%, the overshoot was mainly a result of a 17.6% year-on-year surge in energy prices and a 2.0% rise in the costs of food, alcohol and tobacco.
Without these volatile items, or what the ECB calls core inflation, prices grew 0.4% month-on-month for a 1.9% year-on-year increase, faster than the 1.6% annual rise in August.

Eurostat said energy prices were responsible for almost half of the overall year-on-year inflation reading, adding 1.63 points to the final result. Services added another 0.72 points and prices of non-energy industrial goods a further 0.57 points.
The ECB expects consumer prices will start easing again in 2022.

1160,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 20, 2021 04:56AM ET</span>",China's new home prices stall for first time since COVID-19,"By Liangping Gao and Ryan Woo
BEIJING (Reuters) -China's new home prices stalled for the first time since February 2020 in September, as the chill in the property market intensified amid tightening credit due to an ongoing crackdown on speculative investment.
The average new home price in 70 major Chinese cities was unchanged in September month-on-month, compared with 0.2% growth in August, according to Reuters calculations based on data released by the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) on Wednesday.
Some analysts said prices fell 0.08%, or even 0.1%, based on their respective calculations, which can vary slightly due to different formulas used. The NBS did not respond to a Reuters request for comment.
The data showed 27 cities reported month-on-month gains, compared with 46 in August, the lowest since February 2020 at the height of China's COVID-19 outbreak. 
In September, some cities intensified their campaigns to drive speculators out of the property market. In Xiamen, the southeastern city further tightened property curbs on top of existing measures, prohibiting first-time home buyers from reselling their properties for five years.
The tougher restrictions, along with tighter rules on borrowing for property purchases, have weighed on near-term demand, analysts said. 
""Real estate credit tightening - with home loans down by 510 billion yuan ($79.8 billion) year-on-year in the third quarter - was the biggest reason for the overall market freeze,"" said Zhang Dawei, chief analyst with property agency Centaline. 
Chinese leaders, fearful that a persistent property bubble could undermine the country's long-term ascent, are likely to maintain tight property curbs, although analysts say they could soften some tactics as needed.
Compared with a year earlier, China's new home prices grew 3.8% in September, the slowest in nine months, easing from a 4.2% increase in August. 
Compounding concerns about the sector are the debt problems of China Evergrande, the country's second-largest developer, which is scrambling to raise funds to pay its many lenders and suppliers.
Tens of thousands of Chinese developers had borrowed heavily to build homes during a surge in the property market between 2016 and 2018. But they are now facing a liquidity crunch amid tighter regulations on fresh borrowing, leaving many projects incomplete.
""Many developers have recently been exposed to a liquidity crunch, leading buyers to worry about buying buildings that are forever unfinished,"" Zhang said. 
""It is expected that in the fourth quarter of 2021, the markets in most cities will enter an obvious adjustment cycle.""
Vice Premier Liu He said on Wednesday that while there are some problems in the property market, overall risks are controllable, according to domestic media. 
Liu said reasonable demand for capital was being met, adding that he expected the property market to continue to develop in a healthy way overall, domestic media reported.
SMALLER CITIES
Price declines have particularly hammered smaller cities with persistent population outflows or uncertain economic prospects, leading to a build-up in local housing inventories.
Luzhou in Sichuan province and Dali in Yunnan province saw month-on-month price declines in seven out of nine months so far this year, the most out of all the 70 major cities tracked by the statistics bureau. 
In Taiyuan, the capital of northern Shanxi province, new home prices fell in six out of the nine months. 
""Many new homes are under construction in Taiyuan, and there is a backlog of homes that hasn't been sold,"" said a Taiyuan resident surnamed Hou, 24. 
""Previously, just opposite my home, there was construction on a plot for nearly two years, and there were several work suspensions during that time.""
Even China's largest cities are starting to weaken. 
New home prices fell for the second month in Guangzhou, while Tianjin and Chengdu saw their first monthly declines this year in September. Prices in Beijing stalled. 

""If there is no significant easing of mortgage loans from October onwards, price wars will be the main buzzword in the real estate market in the fourth quarter,"" said Zhang.

TOKYO (Reuters) -Japan's export growth weakened to its slowest in seven months in September, while a surge in imports added to worries that pandemic-led global supply chain snags could derail the country's fragile economic recovery.
Exports are losing steam at a time when a weaker yen and a spike in oil prices have pushed up import costs, hurting resource-poor Japan's terms of trade and potentially undermining Prime Minister Fumio Kishida's pledge to correct wealth gaps.
The trade data will be among factors the Bank of Japan will scrutinise when it releases fresh quarterly growth and inflation projections at its policy meeting later this month.
Exports rose 13.0% in September from a year earlier, Ministry of Finance data showed on Wednesday, compared with a median market forecast for an 11.0% rise, as car shipments tumbled 40.3%, the first drop in seven months.
While ahead of forecasts, export growth weakened from 26.2% in the previous month and was the slowest since February.
""While the effect of auto production cuts will abate once supply bottlenecks are resolved, fundamental concerns for growth peak-outs in the United States and China are unchanged,"" said Kota Suzuki, economist at Daiwa Securities.
""Exports will still be in the weak state for a while.""
Shipments to China, Japan's largest trading partner, rose 10.3% in September year-on-year, led by semiconductors and plastic materials, while car exports fell 71.9%.
U.S.-bound exports, another key destination for Japanese goods, fell 3.3% to mark the first decline in seven months, as demand for cars and airplanes weakened.
Imports, meanwhile, jumped 38.6% in the year to September, following the prior month's 44.7% gain, driven by increased costs for oil, coal and medicines. 
Imports have now risen for eight straight months, fuelling concerns that a recent yen weakening and surging oil prices are adding to the cost of living in Japan.
""Rising import prices hurt the terms of trade for Japanese companies,"" said Ryosuke Katagi, market economist at Mizuho Securities. ""As consumer price inflation remains stagnant in Japan, companies cannot pass on the soaring costs to consumers, damaging corporate profits.""
Japan's trade balance swung into a deficit for a second straight month at 622.8 billion yen ($5.43 billion), with the yen-based cost of imports the highest since November 2018.
The data may add to worries among policymakers hoping for an export-led recovery, while rising import costs will stoke fears of stagflation, or a combination of rising inflation and stagnating growth.
Policymakers are under pressure to maintain Japan's economic recovery from last year's pandemic-induced doldrums, despite additional strains from a resurgence of the pandemic in other parts of Asia.

The world's third-largest economy is expected to have expanded a meagre 0.8% in the third quarter, a Reuters poll showed, as parts shortages and supply constraints caused by Asian factory shutdowns disrupted automakers.

1163,By Bloomberg,"<span>Oct 19, 2021 10:01PM ET</span>",China Home Rut Deepens as Prices Fall for First Time Since 2015,"(Bloomberg) -- China’s home prices fell for the first time in six years as a property slump deepens in the world’s second-largest economy. 
New-home prices in 70 cities, excluding state-subsidized housing, slid 0.08% in September from August, the first drop since April 2015, National Bureau of Statistics figures showed Wednesday. Values in the secondary market declined 0.19%, down for a second month.
A slump in the home market is becoming more evident as developers including China Evergrande Group struggle to raise money and buyers stay away. Falling prices may fuel a vicious cycle by further weakening demand, worsening the cash shortage at builders and forcing them to offer bigger discounts.
September is traditionally a peak season for the home market. Yet residential sales tumbled 17% by area, investments slid for the first time since early 2020, and the rate of failed land auctions climbed to the highest since at least 2018. 
Read more on the impact of land auction flops
The downturn has continued into this month. Existing-home sales plunged 63% from a year earlier in the first 17 days of October, according to a  Nomura Holdings  (NYSE:NMR) Inc. note Monday. 
“The new-home market faces relatively big downward pressure in the short term,” Yang Kewei, a research director at China Real Estate Information Corp., said before the figures were released. “The effects of price discounts are waning.” 
Fears of contagion from the crisis at Evergrande have intensified after a surprise default by Fantasia Holdings Group Co. and a wave of credit rating downgrades at other developers. Yields on Chinese high-yield dollar bonds, which are dominated by builders, have climbed to their highest in about a decade, hurting a key funding channel for the sector.
That will have a knock-on effect on the broader economy, since  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS). estimates the property sector and related downstream industries make up almost a quarter of gross domestic product. 
Still, China’s central bank has said risks posed to the domestic economy by Evergrande can be contained. The property firm’s trouble “casts a little bit of concern,” People’s Bank of China Governor Yi Gang said at a virtual meeting of the Group of 30 on Sunday.

(Reuters) - Foreign holdings of U.S. Treasuries rose for a fifth straight month in August and hit a record high, but the pace of increase slowed, data from the Treasury Department showed on Monday.
Foreign investors held $7.56 trillion of Treasuries as of the end of August. In July, foreign holdings of Treasuries stood at $7.54 trillion, the previous record according to Refinitiv Datastream, and up from $7.5 trillion at the end of June.
Gennadiy Goldberg, rates strategist for TD Securities, said the slower rate of increase likely reflected foreign buyers taking stock of less-volatile trading for U.S. debt during August.
The yield on the benchmark U.S. 10-year Treasury note started the month at 1.237% and finished August slightly higher at 1.307% after trading within a narrower range than in July.
""Given that rates stabilized (In August) you saw a more mixed buying and selling picture than before,"" Goldberg said of the foreign purchase pattern.
U.S. Treasury yields are low by historic standards but higher than government bond yields in many other major countries, boosting their attractiveness to foreign investors.
Monday's data showed Japan remained the largest non-U.S. net holder of Treasuries with $1.32 trillion in August, up from $1.31 trillion at the end of July. Second-placed China had $1.05 trillion of U.S. Treasuries at the end of August, down from $1.07 trillion a month earlier.

Net foreign purchases of long and short-term U.S. Securities and banking flows totaled $91 billion for August, down from $164.1 billion in July.
Of the August amount, net foreign private inflows were $125 billion, down from $166 billion in July. Net foreign official outflows were $34 billion, compared with outflows of $2.1 billion in July.

1166,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 19, 2021 12:16PM ET</span>",U.S. homebuilding stumbles as supply constraints mount,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. homebuilding unexpectedly fell in September and permits dropped to a one-year low amid acute shortages of raw materials and labor, supporting expectations that economic growth slowed sharply in the third quarter.
The report from the Commerce Department on Tuesday also showed the gap between completed houses and those still under construction was the largest on record last month. Robust demand as global economies emerge from the COVID-19 pandemic is running against worker shortages, straining supply chains and fanning inflation. Nearly every industry in the United States is experiencing shortages.
""Momentum in demand still appears to be positive,"" said Rubeela Farooqi, chief U.S. economist at High Frequency Economics in White Plains, New York. ""But supply is struggling to catch up given higher input costs and shortages that remain headwinds for builders."" 
Housing starts dropped 1.6% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.555 million units last month, the lowest level since April. Data for August was revised down to a rate of 1.580 million units from the previously reported 1.615 million units.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast starts would rise to a rate of 1.620 million units. Lumber prices are rising again after tumbling from record highs set in May. Building materials, like windows and electric breaker boxes, are in short supply.
Prices for copper, another essential material in home building, have soared more than 16% since the end of September, buoyed by decades-low supplies. The pandemic has upended labor market dynamics, leading to shortages of workers needed to produce and move raw materials and finished goods to markets.
Starts have declined from the 1.725 million unit-pace level scaled in March, which was more than a 14-1/2-year high.
Single-family starts, which account for the largest share of the housing market, were unchanged at a rate of 1.080 million units last month. Single-family homebuilding rose in the West and Midwest, but fell in the Northeast and the densely populated South, also likely depressed by Hurricane Ida, which caused unprecedented flooding. Starts for buildings with five units or more dropped 5.1% to a rate of 467,000 units last month.
A survey from the National Association of Home Builders on Monday showed confidence among single-family homebuilders rising further in October, but noted that ""builders continue to grapple with ongoing supply chain disruptions and labor shortages that are delaying completion times.""
Stocks on Wall Street were trading higher as upbeat results from Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) and Travelers (NYSE:TRV) fired up risk appetite. The dollar fell against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices were mixed. 
COMPLETIONS LAG
Last month's decline in homebuilding followed on the heels of news on Monday that production at U.S. factories fell by the most in seven months in September. Residential investment likely remained weak in the third quarter after contracting in the April-June quarter. 
Gross domestic product growth estimates for the third quarter are mostly below a 3% annualized rate. The economy grew at a 6.7% pace in the second quarter. 
The housing market was boosted early in the coronavirus pandemic by an exodus from cities to suburbs and other low-density locations as Americans sought more spacious accommodations for home offices and online schooling, leading to three straight quarters of double-digit growth in residential spending. That tailwind is ebbing as workers return to offices and schools reopened for in-person learning, thanks to COVID-19 vaccinations. High inflation is also lifting mortgage rates. 
The 30-year fixed mortgage rate rose to an average of 3.05% last week from 2.99% in the prior week, according to data from mortgage giant  Freddie Mac  (OTC:FMCC). Though still low by historical standards, rising borrowing costs could make homeownership less affordable for some first-time buyers. House prices notched record double-digit growth on an annual basis in July.
A separate report from the Mortgage Bankers Association on Tuesday showed mortgage applications for new home purchases decreased 16.2% in September from a year ago. Applications were down 4% on a month-on-month basis. The average loan size hit a record $408,522, underscoring the higher construction costs.
With building costs mounting, permits for future homebuilding plunged 7.7% to a rate of 1.589 million units last month, the lowest level since September 2020. Single-family permits fell 0.9% to a rate of 1.041 million units. 
Permits for buildings with five units or more plummeted 21.0% to a rate of 498,000 units. 
Housing completions dropped 4.6% to a rate of 1.240 million units, the lowest level since August 2020. Single-family home completions were unchanged at a rate of 953,000 units. 
The stock of housing under construction increased 1.3% to a rate of 1,426 million units last month, the highest since February 1974. That led to a record wide gap between completed homes and houses under construction.

Also highlighting the supply constraints, the number of houses authorized for construction but not yet started raced to a record high last month.
""The backlog of starts – which reflects numerous supply-side constraints, including high input costs and difficulty attracting skilled workers – should underpin housing construction in the months ahead,"" said Nancy Vanden Houten, lead U.S. economist at Oxford Economics in New York.

1168,By Bloomberg,"<span>Oct 19, 2021 08:54AM ET</span>","U.S. Housing Starts Fell Last Month, Led by Multifamily Slowdown","(Bloomberg) -- U.S. housing starts decreased in September, driven by a pullback in multifamily construction, as lingering supply-chain constraints, shortages of skilled labor and elevated materials costs continue to challenge builders.
Residential starts fell 1.6% last month to a 1.56 million annualized rate, according to government data released Tuesday. The median estimate in a Bloomberg survey called for a 1.62 million pace.
Applications to build, a proxy for future construction, fell 7.7% to an annualized 1.59 million units in September. That’s the largest monthly decline since February. 
Cheap borrowing costs and a pandemic-fueled migration to the suburbs supported housing demand and construction through late 2020 and earlier this year. But high materials costs, unpredictable supply-chain delays and labor shortages have strained builders’ ability to keep up with still-solid demand in more recent months.
Single-family starts were unchanged in September at an annualized 1.08 million units as multifamily starts -- which tend to be volatile and include apartment buildings and condominiums -- decreased 5% to 475,000. 
Meanwhile, the report indicates builders are making little headway on project backlogs. The number of single-family homes authorized for construction but not yet started -- a measure of backlogs -- edged lower to 144,000 in September but remains near a 15-year high.
While high construction costs helped fuel a surge in prices that has cooled buyer interest somewhat, builders remain generally optimistic. A gauge of homebuilder sentiment rose to a three-month high in October -- holding well-above pre-pandemic levels -- a separate report showed Monday.

1169,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 18, 2021 01:31PM ET</span>","Chip shortages, Hurricane Ida weigh on U.S. factory output; demand remains strong","By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Production at U.S. factories fell by the most in seven months in September as an ongoing global shortage of semiconductors depressed motor vehicle output, further evidence that supply constraints were hampering economic growth.
Manufacturing production last month was also weighed down by the lingering effects of Hurricane Ida, which also severely disrupted output at mines. The report from the Federal Reserve on Monday followed on the heels of data last week showing a solid rise in inflation in September. Though retail sales rose last month, that reflected higher prices for motor vehicles. 
""While the hurricane disruption and weather effects will fade, labor and product shortages are still worsening, which will continue to weigh on manufacturing output over the coming months and quarters,"" said Michael Pearce, a senior U.S. economist at Capital Economics in New York.
Manufacturing output dropped 0.7% last month, the largest decline since February. Data for August was revised down to show production falling 0.4% instead of rising 0.2% as previously reported. It was only the second time since April 2020, when mandatory closures of nonessential businesses were enforced to slow the first wave of COVID-19 infections, that manufacturing output fell for two straight months. 
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast manufacturing production edging up 0.1%. Output increased 4.8% compared to September 2020. Manufacturing, which accounts for 12% of the U.S. economy, remains underpinned by businesses desperate to replenish stocks after inventories were drawn down in the first half of the year amid strong demand for goods.
Spending shifted to goods from services over the course of the pandemic, straining supply chains. The rotation back to services, such as travel and dining out, has been slowed by a resurgence in coronavirus infections over the summer, driven by the Delta variant.
Production at auto plants tumbled 7.2% after dropping 3.2% in August. The global shortage of microchips is forcing automakers to cut production. There is also a shortage of workers at ports, which is causing congestion and holding up the delivery of raw materials. 
Motor vehicle assembly dropped to an annualized rate of 7.78 million units, the lowest since April 2020, from a pace of 8.82 million units in August.

""Supply issues limiting production will likely continue to limit consumption of autos, with latest industry guidance suggesting shortages could last well into 2022,"" said Veronica Clark, an economist at  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) in New York.
Excluding autos, manufacturing output dropped 0.3%. The Fed said Hurricane Ida, which devastated U.S. offshore energy production in late August, contributed 0.3 percentage point to the drop in manufacturing output. 
With autos and consumer energy products output tumbling, consumer goods production fell 1.9% last month. There were, however, increases in the production of primary metals and electrical equipment, appliances and components as well as furniture and related products. 
Nondurable goods output dropped 1.0%, with large decreases in chemicals, petroleum and coal products.
Overall, manufacturing output increased at a 5.3% rate in the third quarter after growing at a 5.0% pace in the second quarter. Motor vehicle and parts production rebounded at an 8.6% rate as manufacturers scrapped annual plant closures for retooling over summer to manage their chip supply. Motor vehicle output plunged at a 24.6% pace in the second quarter.
Stocks on Wall Street were lower. The dollar was steady against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices fell. 
SILVER LINING
A shortage of motor vehicles helped to drive up inflation in September, through very high prices, and flattered retail sales. The dearth of automobiles is also frustrating efforts to rebuild inventories. The combination of higher inflation, which is cutting into consumer spending, and moderate inventory build has led economists to anticipate that economic growth slowed sharply in the third quarter.
The Atlanta Fed is estimating that gross domestic product growth braked to a 1.2% annualized rate last quarter. The economy grew at a 6.7% pace in the second quarter.
""Perhaps a silver lining in this difficult supply environment today is that manufacturers will have plenty of work ahead of them once they are able to secure the inputs and help they need,"" said Tim Quinlan, a senior economist at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) in Charlotte, North Carolina.
Labor and building material shortages are also impeding the housing market. A survey from the National Association of Home Builders on Monday showed sentiment among single-family homebuilders rising in October amid strong demand. But builders complained that ""ongoing supply chain disruptions and labor shortages are delaying completion times and putting upward pressure on building material and home prices."" 
Last month's decline in manufacturing output combined with a 2.3% decrease in mining and a 3.6% drop in utilities to pull down industrial production by 1.3%. The largest drop in industrial output in seven months followed a 0.1% dip in August. Mining was weighed down by the aftermath of Ida, while demand for utilities subsided following a warmer-than-usual August.
Industrial production rose at a 4.3% rate in the July-September quarter, notching its fifth straight quarter of growth of at least 4%.

Capacity utilization for the manufacturing sector, a measure of how fully firms are using their resources, fell 0.6 percentage point in September to 75.9%. Overall capacity use for the industrial sector dropped 1.0 percentage point to 75.2%. It is 4.4 percentage points below its 1972-2020 average.
Officials at the Fed tend to look at capacity use measures for signals of how much ""slack"" remains in the economy — how far growth has room to run before it becomes inflationary.

1170,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 18, 2021 10:06AM ET</span>","U.S. homebuilder confidence unexpectedly rises in October, survey shows","(Reuters) - Confidence among U.S. single-family homebuilders rose by the most in nearly a year in October as customer traffic improved for a second straight month, although builders remain concerned that the shortages that are driving up materials prices will hurt home affordability.
The National Association of Home Builders/Wells Fargo Housing Market Index rose 4 points - the most since November 2020 - to 80 this month. The reading topped the median estimate of economists in a Reuters poll of 76 and the increase pushed the index to a three-month high. 
A reading above 50 indicates that more builders view conditions as good than poor. 
""Builders are getting increasingly concerned about affordability hurdles ahead for most buyers,"" said NAHB Chief Economist Robert Dietz. 
Nonetheless, all three subindexes improved, and conditions were seen as better in all four regions tracked in the monthly survey.
The current conditions index rose 5 points to 87, the highest since June; the index measuring sales expectations for the next six months rose 3 points to 84, the highest since last December; and the customer traffic index improved by 4 points - the most since February - to 65.

Dietz said affordability may also be tested with interest rates expected to rise in coming months as the U.S. Federal Reserve begins to remove its pandemic-era support for the economy. The Fed is widely expected to announce plans to start cutting its purchases of $120 billion a month of U.S. Treasuries and mortgage-backed debt as early as its next meeting in just over two weeks, although any rate hike by the central bank is seen further away.
Still, home loan interest rates have already begun to rise, with the average 30-year mortgage rate climbing to 3.18% in early October, the highest since June, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association.

1171,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 18, 2021 08:12AM ET</span>","China's economy stumbles on power crunch, property woes","By Kevin Yao and Gabriel Crossley
BEIJING (Reuters) - China's economy hit its slowest pace of growth in a year in the third quarter, hurt by power shortages and wobbles in the property sector, highlighting the challenge facing policymakers as they seek to prop up a faltering recovery while reining in the real estate sector.
Gross domestic product expanded 4.9% from a year ago, missing forecasts, as attempts by Beijing to curb lending to the property sector exacerbated the fallout from electricity shortages which sent factory output back to levels last seen in early 2020, when heavy COVID-19 curbs were in place.
The world's second-largest economy had staged an impressive rebound from last year's pandemic slump but the recovery has lost steam from the blistering 18.3% growth clocked in the first quarter.
Under President Xi Jinping, a drive to make structural changes that address long-term risks and distortions, which has involved crackdowns on the property sector and technology giants, as well as carbon emission cuts, has taken a toll.
Analysts at  Barclays  (LON:BARC) cut their fourth quarter forecast by 1.2 percentage points to 3.5% on the disappointing data. Analysts at ANZ cut their forecast for China's 2021 GDP growth to 8.0% from 8.3%.
Policymakers will now have to balance the impact of those structural changes with steps that will shield the economy and tame contagion risks from a debt crisis at major developer China Evergrande Group.
""In response to the ugly growth numbers we expect in coming months, we think policymakers will take more steps to shore up growth, including ensuring ample liquidity in the interbank market, accelerating infrastructure development and relaxing some aspects of overall credit and real estate policies,"" said Louis Kuijs, head of Asia economics at Oxford Economics.
A Reuters poll of analysts had expected GDP to rise 5.2% in the third quarter.
The weak numbers sent the yuan and most Asian stock markets lower amid broader investor concerns about the world economic recovery.
In Europe, China-exposed luxury stocks including LVMH,  Kering  (PA:PRTP) and Hermes fell about 3% each, also hurt by Xi's call for the expansion of a consumption tax. 
POLICY-DRIVEN
China, still an avowedly socialist country, has pledged to reduce inequality after years of breakneck growth but may have to tread cautiously to avoid derailing a private sector that has been a vital engine of growth and jobs, analysts say.
In an essay in the ruling Communist Party journal Qiushi last week, Xi called for progress on a long-awaited property tax that could help reduce wealth gaps.
New construction starts in September slumped for a sixth straight month, NBS data showed, the longest spate of monthly declines since 2015, as cash-strapped developers reined in investment and paused projects following tighter borrowing limits.
Meanwhile, the industrial sector has been hit by power rationing triggered by coal shortages, as well as environmental curbs on heavy polluters like steel plants and floods over the summer.
Overall industrial output rose just 3.1% in September from a year earlier, marking the slowest growth since March 2020, during the first wave of the pandemic.
Aluminium output declined for the fifth consecutive month and daily crude steel output hit the lowest level since 2018.
Bucking the negative trend, retail sales grew 4.4%, faster than forecasts and the 2.5% growth in August, and the surveyed nationwide jobless rate fell from 5.1% to 4.9%.
""Most of the (negative) factors are policy-driven... the economy is having a lot of pain points and these pain points are not going away soon because policies are here to stay, and therefore it will continue into 2022,"" said Iris Pang, chief economist for Greater China at ING.
On a quarterly basis, growth eased to 0.2% in July-September from a downwardly revised 1.2% in the second quarter.
Premier Li Keqiang said last week that China has ample tools to cope with economic challenges despite slowing growth, and expressed confidence in hitting full-year development goals.
On Sunday, People's Bank of China governor Yi Gang said the economy is expected to grow 8% this year.

Still, the central bank is expected to remain cautious about monetary easing due to worries about high debt and property risks.
Analysts polled by Reuters expect the People's Bank of China to refrain from attempts to stimulate the economy by reducing the amount of cash banks must hold in reserve until the first quarter of 2022.

The median forecast from a poll of 17 economists expects export orders to jump 17% from the year-ago period. Forecasts for growth ranged from 6.5% to as high as 26%.
Taiwan's export orders are a leading indicator of demand for hi-tech gadgets and Asia's exports, and typically lead actual exports by two to three months.
The island nation's export orders, a bellwether of global technology demand, leapt 17.6% from a year earlier to $53.5 billion in August, a strong performance but less than forecast on unexpectedly weaker demand for new smartphones. 

Taiwan's manufacturers, including the world's largest contract chipmaker Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd, are a key part of the global supply chain for technology giants such as Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL).
The data for September will be released on Wednesday.

1173,By Investing.com,"<span>Oct 18, 2021 01:07AM ET</span>","China’s Economic Growth Slows Down, but Retail Sales Up","By Gina Lee
Investing.com – China’s economy grew at its slowest pace in a year in the third quarter of 2021, with a global energy crunch, supply chain bottlenecks, and an unsteady property market also adding pressure on policymakers to bolster a faltering economic recovery.
Data released earlier in the day said that the GDP grew 0.2% quarter-on-quarter, against the 0.5% growth in forecasts prepared by Investing.com and the previous month’s 1.3% growth. The GDP grew 4.9% year-on-year, lower than the 5.2% growth in forecasts prepared by Investing.com and the 7.9% growth recorded in August 2021.
China  Evergrande  Group's (HK:3333) ongoing debt crisis, supply chain delays, and the energy crunch are emerging as big challenges for China to overcome.
""The domestic economic recovery is still unstable and uneven,"" National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) spokesperson Fu Linghui said at a briefing on Monday.
The slow growth is in contrast to the country’s impressive economic recovery from COVID-19 in 2020, boosted by effective virus containment and increasing overseas demand for Chinese manufactured goods.
""In response to the ugly growth numbers we expect in coming months, we think policymakers will take more steps to shore up growth, including ensuring ample liquidity in the interbank market, accelerating infrastructure development and relaxing some aspects of overall credit and real estate policies,"" Oxford Economics head of Asia economics Louis Kuijs told Reuters.
Developer China Evergrande Group’s debt woes continue, and worries about a potential spillover of credit risk from China's property sector into the broader economy also continue to mount.
Meanwhile, industrial production grew 3.1% year-on-year in September, lower than the 4.5% growth in forecasts prepared by Investing.com and the previous month’s 5.3% growth.
Retail sales grew 4.4% year-on-year in September, higher than the 3.3% in Investing.com forecasts and the previous month’s 2.5% growth. The unemployment rate was 4.9%, lower than the 5.1% recorded in August.
The industrial sector has been hit by the energy crisis, with coal shortages triggering power rationing. The sector has also been hit hard by environmental curbs on heavy polluters like steel plants and floods over the summer.

1174,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 18, 2021 01:06AM ET</span>",China's plunging construction starts reminiscent of 2015 downturn,"By Liangping Gao and Ryan Woo
BEIJING (Reuters) -China's September new construction starts slumped for a sixth straight month, the longest spate of monthly declines since 2015, as cash-strapped developers put a pause on projects in the wake of tighter regulations on borrowing. 
New construction starts in September fell 13.54% from a year earlier, the third month of double-digit declines, according to Reuters calculations based on January-September data released by the National Bureau of Statistics on Monday. 
That marks the longest downtrend since declines in March-August 2015, the last property malaise. 
When the sector recovered in 2016 after authorities loosened their grip on purchases and development, tens of thousands of real estate firms borrowed heavily to build homes. 
But as regulations tightened again this year, many of them have started to face a liquidity crunch, which was then worsened by sharply weaker demand due to tighter restrictions on speculative purchases. 
Property sales by floor area dropped 15.8% in September, down for a third month, according to Reuters calculations based on the statistics bureau's data. 
The slowdown in the sector was also underscored by a 3.5% drop in property investments by developers in September, the first monthly decline since January-February last year at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic in China.
""All the data are poor,"" said Zhang Dawei, chief analyst with property agency Centaline. 
""Financing is hard, sales are tough, so of course, there has been no enthusiasm to build. For the first time in history, developers are encountering two blockages - blockages in sales and blockages in financing.""
The potential collapse of highly indebted real estate firms such as China Evergrande Group have raised concerns about systemic risks to the broader economy. The real estate sector accounts for a quarter of China's gross domestic product. 
Authorities will try to prevent problems at Evergrande from spreading to other real estate companies to avoid broader systemic risk, Yi Gang, governor of China's central bank, said on Sunday.
On Friday, a central bank official said the spillover effect of Evergrande's debt problems on the banking system was ""controllable.""
""There is a likelihood that housing policies may loosen in the fourth quarter, and that would ease the pessimism in the property transaction data,"" said Yan Yuejin, director of Shanghai-based E-house China Research and Development Institution. 
On Friday, representatives from 10 Chinese property companies met government regulators to ask for an ""appropriate loosening"" on policy restrictions, financial news outlet Yicai reported.
China's real estate shares have fallen 22% so far this year. On Monday, they were down 2.6% as of 0300 GMT.

In the first nine months, property investment rose 8.8% from a year earlier, slowing from 10.9% growth seen in January-August. 
Funds raised by China's property developers grew 11.1%, slower than the 14.8% rise seen in the first eight months.

COMMENTARY:
WOEI CHEN HO, ECONOMIST, UOB, SINGAPORE
""The numbers are actually much weaker than what we thought... I think in the fourth quarter it will be even slower because we will see more impact from the energy crunch.
""It's quite clear that the energy crunch has had a larger impact on industrial production than what the market was expecting.
""Going forward it will be a challenging environment for China - if you look at the energy crunch (and) the crackdown on the property sector, which is having a quite a big impact on the economy. We are probably going to downgrade our full-year growth (from 8.6%) to closer to 8%.""
CHAOPING ZHU, GLOBAL MARKET STRATEGIST, J.P. MORGAN ASSET MANAGEMENT, SHANGHAI 
""At the beginning of this year, the Chinese government set an annual goal of 6% GDP growth, leaving sufficient room for fundamental reforms aiming to improve the country's long-term growth potential. However, short-term shocks seem inevitable when a variety of policy measures have been introduced in a short period since July.
""The intensive implementations of decarbonisation policies, education burden reduction, internet regulation, as well as escalating property market control, weighed on domestic consumption and investment. As a result, the policy pendulum is swinging back to supportive measures, although the degree might be moderate and the direction for long-term reforms will not be changed.""
SELENA LING, CHIEF ECONOMIST, OCBC BANK, SINGAPORE
""Headwinds are on the production side, especially with the current power crunch, increasing regulatory scrutiny and also the downside risks to the property market.
""2022 growth is likely to slow further, closer to a low 5% handle... it's back to a domestic demand story (and) retail sales is a bright spot. The probability of an imminent RRR cut has diminished post-PBOC conference and the full MLF rollover last week.""
IRIS PANG, CHIEF ECONOMIST, GREATER CHINA, HONG KONG, ING
""It's within my expectations, but the direction is almost all down.
""Retail sales figures show there is still huge demand for jewellery, which makes me think that people are not willing to buy properties and are trying to find alternatives.
""Automobile sales are in contraction - this also reflects that the economy is not really solid, if people don't want to buy big-ticket items. Another thing that I usually use to gauge the average consumer is clothing, and clothing is under contraction ... and this makes me think the average consumer is now saving more than spending.
""Most of the (negative) factors are policy-driven... the economy is having a lot of pain points and these pain points are not going away soon because policies are here to stay, and therefore it will continue into 2022 -- unless international borders fully reopen, that will give a new engine for all economies.""
ZHIWEI ZHANG, CHIEF ECONOMIST, PINPOINT ASSET MANAGEMENT, HONG KONG 
""Q3 data showed further signs that the risk of stagflation is rising. GDP growth year-on-year dropped below 5%. The quarter-on-quarter growth dropped to 0.2%. The QoQ growth is at the slowest level except for Q1 last year when COVID broke out.
""Yet the unemployment rate declined, which is puzzling. This suggests the government may not feel the urgency to launch stimulus and boost growth. The PBOC press conference last week also sent signals indicating that the monetary policy stance will not change significantly. Without a meaningful policy change, growth in Q4 would likely slow further.""
KEN CHEUNG, CHIEF ASIAN FX STRATEGIST, MIZUHO BANK, HONG KONG
""On the monetary policy front, the PBOC downplayed the easing bias and is more likely to implement targeted easing measures to replace the broad RRR cut in Q4. Yet, the increasing downside risk for China growth in Q4 should still dent RMB sentiment and we expect the CNY to fall back to 6.50 at year-end.""
LOUIS KUIJS, HEAD OF ASIA ECONOMICS, OXFORD ECONOMICS, HONG KONG
""We think the electricity shortages and production cuts will become less of a problem later in Q4. In line with our expectation, senior policymakers have started to stress growth and we expect them to start calling for the pursuit of climate targets on a more measured timeline.
""But, while we don't expect Evergrande's problems to trigger a Lehman moment, we think the pending real estate downturn will continue to weigh substantially on growth in the coming months, while lingering COVID caution should continue to lead to be a drag on consumption. As a result, we forecast only 3.6% y/y GDP growth in Q4.
""In response to the ugly growth numbers we expect in the coming months, we think policymakers will take more steps to shore up growth, including ensuring ample liquidity in the interbank market, accelerating infrastructure development and relaxing some aspects of overall credit and real estate policies.""
BACKGROUND:
* China's economy has rebounded from the pandemic but the recovery is losing steam, weighed by faltering factory activity, persistently soft consumption and a slowing property sector.
* Signs of further slowing in the economy put pressure on the central bank to ease policy, but analysts said concerns over debt and property bubble risks may delay any meaningful steps.
* Global worries about a possible spillover of credit risk from China's property sector into the broader economy have intensified as major developer China Evergrande Group wrestles with more than $300 billion of debt.
* Chinese Premier Li Keqiang has said China has ample tools to cope with economic challenges despite slowing growth, and the government is confident of achieving full-year development goals.
* China's economy is ""doing well"", but faces challenges such as default risks for certain firms due to ""mismanagement"", the People's Bank of China Governor Yi Gang said on Sunday.
* The country's export growth surprisingly accelerated in September as still solid global demand offset some of the pressures on the economy.

* Economists expect China's GDP to grow 8.2% this year. This is slower than an 8.6% rise forecast in a July poll, but would still be the highest annual growth in a decade. The economy expanded 2.3% in pandemic-hit 2020.
* China has set an annual GDP growth target at above 6% this year, below analysts' expectations, giving policymakers more room to cope with uncertainties.

WELLINGTON (Reuters) -New Zealand's Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose 2.2% in the third quarter, beating expectations and surging at the fastest pace in over a decade driven by housing-related costs and other supply constraints, data released on Monday showed.
CPI rose 2.2% in the quarter ending September from a rise of 1.3% in the second quarter, the biggest quarterly movement since a 2.3% rise in the December 2010 quarter, Statistics New Zealand said in a statement.
Annual inflation surged 4.9% compared to a rise of 3.3% in the previous quarter, also the biggest annual movement in more than a decade. 
The data beat analysts' expectations in a Reuters poll and forecasts of the Reserve Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ), both of which put the quarterly inflation rise at 1.4%, lifting annual inflation to 4.1%.
The main drivers were housing-related costs, such as construction of new houses and local authority rate, Statistics New Zealand said in its statement. 
Vegetable prices was the second major driver along with transport costs and fuel prices. New Zealand's largest city, Auckland, has been in lockdown since mid-August to stamp out an outbreak of the Delta variant of coronavirus.
The New Zealand dollar jumped, touching $0.7103, as traders anticipated more monetary policy tightening by the central bank in response to the higher than expected inflation. 
RBNZ hiked rates earlier this month, and signalled further tightening to come, as it looks to keep inflation near its target 1-3% range, and to cool a red-hot housing market.

""We had already expected the RBNZ to continue hiking rates despite the Auckland lockdown,"" said Ben Udy, an economist at Capital Economics.
""But the strength in consumer prices in Q3 will surely nudge the Bank towards an even more aggressive hiking cycle,"" he said.

In a report, the association's research unit CSC forecast gross domestic product (GDP) would rise 6.1% this year and 4.1% next year, going above pre-pandemic levels in the first half of 2022. 
In April the research unit had said Italy's GDP would be up 4.1% in 2021.
Its forecasts for this year are now just above the 6% expected by the national unity government lead by Mario Draghi. 
Last year the COVID-hit economy contracted by 8.9%, the steepest recession in Italy's post-war history. The firm pick-up now in place is seen resulting in lower-than-expected public deficit and debt ratios this year.
The CSC report cautioned that, starting from the last quarter of this year, GDP growth would have a more ""moderate profile"".
It said that its estimates took into account Italy's multi-billion euro recovery plan, partly funded by the European Union.
It added that, despite the ""positive perspectives"", the forecasts had downside risks that were linked to the possibility of new COVID-19 restrictions, the lack of raw materials that could bog down production and more structural inflation. 

Confindustria President Carlo Bonomi said that recovery was well underway but that it was important to ""keep the guard up"".
""Italy must go back to growing at a yearly pace of at least 1.5-2%, an achievable goal, equal to the annual growth registered between 1997 and 2007,"" he said.

1179,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 15, 2021 12:31PM ET</span>",Rising prices flatter U.S. retail sales; demand for goods remains strong,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. retail sales unexpectedly rose in September in part as more expensive motor vehicles boosted receipts at auto dealerships, but there are fears that supply constraints could disrupt the holiday shopping season amid continued shortages of goods.
Given the partial lift from inflation, the surprise increase in retail sales reported by the Commerce Department on Friday did little to change economists' expectations that consumer spending probably stalled in the third quarter. Inflation-adjusted sales, which rose moderately last month, are what is included in the calculation of gross domestic product. 
""The solid retail sales report reflects both consumer resilience and escalating prices,"" said Sal Guatieri, a senior economist at BMO Capital Markets in Toronto. ""The main concern now is that supply-chain disruptions and microchip shortages appear to be spreading, limiting selection and tamping down goods demand."" 
Retail sales rose 0.7% last month. Data for August was revised higher to show retail sales increasing 0.9% instead of 0.7% as previously reported. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast retail sales would slip 0.2%. Consumer prices increased 0.4% on a monthly basis in September suggesting the so-called real retail sales rose 0.3% last month. 
An ongoing global shortage of microchips is forcing automakers to cut production, leading to a scarcity of inventory at showrooms, which is boosting prices. The semiconductor shortage has also impacted the supply of electronics and appliances. Congestion at ports because of a dearth of workers has also meant fewer goods on shelves heading into the holiday shopping season, limiting choice for buyers.
U.S. President Joe Biden on Wednesday announced that the Port of Los Angeles would join the Port of Long Beach, two of the country's busiest, in expanding round-the-clock operations to unload an estimated 500,000 containers on cargo ships offshore.
Spending shifted to goods from services over the course of the COVID-19 pandemic, straining supply chains. The rotation back to services, such as travel and dining out, has been slowed by a resurgence in coronavirus infections over the summer, driven by the Delta variant. 
Retail sales are mostly made up of goods, with services, including healthcare, education and hotel accommodation, making up the remaining portion of consumer spending. 
Economists expected consumers to start their holiday shopping early to avoid empty shelves, which would probably keep retail sales higher in October. Spending remains strong despite consumer sentiment shifting lower, thanks to strong household wealth and rising wages from a tightening labor market.
A survey from the University of Michigan on Friday showed consumer sentiment slipped further in early October because of the endless pandemic and the political wrangling in Washington over raising the federal government debt limit as well as more spending for infrastructure and social programs. 
""Strength this month and next could be a result of well-telegraphed supply shortages leading consumers to begin holiday-season shopping earlier than usual,"" said Veronica Clark, an economist at  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) in New York. ""This effect, as well as potentially binding supply limitations, could subsequently result in a drop in retail sales in November and December.""
Retailers are cautiously optimistic that shortages will not derail the holiday season.
""We have seen record imports this year and are confident that collectively we can work through these challenges to ensure a healthy and happy holiday season,"" said Matthew Shay, president of the National Retail Federation in Washington.
Stocks on Wall Street were trading higher. The dollar dipped against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices fell.

AUTO RECEIPTS RISE
In September, sales at auto dealerships rose 0.5% after decreasing 3.3% in August. With unit sales declining, the increase in receipts reflected higher prices. 
The average price of a new motor vehicle topped $45,000 for the first time ever in September, according to a report this week from Kelley Blue Book, a vehicle valuation and automotive research company in California.
Online retail sales rose 0.6%. Sales at clothing stores jumped 1.1%. More workers returned to offices after the Labor Day holiday and may have needed a new wardrobe after more than a year of working from home. Receipts at building material stores nudged up 0.1% and furniture outlets gained 0.2%. 
Sales at service stations surged 1.8% because of higher gasoline prices. There was also an increase in receipts at sporting goods, hobby, musical instrument and book stores. 
With coronavirus infections ebbing, the flow of traffic to restaurants and bars increased, lifting sales 0.3%. Restaurants and bars are the only services category in the retail sales report. Sales at electronics and appliance stores dropped 0.9%.
Excluding automobiles, gasoline, building materials and food services, retail sales rose 0.8% after increasing 2.6% in August. These so-called core retail sales correspond most closely with the consumer spending component of gross domestic product. 
Economists believe consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, was flat in the third quarter after a robust 12.0% annualized growth pace in the April-June period. Consumer spending growth estimates for the third quarter are mostly below a 2.0% rate.

That also suggests GDP growth braked sharply in the July-September quarter from the second-quarter's 6.7% pace. Growth estimates for the third quarter range from as low as a 1.3% rate to as high as a 4.0% pace. Some of the anticipated slowdown in growth reflects the fading stimulus from trillions of dollars in pandemic relief from the government.
""Inflation will take a major bite out of third-quarter real consumer spending growth,"" said Shannon Seery, an economist for  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) in Charlotte, North Carolina. ""The main challenge for the fourth quarter will be finding everything on the shopping list as the supply chain crisis worsens.""

Business inventories rose 0.6% after a similar gain in July, the Commerce Department said on Friday. Inventories are a key component of gross domestic product. August's increase was in line with economists' expectations.
Inventories increased 7.4% on a year-on-year basis in August. Retail inventories gained 0.1% in August as estimated in an advance report published last month. That followed a 0.4% rise in July. Motor vehicle inventories dropped 1.4% instead of 1.5% as estimated last month.
Retail inventories excluding autos, which go into the calculation of GDP, rose 0.6% as estimated last month.
Business inventories were depleted in the first half of the year, but shortages amid persistent supply bottlenecks because of the COVID-19 pandemic and congestion at ports in the United States and China are making it difficult to rebuild stocks. 
That has contributed to third-quarter GDP growth estimates being slashed to as low as a 1.3% annualized rate from as high as a 7% pace. The economy grew at a 6.7% pace in the second quarter.

The government's Insolvency Service said 1,446 companies registered for insolvency last month, up 56% from a year ago but still down 4% on September 2019.
Company insolvencies - including voluntary liquidations, administration and bankruptcies - fell sharply last year due to the COVID-19 pandemic, which caused big backlogs in courts. Some businesses that would have folded also received support from government programmes.
The bulk of the insolvencies in September comprised creditor voluntary liquidations.

""This suggests that directors are choosing to close their businesses after deeming their financial survival unlikely after 18 months of trading through a pandemic,"" said Nicky Fisher, deputy vice president of insolvency and restructuring trade body R3.
Individual insolvencies showed a similar pattern. While bankruptcies were still down compared with a year ago, debt relief orders - a form of insolvency for people with debts of less than 30,000 pounds ($41,000) - rose to their highest since around the start of lockdown.

BEIJING (Reuters) - China's energy crisis deepened on Friday as cold weather swept into much of the country and power plants scrambled to stock up on coal, sending prices of the fuel to record highs.
Electricity demand to heat homes and offices is expected to soar this week as strong cold winds move down from northern China. Forecasters predict average temperatures in some central and eastern regions could fall by as much as 16 degrees Celsius in the next 2-3 days.
Shortages of coal, high fuel prices and booming post-pandemic industrial demand have sparked widespread power shortages in the world's second-largest economy. Rationing has already been in place in at least 17 of mainland China's more than 30 regions since September, forcing some factories to suspend production and disrupting supply chains. 
The most-active January Zhengzhou thermal coal futures hit a record high of 1,669.40 yuan ($259.42) per tonne early on Friday. The contract has risen more than 200% year to date.
The three northeastern provinces of Jilin, Heilongjiang and Liaoning - among the worst hit by the power shortages last month - and several regions in northern China including Inner Mongolia and Gansu have started winter heating, which is mainly fuelled by coal, to cope with the colder-than-normal weather.
Beijing has taken a slew of measures to contain coal price rises including raising domestic coal output and cutting power to power-hungry industries and some factories during periods of peak demand. It has repeatedly assured users that energy supplies will be secured for the winter heating season. [B9N2QE019]
But power shortages are expected to continue into early next year, with analysts and traders forecasting a 12% drop in industrial power consumption in the fourth quarter as coal supplies fall short and local governments give priority to residential users. 
Graphic: China power rationing map - https://graphics.reuters.com/CHINA-POWER/jnvweyzazvw/chart.png 
Earlier this week, China in its boldest step in a decades-long power sector reform said it would allow coal-fired power prices to fluctuate by up to 20% from base levels from Oct. 15, enabling power plants to pass on more of the high costs of generation to commercial and industrial end-users.
Steel, aluminium, cement and chemical producers are expected to face higher and more volatile power costs under the new policy, pressuring profit margins. Data on Thursday showed factory-gate inflation in September hit a record high.

China aims to be ""carbon neutral"" by 2060 and Beijing has been trying to reduce its reliance on polluting coal power in favour of cleaner wind, solar and hydro. But coal is expected to provide the bulk of its electricity needs for some time.
China is not the only nation struggling with power supplies, which has led to fuel shortages and blackouts in some countries. The crisis has highlighted the difficulty in cutting the global economy's dependency on fossil fuels as world leaders seek to revive efforts to tackle climate change at talks next month in Glasgow.
China will strive to achieve carbon peaks by 2030, Vice Premier Han Zheng said in a video message at the Russian Energy Week International Forum, according to state-run news agency Xinhua late on Thursday.

He also said that China and Russia are important forces leading the energy transition and they should cooperate and ensure smooth progress of major oil and gas pipeline and nuclear power projects.

JAKARTA (Reuters) - Indonesia's September trade surplus was larger than expected as exports surged on the back of booming commodity prices, government data showed on Friday, cementing hopes for a quick economic recovery.
The resource-rich country booked a September trade surplus of $4.37 billion, data from the country's statistics bureau showed. That was above the median estimate of $3.84 billion, according to analysts polled earlier by Reuters. 
Indonesia recorded an all-time high surplus of $4.74 billion in August. It has posted a trade surplus every month since May 2020.
Analysts said robust exports should cushion the economic impact of Indonesia's devastating COVID-19 wave in the third quarter. 
The trade surplus would also help Southeast Asia's largest economy narrow its current account deficit, making its financial market less vulnerable to capital outflows and allowing the central bank to keep monetary policy accommodative for longer.
""The surplus is still large because of skyrocketing commodity prices, which is positive for our economy and the (U.S. dollar) liquidity outlook,"" said Fakhrul Fulvian, chief economist at Trimegah Sekuritas. 
""This means Bank Indonesia will keep interest rates steady next week,"" he added, referring to a central bank policy meeting scheduled to take place from Monday to Tuesday. 
Bank Indonesia is expected to keep its main policy rates unchanged until the third quarter of 2022, according to a new Reuters poll.
September exports grew 47.64% to $20.60 billion from a year earlier, compared with the poll's 51.57% growth forecast. 

Shipments of coal and copper remained strong, each rising more than 160%, while overseas sales of palm oil products, steel and oil and gas also registered high growth. 
September imports rose 40.31% to $16.23 billion, versus the poll's 50% forecast, with consumer goods imports surging nearly 60%.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits dropped below 300,000 last week for the first time in 19 months, further evidence that a shortage of workers was behind slower job growth rather than weakening demand for labor.
With the second straight weekly decline reported by the Labor Department on Thursday, initial claims are now in the zone that is generally associated with healthy labor market conditions. But the labor market faces challenges from shortages of workers and raw materials, which are fueling inflation.
""The data support the narrative that businesses are increasingly reluctant to let go of workers amid a severe supply shortage,"" said Rubeela Farooqi, chief U.S. economist at High Frequency Economics in White Plains, New York. ""But it is still not clear if the expected supply surge that failed to materialize in August and September will appear going forward.""
Initial claims for state unemployment benefits dropped 36,000 to a seasonally adjusted 293,000 for the week ended Oct. 9. That was lowest level since mid-March 2020, when the nation was in the early stage of the COVID-19 pandemic. 
There were decreases in unadjusted claims in Florida, Texas and Tennessee. Applications increased in California, Kentucky, Maryland, Missouri and Michigan. Part of the rise in Michigan was likely due to the idling of assembly lines by some motor vehicle manufacturers because of a global chip shortage. 
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast 319,000 claims for the latest week. The drop last week was the biggest since late June. A 250,000-300,000 range for claims is seen as consistent with a healthy labor market. Claims have declined from a record high of 6.149 million in early April 2020. 
The government reported last Friday that nonfarm payrolls increased by only 194,000 jobs in September, the fewest in nine months. The cooling in employment growth is mostly due to a dearth of workers as well as a skills mismatch, with government data on Tuesday showing there were 10.4 million job openings at the end of August.
Stocks on Wall Street were trading higher. The dollar fell against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices were mixed.

SHRINKING UNEMPLOYMENT ROLLS
More people are coming off the state unemployment rolls, indicating strong demand for labor. The number of people continuing to receive benefits after an initial week of aid plunged 134,000 to 2.593 million in the week ended Oct. 2, also the lowest level since mid-March 2020.
The total number of people collecting unemployment checks under all programs dropped 523,426 to 3.649 million during the week ended Sept. 25. That reflected the lapse of federal government-funded unemployment benefits last month.
Labor shortages, caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, are also prevalent in other advanced economies, clogging the supply chains. There is hope that more Americans will rejoin the labor force, with coronavirus infections driven by the Delta variant declining, schools fully reopened for in-person learning and expanded benefits expired.
But amid increased self employment and massive savings as well as early retirements, thanks to a strong stock market and record house price gains, the labor pool could remain shallow for a while. Labor shortages are snarling the supply chain because there are fewer workers to produce raw materials and goods as well as shipping them to markets, fanning inflation.
In another report on Thursday, the Labor Department said its producer price index for final demand rose 0.5% in September, the smallest gain in nine months, after increasing 0.7% in August. Economists had forecast the PPI gaining 0.6%. 
Graphic: Inflation: https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-STOCKS/zjvqkewdzvx/inflation.png 
A 1.3% jump in prices of goods accounted for nearly 80% of the increase in the PPI. Goods prices, which advanced 1.0% in August, were boosted by energy products like gasoline, residential electricity and gas fuels. 
The price of Brent crude has shot above $80 a barrel. Electric and natural gas prices have also risen, indicating that energy costs could remain elevated.
Wholesale food prices rose 2.0%, lifted by beef. Services gained 0.2% as an 11.6% jump in margins for fuels and lubricants retailing was partially offset by a 16.9% plunge in airline tickets. There were also increases in the wholesale prices of machinery and equipment, motor vehicles and parts as well as truck transportation of freight.
In the 12 months through September, the PPI accelerated 8.6%, the largest year-on-year advance since November 2010 when the series was revamped, after surging 8.3% in August.
The report followed on the heels of news on Wednesday of a solid increase in consumer prices in September, driven by strong gains in food and rents as well as a range of other goods.
Minutes of the Federal Reserve's Sept. 21-22 policy meeting published on Wednesday showed some U.S. central bank officials ""expressed concerns that elevated rates of inflation could feed through into longer-term inflation expectations of households and businesses.""
But producer inflation could be nearing its peak. Excluding the volatile food, energy and trade services components, producer prices nudged up 0.1% last month after gaining 0.3% in August. In the 12 months through September, the core PPI increased 5.9% after accelerating 6.3% in August. 

Healthcare costs rose 0.2% and portfolio management fees jumped 1.2%. Airfares, healthcare and portfolio fees feed into the core personal consumption expenditures price index, the Fed's preferred inflation measure for its flexible 2% target. With the CPI and PPI data in hand, economists are estimating that the core PCE price index rose 0.1% in September, which would keep the year-on-year increase at 3.6%.
""There's no question producers are struggling with supply chain issues and labor shortages, so it's way too early to call the relatively low increases in core PPI a harbinger of a new trend,"" said Will Compernolle, a senior economist at FHN Financial in New York.

The producer price index for final demand increased 0.5% from the prior month and 8.6% from a year earlier, Labor Department data showed Thursday. Excluding volatile food and energy components, the so-called core PPI rose 0.2% and was up 6.8% from a year ago.
The median forecasts in a Bloomberg survey of economists called for a 0.6% month-over-month advance in the overall PPI and an 8.7% gain in the core figure.
The PPI has climbed steadily this year as interruptions in supply networks and constraints that include shortages of materials and labor, drive up production costs. Firms have passed along at least some of those costs to their customers, which explains a recent acceleration in consumer prices. 
A separate report Wednesday showed prices paid by consumers rose in September by more than forecast, posting the largest annual gain since 2008.
Countries around the world are experiencing higher inflation. In China, the world’s largest exporter, a gauge prices paid to factories rose last month by the most since 1975.
Recent U.S. inflation data reinforce the Federal Reserve’s plan to soon start pulling back monetary support, especially as bottlenecks show little signs of abating. Minutes from last month’s Fed policy meeting showed that officials assessed that if the economic recovery remains on track, “a gradual tapering process that concluded around the middle of next year would likely be appropriate.”

Initial unemployment claims in regular state programs totaled 293,000 in the week ended Oct. 9, a decrease of 36,000 from the prior week, Labor Department data showed Thursday. The median estimate in a Bloomberg survey of economists called for a slight decrease to 320,000 applications.
Continuing claims for state benefits dropped to 2.6 million in the week ended Oct. 2.
Claims have marched lower as the economy recovers, boosting demand for labor to keep up with consumers. The latest surge of coronavirus cases hasn’t led to widespread layoffs as firms look to hire more workers and retain those they already have.
Still, September was the slowest month of job growth this year in the U.S. as the end of pandemic unemployment benefits and back-to-school didn’t lead to a sizable increase in hiring. That, along with lingering supply-chain issues, has led several economists to cut their forecasts for third-quarter growth, which is reported later this month.
The dearth of childcare has proved to be a major hurdle as the number of women on payrolls fell last month for the first time since December 2020.

The producer price index (PPI) rose 10.7% from a year earlier in September, the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) said on Thursday, the biggest rise since the bureau started compiling the data in 1996. Economists in a Reuters poll had expected a 10.5% rise, after a 9.5% increase in August. 
Producer prices have risen due to output curbs caused by a power crunch at a home and a months-long global commodity price rally. But Chinese businesses have been reluctant to pass on the higher costs to local customers due to already soft orders. 
Data on Thursday showed consumer inflation eased last month, weighed by weak demand for goods from clothing to household appliances, as well as a decline in volatile food prices. 
Tang Jianwei, chief macroeconomics analyst at BOCOM, said China's mixed inflation picture posed a dilemma for the country's monetary authorities. 
""On one side, the relatively weak domestic demand requires a certain degree of easing to support a recovery in demand and on the other side, record high PPI restricts the room of easing,"" said Tang Jianwei, chief macroeconomics analyst at BOCOM.
Underpinning producer prices, global commodity prices surged in recent months driven by increased demand for coal and metals as economies around the world reopened after being shut due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Labour shortages and transportation bottlenecks have also lifted prices globally.
Adding to the price pressures in China, widespread power cuts in September disrupted output across the cement, steel，and aluminum industries, and even halted production at numerous factories including many supplying big global brands such as Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). China's power crunch has stemmed from a coal shortage amid efforts to meet decarbonisation goals and record prices of the fuel. 
Prices rose in 36 out of 40 industrial sectors last month, up from 32 sectors in August, the data showed. Prices in mining and coal jumped 74.9%, up sharply from August's 57.1% rise.
But the consumer price index rose 0.7% year-on-year in September, slowing from a 0.8% increase in August and below a forecast for a 0.9% rise in the Reuters poll.
""Bottlenecks in the supply side continue to exist and the demand was weak so producers cannot pass through the costs. This is a painful process the Chinese economy has to go through,"" said Zhou Hao, senior EM economist at Commerzbank (DE:CBKG).
China's economic growth is expected to slow to 5.2% year-on-year in the third quarter from 7.9% in April-June, a recent Reuters poll showed.
MEASURES 
Rising price pressures come even as Beijing has taken a raft of measures to curb record-high coal prices and ease the country's power crunch, including urging coal miners to boost output and manage electricity demand at industrial plants.
The government said last week that it will allow coal-fired power prices to fluctuate by up to 20% from base levels, a loosening of previous limits. 
ANZ expect the move to boost the headline PPI by 2 percentage points in the near term, while the impact on CPI will be a mere 0.5 percentage point. 
Tang said the chances of an interest rate cut or a reduction in banks' reserve requirements this year were low, adding authorities would likely keep interbank liquidity reasonably ample through structural adjustments instead. 
The People's Bank of China has kept its benchmark rate for corporate and household loans unchanged for 17 months, while it last lowered the reserve requirements in mid-July.

Core inflation, which strips out volatile food and energy prices, reached 1.2% in September, unchanged from August. 
However, in a sign that consumer inflation is not indefinitely immune to broader price pressures, Foshan Haitian, China' largest manufacturer of soy sauce, said this week it plans to raise prices by as much as 7% from Oct. 25 due to rising costs for raw materials, transportation and energy.

SYDNEY (Reuters) -Australian employment fell sharply for a second month in September as coronavirus lockdowns forced firms to lay off workers, while the jobless rate was held down by another big drop in the number of people looking for work.
Policy makers are counting on a recovery in coming months as rapid progress in vaccinations has allowed restrictions to ease in Sydney, with Melbourne and Canberra soon to follow.
Relief was sorely needed with Thursday's data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) showing employment fell by 138,000 in September, on top of a 146,100 drop in August.
The jobless rate edged up to 4.6%, from 4.5%, but has been artificially held down by the restrictions which prevent people looking for work and being counted as unemployed.
""The low national unemployment rate continues to reflect reduced participation during the recent lockdowns, rather than strong labour market conditions,"" said Bjorn Jarvis, head of labour statistics at the ABS.
The participation rate fell 0.7 percentage point in September to 64.5%, a long way from a record high of 66.2% hit in June. As this shift unwinds, the unemployment rate could well rise in the next few months even as employment recovers.
The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) has cautioned that unemployment will likely top 5% by year end, though it is optimistic activity will pick up quickly as the lockdowns ease.
The central bank still believes the jobless rate will need to get down to 4% or lower to drive a sustained, and much needed, lift in wages and inflation.
Speaking on Thursday, RBA Deputy Governor Guy Debelle noted that while the labour market had enjoyed a strong recovery ahead of the lockdowns, wages remained stubbornly subdued with very few workers getting annual rises over 2%.
The RBA has long argued pay growth above 3% was needed to get inflation into its 2-3% target band, after years of undershooting.

Debelle said the lack of a pick up in wages and inflation meant Australia did not have to follow some other developed nations in paring back policy stimulus.
Markets have recently started to wager the RBA might hike interest rates late next year, while the bank itself continues to say a move is unlikely until 2024.

The Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors said its house price balance fell to +68 in September from a downwardly revised +72 in August, matching economists' forecasts in a Reuters poll.
Britain's housing market, like those in many other big economies, has boomed over the past year as the COVID-19 pandemic led to increased demand for properties with more space.
British house prices got an extra boost from a tax break on property purchases which expired at the start of this month. 
Mortgage lender Halifax reported last week that prices in September were 7.4% up on the year, including a hefty 1.7% monthly jump, the largest since 2007.
RICS said its members thought prices rises would slow over the next few months. But there was an unusually broad consensus that prices and rents would rise further over the year to come, as fewer homes and rental properties come on to the market.

""Both price and rent expectations (are) close to series highs pointing to greater pressure on affordability at a time when money markets are sensing interest rate increases coming sooner rather than later,"" RICS's chief economist, Simon Rubinsohn, said.
Investors expect the Bank of England to start raising its main interest rate from a record-low 0.1% before the end of the year.

1195,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 13, 2021 05:42PM ET</span>","Higher inflation squeezing U.S. consumers as food prices, rents accelerate","By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. consumer prices increased solidly in September as Americans paid more for food, rent and a range of other goods, putting pressure on the Biden administration to urgently resolve strained supply chains, which are hampering economic growth. 
With prices likely to rise further in the months ahead following a recent surge in the costs of energy products, the report from the Labor Department on Wednesday could test Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's repeated assertion that high inflation is transitory. Powell and the White House have blamed supply chain bottlenecks for the high inflation. 
Supply chains have been gummed up by robust demand as economies emerge from the COVID-19 pandemic, thanks to more than $10 trillion in global economic stimulus, about half of it in the United States. The coronavirus pandemic has caused a global shortage of workers needed to produce raw materials and move goods from factories to consumers. 
President Joe Biden on Wednesday announced https://www.reuters.com/world/us/biden-cite-progress-unsnarling-supply-chain-meeting-with-labor-industry-2021-10-13 that the Port of Los Angeles would start operating around the clock, following the Port of Long Beach's lead, to ease congestion. Retailers like Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc as well as shipping companies FedEx Corp (NYSE:FDX) and UPS also agreed to move goods 24 hours a day and seven days a week.
""Inflation is no longer 'transitory,'"" said Sung Won Sohn, professor of finance and economics at Loyola Marymount University in Los Angeles. ""Supply-chain bottlenecks are getting worse. The logjam is unlikely to ease anytime soon despite the latest intervention by the White House."" 
The consumer price index rose 0.4% last month after climbing 0.3% in August. Food prices jumped 0.9% after increasing 0.4% in the prior month. The largest rise in food prices since April 2020 was driven by a surge in the cost of meat. 
Owners' equivalent rent of primary residence, which is what a homeowner would receive from renting a home, increased 0.4%. That was the biggest gain in five years and followed a 0.3% rise in August. Rent of primary residence shot up 0.5%, the largest advance since May 2001. 
Rents are rising as demand for housing in cities rebounds after a pandemic-induced exodus to suburbs and other low-density locations. Economists expect rents, which account for nearly a third of the CPI, will be a major source of inflation in the months ahead.
""If shelter prices continue to pick up steam, it could mean higher inflation is more baked in than originally thought,"" said Will Compernolle, senior economist at FHN Financial in New York.
Food and rents accounted for more than half of the increase in the CPI. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the overall CPI would rise 0.3%.
In the 12 months through September, the CPI increased 5.4% after advancing 5.3% on a year-on-year basis in August.
Though gasoline prices rose moderately relative to August, prices at the pump have accelerated after the price of Brent crude shot above $80 a barrel. Natural gas prices have also surged.
Major U.S. stock indexes closed higher. The dollar fell against a basket of currencies. Yields on the two-year Treasury note, which is sensitive to changes in interest rates, rose.
NEW CARS MORE EXPENSIVE
Excluding the volatile food and energy components, the CPI climbed 0.2% after edging up 0.1% in August. In addition to rents, the co-called core CPI was lifted by a 1.3% increase in the cost of new motor vehicles, which marked the fifth straight month of gains above 1%.
A global semiconductor shortage has forced auto manufacturers to cut production. The average price of a new motor vehicle topped $45,000 for the first time ever in September, according to Kelley Blue Book, a vehicle valuation and automotive research company in California.
There were also increases in the prices of household furnishings and operations, with furniture and bedding posting the biggest gain since March 1988. Consumers also paid more for motor vehicle insurance.
Though prices for airline fares and used cars and trucks fell, economists expected a rebound, noting that air travel was picking up as infections driven by the Delta variant of the coronavirus subside. Auction data pointed to rising prices for used motor vehicles.
The so-called core CPI rose 4.0% on a year-on-year basis last month, matching the gain in August.
Accelerating wage growth is also exerting upward pressure on inflation. The government reported last week that average hourly earnings increased by the most in seven months on a year-on-year basis in September because of worker shortages. 
With the number of people voluntarily quitting their jobs hitting a record high https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-job-openings-fall-still-high-104-million-august-2021-10-12 in August and at least 10.4 million unfilled positions, wage inflation is set to rise further.
Minutes of the Fed's Sept. 21-22 policy meeting, which were released on Wednesday, showed some U.S. central bank officials ""expressed concerns that elevated rates of inflation could feed through into longer-term inflation expectations of households.""
Fed officials signaled https://www.reuters.com/business/patient-or-aggressive-fed-policymakers-split-inflation-response-2021-10-13 they could start reducing the central bank's massive bond-buying program in mid-November, the minutes showed.
Strong inflation, if persistent, could force the Fed to increase interest rates.
""Stickier more persistent factors are becoming more prevalent, which the Fed is more likely to respond to,"" said Michelle Meyer, chief U.S. economist at Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) Securities in New York.
The Fed's preferred inflation measure for its flexible 2% target, the core personal consumption expenditures price index, increased 3.6% in the 12 months through August, rising by the same margin for a third straight month. 

September's data is due later this month. The Fed last month upgraded its core PCE inflation projection for this year to 3.7% from the 3.0% it projected in June.
Rising inflation, which is eroding consumers' purchasing power, and supply constraints led economists to anticipate that economic growth braked to below a 3% annualized rate in the third quarter. The economy grew at a 6.7% pace in the April-June quarter.

1196,By Bloomberg,"<span>Oct 13, 2021 08:36AM ET</span>",U.S. Consumer Prices Outpace Forecast as Inflation Dogs Economy,"(Bloomberg) -- Prices paid by U.S. consumers rose in September by more than forecast, resuming a faster pace of growth and underscoring the persistence of inflationary pressures in the economy.
The consumer price index increased 0.4% from August, according to Labor Department data released Wednesday. Compared with a year ago, the CPI rose 5.4%, matching the largest annual gain since 2008. Excluding the volatile food and energy components, so-called core inflation rose 0.2% from the prior month.
The median estimate in a Bloomberg survey of economists called for a 0.3% monthly gain in the overall measure and a 0.2% advance in the core rate.
A combination of unprecedented shipping challenges, materials shortages, high commodities prices and rising wages have sharply driven up costs for producers. Many have passed some portion of those costs along to consumers, leading to more persistent inflation than many economists -- including those at the Federal Reserve -- had originally anticipated.
The pickup in price growth seen last month reflected higher food and shelter costs. Meantime, measures of used cars and trucks, apparel and airfares cooled.
The report will likely reinforce the Fed’s inclination to soon start tapering its asset purchases, especially as the supply-chain challenges plaguing businesses show little signs of abating. Minutes from last month’s Federal Open Market Committee meeting -- out Wednesday afternoon -- will provide further insight on policy makers’ views toward progress on employment and inflation goals for tapering.
A New York Fed survey out Tuesday showed U.S. consumers’ expectations for inflation continued to rise in September, with 1-year and 3-year expectations accelerating to record highs.

1197,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 13, 2021 07:42AM ET</span>","UK economy picks up in August, underpinning BoE rate hike bets","By David Milliken and William Schomberg
LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's economy returned to growth in August after contracting for the first time in six months in July, keeping intact financial market bets that the Bank of England will begin raising interest rates before the end of the year.
Gross domestic product grew by 0.4% in August - a shade under market expectations in a Reuters poll of economists - after it was revised down to show a drop of 0.1% in July when staff absences linked to the Delta variant of COVID-19 peaked.
""The economy picked up in August as bars, restaurants and festivals benefited from the first full month without COVID-19 restrictions in England,"" Darren Morgan, director of economic statistics at the Office for National Statistics, said.
Financial markets were little changed after the data, which showed a mixed picture on the impact of supply chain difficulties that have pushed up inflation and hurt growth.
The BoE, facing a jump in inflation, looks set to be the first major central bank to raise interest rates since the start of the pandemic. Investors are betting on a rise to 0.25% by the end of December, up from its all-time low of 0.1%.
After the latest official data, Britain's economy is now within 0.8% of its pre-pandemic size - a much smaller gap than when the last monthly figures were released thanks to upward revisions to output growth earlier in the year.
Still, the economy remains around 5% smaller than if growth had continued on its 2010-2019 trajectory uninterrupted by the pandemic - unlike the United States which had almost closed that gap as of the second quarter of 2021. 
GRAPHIC-UK GDP remains almost 5% below pre-COVID trend https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/polling/lgvdwllodpo/Pasted%20image%201634122592331.png 
Britain's economy shrank by 9.7% in 2020, its joint-biggest drop in 300 years and matching the annual decline in 1921, when the economy was still reeling from the cost of World War One.
The International Monetary Fund forecast on Tuesday that Britain was on track to have the fastest expansion of any country in the G7 group of rich nations, growing by 6.8% this year, although the outsize scale of last year's slump means it will still take longer to recover than most of its peers.
SLOWING REBOUND
Britain's economy expanded rapidly in the first half of 2021 helped by the fast initial roll-out of COVID-19 vaccines. 
But this has slowed due to a wave of coronavirus cases and global supply chain chaos which in Britain has been exacerbated by new post-Brexit restrictions on trade and immigration.
Growth in the three months to August slowed to its weakest since April at 2.9%.
Chip shortages which had hampered carmakers eased in August, the ONS said, helping manufacturing return to growth, but car output was still more than 14% below a peak in February.
Supply-chain shortages were most visible in construction, where output fell for a second month in a row due to rising costs and shortages of steel, concrete, timber and glass.
The economy is also likely to have taken a further hit in September from temporary shortages of fuel at many petrol stations in England - caused by a lack of tanker drivers - and the impact of a surge in natural gas prices.
Samuel Tombs, economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said expectations that the BoE would act imminently looked misplaced.
""The continuation of modest GDP growth in August should convince the MPC that the economy does not need to be cooled immediately by raising interest rates,"" he said.
GDP would need to grow by an implausible 2.2% in September for it to match the BoE's forecast in August for growth of 2.1% in the third quarter as a whole, he added.
Separate data from the ONS suggested the impact of Brexit on trade between Britain and the European Union was easing.

Imports of goods from EU countries remained lower than those from non-EU countries for an eighth month in a row but the gap was the narrowest since Britain left the bloc's single market on Jan. 1. 
The data showed a similar picture for British goods exports to the EU, the ONS said.

1198,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 13, 2021 06:26AM ET</span>",China's Sept exports surprisingly robust despite power crunch,"By Stella Qiu and Gabriel Crossley
BEIJING (Reuters) - China's export growth unexpectedly accelerated in September, as still solid global demand offset some of the pressures on factories from power shortages, supply bottlenecks and a resurgence of domestic COVID-19 cases.
The world's second-largest economy has staged an impressive rebound from the pandemic but there are signs the recovery is losing steam. Resilient exports could provide a buffer against growing headwinds including weakening factory activity, persistently soft consumption and a slowing property sector. 
Outbound shipments in September jumped 28.1% from a year earlier, up from a 25.6% gain in August. Analysts polled by Reuters had forecast growth would ease to 21%. 
""Exports have continued to outperform and accelerate, even after omitting the impact of base effects,"" said Erin Xin, Greater China economist at HSBC, adding that earlier shipments of holiday consumer products in light of global supply chain disruptions may be behind the continued strength in exports.
Other analysts said power rationing in September may not have affected exports yet, but could constrain production and inflate costs for Chinese manufacturers in the months to come. 
Power shortages caused by a transition to clean energy, strong industrial demand, and high commodity prices have halted production at numerous factories including many supplying firms such as Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) since late September. 
Factories in eastern provinces of Guangdong and Zhejiang, both major export powerhouses, have been asked to stagger their production throughout the week, and many owners are complaining about the chaos the curbs have brought to work schedules.
Previously, factories could operate at night but now the ban is 24 hours on days of rationing, said King Lau, who helps manage a metal-coating factory in the export city of Dongguan. The factory was asked to stop using government electricity on three working days this week.
However, Louis Kuijs, head of Asia economics at Oxford Economics is optimistic the export outlook in the coming quarters remains solid, despite near-term headwinds. 
""We generally expect these disruptions to ease over the coming months, as we expect senior policymakers to stress growth and to call for the pursuit of climate targets on a more measured timeline.""
""Further out, we think exports should be underpinned by the ongoing global economic recovery and a gradual easing of global supply-chain disruptions next year.""
Recent data has pointed to a slowdown in production activity. China's manufacturing PMI unexpectedly shrank in September as industrial firms battled with rising costs and electricity rationing.
Furthermore, the property sector, a key driver of growth, is reeling from the increasing defaults of Chinese developers, with real estate sales tumbling and new construction starts slowing. 
Reuters latest poll shows analysts have lowered their expectations for China's full-year growth to 8.2% from 8.6% seen in July, with a further slowdown to 5.5% in 2022. On a quarterly bsis, growth in the third quarter might have cooled to just 0.5% from 1.3% in April-June.[ECILT/CN]
But analysts said concerns over high debt levels and property bubble risks may delay any further central bank policy easing into next year.
Many analysts are expecting the central bank to inject more stimulus by cutting the amount of cash banks must hold as reserves to help small and medium-sized enterprises.
IMPORTS SLOW
China's September imports rose 17.6%, lagging an expected 20% gain in a Reuters poll and 33.1% growth the previous month. 
""The breakdown showed a broad-based decline across all good types, though it was particularly pronounced for inbound shipments of semiconductors,"" said Julian Evans-Pritchard, senior China economist at Capital Economics.
""Lower import volumes of industrial metals add to evidence that environmental curbs and cooling construction activity are weighing on heavy industry.""
However, China's energy demand is rapidly rising. 
Coal imports in September rose to the highest this year as power plants scrambled for fuel to boost electricity generation to ease the power crunch and replenish inventories ahead of the winter heating season.
Natural gas imports in September also rose to their highest since January this year.

China posted a trade surplus of $66.76 billion in September, versus the poll's forecast for a $46.8 billion surplus and $58.34 billion surplus in August.
Its trade surplus with the United States rose to $42 billion, Reuters calculations based on the customs data showed, up from $37.68 billion in August.

1203,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 12, 2021 09:35PM ET</span>","Japan August machinery orders fall, miss expectations","By Kantaro Komiya
TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's core machinery orders unexpectedly fell in August, underlining persistent pressure on businesses and the broader economy as firms struggle to shake off the drag from the coronavirus pandemic.
The Cabinet Office data on Wednesday showed core orders, a highly volatile data series regarded as an indicator of capital spending in the coming six to nine months, fell 2.4% in August from the previous month, dragged down by the biggest decline in orders from manufacturers in more than five years.
The contraction compared with July's 0.9% rise, while a Reuters poll of economists had predicted 1.7% growth.
In comments accompanying the data, the government downgraded its assessment on machinery orders for the first time in six months, saying a recovery in the series appeared to be stalling.
""The picture has been 'solid manufacturers and weak non-manufacturers' so far, but the gap is narrowing,"" Masato Koike, an economist at Dai-ichi Life Research Institute said.
The export-oriented manufacturing sector faces headwinds ranging from a global economic slowdown to supply chain bottlenecks, while service-oriented non-manufacturers have a clearer path to recovery as the domestic COVID-19 situation improves, Koike added.
The orders data came about a week after the inauguration of new Prime Minister Fumio Kishida, after his predecessor Yoshihide Suga saw his support undermined by surging coronavirus infections and protracted restrictions.
While Japanese firms have so far provided momentum to the economy's recovery through solid output, exports and capital expenditure, the outlook points to a bumpy ride.
Manufacturers' sentiment dropped to a six-month low in October due to an enduring supply shortage and soaring material costs, the Reuters Tankan showed on Wednesday.
Following an annualised 1.9% gross-domestic product (GDP) growth in the second quarter, analysts forecast a smaller gain in Japan's July-September GDP, indicating sluggish - if not shrinking - private consumption.
By sector, manufacturers' orders declined 13.4% month-on-month in August, marking the first decline in five months, due to by weaker demand from sectors such as electronic machines, production machines and shipmakers. It was the biggest fall since February 2016.
Orders from non-manufacturers increased 7.1% after a 9.5% dip in July, led by demands from wholesale and retail sellers and logistics companies.
External orders, which are not counted as core orders, fell 14.7%, slipping after 24.1% growth in the previous month.
""The results were weaker ... but it didn't indicate machinery orders will extend declines ahead,"" said Shintaro Inagaki, senior market economist at Mizuho Securities.

""Concerns like the chip shortage and recent commodity price inflation are not something that continue long-term, but they are likely to be dispelled by next spring.""
Compared with a year earlier, core orders, which exclude those for ships and electric utilities, expanded 17.0% in August, the data showed, reflecting a double-digit decline in the same month in 2020. Economists polled by Reuters had predicted a 14.7% jump.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The number of Americans voluntarily quitting their jobs surged to a record high in August and there were more than 10 million vacancies, pointing to a tightening labor market that could help to keep inflation high as companies raise wages to lure workers. 
The Labor Department's monthly Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey, or JOLTS report, on Tuesday was another reflection of an economy that is battling labor and raw material shortages in nearly every industry, which are crimping growth.
""There are help-wanted posters in every shop window on Main Street, and the lack of workers is exacerbating the supply disruptions throughout the nation that is lighting a match to the fire of inflation,"" said Christopher Rupkey, chief economist at FWDBONDS in New York. ""The labor market has already recovered.""
Quits increased by about 242,000 in August, lifting the total to a record 4.3 million. There were 157,000 people who quit in the accommodation and food services industry while 26,000 left in the wholesale trade business. State and local government education saw 25,000 departures.  
Are you being served? https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-ECONOMY/dwpkradmzvm/chart_eikon.jpg 
People are most likely leaving their jobs for fear of contracting COVID-19. The number of quits increased in the South and Midwest regions, which have borne the brunt of the summer wave of coronavirus infections driven by the Delta variant. 
Vaccinations rates are low in the South and Midwest and some states like Florida and Texas have banned mask mandates.
The quits rate shot up to an all-time high of 2.9% in August from 2.7% in July. The quits rate is normally viewed by policymakers and economists as a measure of job market confidence. The higher quits rate suggests wage inflation will likely continue to build up as companies scramble for workers, who have unlimited choice. 
""These readings are also consistent with strong demand for labor, with people feeling confident in their abilities to get new jobs and not many layoffs taking place,"" said Daniel Silver, an economist at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) in New York.
Inflation is way above the Federal Reserve's flexible 2% target, while gross domestic product growth estimates for the third quarter are mostly below a 3% annualized rate. The economy grew at a 6.7% pace in the second quarter.
Stocks on Wall Street were weaker on worries over the impact of inflation on upcoming third-quarter earnings. The dollar rose against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices were mixed.
STRONG LABOR DEMAND 
Though employment remains 5 million jobs below its peak in February 2020, economists believe that number probably is not a true reflection of the labor market's health as the shortfall includes people who have retired. 
Job openings, a measure of labor demand, dropped 659,000 to a still-high 10.4 million on the last day of August. Data for July was revised to show 11.1 million unfilled jobs instead of the previously reported 10.9 million. 
Despite August's decline, which economists attributed to the coronavirus infections over summer hampering activity in the consumer-facing services industries, vacancies were the second- highest on record and were 49% above their pre-pandemic level. There were 0.8 people per job opening in August.
""The JOLTS report continues to suggest that the labor market isn't as loose as the current 5 million jobs shortfall would indicate,"" said Lydia Boussour, lead U.S. economist at Oxford Economics in New York. 
JOLTS https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-STOCKS/akpezaqrdvr/jolts.png 
There were 224,000 fewer vacancies in the healthcare and social assistance sector. Job openings in the accommodation and food services industry fell by 178,000. States and local government education vacancies dropped by 124,000 positions.
Regionally, job openings fell in the Northeast and Midwest. The job openings rate dropped to 6.6% from 7% in July.
The government reported last Friday that nonfarm payrolls increased by only 194,000 in September, the smallest gain since December 2020, after increasing 366,000 in August.
The scarcity of workers was underscored by a separate survey from the NFIB on Tuesday showing 51% of small business owners reported job openings they could not fill in September, a record high reading for the third straight month.
Hiring decreased by 439,000 jobs to 6.3 million in August. The largest decline since December 2020 was led by the accommodation and food services industry, where payrolls dropped by 240,000 jobs. Hiring at state and local government education declined by 160,000 jobs. 
The decrease in hiring was more pronounced in the Midwest region. The hiring rate fell to 4.3% from 4.6% in July.
With COVID-19 infections declining and schools fully reopened for in-person learning, there is hope that more people will rejoin the labor force. The labor squeeze could also ease in the months ahead following the expiration of federal government-funded benefits in early September.

Businesses and Republicans blamed these expanded benefits for the record job openings. But amid increased self employment and all-time high savings as well as early retirements, thanks to a strong stock market and record house price gains, the labor pool could remain shallow for a while.
""Longer-term issues remain as many people who worked in low- paying jobs with variable hours, particularly in leisure/hospitality, may be unwilling to go back to these types of positions,"" said Sophia Koropeckyj, a senior economist at Moody's (NYSE:MCO) Analytics in West Chester, Pennsylvania.

LONDON (Reuters) -British employers increased their payrolls to a record high in September, shortly before the end of the government's wage subsidies scheme, potentially encouraging the Bank of England's progress towards a first post-pandemic interest rate hike.
The number of workers on companies' books rose by the most on record in data going back to 2014, up by 207,000 from August.
Employers turned to recruitment agencies to find staff and hotel and food firms created jobs as they recovered from COVID-19 lockdowns.
Separate official data published on Tuesday showed the unemployment rate edged down to 4.5% in the three months to August from 4.6% in the May-July period, as expected by economists in a Reuters poll.
The BoE is gearing up to become the first major central bank to raise rates since the coronavirus crisis struck. Inflation is heading towards 4% or higher -- above its 2% target. 
But the BoE is watching to see how many people became unemployed after the end of the furlough programme that subsidised wages to keep people employed during the pandemic.
About 1 million people are likely to have been on the scheme when it ended on Sept. 30, according to an estimate by the Resolution Foundation think tank.
Hussain Mehdi, macro and investment strategist at HSBC Asset Management, said the data left open the possibility of a BoE rate increase before the end of the year.
""A decent October jobs report could open the door to a hike as soon as the December meeting,"" he said. 
The BoE is also monitoring pay growth as it tries to gauge how persistent a recent jump in inflation is likely to be.
Average weekly earnings in the June-August period were 7.2% higher than in the same three months of 2020, slowing from the previous reading of 8.3%.
Excluding bonuses, earnings rose by 6.0%, also losing some momentum.
The ONS estimated the underlying pace of wage growth, taking into account how job losses during the lockdowns affected predominantly lower-paid workers, was between 4.1% and 5.6% for regular pay in nominal terms.
That compared with regular pay growth of about 3% just before the pandemic hit.
SHORTAGE OF JOB CANDIDATES
A record-high level of vacancies pointed to a shortage of candidates for jobs after the pandemic and Britain's post-Brexit controls on workers from the European Union which has made it harder for some employers to find staff. A shortage of fuel tanker drivers led to the supply of petrol and diesel being disrupted this month. 
But there were still signs of caution on the part of employers, who hired many more part-time workers than full-time staff in the three months to August.

The Resolution Foundation said the widest measure of economic activity – hours worked – remained 2.7% down on pre-pandemic levels, but the gap was likely to be closed in next month's data.
""Though wage growth looks almost unbelievably strong right now, there are big questions over whether it will remain strong enough over the coming months to prevent real wages from falling this winter,"" said Nye Cominetti, a Resolution Foundation economist.

1207,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 12, 2021 03:40AM ET</span>",Chip shortage and power crunch hit China auto sales in 'Golden September',"BEIJING (Reuters) - China's auto sales slumped 19.6% in September from a year earlier, industry data showed on Tuesday, falling for a fifth consecutive month as a prolonged global shortage of semiconductors and a domestic power crunch disrupt production.
This time of year, known as ""Golden September, Silver October"", is usually a high point in sales for the industry, with consumers making purchases after staying away from showrooms during the stifling summer months.
Sales in the world's biggest car market totalled 2.07 million vehicles in September, data from the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers (CAAM) showed. 
The sales drop was due to the domestic power crunch caused partly by the shortage of coal and prolonged global chip shortage that has forced many major automakers to idle or curtail production, said Chen Shihua, a senior official at CAAM.
He added that the chip supply shortage eased in China last month and that the industry body now expects the supply to improve further in the final three months this year but constraints would remain.
One bright spot in the data was the strong sales of new energy vehicles (NEV), which more than doubled in September to 357,000, thanks to the government's promotion of greener vehicles to cut pollution. These include battery-powered electric vehicles, plug-in petrol-electric hybrids and hydrogen fuel-cell vehicles.
Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc, which is making Model 3 sedans and Model Y sport-utility vehicles in Shanghai, sold 56,006 China-made vehicles in September, the highest since it started production in Shanghai about two years ago, and up 27% from 44,264 in August.

Chinese EV makers Nio (NYSE:NIO) Inc and Xpeng (NYSE:XPEV) Inc delivered over 10,000 vehicles each last month. Volkswagen AG (OTC:VWAGY) said it sold 10,126 ID. series EVs in China in September.
Another CAAM official, Xu Haidong, said NEV sales likely to hit three million units this year, up from 1.4 million last year.

LONDON (Reuters) - British shoppers increased their spending in September at the slowest pace since January, when the country was stuck in a coronavirus lockdown, as they worried about a shortage of fuel, according to a survey published on Tuesday.
The British Retail Consortium said retail spending lost more momentum last month, rising by just 0.6% compared with September 2020, much weaker than August's 3.0% increase.
""There are signs that consumer confidence is being hit as the fuel shortages, combined with wetter weather, had an impact in the second half of the month,"" BRC Chief Executive Helen Dickinson said. ""This had a bigger effect on large purchases such as furniture and homeware.""
Much of the country saw panic-buying of fuel last month as a shortage of tanker drivers led to disruption of supplies. The government has blamed this on problems facing the global economy as it reopens after lockdown, but critics say it also reflects Britain's tougher post-Brexit immigration rules.
A separate survey of broader household spending by card payments firm Barclaycard showed consumers increased their spending on fuel by 11.1% compared with September 2019, the biggest such increase in more than two years.
Overall consumer card spending grew by 13.3% compared to the same period in 2019, Barclaycard said.
Its surveys currently do not compare sales with 2020 because of distortions caused by the pandemic lockdowns.
Almost half of Barclaycard's respondents reported seeing empty spaces on the shelves, reflecting the shortage of truckers, and 18% said they found it harder than usual to find fresh fruit and vegetables. 
Spending growth on non-essential items slowed, which might be a sign some consumers were starting to cut back on discretionary purchases as inflation rose, Barclaycard said.
Nine out of 10 respondents were concerned about the impact of inflation on their household finances, something the Bank of England will note as it considers when to raise interest rates for the first time since the pandemic hit. The proportion who felt optimistic about the economy fell to 31% from 37% in August.

But there were signs of a return to something resembling normality for some sectors hit hardest by lockdowns.
Spending at pubs and bars rose as newly reunited colleagues went out and takings at cinemas, theatres and concert halls also rose. Struggling travel agents and airlines saw the scale of their sales falls narrow.

TOKYO (Reuters) -Japan's wholesale inflation hit a 13-year high in September as rising global commodity prices and a weak yen pushed up import costs, putting pressure on corporate margins and raising the risk of unwanted consumer price hikes.
Rising input costs are adding strain for manufacturers already hit by supply constraints and clouding the outlook for the world's third-largest economy, which relies on exports to cushion the blow from soft consumption, analysts say.
The corporate goods price index (CGPI), which measures the price companies charge each other for their goods and services, surged 6.3% in September from a year earlier, Bank of Japan data showed on Tuesday, exceeding market forecasts for a 5.9% gain.
The increase accelerated from a revised 5.8% rise in August to its fastest pace since September 2008, the data showed.
""If rises in raw material costs accelerate, companies selling final goods prices will see profits squeezed. As Japan is a net importer of fuel, such cost-push inflation could hurt the economy,"" said Toru Suehiro, senior economist at Daiwa Securities.
Rising oil prices pushed up petroleum and coal costs by 32.4% in September, while prices of wood products spiked 48.3%.
An index gauging yen-based wholesale import prices surged a record 31.3% in September from a year earlier, suggesting a weak yen - usually a boon to the economy by lifting exports - could hurt growth by squeezing the bottom line for corporations.
""A double whammy of declining yen value and rising energy costs could be a huge blow to Japan's economy,"" said Mari Iwashita, chief market economist at Daiwa Securities.
Still, analysts doubted whether the rise in wholesale prices would trigger a spike in Japan's consumer inflation, as seen in other economies.

""Most of the rise in wholesale prices will be absorbed by companies with the impact on consumers likely marginal, such as through higher gasoline costs,"" said Atsushi Takeda, chief economist at Itochu Economic Research Institute.
Core consumer inflation was flat in August from the previous year, well short of the BOJ's 2% target, as weak household spending keeps firms from raising prices.

The New Zealand Treasury said it had a budget deficit of NZ$4.6 billion ($3.2 billion) in the year to end June 2021, compared with a shortfall of NZ$15.1 billion forecast just a few months ago in May.
Revenue was higher and expenditure lower than forecasted as economic activity rebounded strongly and unemployment fell much more quickly than expected.
That allowed the government to borrow less than planned so that net core debt amounted to 30% of gross domestic product, instead of the 34% originally forecast in the 2020/21 budget.
Minister of Finance Grant Robertson said the current year would be impacted by the recent outbreak of the Delta variant that has forced a lockdown of the country's largest city, Auckland.

""However, the 2020/21 Crown accounts on the back of a solid result in 2019/20 put New Zealand in a strong position to support social and economic recovery and development,"" he said in a statement.

TOKYO (Reuters) -Japanese households' inflation expectations rose in the three months to September, a survey showed on Monday, suggesting a global rise in raw material costs may be affecting perceptions in a country worried about the risk of deflation.
The ratio of Japanese households that expect prices to rise a year from now stood at 68.2% in September, up from 66.8% three months ago, a quarterly central bank survey showed.
The median projection of inflation a year from now stood at 3.0% in September, up from 2.0% in June, the survey showed.
There is uncertainty, however, on how lasting the shift in public sentiment could be. The ratio of households seeing prices rising five years from now slid to 78.1% in September from 79.3% in June.
More households expect economic conditions to worsen a year from now, the survey showed, underscoring concerns that the lingering impact of the coronavirus pandemic could weigh on consumption.
In a sign households are already feeling the effects of rising food and grocery costs, 61.5% said they saw prices rise from year-before levels, up from 56.4% in June.
The survey was conducted on 2,209 households between Aug. 6 and Sept. 1.
Japan's economy, the world's third largest, is gradually recovering helped by robust external demand, though consumption has been hobbled by state of emergency curbs to contain the rise in COVID-19 infections. The measures were lifted on Sept. 30.

Soft household spending has kept consumer inflation hovering around zero in Japan, contrary to other major economies that have seen prices spikes on strong demand and supply bottlenecks.
Former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe deployed his ""Abenomics"" stimulus policies in 2013 to pull Japan out of nearly two decades of grinding deflation. While consumer prices have perked up since then, inflation remains distant from the Bank of Japan's 2% target due partly to weak household spending.

The rate remains well within the target range of between 5% and 9% set by the central bank, which next meets on Oct. 28 to decide interest rates. 
""Monthly inflation is higher than we had anticipated. It's mainly explained by the jump in vegetable and meat prices. The food index is up 3.5% month on month,"" said Allen Sandeep of Naeem Brokerage. 
Headline inflation was last this high in January 2020, when it reached 7.17%. 
Egypt's fuel pricing committee also raised domestic prices in a quarterly review on Friday, indicating that more price rises may lie ahead.
""We expect inflation in October to maintain its monthly momentum, with the seasonal spending accompanying the school season coupled with the inflationary impact of the introduced increase in fuel prices,"" Beltone analyst Alia Mamdouh said in a note. 
Naeem Research by contrast predicted inflation could lessen in October. 
""We expect annual inflation to cool down, given favourable base year impacts (contributing -1.9%) and a slower increase in monthly inflation,"" it said in a note. 
""Our calculations indicate that the latest gasoline price hike (of EGP0.25/litre) would have less than a 30 bps (basis point) impact on monthly CPI."" 

The central bank held rates steady at its last meeting on Sept. 16, saying that global financial conditions continued to be ""accommodative"".
Core inflation, which strips out volatile items such as food, rose to 4.8% year on year in September, from 4.5% a month prior.

OTTAWA (Reuters) -The Canadian economy posted a monster jobs gain in September, pushing employment back to its pre-pandemic levels, and the jobless rate hit an 18-month low, Statistics Canada data indicated on Friday.
Analysts said the figures showed the recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic was gaining pace but predicted the Bank of Canada would want to see sustained evidence of strength before adopting a more aggressive stance on the timing of interest rate hikes.
Statistics Canada reported a net gain of 157,100 new jobs, all of them in full-time employment. The jobless rate dipped to 6.9%, the lowest level since February 2020.
Analysts polled by Reuters had forecast the country would add 65,000 new jobs in September and its unemployment rate would fall to 6.9% from 7.1% in August.
Canada has now returned to the employment levels seen before the COVID-19 pandemic started last year, having regained the 3 million jobs it lost during the crisis, Statscan said.
""It's very solid and shows that Canada is doing well in that fourth wave,"" said Jimmy Jean, chief economist at Desjardins Group, saying the central bank might announce later in October that it is further tapering its quantitative easing program.
All the job gains came in full-time employment, which posted an increase of 193,600 new jobs, and were split evenly between the public and private sectors. The economy shed 36,500 part-time positions.
The Bank of Canada slashed interest rates to a record low of 0.25% last year and says it will not consider raising them again until the economy has absorbed excess slack, which it expects to occur in the second half of 2022.
Due to population growth, there are still 276,000 more people unemployed than there were in February 2020.
""The Bank of Canada is still going to want to see more improvement from here because their goal isn't just to get back to the pre-pandemic jobs number, it (is) to get back to the pre-pandemic employment population ratio,"" said Andrew Kelvin, chief Canada strategist at TD Securities.
The Canadian dollar touched its strongest level since Aug. 11 at 1.2490 per greenback, or 80.06 U.S. cents, up as much as 0.5% on the day. Separately, data showed U.S. employment increased far less than expected in September.

Royce Mendes, senior economist at CIBC Capital Markets, noted that while the number of hours worked were up 1.1%, they remained 1.5% below their pre-pandemic level.
""While the headline print likely seals the deal for another taper from the Bank of Canada later this month, there's still a ways to go to fully heal the labor market,"" he said in a note.

1214,By Bloomberg,"<span>Oct 08, 2021 08:36AM ET</span>",Payrolls Growth in U.S. Misses Big for a Second Straight Month,"(Bloomberg) -- The U.S. added fewer jobs than forecast for a second month in September, signaling weakness in the labor market recovery and complicating a potential decision by the Federal Reserve to begin scaling back monetary support before year end.
Nonfarm payrolls increased 194,000 last month after an upwardly revised 366,000 gain in August, a Labor Department report showed Friday. The unemployment rate fell to 4.8%, while average hourly earnings jumped.
The median estimate in a Bloomberg survey of economists was for a 500,000 rise in September payrolls.
Consecutive months of sluggish job growth indicate a tug of war between employers -- starved for workers to meet demand -- and candidates have been slow to return to the workforce. Nonetheless, school reopenings and the end of expanded federal unemployment benefits should lead to a pickup in hiring in coming months at a time when companies are boosting pay.
The jobs figures risk not satisfying the Federal Reserve’s “substantial further progress” criteria for labor market improvement, indicating the central bank could delay its plan to begin tapering asset purchases by year-end.
Chair Jerome Powell said after last month’s policy meeting that “a reasonably good employment report” for September would be needed meet that test.
Vaccine mandates put into place by employers and governors in states including California and New York in recent weeks could also be contributing to churn in the labor market and adding to hiring challenges.

Exports rose 29.2% in September from a year earlier to a record $39.7 billion, according to a statement from Taiwan’s Ministry of Finance on Friday. That compares to a median estimate of 25% in a Bloomberg survey of economists. Imports surged 40.4% to $33.2 billion, the second highest reading on record. The trade balance widened to $6.5 billion, it’s highest since October last year. 
Taiwan’s overseas shipments have been on a tear ever since rebounding from a dip during the initial months of the global Covid-19 outbreak last year. September’s figures benefited from resurgent worldwide demand, especially for electronic devices and new technologies such as 5G, according to the ministry’s statement. The decision by several major chipmakers to raise prices in recent months also bolstered figures. 
The growth was underpinned by strong figures from the island’s largest company, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. Earlier Friday it reported a record NT$414.7 billion ($14.8 billion) in quarterly sales for the three months through September, bolstered by global demand for computer chips amid an ongoing shortage in the silicon that power everything from cars to smartphones. 
The company’s September sales rose 20% versus a year ago to NT$152.7 billion.
But economists are increasingly warning that Taiwan’s streak of stellar export growth may be about to end. 
“Monthly exports are expected to gradually decrease in the next quarter and into the start of next year as well.” Woods Chen, chief economist at Yuanta Securities Invest Consulting, said in a telephone interview on Thursday. “It is unlikely that export growth will go back to how it was in the third quarter.” 
Chen estimated exports to slow to 17% in the fourth quarter and 6% in the first quarter of 2022. 
Exports are likely to continue expanding in the final quarter of 2021, according to the finance ministry’s statement, fueled mainly by the launch of new consumer electronics products, infrastructure projects in major countries, and the overall expansion of the global economy.
Shipments will likely grow by between 21% and 25% in October, the finance ministry’s Beatrice Tsai said in a briefing in Taipei Friday. 
“I expect a moderation in export growth in the fourth quarter as there are some early signs of softening demand for consumer electronic products,” Michelle Lam, an economist at Societe General SA, wrote via message Friday. “However, Taiwan’s leading position in foundry and the continued semiconductor shortage means it will be manageable.”

The sluggish data weighed on the outlook for China's overall retail sales, which have slowed much more sharply than expected when new COVID-19 outbreaks struck a handful of Chinese cities over summer.
The seven-day holiday in China from Oct. 1-7 to mark National Day is one of the busiest travel periods in the country and a bellwether for consumer demand in the world's second-largest economy.
Domestic tourism revenues totalled 389.06 billion yuan ($60.36 billion), the official People's Daily reported on Thursday, the last day of the holiday, citing data from China's Ministry of Culture and Tourism. 
That was down 4.7% year-on-year and still under 60% of the revenues recorded in the same week before the pandemic.
""The spend weakness was attributable to the relatively soft prices of travel products and a shift toward short-haul trips,"" Citi wrote in a note. 
""The recovery of consumption has been sluggish post the pandemic, and the road ahead may still be bumpy, given lingering public health risks. While the Delta wave has been contained, the risks of importing infections and local outbreaks remain.""

Investing.com – China’s services sector made a return to growth in September as a major COVID-19 outbreak in the eastern province of Jiangsu was brought under control. Although providing support to a stalled economic recovery, the risk remains that more COVID-19 outbreaks could hamper the recovery again.
The Caixin services purchasing managers index (PMI), released earlier in the day, was 53.4 in September, compared to the previous month’s 46.7 figure. The Caixin survey, which focuses on the private sector, also rose above the 50-mark indicating growth and away from more-than-one-year lows.
The non-manufacturing PMI, released by the National Bureau of Statistics at the end of September, was at 53.2.
The services sector has been slower to recover from COVID-19 compared to the manufacturing sector. It is also more susceptible to shocks from COVID-19 outbreaks, which impact consumption and travel, and the outlook for a rebound remains uncertain.
""In view of this, in the coming months, the government should focus on improving epidemic prevention and control and alleviating supply-side pressure,"" Caixin Insight Group senior economist Wang Zhe told Reuters.
""It should also find a balance among multiple objectives, such as promoting employment, holding raw material prices stable, ensuring a stable and orderly supply, and meeting targets for controlling energy consumption.""

The Caixin/Markit services Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) rose to 53.4 from 46.7 in August, pulling away from the lowest level seen since the height of the pandemic last year. The 50-point mark separates growth from contraction on a monthly basis. 
The better readings in the survey, which focuses more on smaller firms in coastal regions, are in line with findings in an official survey last week which also showed the services industry returned to activity growth.
Analysts say the services sector, which was slower to recover from the pandemic than manufacturing, is more vulnerable to sporadic COVID-19 outbreaks in the country, clouding the outlook for the much anticipated rebound in consumption in the months to come. 
""In view of this, in the coming months, the government should focus on improving epidemic prevention and control and alleviating supply-side pressure,"" said Wang Zhe, senior economist at Caixin Insight Group.
""It should also find a balance among multiple objectives, such as promoting employment, holding raw material prices stable, ensuring a stable and orderly supply, and meeting targets for controlling energy consumption.""
Sub-indexes of new business, prices charged, and employment all bounced back to expansionary territory in September, although new export business shrank again, touching the lowest in seven months due to the surging pandemic overseas. 

Input prices increased for the 15th straight month in September and rose at a faster pace, driven by rising labour, freight and raw material costs, the survey found, an issue that drove factory activity into contraction last month.

Initial claims for state unemployment benefits decreased 38,000 to a seasonally adjusted 326,000 for the week ended Oct. 2. That was the biggest drop since late June. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast 348,000 claims for the latest week.
Unadjusted claims, which economists say offer a better read of the labor market, tumbled 41,431 to 258,909 last week. California led the drop in claims last week. There were also decreases in Michigan, Ohio, Washington DC and Missouri. They offset notable increases in Pennsylvania and Virginia. 
Claims had increased for three straight weeks as California moved people to another program following the expiration of federal government-funded aid on Sept. 6, to allow the recipients to collect one additional week of benefits. 
There had also been increases in filings related to the idling of assembly plants in some states by automakers as they managed their supply of semiconductors amid a global shortage. 
A resurgence in COVID-19 infections, driven by the Delta variant, also disrupted activity in the high-contact services sector. That suggested some moderation in labor market conditions in the prior weeks, which was confirmed by a separate report on Thursday from global outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas showing job cuts announced by U.S.-based employers increased 14% to 17,895 in September. 
Still, layoffs were down 85% compared to September 2020.
In the third quarter, employers announced 52,560 job cuts, the fewest since the second quarter of 1997 and down 23% from the July-September period.
Stocks on Wall Street were trading higher. The dollar dipped against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices fell.
SUPPLY WOES
Layoffs last month were led by companies in the healthcare/products sector, with 2,673 announced cuts. Since the  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) vaccine received full-FDA approval, many healthcare facilities have implemented vaccine mandates, which have led to the firing of non-compliant workers.
Ongoing strains in the supply chain saw industrial goods manufacturers laying off 2,328 workers in September, while warehousing businesses reported 1,936 job cuts. There were 1,679 job cuts in the services sector. 
But the rise in layoffs was dwarfed by an explosion in planned hiring, in part as retailers gear up for the holiday season. The Challenger report showed companies announced plans to hire 939,790 workers compared to only 94,004 in August.
With companies eager to hire, more people are coming off the state unemployment rolls. The claims report showed the number of people continuing to receive benefits after an initial week of aid tumbled 97,000 to 2.714 million in the week ended Sept. 25. That was the lowest level since mid-March 2020.
The total number of people collecting unemployment checks under all programs dropped to 4.172 million during the week ended Sept. 18 from 5.027 million in the prior week. That reflected the end of extended benefits last month, which economists hope will increase the labor pool.
The pandemic forced some people to drop out of work to become caregivers. Others are reluctant to return for fear of contracting the coronavirus, while some have either retired or are seeking career changes. That has left employers desperate to fill a record 10.9 million job openings as of the end of July.
The worker shortages have impacted job growth, though there is optimism that hiring picked up in September. According to a Reuters survey of economists, nonfarm payrolls likely increased by 500,000 jobs last month. 
Estimates range from as high as 700,000 jobs to as low as 250,000, reflecting the mixed labor market indicators in September. A survey from the Conference Board last week showed consumers' views of current labor market conditions softened. 
While the Institute for Supply Management's measure of manufacturing employment rebounded last month after contracting in August, its measure of services industry employment slipped.

The economy created 235,000 jobs in August, the fewest in seven months. The unemployment rate is forecast dipping to 5.1% in September from 5.2% in August. 
""Going forward, the combination of easing labor supply constraints, strong labor demand and an improving COVID outlook should spur further labor market progress,"" said Lydia Boussour, lead U.S. economist at Oxford Economics in New York.

The Rome-based Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) also projected record global cereal production in 2021, but said this would be outpaced by forecast consumption. 
FAO's food price index, which tracks international prices of the most globally traded food commodities, averaged 130.0 points last month, the highest reading since September 2011, according to the agency's data.
The figure compared with a revised 128.5 for August. The August figure was previously given as 127.4.
On a year-on-year basis, prices were up 32.8% in September.
Agricultural commodity prices have risen steeply in the past year, fuelled by harvest setbacks and Chinese demand.
The FAO's cereal price index http://www.fao.org/worldfoodsituation/foodpricesindex/en rose by 2.0% in September from the previous month. That was led by a near 4% increase for wheat prices, with the UN agency citing tightening export availabilities amid strong demand. [GRA/] [GRA/TEND]
""Among major cereals, wheat will be the focus in the coming weeks as demand need to be tested against fast rising prices,” FAO Senior Economist Abdolreza Abbassian said in a statement. 
World vegetable oil prices were up 1.7% on the month and showing a year-on-year rise of about 60%, as palm oil prices climbed on robust import demand and concerns over labour shortages in Malaysia, FAO said.
Palm oil futures have rallied further in early October to hit record highs as a surge in crude oil markets has lent further support to vegetable oils used in biodiesel. [POI/]
Global sugar prices rose 0.5% in September with concern over adverse crop weather in top exporter Brazil partly offset by slowing import demand and a favourable production outlook in India and Thailand, according to FAO.
For cereal production, FAO projected a record world crop of 2.800 billion tonnes in 2021, up slightly from 2.788 billion estimated a month ago. 

That would be below world cereal use of 2.811 billion tonnes, a forecast revised up by 2.7 million tonnes from a month earlier mainly to reflect increased wheat use in animal feed, FAO said in a cereal supply and demand note http://www.fao.org/worldfoodsituation/csdb/en.
Global cereal stocks were expected to ease in 2021/22 but would still be at a comfortable level, FAO added.

BERLIN (Reuters) -German industrial output suffered its steepest drop in August since April last year, due to supply chain disruptions that are holding back growth in Europe's biggest economy and hitting the auto sector particularly hard, official data showed on Thursday.
The Federal Statistics Office said industrial output fell by 4.0% on the month after an increase of 1.3% in July. A Reuters poll had pointed to a decline in August of 0.4%.
""Manufacturers continue to report production constraints due to supply shortages of intermediate products,"" the office said in a statement.
Production of cars and car parts fell by 17.5% on the month.
German car companies are struggling to meet a post-pandemic surge in demand since the start of the year, due to a lack of microchips and other intermediate products.
Carmaker BMW said its group deliveries were down 12.2% in the third quarter, hit by the microchip crunch.
On Tuesday, Daimler (OTC:DDAIF) truck boss Martin Daum said he expected the global chip shortage to continue to affect production next year.
""We will definitely deliver less than we could have sold, and that also applies to next year,"" he said, adding that it was impossible to say how big the shortfalls would be.
""It's a fight for every chip,"" he added.
Official data released on Wednesday showed German industrial orders fell more than expected in August on weaker demand from abroad following two months of unusually strong gains due to major contracts.
However, the Munich-based Ifo economic institute said separately that its survey of production expectations rose in September.
""Order books are still full, only materials bottlenecks are causing problems at the moment and dampening production plans somewhat,"" Ifo economist Klaus Wohlrabe said.
Thomas Gitzel, economist at VP Bank, said ""if the flow of materials gets going again, the conditions are in place for a strong upturn in industrial activity.""
Carsten Brzeski, at ING, said that for now it looked like that upturn would ""come rather later than sooner.""

Separately, prices for newly built residential buildings rose by 12.6% on the year in August, their biggest rise since November 1970. German consumer prices rose by rose by 4.1% year-on-year last month.
Jens-Oliver Niklasch, economist at LBBW, commented: ""Supply shortages, high energy prices and production stoppages: a toxic brew that already smells faintly of stagflation.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. private payrolls increased more than expected in September as COVID-19 infections started subsiding, boosting hiring at restaurants and other high-contact businesses.
The ADP National Employment Report released on Wednesday supported expectations that job growth picked up last month, though it has a poor record predicting the private payrolls count in the Labor Department's more comprehensive and closely watched employment report.
September's employment report due on Friday will garner more attention after the Federal Reserve signaled last month that it would likely begin reducing its monthly bond purchases as soon as November. Fed Chair Jerome Powell believes the economy is one ""decent"" monthly employment report short of meeting the U.S. central bank's threshold for tapering its bond buying program.
""It looks like the gain in employment will qualify as 'decent',"" said Paul Ashworth, chief economist at Capital Economics in Toronto. ""Nevertheless, it is worth remembering that the first estimate from the ADP is not a particularly good predictor of official payrolls."" 
Private payrolls increased by 568,000 jobs last month, the ADP National Employment Report showed. Data for August was revised lower to show 340,000 jobs added instead of the initially reported 374,000. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast private payrolls would increase by 428,000 jobs.
Employment gains averaged 410,000 jobs in the third quarter, a slowdown compared to the second-quarter average of 748,000. Last month, the leisure and hospitality industry added 226,000 jobs after creating 155,000 positions in August. 
Manufacturing payrolls increased by 49,000 jobs, while hiring at construction sites also rose by 49,000. Job gains in other sectors were modest. Large firms accounted for the bulk of job creation, followed by medium-sized companies. Small business hiring climbed by 63,000 jobs after rising 61,000 in August. 
The ADP report is jointly developed with Moody's (NYSE:MCO) Analytics. It has a poor record predicting the private payrolls count in the department's Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) employment report because of methodology differences.
Stocks on Wall Street fell as the ADP report fanned fears that the Fed could tighten monetary policy sooner than expected. The dollar rose against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices were higher.

MORTGAGE RATES RISING
Expectations that the Fed will soon start to withdrew some of the monetary support to the economy have boosted mortgage rates, hurting refinancing activity and demand for home purchase loans. A report from the Mortgage Bankers Association on Wednesday showed mortgage applications dropped 6.9% last week from the prior week.
Refinance applications tumbled 9.6% from the previous week and were down 16% from a year ago. Applications for loans to buy a home dropped 1.7% from a week ago. The 30-year mortgage fixed rate rose four basis points to 3.14% last week, the highest since July. 
Graphic: MBA, https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-STOCKS/zgpombqmrpd/mba.png 
The pick-up in private payrolls suggests the economic expansion remains on track even as gross domestic product growth appears to have slowed sharply in the third quarter because of the resurgence in COVID-19 infections in summer and relentless shortages that have undercut motor vehicle sales.
The Atlanta Fed is predicting that GDP growth braked to a 1.3% annualized rate in the July-September quarter. The economy grew at a 6.7% pace in the second quarter. 
""Stronger job growth in September could indicate that the drag on hiring from the recent increase in coronavirus cases is fading,"" said Gus Faucher, chief economist at PNC Financial (NYSE:PNC) in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.
According to a Reuters survey of economists, nonfarm payrolls likely increased by 473,000 jobs in September. The economy created 235,000 jobs in August, the fewest in seven months. Estimates range from as high as 700,000 jobs to as low as 250,000. The unemployment rate is forecast dipping to 5.1% from 5.2% in August.
But labor market indicators were mixed in September. A survey from the Conference Board last week showed consumers' views of current labor market conditions softened. 
The number of people on state unemployment rolls fell in mid-September relative to mid-August. The Institute for Supply Management's measure of manufacturing employment rebounded last month after contracting in August. But the ISM's gauge of services industry employment slipped, with businesses reporting that ""labor shortages (were) experienced at all levels.""

The economy is experiencing an acute shortage of labor as the pandemic forced some people to drop out of work to become caregivers. Others are reluctant to return for fear of contracting the virus, while some have either retired or are seeking career changes. 
There were a record 10.9 million job openings at the end of July. Economists are cautiously optimistic that the labor crunch will start easing in the fall and through winter after the expiration in September of federal government-funded unemployment benefits, which businesses and Republicans blamed for the worker shortage.

MEXICO CITY/SAO PAULO (Reuters) -Automotive production in Brazil and Mexico, Latin America's two largest economies, plummeted in September, dragged down by an industry-wide semiconductor chip shortage and railroad blockades in Mexico, data showed on Wednesday.
Brazilian auto production was down 21.3% to 173,287 units in September from the same month in 2020, when the industry was scrambling to resume production from a coronavirus-induced shutdown, Brazilian automakers association Anfavea said.
In Mexico, auto output plunged 33.30% from September 2020 to 208,092 vehicles, while auto exports fell by 24.18% to 195,294 units, data from national statistics agency INEGI showed.
""All of this is due to the shortage of semiconductors, which at this point is affecting all levels of production for all participants in the domestic market,"" said the head of the Mexican Automotive Industry Association (AMIA), Fausto Cuevas.
A semiconductor chip shortage is causing major auto production cuts around the globe and auto industry officials have warned the problem is getting worse.
In the latest fallout from the chip shortfall, Japanese automaker Nissan (OTC:NSANY) told Reuters it plans to carry out temporary stoppages at two Mexican plants for several days in October due to adjustments needed to manage the situation.
AMIA's Cuevas forecast Mexican automotive exports would decline between 3.8% and 4.2% this year from 2020 and projected production to fall by between 4.7% and 5%, saying Mexico's auto industry would only return to pre-pandemic levels in 2024.
A senior executive at Mexico's Automobile Distributors Association (AMDA) said analysts were forecasting that supply and demand for semiconductor chips would be in balance around the second quarter of 2022.
Compounding carmakers' woes in Mexico have been 86 days of railroad blockades as of Oct. 5 in the western state of Michoacan, home to the key port of Lazaro Cardenas, according to analysis by Grupo Financiero BASE.
Automakers in Brazil lowered projections for sales, output and exports this year, blaming a shortage of parts and a slow economic recovery.

Anfavea, which represents global carmakers such as General Motors (NYSE:GM), Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) and Fiat in Brazil, now expects sales of new automobiles in Brazil to either fall by 1% or rise by no more than 3% this year. In July, the association had forecast 13% sales growth from 2020.
Vehicle sales in Brazil fell 10.2% in September from August to 155,075 units, according to Anfavea. Still, automotive output in Brazil did rise 5.6% in September from August.

Retail sales, a proxy for consumer demand, in the 19 countries sharing the euro rose 0.3% month-on-month in August and were unchanged from a year earlier, the European Union's statistics office Eurostat said.
Economists polled by Reuters had expected a 0.8% monthly gain and a 0.4% year-on-year increase.

Eurostat said food, drinks and tobacco sales fell 1.7% month-on-month and by 1.9% year-on-year, holding back the overall index even though sales via mail order and internet shot up.
Such sales, which have been strong since the start of the pandemic, rose 9.0% from July after two months of declines and were up 8.5% from a year earlier.

1229,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 06, 2021 03:17AM ET</span>",German industrial orders fall more than expected in August,"BERLIN (Reuters) -German industrial orders fell more than expected in August on weaker demand from abroad following two months of unusually strong gains due to major contracts, data showed on Wednesday.
The figures published by the Federal Statistics Office showed orders for goods 'Made in Germany' were down by 7.7% on the month in seasonally adjusted terms. A Reuters poll of analysts had pointed to a drop of 2.1% on the month.
German car companies are struggling to meet a post-pandemic surge in demand since the start of the year due to a lack of microchips and other intermediate products which is holding back the recovery of Europe's largest economy.
The steep drop on the month was partly caused by previous orders for planes, ships and other large vehicles which had pushed up orders by 4.9% in July and 4.6% in June, the office said.
Without this distorting effect, industrial orders were down by 5.1% in August.
Another reason for the weaker-than-expected headline figure was lower demand from abroad, especially from clients outside the euro zone area.
The economy ministry also pointed to an unusually strong decline in orders for cars which it partly linked to special holiday effects in some regions with large automobile factories.
Nonetheless, overall industrial orders remained at a historically high level and were already 8.5% above their pre-crisis levels of February 2020, the month before Germany was hit by the COVID-19 pandemic, the ministry said.
""The result is a shock at first glance, but given the overall high level, it hurts less than in normal times,"" Bankhaus Lampe economist Alexander Krueger said.

The main problem in German manufacturing is still the lack of semiconductors and other intermediate products as the supply chain problems still prevent orders from being processed.
""Order cancellations will therefore tend to increase. With no easing of the supply bottlenecks in sight, industry will continue to suffer,"" Krueger added. ""Industry will continue to be a drag on growth in the fourth quarter.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. services industry activity nudged up in September, but growth is being restrained by a persistent shortage of inputs and the resulting high prices as the pandemic drags on.
The Institute for Supply Management (ISM) survey on Tuesday reported that ""ongoing challenges with labor resources, logistics, and materials are affecting the continuity of supply."" Hopes for an easing in the supply chain bottlenecks were dashed by a resurgence in COVID-19 infections over summer, driven by the Delta variant. Ports in China and the United States are also experiencing congestion. 
""We don't expect supply-side constraints to start easing meaningfully until mid-2022,"" said Oren Klachkin, lead U.S. economist at Oxford Economics in New York. ""Solid demand and less Covid wariness will keep services growing, but the expansion will be capped by the supply side's limited ability to meet demand.""
The ISM's non-manufacturing activity index edged up to a reading of 61.9 last month from 61.7 in August. A reading above 50 indicates growth in the services sector, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the index falling to 60.
Seventeen services industries, including retail trade, public administration as well as finance and insurance reported growth. Only agriculture, forestry, fishing and hunting saw a decline in activity. 
Accommodation and food services businesses reported increased transportation bottlenecks, which were ""resulting in longer lead times and missed appointments."" Transportation and warehousing businesses said ""demand far outweighs supply for goods and services."" 
In the public administration industry, businesses complained about rising costs for both supply and service inputs, which they said ""have the potential to significantly impact our operations through the end of the year, especially if seasonal trends prove exceptionally strong."" 
Spending is shifting from goods to services like travel and other high-contact activities as the economy normalizes after being severely disrupted by the pandemic, thanks to vaccinations against the coronavirus.
The survey's measure of new orders received by services businesses inched up to 63.5 last month from a reading of 63.2 in August. Its gauge of supplier deliveries dipped to a reading of 68.8 last month from 69.6 in August. A reading above 50 indicates slower deliveries. With supply still tight, prices remained high. A measure of prices paid by services industries rose to 77.5 from a reading of 75.4 in August.
That mirrored the findings of the ISM's manufacturing survey published last Friday and suggested that high inflation could persist through 2022. The Federal Reserve last month raised its projection for its key inflation measure to 3.7% this year. That was up from the 3.0% projected in June. 
The personal consumption expenditures price index, excluding the volatile food and energy components, increased 3.6% year-on-year in August - well above the U.S. central bank's flexible 2% inflation target.
Stocks on Wall Street were trading higher. The dollar rose against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices fell. 
ISM services PMI https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-STOCKS/egpbkyrygvq/ism.png 
SLOWER GROWTH
But even as the services industry pushes ahead, evidence is mounting that economic growth slowed significantly in the third quarter. A separate report from the Commerce Department on Tuesday showed the trade deficit surged 4.2% to a record $73.3 billion in August. Economists had forecast the trade gap widening to $70.5 billion. 
Trade balance https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-STOCKS/akvezqbqxpr/tradebal.png 
The report followed on the heels of government data last Friday showing high inflation sharply cutting into consumer spending in July, with a moderate rebound in August. 
Following the trade data, the Atlanta Fed cut its third-quarter gross domestic product estimate to a 1.3% annualized rate from a 2.3% pace.
The economy grew at a 6.7% pace in the second quarter. Trade has subtracted from GDP growth for four straight quarters. 
Imports shot up 1.4% to a record high $287.0 billion, led by consumer goods such as pharmaceutical preparations, toys, games and sporting goods. There was also a rise in imports of industrial supplies and materials. 
But a global shortage of semiconductors which is hampering production at auto plants resulted in imports of motor vehicles, parts and engines decreasing $1.5 billion. 
The rise in imports, mostly the result of businesses rebuilding depleted inventories, suggests an apparent slowdown in consumer spending last quarter was probably temporary.
""There is a huge backlog of foreign-made consumer goods waiting to get into the U.S. supply chain, on ships waiting to be unloaded at U.S. ports, at foreign ports waiting to get onto those ships, and at foreign factories waiting to get to port,"" said Bill Adams, a senior economist at PNC Financial (NYSE:PNC) in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. ""That will keep goods imports high through at least November.""
Exports gained 0.5% to $213.7 billion in August, the highest since May 2019, lifted by industrial supplies and materials such as nonmonetary gold and natural gas. But motor vehicles exports fell as did capital goods like civilian aircraft and industrial machinery.
Persistent shortages saw a build-up of unfinished work at services industries in September. Companies continued to hire more workers, though the pace slowed a bit from August, likely reflecting difficulties finding workers. 
Companies complained about ""employee flight to better-paying jobs and lack of a pipeline to replace."" The ISM survey also found that ""labor shortages (were) experienced at all levels."" 

The survey's measure of services industry employment dipped to a reading of 53.0 last month from 53.7 in August.
There is an acute shortage of labor as the pandemic forced some people to drop out of work to become caregivers. Others are reluctant to return for fear of contracting the virus, while some have either retired or are seeking career changes. There were a record 10.9 million job openings at the end of July.

OTTAWA (Reuters) - Canada's trade surplus with the world widened in August, easily beating analyst expectations, as strong exports of energy products outweighed a drop a two-way trade for motor vehicles and parts, data showed on Tuesday.
The country's trade surplus was C$1.94 billion ($1.54 billion) in August, well ahead of the average analyst estimate of a surplus of C$430 million and up from a surplus of C$736 million in July. 
Exports rose 0.8%, led by energy products - which rose to their highest level since March 2014 - and metal and non-metallic mineral products, which outweighed a drop in motor vehicle and parts exports.
Imports, meanwhile, fell by 1.4%, mostly on a decline in motor vehicle and parts imports.
""As we expected, the global chip shortage continued to impact production in that (motor vehicle) sector,"" said Royce Mendes, senior economist at CIBC Capital Markets, in a note.
""The fact that the wider-than-expected surplus was largely the result of more weakness in goods imports than anticipated will likely blunt any impacts from the data on the Canadian dollar,"" he added.

The Canadian dollar was trading nearly unchanged after the data, at 1.2589 to the greenback, or 79.43 U.S. cents.

The survey's measure of new orders received by services businesses inched up to 63.5 last month from a reading of 63.2 in August. 
Like other segments of the economy, the services sector is grappling with shortages of raw materials and labor. There are little signs that these headwinds will recede anytime soon.
The ISM survey's measure of supplier deliveries dipped to a reading of 68.8 last month from 69.6 in August. A reading above 50 indicates slower deliveries. With supply still tight, prices remained high. A measure of prices paid by services industries rose to 77.5 from a reading of 75.4 in August.

LONDON (Reuters) -Business growth across Europe remained strong last month but elevated inflationary pressures put a dent in demand while ongoing supply issues constrained activity, issues which are likely to continue, a survey showed on Tuesday. 
Although many restrictions imposed to contain the coronavirus pandemic have now been lifted in the region, firms are suffering from shortages of staff, raw materials and transport.
HIS Markit's final composite Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI), seen as a good guide to economic health, sank to 56.2 last month from August's 59.0, although still well above the 50 mark separating growth from contraction and just above a 56.1 ""flash"" estimate.
On Friday, a euro zone manufacturing PMI showed growth remained robust in September but activity suffered from supply chain bottlenecks, and the bloc's dominant service industry also saw the pace of expansion slow.
A PMI for the services sector fell to 56.4 from 59.0, its lowest since May, while the new business index dropped to 55.3 from 57.9.
""Today's data confirm the services sector remains on the path of recovery, but the pace of expansion softened. Despite the momentum remaining solid, inflationary pressures and supply-side disruptions weigh on the outlook,"" said Maddalena Martini at Oxford Economics.
""Looking forward, we see these downside risks to remain towards the end of 2021.""
Demand fell to a five-month low as firms passed on part of rising input costs, which rose at a record pace, to consumers. The composite output prices index rose to 59.1 from 58.3, not far from survey highs set in the summer months.
Activity in Germany's services industry continued to grow strongly in September, but the recovery from the pandemic lost momentum as catch-up effects waned and more companies were affected by supply bottlenecks.

In France, services growth slipped as inflationary pressures and COVID-19 protocols had an impact on businesses. Italian and Spanish services growth also slowed.
Meanwhile, in Britain - outside the currency union - the post-lockdown economic recovery avoided losing further momentum last month but companies increased prices at the fastest pace on record, adding to signs of rising inflation. [GB/PMIS]

The Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) said the auto industry continued to be plagued by a global shortage of semiconductors used in the production of cars.
""This is a desperately disappointing September and further evidence of the ongoing impact of the Covid pandemic on the sector,"" said SMMT chief executive Mike Hawes.
With widespread panic-buying at the petrol pumps late last month caused by a shortage of goods vehicle drivers, the SMMT said more than 32,000 battery-powered cars were registered last month - a new record.

Hawes said a massive investment in public recharging facilities was needed to keep pace with consumer demand for electric cars.
British licence plates denote the age of a vehicle and update every March and September - meaning these are usually bumper months for car registrations as buyers like to show they have the newest model.

1235,By Bloomberg,"<span>Oct 05, 2021 05:00AM ET</span>",U.K. Services Prices Jump at Record Pace on Supply-Chain Woes,"(Bloomberg) -- The prices paid by customers in the U.K. services sector rose at the fastest pace on record last month as the nation’s supply-chain crisis accelerated inflationary pressures in the economy. 
With energy prices spiraling and a shortage of staff in haulage, agriculture and meat processing causing significant disruption, U.K. firms have been forced to pass the rapid rises in costs to consumers, according to a survey by IHS Markit. 
That resulted in the fastest increase in prices charged since the survey began in 1996. Worse may be to come, with the figures not fully reflecting the full impact of the U.K.’s fuel crisis at the end of September. 
Markit’s report is the latest to highlight how supply-chain issues are increasingly filtering through to consumers, exacerbating a looming cost of living crisis this winter. It could also be a warning sign for Bank of England policy makers, who already expect inflation to reach more than 4% by the end of this year, and are poised to tighten policy should price rises become entrenched. 
”Tight constraints on business capacity and rampant supply chain uncertainty meant that service providers have become more willing to pass on higher costs to customers,” said Tim Moore, economics director at IHS Markit.
Many businesses are “reporting more frequent reviews of pricing due to escalating cost increases by suppliers,” he said 
The supply constraints also pulled down the pace of growth within the U.K.’s dominant services sector, with Markit saying supply-chain shortages were increasingly leading to lost business opportunities.
New orders rose at the slowest pace since the winter lockdown. The firm’s index of growth in the industry stood at 55.4 last month, slightly above an earlier estimate but well below the recent peak of 62.9 seen in May.

1236,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 05, 2021 04:57AM ET</span>","UK economic recovery steadies in Sept, price pressures mount -PMI","LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's post-lockdown economic recovery avoided losing further momentum in September but companies increased prices at the fastest pace on record, adding to signs of rising inflation, a survey showed on Tuesday. 
The final reading of the IHS Markit/CIPS composite Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI), which combines Britain's services and manufacturing sectors, edged up to 54.9 from 54.8 in August, the first time it did not fall since May.
The reading was also higher than the preliminary estimate for September of 54.1.
While the figure represented strong overall growth for companies, shortages of staff, raw materials and transport led to the slowest growth in new orders since shortly before the lifting of coronavirus lockdowns in early 2021.
Some companies said the scheduled end on Sept. 30 of a tax break for home-buyers contributed to the slowdown in new orders.
Backlogs of work grew as firms struggled to fill their vacancies and a slowdown in job creation from a record high in August reflected some redundancies ahead of the expiry of the government's furlough scheme at the end of the month. 
Companies raised the prices they charged at the fastest pace since the composite index was launched in 1999. Input costs also rose sharply for services firms but they grew more slowly for manufacturers.

The Bank of England is watching closely for any signs that the recent rise in inflation might prove longer-lasting than it has predicted. Last month the BoE said the case for an interest rate hike had strengthened as inflation pressure mounted.
IHS Markit said the data had yet to fully reflect the inflationary impact of Britain's fuel crisis and surging energy prices at the end of the month.

IHS Markit's final Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) for the services sector fell to 56.2 from 60.8 in August, still well above the 50 threshold which separates growth from contraction and a bit better than a flash reading of 56.0. 
IHS Markit economist Phil Smith said the survey suggested Germany was heading towards a more moderate period of economic growth in the final months of the year.
""Our current forecasts are for a 3.0% quarter-on-quarter rise in GDP in Q3, followed by a 1.2% gain in Q4,"" Smith said.
The German economy shrank by 2.0% quarter-on-quarter in the first three months of the year and then expanded by 1.6% quarter-on-quarter in the three months from April to June.
The composite PMI index, which comprises both the services and manufacturing sectors, eased to 55.5 from 60.0 in August, reflecting the continued recovery of the manufacturing sector. The reading was better than a flash figure of 55.3.

""The loss of momentum is partly natural as activity gets closer to pre-pandemic levels,"" Smith said, adding that the drag on growth from materials shortages was also becoming more noticeable, impacting services firms directly and also via a slowdown in manufacturing.
Coupled with inflationary pressures, the threat of further spillover effects to other parts of the economy is dampening service providers' growth expectations, Smith said.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia's trade surplus unexpectedly grew to a record in August as strength in liquefied natural gas and coal exports more than offset a pullback in iron ore prices, a windfall to mining profits and tax receipts. 
Figures from the Australian Bureau of Statistics out on Tuesday showed the surplus on international trade jumped to A$15.1 billion ($11.0 billion) in August, from A$12.7 billion the month before. That was the highest on record and confounded analysts' forecasts of a drop to A$10.3 billion.
Exports climbed 4.1% in the month to A$48.5 billion led by LNG, hard coking coal and thermal coal, courtesy of strong energy demand in Asia. Both prices and volumes were higher, eclipsing a sharp fall in prices for iron ore, Australia's number one export earner.
Demand for energy in Asia has only got hotter as shortages of electricity in China led to blackouts and countries compete for LNG and coal shipments ahead of winter.
Australian goods exports to China alone stood at A$18.6 billion in August, up 55% on a year earlier and showing little impact from ongoing trade and political tensions with Beijing. 
Imports fell 1.5% in August to A$33.4 billion, with the drop mainly in capital goods while consumption good imports were led higher by cars.
Trade in services remains around half of pre-pandemic levels with Australia's international borders still shut to tourists and students.

The ABS said that due to problems with sourcing reliable data on services it would stop reporting the figures from January, while seeking means to improve the statistics.

WELLINGTON (Reuters) - New Zealand business confidence dropped in the third quarter as the latest COVID-19 lockdown in the country hurt sentiment, a private think tank said on Tuesday.
A net 11% of firms surveyed expected general business conditions to deteriorate, compared with a net 7.0% positive reading in the previous quarter, the New Zealand Institute of Economic Research's (NZIER) quarterly survey of business opinion (QSBO) showed.
On a seasonally adjusted basis, 8% expected business conditions to worsen, versus 9.0% expecting an improvement in the previous period. The survey's measure of capacity utilisation was 96.1%, from the previous quarter's 94.9%.
Demand was still holding up, but the negative impact of the current COVID-19 community outbreak had affected business confidence, NZIER said in its report.
New Zealand's biggest city, Auckland, continues to be in lockdown since the highly infectious Delta variant of COVID-19 entered the country in mid-August. Some restrictions will be eased from Wednesday.
""Uncertainty over how the latest outbreak will evolve and how much longer containment restrictions will remain in place looks to have dented confidence and led to more caution amongst businesses towards investment,"" the report said.

The business outlook data comes ahead of an interest rate decision by the Reserve Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ) on Wednesday. 
The central bank is widely expected to hike rates for the first time in seven years.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - New orders for U.S.-made goods accelerated in August, pointing to sustained strength in manufacturing even as economic growth appeared to have slowed in the third quarter because of shortages of raw materials and labor.
The Commerce Department said on Monday that factory orders increased 1.2% in August. Data for July was revised higher to show orders rising 0.7% instead of gaining 0.4% as previously reported. Orders have now increased for four straight months. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast factory orders gaining 1.0%. Orders shot up 18.0% on a year-on-year basis.
""Factory orders continue to climb, a good sign for manufacturing,"" said Ryan Sweet, a senior economist at Moody's (NYSE:MCO) Analytics in West Chester, Pennsylvania. ""However, manufacturing is still being tested by the global supply-chain issues.""
Shortages held back shipments of factory goods, which barely registered a 0.1% gain in August after advancing 1.5% in July.
Manufacturing, which accounts for 12% of the economy, is being driven by still-strong demand for goods despite spending shifting back to services. Businesses are rebuilding inventories, which were depleted in the first half. 
An Institute for Supply Management survey last week showed manufacturing activity steadily expanding in September, but noted that ""companies and suppliers continue to deal with an unprecedented number of hurdles to meet increasing demand.""
According to the survey all industries were ""impacted by record-long raw materials lead times, continued shortages of critical materials, rising commodities prices and difficulties in transporting products.""
Stocks on Wall Street were trading lower. The dollar fell against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury yields rose.
SLOWER GDP GROWTH
Input shortages and the resulting high prices, worsened by the latest wave of COVID-19 infections, driven by the Delta variant, likely caused a sharp slowdown in gross domestic product growth in the third quarter. 
Data last Friday showed high inflation sharply cutting into consumer spending in July, with a moderate rebound in August. The Atlanta Federal Reserve is forecasting GDP growth braking to a 2.3% annualized rate in the third quarter. The economy grew at a 6.7% pace in the second quarter. 
The increase in factory goods orders in August was led by computers and electronic products, fabricated metal products, transportation equipment as well as electrical equipment, appliances and components. But there were decreases in machinery and primary metals orders.
With shipments barely rising, inventories at factories rose 0.6% in August after a similar gain in July. Unfilled orders at factories jumped 1.0% after rising 0.5% in July.
The Commerce Department also reported that orders for non-defense capital goods, excluding aircraft, which are seen as a measure of business spending plans on equipment, gained 0.6% in August instead of advancing 0.5% as reported last month. Momentum has, however, slowed in recent months.
Shipments of these so-called core capital goods, which are used to calculate business equipment spending in the GDP report, rose 0.8%. Core capital goods shipments were previously reported to have increased 0.7% in August.

Business spending on equipment was robust in the second quarter, notching the fourth straight quarter of double-digit growth. That contributed to hoisting the level of GDP well above its peak in the fourth quarter of 2019.
""Incorporating data from the factory goods report and other related measures, we continue to believe that real equipment spending fell noticeably in the third quarter and that the real change in business inventories was close to zero that quarter,"" said Daniel Silver, an economist at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) in New York.

Tax revenues have proven more resilient than many forecast during the COVID-19 pandemic, and the reopening of almost every part of the economy from a third lockdown in recent months has led to a sharp rise in most categories.
VAT receipts, which are collected every second month, were 13.7% ahead of target for the month of September, a similar level to July when the hospitality sector opened again. That brought the cumulative VAT total for the year to date to 7.7% above forecast.
The amount of VAT collected so far this year is also 1% higher than in the first nine months of 2019, before the pandemic struck.
Corporate tax returns, which are mostly collected from the country's large multinational sector and have more than doubled to record levels since 2014, were 14.8% or 1 billion euros ahead of expectations at the end of September. 
The largest category, income tax, was 0.8% ahead of target.
With spending 3.2% below forecast, the exchequer recorded a lower deficit of 9.2 billion euros on a 12-month rolling basis.

1244,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 01, 2021 01:11PM ET</span>",U.S. consumer spending increases; inflation eroding households' buying power,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON(Reuters) - U.S. consumer spending surged in August, but outlays adjusted for inflation were weaker than initially thought in the prior month, reinforcing expectations that economic growth slowed in the third quarter as COVID-19 infections flared up.
The report from the Commerce Department on Friday, which showed inflation remaining hot in August, raised the risk of consumer spending stalling in the third quarter, even if spending accelerates further in September. Inflation-adjusted, or the so-called real consumer spending is what goes into the calculation of gross domestic product. 
""Third quarter consumer spending is on track for only a scant gain,"" said Tim Quinlan, a senior economist at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) in Charlotte, North Carolina. ""If COVID cases keep falling and sentiment turns positive, there is scope for a more solid finish to this tumultuous year."" 
Consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, rebounded 0.8% in August. Data for July was revised down to show spending dipping 0.1% instead of gaining 0.3% as previously reported. 
Consumption was boosted by a 1.2% rise in purchases of goods, reflecting increases in spending on food and household supplies as well as recreational items, which offset a drop in motor vehicle outlays. A global shortage of semiconductors is undercutting the production of automobiles. 
Goods spending fell 2.1% in July. Spending on services rose 0.6% in August, supported by housing, utilities and health care. Services, which account for the bulk of consumer spending, increased 1.1% in July. Spending is shifting back to services from goods, but the resurgence in coronavirus cases, driven by the Delta variant, crimped demand for air travel, hotel accommodation and sales at restaurants and bars.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast consumer spending increasing 0.6% in August. 
Inflation maintained its upward trend in August, though price pressures have probably peaked. The personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index, excluding the volatile food and energy components, climbed 0.3% after increasing by the same margin in July. In the 12 months through August, the so-called core PCE price index increased 3.6%, matching July's gain. 
The core PCE price index is the Federal Reserve's preferred inflation measure for its flexible 2% target. The U.S. central bank last week upgraded its core PCE inflation projection for this year to 3.7% from 3.0% back in June. 
The Fed said it would likely begin reducing its monthly bond purchases as soon as November and signaled interest rate increases may follow more quickly than expected. Fed Chair Jerome Powell, who has maintained that high inflation is transitory, told lawmakers on Thursday that he anticipated some relief in the months ahead. 
Still, inflation could remain high for a while. A survey from the Institute for Supply Management on Friday showed manufacturers experienced longer delays getting raw materials delivered to factories and paid higher prices for inputs in September. 
Stocks on Wall Street were higher. The dollar fell against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices were mixed.
SLOWING GROWTH
High inflation is cutting into spending. Real consumer spending rose 0.4% in August following a downwardly revised 0.5% drop in July. With the August and July data in hand, economists predicted that growth in consumer spending would probably brake to around a 1% annualized rate in the third quarter. 
Consumer spending grew at a robust 12.0% rate in the April-June quarter, accounting for much of the economy's 6.7% growth pace. The level of GDP is now above its peak in the fourth quarter of 2019. 
The Atlanta Fed cut its GDP estimate for the quarter to a 2.3% rate from a 3.2% pace. Slower growth was reinforced by a third report from the Commerce Department showing construction spending flat in August.
""Even with the softening growth picture, we continue to expect the Fed to announce the start of tapering at the early November meeting,"" said Michael Feroli, chief U.S. economist at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) in New York. 
The economy remains supported by record corporate profits. Households accumulated at least $2.5 trillion in excess savings during the pandemic. Coronavirus infections are trending down, which is already leading to a rise in demand for travel and other high-contact services. Businesses need to replenish depleted inventories, which will keep factories humming.
A fourth report from the University of Michigan showed consumer sentiment ticked higher for the first time in three months in September. But a survey from the Conference Board this week showed consumer confidence dropping to a seven-month low in September.
Though personal income gained only 0.2% in August after rising 1.1% in July as an increase in Child Tax Credit payments from the government was offset by decreases in unemployment insurance checks related to the pandemic, wages are rising as companies compete for scarce workers. Wages rose 0.5% in August, which should help to keep spending supported. 

With inflation high, real disposable income dropped 0.3% after increasing 0.7% in July. The saving rate fell to a still-high 9.4% from 10.1% in July.
""Households still have plenty left in the tank given rising employment and wages, soaring net worth and massive excess savings,"" said Sal Guatieri, a senior economist at BMO Capital Markets in Toronto. ""However, rising prices are eating into spending power, compounding the ongoing lack of supply.""

The Commerce Department said on Friday that the unchanged reading in construction spending followed a 0.3% gain in July. Construction spending increased 8.9% on a year-on-year basis in August. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast construction spending gaining 0.3%.
Spending on private construction projects slipped 0.1% after rising 0.2% in July. Outlays on residential construction advanced 0.4%, likely lifted by remodeling projects, after rising by the same margin in July. 
Single-family homebuilding spending fell 0.7% and outlays on multi-family housing projects dropped 0.8%. Homebuilding is being hampered by expensive building materials as well as land and labor shortages.

Investment in private non-residential construction like gas and oil well drilling declined 1.0% in August. 
Spending on public construction projects rose 0.5% in August, matching July's gain. Outlays on state and local government construction projects increased 0.8%, but federal government spending dropped 4.6%.

The Institute for Supply Management (ISM) said on Friday its index of national factory activity increased to a reading of 61.1 last month from 59.9 in August. 
A reading above 50 indicates expansion in manufacturing, which accounts for 12% of the U.S. economy. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the index falling to 59.6.
Some of the surprise rise in the ISM index, however, was due to a jump in the survey's measure of supplier deliveries to a reading of 73.4 last month from 69.5 in August. 
A reading above 50 percent indicates slower deliveries, but a lengthening in suppliers' delivery times is normally associated with a strong economy and increased customer demand, which would be a positive contribution to the ISM index. But in this case slower supplier deliveries indicate persistent supply shortages related to the COVID-19 pandemic. 
That was underscored by a rebound in the survey's measure of prices paid by manufacturers to a reading of 81.2 from an eight-month low of 79.4 in August. The Federal Reserve last week raised its projection for its key inflation measure to 3.7% this year. That was up from a median of 3.0% projected back in June. The U.S. central bank has a flexible 2% inflation target. 
Aside from the technical lift from the supplier deliveries measure, manufacturing is strong. 
The ISM survey's forward-looking new orders sub-index held at a reading of 66.7 last month. Manufacturing is being underpinned by businesses desperate to rebuild stocks after inventories were depleted in the first half of the year. 
The survey's measure of customer inventories remained in contraction territory in September. 

A gauge of factory employment rebounded last month after falling in August to its lowest level since November. That suggests manufacturing payrolls growth likely picked up in September after slowing in the prior month. 
The Labor Department is scheduled to issue its closely watched employment report next Friday.

""Material scarcity led to higher prices, shipping delays, and subsequent increases in incomplete work,"" Patel said. ""Anecdotal evidence suggests firms sought to clear their backlogs but a lack of skilled workers hindered productivity.""

The measure of outstanding business accumulated matched the series high from June 2018, rising to 56.6 from 55.6 in August, while the indexes for input prices and output prices climbed to the highest levels on record.

CHENNAI (Reuters) - Indian utilities are scrambling to secure coal supplies as inventories hit critical lows after a surge in power demand from industries and sluggish imports due to record global prices push power plants to the brink.
Over half of India's 135 coal-fired power plants have fuel stocks of less than three days, government data shows, far short of federal guidelines recommending supplies of at least two weeks. 
(Graphic: India's coal shortage crisis https://graphics.reuters.com/INDIA-COAL/SHORTAGE/zdvxoddbapx/chart_eikon.jpg) 
Prices of power-generation fuels are surging globally as electricity demand rebounds with industrial growth, tightening supplies of coal and liquefied natural gas.
India is competing against buyers such as China, the world's largest coal consumer, which is under pressure to ramp up imports amid a severe power crunch.
Rising oil, gas, coal and power prices are feeding inflationary pressures worldwide and slowing the economic recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic.
""The supply crunch is expected to persist, with the non-power sector facing the heat as imports remain the only option to meet demand but at rising costs,"" ratings agency S&P's unit CRISIL said in a report this week, adding it expected Asian coal prices to continue to increase. 
""Coal inventory at (Indian) thermal plants will improve only gradually by next March.""
Indian power producers locked in long-term agreements with distribution utilities cannot pass on higher input costs unless a clause to pass on such expenses is written into the contract.
Traders and officials at utilities said buying by power plants dependent of imported coal had been muted due to high prices. 
India's average weekly coal imports during August through late September - when global coal prices rallied over 40% to all-time highs - dropped by over 30% from the average for the first seven months of the year, according to data compiled by Kplr.
The import total for the most recent week was under 1.5 million tonnes, the smallest in at least two years. 
(Graphic: India coal imports by supplier - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/ce/gdpzyqlqrvw/IndiaCoalImportsbySupplier.png) 
Websites of major coal importing state utilities did not show any new tenders seeking new cargoes this month. 
Coal prices from major exporters have scaled all-time highs recently, with Australia's Newcastle prices rising roughly 50% and Indonesian export prices up 30% in the last three months.
The September Indonesia coal price benchmark was as much as seven times higher than similar quality fuel sold by Coal India to Indian utilities, according to Reuters calculations. 
""Traders who bought coal from Coal India in the spot auctions are making a killing. They are selling at 50-100% premiums,"" said a senior official in charge of sourcing coal at a large Indian utility operator.
State-run Coal India said this week higher global prices of coal and freight rates have pushed utilities dependent on imported coal to curtail power production, resulting in higher dependence on domestic coal-fired plants.
India is the world's second largest importer of coal despite having the fourth largest reserves. Utilities make up about three-fourths of its overall consumption, with Coal India accounting for over 80% of the country's production.
INDUSTRIAL POWER DEMAND SURGE
India's power plants are also grappling with surging demand from industries as economic activity rebounds from the latest wave of COVID-19 pandemic.
Power consumption in industrialised states including Maharashtra, Gujarat and Tamil Nadu grew between 13.9% and 21% in the three months ended September, a Reuters analysis of data from federal grid regulator POSOCO showed.
The three states account for nearly a third of India's annual electricity consumption. Industries and offices account for half the country's annual electricity consumption. During the last two quarters of the fiscal year ending March 2021, the residential and agricultural sectors were key drivers of power consumption after the first wave of coronavirus.

""This year we have seen a tremendous growth in industrial demand,"" said Shahmeena Husain, Managing Director of Gujarat's electricity regulator told Reuters.
While there have not been any large scale power outages in India, deficits have increased nearly four-fold from the negligible levels recorded last year, POSOCO data showed. 
The shortages have so far been mostly restricted to northern states such as Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and Kashmir, the data showed.

    ""Domestic consumption increased by about 10% in the last two years because of work from home and air conditioning,"" a senior Tamil Nadu government official told Reuters.
    ""Following opening up of industries after the second wave, industries are king,"" the official said.

MUMBAI (Reuters) - India's palm oil imports in September more than doubled from a year ago to a record 1.4 million tonnes as buyers increased purchases of refined palm oil ahead of key festivals and to take advantage of newly lowered duties, brokers and dealers said.
Higher purchases by India, the world's biggest buyer of vegetable oils, could support palm oil prices that are trading near a record high hit earlier this week.
The country's total vegetable oil imports in September jumped 72% from a year ago to a record 1.8 million tonnes, including more than 400,000 tonnes of refined palm oil, Sandeep Bajoria, chief executive of Sunvin Group, a vegetable oil broker, said.
""Imports jumped because of government decision to lower import tax and festive season demand,"" said Bajoria.
India lifted restrictions on imports of refined palm oil and slashed base import taxes on palm oil, soyoil and sunflower oil in recent months as New Delhi tries to cool near-record price rises.
Edible oil consumption usually jumps in the December quarter with the start of the wedding season as well as festivals like Dhanteras and Diwali.
Top palm oil producer Indonesia supplied a big chunk of India's palm oil imports in September as it was offering refined palm oil at a discount to number two supplier Malaysia, said a Mumbai-based dealer with a global trading firm.
Usually soybean oil expands its share of India's edible oil market from October as freshly harvest soybean supplies get processed, the dealer said.
""This year, excessive rainfall in September has delayed soybean harvesting. Besides, demand for local soymeal is weak since imported soymeal is available at lower prices,"" he said.
New Delhi in August allowed imports of 1.2 million tonnes of genetically modified (GM) soymeal for the first time to help the poultry industry after soymeal prices tripled in a year to a record high.
Sunflower oil imports in September surged 154% from a year ago 170,000 tonnes, while soyoil imports fell to 250,000 tonnes from 316,232 tonnes a year ago, dealers said.
The Solvent Extractors' Association of India, a Mumbai-based trade body, is likely to publish import number for September in mid-October.

India could import 1.2 to 1.3 million tonnes of vegetable oil in October and from November imports could moderate to 1 to 1.1 million tonnes, said another Mumbai-based dealer.
Demand from hotels, restaurants have been improving as people are stepping out with a drop in new coronavirus infections, the dealer said.

LONDON/TOKYO (Reuters) -Global manufacturing activity took a big hit from supply chain bottlenecks and escalating costs, exacerbated by pandemic-induced factory shutdowns in Asia and signs of slowing Chinese growth, surveys showed on Friday.
While countries where outbreaks of the Delta coronavirus variant receded saw an improvement in activity, growth shrank in some as chip shortages and supply disruptions impacted those still struggling to shake off the hit from COVID-19.
Euro zone and British manufacturing growth remained strong but activity suffered from logistical issues, product shortages and a labour crunch that are likely to persist and keep inflationary pressures high.
""Though some of the bottlenecks should soon start to ease, many sectors – most notably those requiring semiconductors – are likely to face disruption for much of 2022,"" said Martin Beck, senior economic advisor to the EY ITEM Club. 
""This signals activity is likely to remain constrained for some time to come.""
IHS Markit's final manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) sank to 58.6 in September from August's 61.4 and Britain's PMI fell for a fourth month in a row, dropping to 57.1 from 60.3. Anything above 50 indicates growth. [EUR/PMIM][GB/PMIM]
Factories in Germany, Europe's largest economy, had been humming along almost undisturbed during the pandemic lockdowns that have impacted the services sector but shortages of intermediate goods and some raw materials are now holding industry back.
Growth in French manufacturing weakened a tad more than initially forecast, its PMI showed, as problems over supplies of goods weighed on the industry.
Those supply bottlenecks kept pressure on the costs of the raw materials factories need and manufacturers passed some of those increases to customers and the euro zone output prices index approached the record high seen in the summer.

ASIAN STRAIN
China's waning economic momentum dealt a fresh blow to the region's growth prospects, with the official PMI on Thursday showing the country's factory activity unexpectedly shrank in September due to wider curbs on electricity use.
Although the private Caixin/Markit Manufacturing PMI fared better than expected after slumping in August, growing signs of weakness in the world's second-largest economy are clouding the outlook for neighbouring countries.
""While coronavirus curbs on economic activity may be gradually lifted, the slow pace at which this will happen means Southeast Asian economies will stagnate for the rest of this year,"" said Makoto Saito, an economist at NLI Research Institute. 
Manufacturers in Japan, the world's third-largest economy, faced pressure from pandemic restrictions and heightened supply chain disruptions as well as shortages of raw materials and delivery delays and its PMI marked its slowest pace of expansion since February.
Taiwan's factory activity continued to expand but at its slowest pace in over a year while Vietnam's index was unchanged.

""While regional PMIs showed that the disruption from large virus waves in the region is easing somewhat, unmet orders continue to pile up, meaning that the resulting shortages further down supply chains are set to remain for some time to come,"" said Alex Holmes, emerging Asia economist at Capital Economics.
Once seen as a driver of global growth, Asia's emerging economies are lagging advanced economies in recovering from the pandemic's pain as delays in vaccine rollouts and a spike in Delta variant cases hurt consumption and factory production.

The IHS Markit/CIPS UK Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index fell for a fourth month in a row, to 57.1 from 60.3 in August, although the final level was higher than a preliminary September reading of 56.3.
Delays in deliveries showed one of the biggest jumps in the PMI's history amid reports of freight delays, staff shortages, disruptions caused by COVID-19 and Brexit, a lack of delivery drivers and port delays.
New export work shrank for the first time in eight months and growth in jobs was the weakest since January with small manufacturers cutting staff.
Last week, the Bank of England revised down its expectations for economic growth in the third quarter of 2021 because of the supply constraints, which now also include fuel shortages caused by a lack of truck drivers.
The bottlenecks have pushed up prices and inflation for manufacturing inputs was not far off a record high in September.

The BoE said last week it expected consumer price inflation would top 4% at the end of the year, more than double its 2% target, strengthening the case for a first interest rate hike since the pandemic struck.
Despite their current problems, firms taking part in the PMI survey remained optimistic about the year ahead with 62% expecting growth in output.

Factories have struggled with logistical issues, product shortages and a labour crunch brought about in large part by ongoing disruptions caused by the coronavirus pandemic which forced governments to impose strict restrictions on mobility.
IHS Markit's final manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) sank to 58.6 in September from August's 61.4, and just below an initial 58.7 ""flash"" estimate.
An index measuring output, which feeds into a composite PMI due on Tuesday and is seen as a good guide to economic health, dropped from August's 59.0 to 55.6. Anything above 50 indicates growth.
""While euro zone manufacturing expanded at a robust pace in September, growth has weakened markedly as producers report a growing toll from supply chain headwinds,"" said Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit.
""Supply issues continue to wreak havoc across large swathes of European manufacturing, with delays and shortages being reported at rates not witnessed in almost a quarter of a century and showing no signs of any imminent improvement.""
Those bottlenecks kept pressure on the costs of the raw materials factories need. The input prices index only nudged down from August's 87.0 to 86.9.
However, factories passed some of those increases to customers and the output prices index approached the record high seen in the summer.

Inflation in the euro zone likely rose to 3.3% last month, preliminary official data is expected to show later on Friday, well above the European Central Bank's 2.0% target. 
Despite rising inflation the ECB will trim emergency bond purchases over this quarter, it said last month, taking a first small step towards unwinding the emergency aid that has propped up the bloc's economy during the coronavirus pandemic.

The IHS Markit Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) for Italian manufacturing came in at 59.7, down from a multi-year high of 60.9 in August but still far above the 50 mark that separates growth from contraction.
September's index reading, which marked the 15th consecutive month of factory growth, was above the median forecast of 59.4 in a Reuters survey of 20 analysts.
The new orders sub-index declined to 58.9 from 61.4 in August, after hitting a record high of 64.4 in May.

Unlike the larger services sector, factories in Italy have been spared the restrictions on business and movement imposed to try to rein in COVID-19 infections.
The government, in its Economic and Financial Document (DEF) presented this week, forecasts economic growth of 6.0% this year, a partial recovery following the record contraction of 8.9% in 2020 when the economy was hobbled by lockdowns.

IHS Markit's Final Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) for manufacturing, which accounts for about a fifth of Germany's economy, stood at 58.4, slightly lower than a flash reading of 58.5, and down from 62.6 in August.
Factories in Europe's biggest economy have been humming along during the pandemic almost undisturbed by lockdowns that have impacted the services sector, and activity accelerated early this year on strong demand from the United States and China.
But shortages of intermediate goods like semiconductors and some raw materials have held back the sector, where companies worried that shortages will drag on into next year have started to report ebbing growth expectations.
Growth in new orders dropped to a 15-month low.
""Supply bottlenecks continue to drive up input costs and, in turn, put pressure on manufacturers to raise prices, which is acting as another headwind to growth,"" said Phil Smith, Economics Associate Director at IHS Markit.
""The rate of input price inflation looks like it might have peaked but is still running close to the fastest in the survey's history, leading to near-record numbers of goods producers to raise prices,"" he added.

Data compiler IHS Markit said its final purchasing managers' index (PMI) for the French manufacturing sector in September fell to 55.0 points from 57.5 in August.
The index remained above the 50-point line dividing an expansion in activity from a contraction, but the final number for September was a bit weaker than the 55.2 points figure given in an initial, flash forecast.
Problems with global shipping and transport, caused partly by strict COVID-19 checks at Chinese ports and other disruptions to global supply chains during the pandemic, have resulted in many of the world's companies not getting key supplies of goods on time. 
Earlier this month, consulting firm AlixPartners said global automakers could lose $210 billion in revenue this year because of supply chain disruptions, such as shortages of semiconductors.

""September survey data show us that the intense supply-side imbalances are now starting to seriously impede the French manufacturing sector and are even affecting the demand-side of the economy too,"" said IHS Markit senior economist Joe Hayes.
""It's clear that manufacturing growth is easing, with little signs that the situation is going to improve in the immediate future,"" added Hayes.

IHS Markit's Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) for manufacturing in Spain fell to 58.1 for September, from 59.5 in August. However, the reading was well above the 50.0 mark that indicates an expansion in activity and was not far from June's reading of 60.4, which was the highest in more than two decades.
""Growth is clearly being restrained by severe and ongoing supply-side delays, which show little sign of dissipating,"" IHS Markit's economist Paul Smith said.
Supply chain disruptions and mismatches between supply and demand for raw materials contributed to input price increases, which in turn encouraged manufacturers to build up inventories and hence produce even more.
Companies reported demand was still strengthening as some clients were making advance orders to protect against delivery delays.
The Spanish statistics department INE downgraded second quarter economic growth to 1.1% earlier this week from an initial 2.8%, raising concern about the recovery's speed.

Spain's economy had shrunk 0.4% in the first quarter after increasing cases of COVID-19 forced renewed curbs on business activity.
The government expects the economy to grow 6.5% this year after 2020's record 10.8% contraction.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's business mood improved for a fifth straight quarter in September with manufacturers perking up on robust global demand, a central bank survey showed on Friday, boding well for the next administration's bid to pull the economy out of the doldrums.
Steady progress in vaccinations and hopes of a re-opening in economic activity also helped lift non-manufacturers' mood, the survey showed, underscoring the Bank of Japan's view an end to state of emergency curbs will prop up consumption.
But manufacturers expect business conditions to worsen three months ahead as parts shortages and Asian factory shutdowns disrupt production, the survey showed, underscoring the fragile nature of Japan's export-reliant recovery.
""Automakers' sentiment worsened, which is negative. But that's offset by strength in electric machinery and capital expenditure thanks to continued expansion in global IT demand,"" said Takumi Tsunoda, senior economist at Shinkin Central Bank Research Institute.
""Supply constraints are affecting broader sectors with parts from Asia in short supply,"" he said. ""Disruptions in domestic production could broaden beyond automakers.""
The headline index gauging big manufacturers' sentiment stood at plus 18 in July-September, up from plus 14 in the previous quarter and exceeding market forecasts for plus 13, the Bank of Japan's (BOJ) closely-watched tankan survey showed.
Big non-manufacturers' sentiment index improved to plus 2 from plus 1 in June, beating a median market forecast for a flat reading and posting a fifth straight quarter of improvement.
The survey bodes well for Fumio Kishida, who succeeds Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga next week with a mandate to revitalise the economy and distribute more wealth to households.
With most companies having sent in replies by Sept. 10, the survey did not factor in much of the government's decision to lift all coronavirus state of emergency on Thursday.
Nevertheless, retailers, restaurants and hotels were less gloomy about business conditions three months ahead reflecting hopes over an economic re-opening, the survey showed.
Some big firms in sectors like steel and oil saw conditions improve thanks to progress in passing on higher costs to their clients, a BOJ official told a briefing.
The tankan's indices showed more companies seeing increases in both input and output prices, suggesting that rising raw material costs may gradually prop up consumer inflation ahead.
Large companies expect to increase capital expenditure by 10.1% in the current fiscal year ending March 2022, the survey showed, backing up the BOJ's view robust corporate-sector activity will offset some of the weakness in consumption.
The survey will be among factors the BOJ will scrutinise when it meets for a rate review on Oct. 27-28 and revises its quarterly growth and inflation projections.
""What the BOJ focuses on in projecting the outlook are corporate profits and capital expenditure plans,"" said Mari Iwashita, chief market economist at Daiwa Securities.
""Looking at these metrics ... the BOJ will probably maintain its forecast of a moderate recovery,"" she said.
Analysts, however, pointed to some worrying signs. Big automakers' sentiment worsened to minus 7, the lowest level since December 2020, due to the hit from supply disruptions.

The fallout is likely to broaden in coming months with sectors such as steelmakers and small parts makers already complaining of worsening conditions ahead, the survey showed.
Slowing Chinese growth and output disruptions caused by Asian factory shutdowns led to a slowdown in Japan's manufacturing activity in September, and was a point of discussion among BOJ policymakers at a recent meeting.

New-home prices in 100 cities rose 0.14% in September from a month earlier, down from 0.2% growth in August, according to data from China Index Academy, one of the country's largest independent real estate research firms.
In September, some cities intensified their campaigns to drive speculators out of the property market, taking more targeted steps such as caps on speculation on school district properties.
Regulators in the northeastern city of Shenyang and southern city of Haikou, in late September, urged real estate developers and agencies to refrain from hyping homes in school districts.
""We expect the ongoing property curbs are unlikely to be eased in the near term, as Beijing has attached national strategic importance to reining in property bubbles, directly intervening in credit supply for the property sector, leaving it little room to dial back these curbs"", Nomura said in a recent note.
Prices in the biggest tier-one cities such as Shanghai and Beijing rose 0.16%, quickening from August's 0.11% gain.
Monthly new-home prices in tier-two cities including provincial capitals grew 0.17% following August's 0.31% uptick, and rose 0.1% in tier-three and tier-four cities versus a 0.12% gain in August. 
On an annual basis, overall new-home prices rose 3.4% in September, compared with August's 3.51% gain. 
Sentiment in China's property market has been rocked by concerns of default risks among real estate firms as the debt crisis at property giant China Evergrande Group deepened. 

China's central bank on Monday vowed to protect consumers exposed to the property sector and injected more cash into the banking system as the Shenzhen government began investigating the wealth management unit of Evergrande.

September's reading was the sixth-highest registered since the survey began in 1998 and the survey showed a ""very strong rebound"" in the sector was continuing, AIB chief economist Oliver Mangan said. 
But it also showed signs that Ireland was subject to similar trends to the rest of Europe where shortages of raw materials, key inputs and labour were holding back manufacturing activity, Mangan said. 

While sub-indices measuring output, new orders and employment all fell, input and output prices both hit record highs. 
Difficulty hiring workers, order backlogs, supply chain delays and lengthening delivery times all contributed to inflationary pressures, Mangan said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits rose further last week as California moved more people to another program following the expiration of government-funded aid early this month to maximize their access to assistance.
The labor market recovery remains intact, with the report from the Labor Department on Thursday showing unemployment rolls steadily shrinking in mid-September. California announced on Sept. 17 that about 340,000 people on the Pandemic Emergency Unemployment Compensation (PEUC) program, which expired on Sept. 4, had been transferred to the Federal State Extended Duration program that remained in effect until Sept. 11. 
California's Employment Development Department said the transfer, which allowed PEUC claimants to collect one additional week of benefits, would show a large increase in claims filed, even though it reflected an existing claimant moving from one program to another. The PEUC was part of expanded unemployment programs which were funded by the federal government to cushion the blow of the COVID-19 pandemic on unemployed Americans. 
Aside from the California distortions, a resurgence in COVID-19 infections, driven by the Delta variant of the coronavirus, could have caused a modest rise in claims as some companies in the high-contact services industries laid off workers because of reduced demand. Infections are subsiding, leading to a pickup in economic activity.
""The increase in initial claims is less concerning than it may appear,"" said Ryan Sweet, a senior economist at Moody's (NYSE:MCO) Analytics in West Chester, Pennsylvania. ""The rise in new filings in California could be capturing refiles.""
Initial claims for state unemployment benefits rose 11,000 to a seasonally adjusted 362,000 for the week ended Sept. 25. That was the third straight weekly increase. 
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast 335,000 applications for the latest week. Unadjusted claims, which economists say offer a better read of the labor market, fell 8,326 to 298,255 last week. 
Claims in California increased 17,978 last week, adding to the 17,218 rise in the prior week. There was also a rise in applications in Michigan last week, likely related to the idling of assembly plants by some automakers as they try to manage their supply of semiconductors amid a global shortage. 
Claims in Texas also rose significantly, probably linked to high coronavirus cases in the state. But there were big declines in filings in Virginia, Maryland, Arizona, Ohio and Louisiana. Claims, which have dropped from a record 6.149 million in early April 2020, remain above their pre-pandemic levels. 
Stocks on Wall Street were trading lower, leaving the benchmark S&P 500 on course to snap its seven-month winning streak. The dollar slipped against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices fell. 
Jobless claims: https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-STOCKS/lbvgngxxwpq/joblessclaims.png 
UNEMPLOYMENT ROLLS SHRINKING
The claims report also showed the number of people continuing to receive benefits after an initial week of aid dropped 18,000 to 2.802 million in the week ended Sept. 18, a sign that more people were finding work. 
The so-called continuing claims covered the week during which the government surveyed households for September's unemployment rate. Continuing claims decreased slightly between the August and September survey periods. 
The unemployment rate was at 5.2% in August. The claims data is being watched for signs of how soon a shortage of workers, which is constraining hiring, will start easing after the expiration of the expanded benefits.
Businesses and Republicans blamed those benefits for keeping the unemployed at home. There were a record 10.9 million open jobs at the end of July. More than 6 million people are estimated to have lost their pandemic benefits on Sept. 6. 
The total number of people collecting unemployment checks under all programs tumbled to 5.028 million during the week ended Sept. 11 from 11.250 million in the prior week.
""So far, there has been little evidence that enhanced benefits were significantly holding back workers from re-entering the labor force,"" said Isfar Munir, an economist at  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) in New York. ""Employment has grown similarly in states that ended the benefits early and those that ended them later."" 
The economy created 235,000 jobs in August, the fewest in seven months. Lack of childcare, fears of contracting the coronavirus and pandemic-related career changes have been blamed for the worker shortage. 
Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell told lawmakers on Thursday that caretakers and retirees made up most of the shortfall in labor force participation. Powell said he was optimistic that a big chunk of retirees would return to the labor force. 
A separate report from the Commerce Department on Thursday showed the economy grew at a slightly faster 6.7% annualized rate in the second quarter, revised up from the 6.6% pace reported in August. Growth was driven by pandemic relief money from the government, which boosted consumer spending. The economy grew at a 6.3% rate in the first quarter. 
GDP: https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-STOCKS/akvezqllopr/gdp.png
Growth appears to have slowed in the third quarter because of the Delta variant as well as shortages of raw materials, which have hurt motor vehicle sales and constrained home building and purchases. Gross domestic product estimates for the third quarter are below a 5% rate.

""The economy is set to regain traction after a late summer lull,"" said Lydia Boussour, lead U.S. economist at Oxford Economics in New York. 
""We expect a slowly improving health situation, solid household finances, a rebuild of inventories and additional fiscal stimulus will support growth momentum in 2022.""

DUBLIN (Reuters) -Ireland on Thursday doubled its forecast for economic growth this year but will not increase its budget package for 2021 as it aims to get the public finances in ""far safer"" shape than previously expected, Finance Minister Paschal Donohoe said on Thursday.
Finance ministry chief economist John McCarthy said he would not read too much into forecast gross domestic product growth of 15.6% this year due to the ways multinationals can distort Irish GDP. He said he would instead focus on the expected 5.2% growth in modified domestic demand.
GDP jumped 21.6% year-on-year in the second quarter as Ireland emerged from one of Europe's strictest lockdown, while modified domestic demand - which strips out some of the ways multinationals can distort the data - grew by 15% over the same period.
The finance ministry also expects unemployment to be around one percentage point lower for each of the next three years, falling to 7.2% in 2022 and 5.3% in 2024. 
Inflation is expected to peak above 4% in the final quarter of the year before falling back below 2% in the third quarter of 2022, the forecasts showed. 
The government decided in July to narrow its budget deficit more gradually than planned in order to increase capital spending in particular on housing and climate change.
Donohoe said he would not use the better than expected growth to further increase the amount of money available for spending hikes and tax cuts in the Oct. 12 announcement of the budget for 2022.

Public Expenditure Minister Michael McGrath also said government departments are unlikely to spend the record 90.7 billion euros allocated for 2021, raising the prospect of a markedly narrower budget deficit than the 5.1% forecast in July.
Donohoe is due to update the deficit and debt forecasts at or ahead of the budget, taking account of spending and tax figures for September that are due to be published on Monday.

An air of chaos has gripped the world's fifth-largest economy in recent days as a deficit of truckers left fuel pumps dry across the land, and a spike in European wholesale natural gas prices tipped energy companies into bankruptcy.
The United Kingdom is short of around 100,000 truckers after tens of thousands returned to the European Union during the Brexit maelstrom and 40,000 truck driver tests were cancelled during the COVID-19 lockdowns.
At Clacket Lane service station beside London's M25 orbital motorway, drivers from Britain, France, Germany, Poland, Latvia, Lithuania, Portugal, Romania, Russia and Turkey were parked up to rest after journeys from every corner of Europe.
Over the faint whiff of sewage, cigarette smoke and diesel fumes in the truck park, scores of drivers told Reuters in several different tongues that wages would have to rise.
They spoke of a hard and lonely life on the road: filthy showers, high parking fees, nights disturbed by thieves wielding knives, illegal migrants seeking a secret ride, and of the pain of divorce after years spent far from wives and children.
""Wages will have to go up so prices for everything we deliver, everything you buy on the shelves, will have to go up too,"" said Craig Holness, a 51-year-old British trucker with 27 years of experience, who was parked up for a break.
Rising trucker pay may give an insight into a riddle that is bothering investors: whether or not the world is on the cusp of persistent price rises after the splurge by governments and central banks during the COVID crisis.
Sterling has fallen on fears the trucker shortage could crimp economic growth, forecast at 7% this year. Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey said on Wednesday he was focused on the inflationary effects from supply shortages including of labour.
Haulier companies and recruitment agencies are battling to fill trucker jobs: One was advertising for a heavy goods vehicle (HGV) Class 1 driver for 75,000 pounds ($102,500) per annum, the highest level the recruiter had ever heard of.
""With HGV drivers, we're now paying them 40% more than we were four months ago,"" Jordan Francis, the commercial director of recruitment agency ProDrive, told Reuters.
He recalled a driver whose pay per hour had increased to 22.50 pounds per hour from 14.00 pounds per hour in March. Sign-on bonuses of 1,000 are being offered too.
'MARRIAGE KILLER'
Holness said the shortage of drivers would not ease any time soon because conditions were so poor that many young people refused to do it. 
While trying to snatch some sleep recently near West Bromwich in central England, thieves sliced an 11-foot hole in his canvas causing hours of delay and stress. 
""Who wants to be a lorry driver - you'd be better tapping away on a keyboard wouldn't you? Kids these days don't want to know,"" said Holness. ""I want to get out."" 
He suggested Johnson, who was educated at Eton, Britain's most exclusive school, and Oxford, its most exclusive university, should spend several days trucking to understand the issues.
""You are just treated like the scum of the earth basically,"" said Phil, a 52-year-old British truck driver from Malvern in central England, who has just had what he termed a significant pay rise. ""Prices will increase.""
He said many truck stops reeked of urine and faeces - and the job gave limited time to see family.
""It's a marriage killer,"" he said. 
The government on Sunday announced a plan to issue temporary visas for 5,000 foreign truck drivers. None of the truck drivers interviewed by Reuters thought many would take up the offer.
""It is tough work and youngsters don't want it,"" said Anton Pogodin, a 37-year-old truck driver originally from Omsk, in Siberia, who now drives from Portugal. 
But in Bucharest, some Romanian truckers were tempted by the offer.
'BREXIT CHAOS'
British ministers have repeatedly denied that Brexit has caused the trucker shortage but many EU drivers blamed just that for prompting so many eastern European drivers to head for the exit.
""No one else has these kind of problems that you're finding here,"" said Belgian driver Patrice Rese, 65. ""It's because of Brexit.""
""Best of luck to you Monsieur Johnson,"" he quipped.
Miguel Brunel, a 41-year-old driver from Bethune in northern France, questioned the logic of replacing so many British drivers with those from eastern Europe only to then essentially prompt those drivers to leave.
""If they had maintained a market of English drivers rather than replacing them from drivers from Eastern Europe, they wouldn't be in this position,"" said Brunel in French.

""This is chaos,"" he said.

The move comes as Brazil faces a rising inflation boosted by high energy and food prices, which has been affecting President Jair Bolsonaro's popularity prior to next year's presidential election.
Petroleo Brasileiro SA, as the company is formally known, said in a securities filing that details of the program are still under evaluation, including which families should receive the benefit and a search for potential partners.
Petrobras CEO Joaquim Silva e Luna said it reinforces the company's ""social role"" amid the outcomes of the COVID-19 pandemic, which is seen by the state-run firm as an ""exceptional and emergency situation"".

Luna had said in a press conference earlier this week that the company does not intend to change its fuel pricing policies. Two people close to the company told Reuters, however, that he was in Brasilia during the weekend to discuss with government officials potential measures to cushion the blow of rising prices.

The government will pay firms a total of 9,000 baht ($266) for each worker over a three-month period from November, aiming to retain 5.04 million jobs, the agency said after a national economic task force meeting chaired by the prime minister.
The support will be for about 480,000 companies employing up to 200 Thai workers, which must retain at least 95% of employees, the planning agency said.
It also said the government was aiming to draw 1 million foreign tourists during the final quarter of 2021 and the first quarter of next year, with spending of at least 60 billion baht.

Thailand will soon reopen to more vaccinated arrivals, waiving a longstanding quarantine requirement, in a bid to revive tourism, an industry that typically accounts for 11-12% of gross domestic product and employs about 20% of the nation's workforce.

Retail sales in August rose 11.9% from a year earlier to HK$28.6 billion ($3.67 billion), government data showed on Thursday. August's increase compared with a revised 2.8% growth in July.
""The CVS should continue to bode well for local consumption sentiment in the rest of the year,"" a government spokesman said, referring to electronic vouchers given to certain consumers to spend in shops.
In volume terms, retail sales in August grew 10.6% from a year earlier compared with a revised 0.7% surge the previous month.
For the first eight months of 2021, total retail sales increased 8.1% in value terms and rose 6.8% in volume.
Online retail sales in August jumped 16.5% in value year-on-year compared with a revised growth of 28.8% in July.
Sales of jewellery, watches, clocks and valuable gifts, which before the pandemic relied heavily on tourists from the mainland, climbed 28% in August versus a revised 26.3% surge in July, the data showed.
Clothing, footwear and allied products rose 40.1% in August against a revised 30.9% growth in July.
Tourist arrivals in August soared 143% from a year earlier to 10,811 after three straight months of decline. That compared with a 57.9% drop in July.
""Keeping the epidemic under control remains pivotal to a full-fledged recovery of the retail sector and the overall economy,"" the spokesman said, adding it was essential to strive towards more widespread coronavirus vaccinations.

The city's economy grew 7.6% in the second quarter from a COVID-induced slump a year earlier and the government upgraded its growth forecast for 2021 to 5.5%-6.5% from 3.5%-5.5%.

1268,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 30, 2021 04:45AM ET</span>",UK economy bounced back by more than thought in Q2 before slowdown,"By William Schomberg and Andy Bruce
LONDON (Reuters) -Britain's economy grew by more than previously thought in the April-June period before what looks like a sharp slowdown more recently as post-lockdown bottlenecks, including a shortage of truck drivers, mount.
Gross domestic product increased by 5.5% in the second quarter, the Office for National Statistics said, stronger than its preliminary estimate of growth of 4.8%. 
The ONS said the data had been adjusted to take account of more complete data from the health sector as well as an update of its sources and methodology for calculating output. 
The revision means Britain is no longer the worst-performing economy among Group of Seven developed countries, when comparing GDP in the summer of 2021 with its level at the end of 2019. It is now tied with Germany and above Italy.
The figures provided a more complete picture of Britain's swift economic bounce-back from its coronavirus lockdown earlier this year, but there are now signs of a loss of momentum due to shortages of supplies and staff as the global economy reopens.
""While the upward revisions to GDP are clearly welcome, Q2 was three months ago, and the recovery appears to have stagnated since,"" Ruth Gregory, an economist at Capital Economics, said.
""Even so, given that there is now thought to be less spare capacity in the economy that will only encourage the Bank of England to hike rates in the not too distant future.""
On Wednesday, BoE Governor Andrew Bailey said he thought the economy would regain its pre-pandemic level of output in early 2022 - a month or two later than the BoE had forecast in August. 
Despite the slowdown, the British central bank has signalled that it is moving towards a first interest rate hike since the pandemic as it expects inflation to head above 4%.
Thursday's data showed households increased their spending by more than 7% in the April-June period and they dipped into their coronavirus lockdown savings to fund it.
The savings ratio, which measures the income households saved as a proportion of their total available disposable income, fell to 11.7% from 18.4% in the first quarter of 2020, the ONS said. 
GDP growth was driven by the services sector, especially in the accommodation and food industry where output rose by 87.6% in quarterly terms as it reopened from lockdown.
Manufacturing output rose by 1.8% in the second quarter, despite a shortage of microchips hurting car production. Food and beverage manufacturing performed strongly.
The ONS said construction output had broadly returned to its pre-pandemic level.

The data also showed that Britain's current account deficit with the rest of the world held steady at 8.6 billion pounds in the second quarter, equivalent to 1.5% of gross domestic product. In the first quarter, the shortfall was 1.6% of GDP.
Excluding volatile trade in precious metals, the deficit widened to 1.8% of GDP from 0.2% in the first quarter, due to a worsening of Britain's trade balance and a fall in earnings on foreign investments.

Investing.com – China’s factory activity contracted in September for the first time since COVID-19 began in 2020, with an electricity crunch inflicting further damage on an economic recovery that is already slowing down.
Data released earlier in the day by the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) showed that September’s manufacturing purchasing managers index (PMI) was at 49.6, lower than the 50.1 figure in both forecasts prepared by Investing.com and reported in the previous month.
The Caixin manufacturing PMI was at 50, higher than the 49.5 in forecasts prepared by Investing.com and August’s 49.2 figure. The improvement was thanks to firmer domestic demand and an increase in new orders, as export sales continued to decline, Caixin Insight Group said in a statement.
The contraction was due to factors including a sluggish performance of energy-intensive industries, NBS senior statistician Zhao Qinghe said in a statement. A widespread power crunch in China that has already forced at least 20 provinces to restrict electricity use in September, is threatening to slow economic growth and disrupt global supply chains.
The data “offered the first glimpse of the cost from the energy crunch and, for the manufacturing sector, it’s substantial. The manufacturing PMI dropped into contraction. The services sector staged a comeback but is by no means recovering strongly,” according to Bloomberg Economics' Chang Shu and David Qu.
Meanwhile, the “weak PMI sent an alarm to the government. The big question is whether the government monetary and fiscal policies will become more supportive now or if the government will wait till the year-end to change the policies,” Pinpoint Asset Management Ltd. chief economist Zhang Zhiwei told Bloomberg.
The NBS data also showed that the non-manufacturing PMI was at 53.2, higher than the 47.5 reported in August.
In the services sector, spending during the recent Mid-Autumn Festival holiday gave it a small boost. However, tourism revenue and travel remained below pre-COVID-19 levels, signs that consumer confidence remains weak after recent COVID-19 outbreaks led to strict restrictive measures."
1271,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 29, 2021 11:31PM ET</span>","China manufacturing unexpectedly shrinks, services offer support","BEIJING (Reuters) -China's factory activity unexpectedly shrank in September due to wider curbs on electricity use and elevated input prices, while services returned to expansion as COVID-19 outbreaks receded, offering some relief to the world's second-biggest economy. 
The official manufacturing Purchasing Manager's Index (PMI) was at 49.6 in September versus 50.1 in August, data from the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) showed on Thursday, slipping into contraction for the first time since February 2020. 
Analysts in a Reuters poll had expected the index to remain steady at 50.1, unchanged from the previous month. The 50-point mark separates growth from contraction. 
China's economy rapidly recovered from a pandemic-induced slump last year, but momentum has weakened in recent months, with its sprawling manufacturing sector hit by rising costs, production bottlenecks and electricity rationing.
Rising COVID-19 cases in tens of cities over the summer also disrupted the manufacturing and the services sectors, though the latter is starting to bounce back as the outbreaks receded.
A sub-index for factory output contracted in September for the first time since February last year, dragged down by a pullback in high-energy consuming industries, such as plants that process metals and oil products. The gauge stood at 49.6 versus 50.1 a month earlier. 
""In September, due to factors such as low volumes of business at high energy-consuming industries, the manufacturing PMI fell below the critical point,"" said Zhao Qinghe, a senior NBS statistician, in an accompanying statement.
""The two indexes of high energy-consuming industries ...are both lower than 45.0, indicating a significant drop in supply and demand.""
GROWTH OUTLOOK
The sudden contraction in factory activity will further weigh on an economy already hit by curbs on its property and tech sectors and facing many growth downgrades by private-sector economists.
Other economies in Asia are also grappling with production issues due to supply chain disruptions, with data on Thursday showing Japan's industrial output falling for a second straight month in August.
""(Chinese) economic growth in Q4 will likely slow further without a change of government policies, and the pace of slowdown may pick up,"" said Zhiwei Zhang, Shenzhen-based chief economist at Pinpoint Asset Management, after the PMI data was released. 
""The big question is whether the government's monetary and fiscal policies will become more supportive now or if the government will wait till the year-end to change the policies.""
The central bank last eased its requirements on how much cash banks should hold in mid-July, just before a surge in domestic COVID-19 cases. 
The People's Bank of China (PBOC) has left its benchmark lending rate for corporate and household loans unchanged for the 17th month in September.
HIGH PRODUCTION COSTS 
A shortage of coal, tougher emissions standards and strong demand from manufacturers and industry pushed coal prices to record highs and triggered widespread curbs on electricity usage in at least 20 provinces and regions.
Higher raw material prices, especially of metals and semiconductors, have also pressured profits of manufacturers. Earnings at China's industrial firms in August slowed for the sixth straight month.
A sub-index for raw material costs rose to 63.5 in September from 61.3 a month earlier, while a gauge of new orders came in at 49.3 compared with 49.6 in August, shrinking for the second straight month. 
A sub-index for employment remained in contraction, at 47.8 versus 47.0 a month earlier. 
A separate private survey also released on Thursday that focuses on small and export-oriented businesses showed that factory activity in September neither expanded nor contracted.
On a more sanguine note, the official non-manufacturing PMI in September was at 53.2, bouncing back from 47.5 in August, data from the NBS showed, as COVID-19 outbreaks receded after rising during the summer months.

Last month, COVID-19-related restrictions drove services sector activity into sharp contraction for the first time since the height of the pandemic last year.
The official September composite PMI, which includes both manufacturing and services activity, stood at 51.7 versus 48.9 in August.

The Caixin/Markit Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) rose to 50.0 in September from 49.2 the month before, versus analyst expectations of 49.5 in a Reuters poll. The 50-mark separates growth from contraction on a monthly basis. 
The Chinese economy recovered rapidly from a pandemic-induced slump last year but has since lost steam, with its sprawling manufacturing sector hit by COVID-19 outbreaks, higher costs, production bottlenecks, and more recently, power rationing. 
China is in the grip of a power crunch due to a shortage of coal, tougher emissions standards, and strong demand from industry, triggering widespread curbs on electricity usage.
The output sub-index showed production fell for a second consecutive month but at a slower pace.
""The resurgence of the epidemic in several regions and shortfalls in raw material supplies slowed production at manufacturing companies,"" said Wang Zhe, senior economist at Caixin Insight Group, in comments released alongside the data. 
China has also been dealing with ongoing small-scale coronavirus outbreaks in the southeastern province of Fujian and Heilongjiang province in the country's northeast.
""Surveyed enterprises said the rise in costs was mainly caused by a sharp increase in the prices of energy, industrial metals and electronic raw materials,"" said Wang.
New export orders slipped faster into contraction, the data showed, hitting the lowest level since February, as overseas demand cooled. Factories continued to lay off workers and at a quicker pace. 
""The demand for consumer goods was weak, reflecting consumers' lack of purchasing power,"" said Wang, adding that demand for intermediate goods was higher. 

A sub-index for new orders returned to expansion. Input prices rose at the fastest pace since May. 
Higher raw material prices, especially of metals and semiconductors, have also pressured profits. Earnings at industrial firms slowed for a sixth month in August.

The official manufacturing purchasing managers’ index declined to 49.6 from 50.1 in August, the National Bureau of Statistics said Thursday, below the 50 median estimate in a Bloomberg survey of economists. Readings below the 50-mark signal a contraction in output.
The non-manufacturing gauge, which measures activity in construction and services sectors, improved to 53.2, well above the consensus forecast of 49.8.
China is facing a widespread power crunch that threatens to slow economic growth and disrupt global supply chains just ahead of the year-end Christmas shopping season. At least 20 provinces have restricted electricity use in September, curbing factory production on everything from aluminum and steel to toys and clothing. 
The electricity shock adds to a slew of headwinds already hitting the economy: the financial system is under stress because of China Evergrande Group’s debt crisis; high commodity prices have squeezed industrial profits; the government has cracked down on industries from property to the internet; and consumer spending remains weak due to virus outbreaks.

The KBC Bank Ireland consumer sentiment eased to 86.4 in September from 86.5 in August. It reached a coronavirus pandemic-high of 87.2 in June as restaurants and pubs began to reopen following the country's third and longest shutdown. 

The weakest elements of the survey were related to the macroeconomic environment in part due to concerns about an international plan to set minimum corporate tax rates, which some fear could threaten a pillar of the country's economic policy, said KBC Ireland chief economist Austin Hughes.
""Irish consumer sentiment held broadly steady in September as a focus on potential threats to the economic outlook ranging from global taxation changes to elevated public debt contrasted with evidence of further progress out of the pandemic,"" Hughes said.

1275,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 29, 2021 07:20PM ET</span>",Britons turn more pessimistic about outlook for economy,"LONDON (Reuters) - People in Britain have turned more pessimistic about the economy amid growing pressure on household budgets from rising energy prices and broader inflation, according to an opinion poll published on Thursday.
Twenty-eight percent of respondents in the poll by Kantar Public said they thought the economy would be in a worse state in 12 months' time, up from 20% in August. Those who thought it would be doing better fell by six points to 24%.
More than half were worried about not being able to keep their home warm enough this winter while three in 10 said they were finding it harder to meet their household budgets than a year ago, an increase of six points from August.
Wholesale natural gas prices have doubled over the past month, leading to the collapse of several smaller British energy suppliers. Regulated household energy prices are set to rise steeply next month, and probably again in April. 
Last week, the Bank of England raised its forecast for inflation which it now expects to peak at above 4% and it lowered its estimate for economic growth in the third quarter, in large part due to post-lockdown bottlenecks in supply chains.
Kantar Public said it interviewed 1,089 people between Sept. 23 and Sept. 27. 
A separate report showed slower growth among businesses in the three months to September although activity was still above its long-run average.

The Confederation of British Industry's growth balance - based on surveys of manufacturers, retailers and other services firms - dropped to +27 from +34 in the three months to August, with the biggest fall in consumer services and distribution.
""The private sector recovery has slowed this month as the immediate boost provided by loosening COVID-19 restrictions fades amidst a mix of labour and materials shortages, and supply chain disruption,"" CBI deputy chief economist Anna Leach said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -Contracts to buy U.S. previously owned homes rebounded to a seven-month high in August, but higher prices as supply remains tight are slowing the housing market momentum.
Other data on Wednesday showed applications for loans to buy a house fell last week as mortgage rates increased after the Federal Reserve signaled it would likely begin reducing its monthly bond purchases as soon as November. There are indications that supply could improve in the fall. 
""Supply constraints that are boosting prices are impacting affordability and have been a headwind for buyers,"" said Rubeela Farooqi, chief U.S. economist at High Frequency Economics in White Plains, New York. ""Gradually easing supply constraints should be a positive, although affordability concerns could temper sales in the very near term.""
The National Association of Realtors (NAR) said its Pending Home Sales Index, based on signed contracts, jumped 8.1% last month to 119.5. That was the highest reading since January and followed two straight monthly declines.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast contracts, which become sales after a month or two, increasing 1.4%. Compared with a year ago, pending home sales fell 8.3% in August. 
The housing market boomed early in the COVID-19 pandemic amid an exodus from cities as people worked from home and took classes online. But the pandemic tailwind is fading as vaccines allow workers to return to offices. 
Expensive homes are also sidelining some first-time buyers from the market. The NAR reported last week that the share of first-time buyers was the smallest in more than 2-1/2 years in August. Existing home sales dropped last month.
Data on Tuesday showed consumer sentiment towards buying a home weakening for a third straight month in September and house prices posting record gains in July from a year-ago.
Lumber prices have plummeted from record highs scaled in May, which economists and realtors hope will encourage builders to ramp-up construction of single-family homes. The resumption of foreclosures after a pandemic moratorium is also expected to ease the inventory crunch. 
But house prices are likely to remain elevated, which together with rising mortgage rates could further erode affordability. In a separate report on Wednesday, the Mortgage Bankers Association said applications for loans to buy a home fell 1.2% last week from the prior week.
Loan purchase applications were down 12% from a year ago. According to the MBA, mortgage rates across all loan types increased since last Wednesday's announcement by the Fed, with the benchmark 30-year fixed rate reaching its highest level since early July. 
The U.S. central bank's massive monthly bond buying program to aid the economy's recovery from the pandemic has helped to keep mortgage rates low. With U.S. Treasury yields rising in recent days, mortgage rates could creep higher, which could draw some buyers into the market in anticipation of further rises.

""We anticipate home sales will trend sideways over the remainder of 2021,"" said Mahir Rasheed, a U.S. economist at Oxford Economics in New York. 
The surge in pending home sales last month was led by the South and Midwest regions, where the NAR said house price increases have been generally moderate relative to the rest of the country. Contracts soared 10.4% in the Midwest and vaulted 8.6% in the densely populated South. They rose 4.6% in the Northeast and advanced 7.2% in the West.

The European Commission's economic sentiment indicator rose to 117.8 in September, from 117.6 in August, after hitting an all-time high of 119.0 in July. 
Economists polled by Reuters had expected sentiment to ease in September to 116.9, mainly because of an expected weakening in industry and services.
But Commission data showed sentiment in industry improved to 14.1 from 13.8 in August, though it did decline in services to 15.1 from 16.8.
Consumers became more optimistic as well, with a reading of -4.0, up from -5.3 in August, and in the construction sector the indicator rose to 7.5 from 5.5, helping offset the decline in the retail sector to 1.3 from 4.6.

The economic rebound after the COVID-19 pandemic and rapidly rising energy prices also drove higher inflation expectations among consumers and manufacturers. 
Selling price expectations among manufacturers rose to 38.2 points, setting a new record high since the survey began in 2000, while consumer inflation expectations rose to 33.1 from 31.1 in August, approaching the 38.7 record from August 2001.

Net mortgage lending increased by 5.293 billion pounds ($7.24 billion) in August, bouncing back from July's net repayment of 1.758 billion pounds. New mortgage approvals fell slightly to 74,453.
A Reuters poll of economists had pointed to a net rise of 3.7 billion pounds in mortgage borrowing in August and to 73,000 mortgage approvals during the month.
Britain's housing market has boomed since the summer of 2020, helped by a pandemic surge in demand for bigger properties as more people work from home and by the tax incentive offered by finance minister Rishi Sunak.
That incentive was halved in scale on July 1 for home-buyers in England and Northern Ireland and is due to expire completely at the end of this month. Similar tax breaks in Scotland and Wales have already ended.
Wednesday's data showed consumer borrowing also rose in August, increasing by a net 351 million pounds after a rise of just 32 million pounds in July. The economists polled by Reuters had expected a smaller rise of 300 million pounds.
Nonetheless, consumer credit was 2.4% lower than in August 2020, underscoring how many households remained cautious about their spending over the summer when COVID-19 cases picked up again and many people were required to isolate at home.

Economists say further momentum is likely to be lost in the coming months due to rising inflation and supply chain problems linked to the reopening of the economy, chief among them a lack of truck drivers which is hampering fuel supplies.
""Overall, we're becoming more worried that economy may soon take a step back,"" Paul Dales, an economist at Capital Economics said. ""That would be food for thought for the Bank of England which appears intent on raising interest rates in the coming months.""

1279,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 29, 2021 04:31AM ET</span>",German import prices rise at fastest rate in 40 years,"BERLIN (Reuters) - German import prices rose the fastest in 40 years last month, driven by a jump in the price of oil and gas, and supply chain bottlenecks for raw materials worsened further, pointing to a further rise in prices for consumers.
Import prices jumped 16.5% in August from a year earlier, the Federal Statistics Office said on Wednesday, which was above economists' forecasts for a 16.1% increase and up from 15.0% in July.
The August increase was the steepest rise since September 1981, when the second oil crisis pushed prices up by 17.4%.
The price of energy imports was up 93.6% in August compared with a year earlier, mainly due to a strong rise in the price of natural gas, the Statistics Office said.
The price of many raw materials rose steeply as well. Iron ore cost 96.8% more in August, and the price of sawn and planed wood was up 61.6%, and basic iron, steel and ferro-alloys were up by 57.7%.
At the same time, supply chain bottlenecks affecting German companies worsened further, a survey published by the Ifo institute on Wednesday showed.
Some 77.4% of German industrial firms reported difficulties procuring intermediates and raw materials this month. Among car companies, that figure was at 97%, Ifo said.

""There are many orders, but companies cannot produce them right now,"" Ifo economist Klaus Wohlrabe said. As a result, more companies are now planning to increase prices, Ifo said.
Economists expect German flash inflation figures due on Thursday to show the rise in consumer prices, harmonised to make them comparable with inflation data from other European Union countries (HICP), accelerated further to 4.0% in September, from 3.4% in August, according to Refinitiv data.

1280,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 29, 2021 03:45AM ET</span>",Vietnam posts record GDP slump in Q3 due to COVID-19 curbs,"HANOI (Reuters) - Vietnam's gross domestic product contracted 6.17% in the third quarter of 2021 from a year earlier as pandemic restrictions hit, the sharpest quarterly decline on record, government data released on Wednesday showed. 
The services sector contracted 9.28% from a year earlier in the period, while the industrial and construction sector fell 5.02%, the General Statistics Office (GSO) said in a statement. The agriculture sector expanded 1.04%. 
""The COVID-19 pandemic has seriously affected all aspects of the economy with many key production cities and provinces having to impose strict lockdowns,"" the GSO said in a statement.
The GSO traditionally releases data before the end of the reporting period and its data is often subject to revision. Growth in the second quarter was revised down to 6.57% from 6.61%. 
After successfully containing the virus for most of last year, Vietnam has been grappling with a rise in infections since April, with total cases at 770,000 and 18,936 deaths, mostly in its business hub Ho Chi Minh City and neighbouring industrial provinces. 
The outbreak has forced authorities to impose strict lockdowns in Vietnam's largest cities and provinces, and prompted companies to suspend production. 
The government has in the past week taken steps to gradually ease lockdowns, following pressure from business associations and warnings by investors that the restrictions will prompt a shift away from the country.
The government is targeting a 6.5% GDP increase this year, but a minister earlier this month said growth could be 3.5%-4.0%.
Analysts said monthly activity data indicated the worst may be over. 
""We still expect a sizeable pick-up in the fourth quarter with production quickly normalising due to higher vaccination rates among manufacturing employees and a broader easing in restrictions,"" Oxford Economics said in a note.
However, it said logistical and supply chain disruptions were a risk to the outlook and that it would be revising down its 2021 GDP growth forecast of 5.4%.
Around 90,000 businesses suspended operations or went bankrupt in the January-September period, the GSO said. Among them, 32,400 were dissolved, up 17.4% from a year earlier.

It said the unemployment rate rose to 3.43% in the third quarter from 2.40% in the second quarter. 
According to the GSO, exports in September likely fell 0.6% from a year earlier to $27 billion and the industrial production index dropped 5.5%.

The Household Finance Index published by Scottish Widows, an insurance and pensions firm, fell to 44.0 in the July-September period from 44.7 in the second quarter of the year.
The last time the index decreased from one quarter to the next was in the three months to June 2020 when Britain was in the grip of its first coronavirus lockdown.
Income from employment rose for the first time since early last year. But households had less cash available for discretionary spending as prices for essential goods increased, Scottish Widows said.
Britain's main inflation measure jumped to 3.2% in August and the Bank of England expects it to rise above 4% as the post-lockdown reopening of the economy at home and around the world leads to bottlenecks and supply shortages.
Households were also more downbeat about their financial outlook over the next 12 months. 
A survey published last week showed growing worries over energy bills, food costs and tax hikes that caused a drop in British consumer confidence.

A separate report from a recruiters group showed employers were a bit less confident about hiring in the three months to August but their plans for taking on new staff remained high by historical standards.
The Recruitment & Employment Confederation survey was conducted before the recent escalation of supply chain problems which led the BoE last week to lower its estimate for economic growth in the third quarter.

1283,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 28, 2021 02:17PM ET</span>",U.S. consumer confidence hits seven-month low as near-term economic outlook dims,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. consumer confidence fell to a seven-month low in September as a relentless rise in COVID-19 cases deepened concerns about the economy's near-term prospects, fitting in with expectations for a slowdown in growth in the third quarter.
The survey from the Conference Board on Tuesday showed consumers less interested in buying a home and big-ticket items such as motor vehicles and major household appliances over the next six months. Consumers were also not as upbeat in their views of the labor market as in the prior month. 
Economic activity has cooled in recent months as the boost from pandemic relief money faded and infections flared up, driven by the highly contagious Delta variant of the coronavirus. Labor and raw material shortages have also chipped away at growth.
""But given that wave seems to be cresting, there's hope confidence just hit its nadir,"" said Robert Frick, corporate economist at Navy Federal Credit Union in Vienna, Virginia. ""Assuming predictions of Delta dropping hold true, this setback may be a three-month trough during the recovery rally.""
The Conference Board said its consumer confidence index dropped to a reading of 109.3 this month from 115.2 in August. The third straight monthly decline pushed the index to the lowest level since February. 
The measure, which places more emphasis on the labor market, has dropped 19.6 points from a peak of 128.9 in June. It was in contrast with the University of Michigan's survey of consumers, which showed sentiment stabilizing early this month. 
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the consumer confidence index nudging up to 114.5.
""These back-to-back declines suggest consumers have grown more cautious and are likely to curtail spending going forward,"" said Lynn Franco, senior director of economic indicators at the Conference Board in Washington.
Politicians in Washington bickering over extending the federal government's borrowing capabilities are also casting a cloud. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen told lawmakers on Tuesday that the government could run out of cash by Oct. 18 unless the U.S. Congress raised the debt limit.
Yellen warned that a debt default would be a ""disastrous"" event that would trigger a ""financial crisis and calamity.""
The Conference Board's so-called labor market differential, derived from data on respondents' views on whether jobs are plentiful or hard to get, fell to a reading of 42.5 this month from 44.4 in August, the highest since July 2000.
This measure closely correlates to the unemployment rate in the Labor Department's closely watched employment report. September's employment report is due to be released on Oct. 8, but could be delayed if Congress fails to reach a deal by Friday to keep the government funded.
Stocks on Wall Street were trading lower. The dollar rose against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices fell.
HOUSE PRICES SURGE
Consumers' inflation expectations over the next 12 months slipped to 6.5% from 6.7% last month. 
Buying intentions for motor vehicles fell to a nine month low. Fewer consumers planned to purchase household appliances like washing machines and clothes dryers over the next six months, supporting expectations for a sharp slowdown in consumer spending this quarter, which will ultimately restrain economic growth. Gross domestic product growth estimates for the third quarter are mostly below a 5% annualized rate. The economy grew at a 6.6% pace in the second quarter.
Expectations for slower GDP growth were reinforced by a separate report from the Commerce Department on Tuesday showing the goods trade deficit rose 0.9% to $87.6 billion in August as businesses imported more products to replenish inventories. Trade has subtracted from GDP growth for four straight quarters.
Imports of goods climbed 0.8% to $236.6 billion, lifted by consumer goods and industrial supplies. But imports of food, capital goods and motor vehicles fell. Motor vehicle imports were likely weighed down by a global shortage of semiconductors, which is impacting production.
Rising imports offset a 0.7% gain in goods exports to $149.0 billion, supported by industrial supplies and consumer goods. But the nation reported a decline in exports of capital goods, motor vehicles and food products. Exports are increasing as global economies continue to recover from the pandemic. 
Some of the increase in imports ended up in warehouses at wholesalers and retailers. Wholesale inventories accelerated 1.2% last month. Stocks at retailers edged up 0.1%. Retail inventories were held back by a 1.5% tumble in stocks of motor vehicles.
Retail inventories excluding autos, which go into the calculation of GDP, rose 0.6% after advancing 0.5% in the prior month. Business inventories were drawn down in the first half of the year. Last month's increase should soften the hit to GDP growth from the widening goods trade deficit.
""The real change in inventories may be slightly positive in the third quarter, with a drop in retail auto inventories being offset by inventory gains in other parts of the economy,"" said Daniel Silver, an economist at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) in New York. 
News on the housing market was discouraging, with the Conference Board survey showing consumers less inclined to buy a home for a third straight month amid higher house prices due to tight supply. 
A third report on Tuesday showed the S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller national home price index surged a record 19.7% in July from a year ago after accelerating 18.7% in June.
Sustained house price inflation was corroborated by a fourth report from the Federal Housing Finance Agency showing house prices soared a record 19.2% in the 12 months through July after surging 18.9% in June.

""We expect some moderation in home price inflation in the second half of this year but still look for annual price
growth to be in double digits,"" said Nancy Vanden Houten, lead U.S. economist at Oxford Economics in New York.

Power and LMC Automotive said in a joint forecast on Tuesday.
New vehicle retail sales in the United States are seen dropping to 888,900 units in September, from 1,182,788 a year ago.
""September results show that there are simply not enough vehicles available to meet consumer demand,"" J.D. Power said in a statement.
While demand remains sky high for personal transportation, with consumers set to spend billions in September, automakers are crimped by semiconductor shortages and supply chain disruptions.
The gap between demand and supply is leading to record vehicle prices, with average transaction price in September expected to reach an all-time high of $42,802, J.D. Power said.
Used vehicle prices are also starting to heat up as the fall season gets underway after cooling in late-June and July, J.D. Power added.
LMC Automotive warned that the recovery in the auto industry may be pushed until 2022, if not 2023, due to the worsening disruptions.

September's seasonally adjusted annualized rate for new vehicle sales will be 12.2 million, down four million units from 2020 and about 800,000 units less than 2019.
Major automakers, including General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc, are set to report monthly and quarter deliveries in the next two weeks.

SHANGHAI (Reuters) - China faces mounting pressure to ramp up coal imports and ensure supplies to keep lights on, factories open and water flowing as a severe power crunch roils the northeastern industrial heartland.
With electricity shortages sparked by coal shortages crippling large sections of industry https://www.reuters.com/world/china/chinas-power-crunch-begins-weigh-economic-outlook-2021-09-27, the governor of Jilin province, one of the hardest hit in the world's no.2 economy, called for a surge in coal imports, while a power company association said supply was being expanded ""at any cost"".
News organisations and social media carried reports and posts saying the lack of power in the northeast had shut down traffic lights, residential elevators and 3G mobile phone coverage as well as triggering factory shutdowns.
A utility in Jilin even warned power shortages could disrupt water supplies at any time, before apologising for causing alarm.
For the second straight day, the main state grid operator sought to reassure customers, saying it would work to guarantee coal supply and strictly control power use by high-energy consuming and polluting sectors, and ensure power supply to residents during the October holidays and winter heating season.
Cities such as Shenyang and Dalian - home to more than 13 million people - have been hit, with disruption at factories owned by suppliers to global companies like Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA). Jilin is one of more than 10 provinces forced to ration power https://www.reuters.com/world/china/what-is-behind-chinas-power-crunch-2021-09-27 as generators feel the heat of soaring coal prices that they can't pass on to consumers.
Speaking to power firms on Monday, Han Jun, the governor of Jilin province, home to nearly 25 million people, said ""multiple channels"" needed to be set up to guarantee coal supplies, and China should source more from Russia, Mongolia and Indonesia.
Han said the province would also urgently send teams to secure supply contracts in the neighbouring region of Inner Mongolia, according to Jilin's official WeChat social media account.
Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) estimated that as much as 44% of China's industrial activity has been hit by power shortages, potentially causing a one-percentage-point decline in annualised GDP growth in the third quarter, and a two-percentage-point drop from October to December. 
It said in a Tuesday note that it was cutting its 2021 GDP growth forecast for China to 7.8%, from the previous 8.2%. 
'AT ANY COST'
The power crunch has taken hold https://www.reuters.com/world/china/what-is-behind-chinas-power-crunch-2021-09-27 as a shortage of coal supplies, toughening greenhouse gas emissions standards and strong demand from industry have pushed coal prices to peaks.
China's thermal coal futures hit a record high at 1,330 yuan ($205.68) per tonne on Tuesday.
Rationing has been implemented during peak hours in many parts of northeastern China since last week, triggering state media reports of power supply disruptions in many cities and stoking concern on social media.
As some shops in the northeast operated by candlelight and malls shut early, posts on China's Twitter-like Weibo (NASDAQ:WB) expressed concern about water after a utility in Jilin warned users that power shortages could hit supplies at any time.
Jilin governor Han urged companies to fulfil their ""social responsibilities"" and ""overcome the difficulties"" caused by coal price rises.
The China Electricity Council, which represents power suppliers, said on Monday that coal-fired power companies were now ""expanding their procurement channels at any cost"" in order to guarantee winter heat and electricity supplies.
It said China needed to increase production and supply of coal while guaranteeing safety and environmental protection. More medium- and long-term contracts needed to be signed to raise power plant inventories ahead of winter.
Coal traders said finding fresh import sources may be easier said than done.
""Russia has to first meet demand from Europe, Japan and South Korea,"" said one northeast China based trader. ""Indonesia's export shipments have been curbed by rainy weather the last couple of months and Mongolia's exports, mostly by trucks, are small."" 
David Fishman, China energy policy researcher and manager at the Lantau Group consultancy, said flaws in China's pricing system were ultimately to blame.
""In the short term, the only relief policies that make sense are digging more coal out of the ground, which is bound to be an unpopular idea, or make end-users pay more for their power,"" Fishman said.
Policymakers had previously warned that China needed to build more coal plants in order to offset potential power shortages over the 2021-2025 period, but utilisation rates at existing plants remain low.

Lauri Myllyvirta, lead analyst with the Helsinki-based Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air, said northeast China currently had 100 gigawatts of coal-fired capacity, which would be more than enough to meet demand if plants had the incentive to buy more coal.
""Not a single grid region has reported peak loads that would be even close to exhausting available generating capacity,"" he said.

The official manufacturing Purchasing Manager's Index (PMI)is expected to stay at 50.1 in September, the same as the August reading, according to the median forecast of 34 economists polled by Reuters. A reading above 50 indicates expansion from the previous month.
China's economy rapidly recovered from a pandemic-induced slump last year, but momentum has weakened in recent months, with the vast manufacturing sector facing heightened costs and production bottlenecks, and more recently, electricity rationing.
China is in the grip of a power crunch as a shortage of coal supplies, toughening emissions standards and strong demand from manufacturers and industry have pushed coal prices to record highs and triggered widespread curbs on usage.
""Unless the power issues are resolved and production restrictions are lifted, efforts by Beijing to ease policy will have a more muted impact on economic output. Thus, power shortages raise the possibility that any economic rebound will be delayed,"" said analysts at BCA Research on Tuesday.
China is also dealing with ongoing small-scale coronavirus outbreaks in the southeast province of Fujian and the northeastern province of Heilongjiang.
Higher raw material prices, especially of metals andsemiconductors, have also pressured profits. Earnings at China's industrial firms in August slowed for the sixth straight month.

The official PMI, which largely focuses on big andstate-owned firms, and its sister survey on the services sector,will both be released on Thursday.
The private Caixin manufacturing PMI will also be published on the same day. Analysts expect the headline reading will rise to 49.5 from 49.2 the month before, remaining in contraction.

The INSEE official statistics agency said its consumer confidence index rose to 102 from 99 in August, hitting its highest level since June.
The improvement brought confidence back to pre-pandemic levels and beat the average forecast of 100 in a Reuters poll of 15 economists.

With the economy rebounding strongly as the coronavirus crisis subsides, households' concerns about unemployment fell to their lowest level since February 2020, just before the outbreak began in France.

BEIJING (Reuters) - Profit growth at China's industrial firms slowed for a sixth month as plants fought off high commodity prices, COVID-19 outbreaks and part shortages, with an unfolding power crisis a growing threat to output and bottom-lines. 
Profits rose 10.1% on year in August to 680.3 billion yuan ($105 billion) compared with a 16.4% gain in July, data from China's statistics bureau showed on Tuesday. 
The world's second-biggest economy rapidly recovered from a pandemic-induced slump last year, but momentum has weakened in recent months, with its vast manufacturing sector facing heightened costs and production bottlenecks, and more recently, electricity rationing.
Factory output rose in August at its slackest pace since July 2020, weighed by domestic COVID-19 outbreaks, high raw material prices, and a persistent shortage of parts such as semiconductors. 
A sustained crackdown this year on real estate speculation and new borrowing by developers for projects has also sapped demand for construction-related goods and services. 
""We expect industrial profit growth to fall further in coming months amid a notable growth slowdown in H2 due to the recurring COVID-19 waves and Beijing's zero-COVID strategy, likely slowing exports, and Beijing's enforcement of property sector tightening and green measures,"" Nomura wrote in a note. 
High commodity prices in recent months have hurt the profitability of many medium-sized and downstream factories.
To cool prices, China will auction more industrial metals from its state stockpiles next month in a rare release of inventories. Prior to this year, Beijing had not sold off state metal reserves for more than a decade.
Earlier this month, China also released crude oil from its strategic reserves for the first time.
POWER CRISIS
New headwinds are also building as China's efforts to meet carbon emissions goals lead to wider curbs on electricity use, particularly on energy-intensive plants and businesses.
Local governments in Zhejiang, Jiangsu, Yunnan and Guangdong provinces have told factories to limit power usage or curb output. In the past week, electricity rationing has severely hit China's northeast.
""We estimate two months of electricity rationing from mid-September in selected provinces will cut 0.1 percentage point from 2021 GDP growth and 0.3 percentage point from 2022 GDP growth,"" Commonwealth Bank of Australia (OTC:CMWAY) wrote in a research note. 
""The combined share of the industrial sector in affected provinces with power rationing is about 14% of Chinese GDP.""
Tight coal supplies and higher prices of the fuel have also eroded the bottom-lines of power companies. 
China power companies' profits squeezed https://graphics.reuters.com/CHINA-ECONOMY/gkplgwkqkvb/chart.png

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australian retail sales dived for a third straight month in August as half the population were trapped in coronavirus lockdowns, though reopening is in sight as vaccinations race toward world-beating levels.
Figures from the Australian Bureau of Statistics on Tuesday showed retail sales fell 1.7% in August to A$29.3 billion ($21.27 billion). That followed a 2.7% drop in July, but did beat market forecasts of a 2.5% slide.
The A$360 billion retail sector accounts for around 18% of gross domestic product and further weakness is expected this month with Sydney, Melbourne and Canberra all locked down. 
While the entire economy is certain to shrink sharply this quarter, relief is in sight with New South Wales just a couple of weeks from easing restrictions as people flock to get jabbed.
After an agonisingly slow start, almost 86% of the adult population in NSW have now had a first shot and 60% are double dosed. By the end of October, the state is expected to pass world leader Portugal which has 84% fully vaccinated.
For Australia as a whole, 77% have had their first dose and the fully vaccinated share will soon surpass the United States.
""At reopening, spending will be driven by pent‑up demand after months of lockdown and accumulated savings,"" said CBA economist Stephen Wu.
""But we expect bumps along the way as some consumers will be initially wary of catching the virus or from coming into contact with the virus and being forced into isolation.""
Yet the pandemic has also massively accelerated the adoption of online sales both by consumers and retailers. Online sales of food have doubled on pre-pandemic levels and even fine dining restaurants have gotten into the game, selling take-away courses and assemble-at-home gourmet meal kits.
It has been a life saver for hard-pressed department stores with annual sales booming by more than 50%.
Analysts at NAB estimate Australians spent almost A$51 billion on online retail in the year to August, an annual increase of around 30% and twice the levels seen pre-pandemic. 

The bonanza, however, is stretching supply chains and pushing up costs. Australia Post recently boasted its busiest day ever and warned customers to shop early for Christmas.

1292,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 27, 2021 11:51AM ET</span>",Strong U.S. business spending on equipment seen underpinning GDP growth in Q3,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - New orders and shipments of key U.S.-made capital goods increased solidly in August amid strong demand for computers and electronic products, keeping business spending on equipment on track for another quarter of robust growth.
The sustained strength in business investment is expected to limit the hit on economic growth from an anticipated slowdown in consumer spending in the third quarter as the boost from fiscal stimulus fades and COVID-19 infections flare up. Demand for goods is being driven by businesses desperate to replenish inventories, but strained supply chains remain a challenge.
""The outlook for business equipment investment remains bright, with the latest business surveys suggesting growth will be sustained close to the pace seen in recent quarters,"" said Michael Pearce, a senior U.S. economist at Capital Economics in New York. ""The resilience of investment is one reason why we expect overall GDP growth will slow marginally in the third quarter, despite a bigger slump in consumption growth.""
Orders for non-defense capital goods excluding aircraft, a closely watched proxy for business spending plans, rose 0.5% last month, the Commerce Department said on Monday. 
Data for July was revised higher to show these so-called core capital goods orders gaining 0.3% instead of the previously reported 0.1%. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast core capital goods orders increasing 0.4%. 
Orders shot up 16.4% on a year-on-year basis and are 18% above their pre-pandemic level. That is boosting manufacturing, which accounts for 11.9% of the economy, though an acute shortage labor as well as raw materials such as semiconductors are making it harder for factories to fulfill orders.
Last month, orders for computers and electronic products rose 1.4%. There were also increases in orders for electrical equipment, appliances and components, as well as fabricated metal products. But orders for machinery fell as did those for primary metals. 
Shipments of core capital goods advanced 0.7% last month after increasing 0.9% in July. Core capital goods shipments are used to calculate equipment spending in the government's gross domestic product measurement. Business spending on equipment has logged four straight quarters of double-digit growth.
Stocks on Wall Street were mixed. The dollar was steady against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices fell.
LEAN INVENTORIES 
There were increases in shipments of machinery as well as computers and electronic products. But shipments of electrical equipment, appliances and components fell. 
Supply constraints, underscored by a building up of unfilled orders, and a resurgence in COVID-19 cases, driven by the highly contagious Delta variant of the coronavirus prompted economists early this month to slash their estimates for third-quarter GDP to as low as 3.5% annualized rate from as high as a 9% pace. The economy grew at a 6.6% pace in the second quarter.
Unfilled core capital goods orders rose 1.0% in August after a similar gain in July. This together with extremely lean inventories after they were depleted in the first half of the year should keep manufacturing well supported.
""The fact that unfilled orders are outpacing actual orders and shipments suggests that the anecdotes of companies turning away business for lack of supplies and needed help on the labor front are endemic to the broader economy,"" said Tim Quinlan, a senior economist at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) in Charlotte, North Carolina.
""Even once bottlenecks ease, the manufacturing sector will still have plenty of work to chip away at."" 
Orders for durable goods, items ranging from toasters to aircraft that are meant to last three years or more, accelerated 1.8% after climbing 0.5% in July. They were boosted by a 5.5% rebound in orders for transportation equipment, which followed a 0.4% fall in July.
Orders for civilian aircraft soared 77.9%. Boeing (NYSE:BA) reported on its website that it had received 53 aircraft orders last month compared to 31 in July. 
But orders for motor vehicles and parts fell 3.1% after rising 5.3% in July. General Motors (NYSE:GM) and Ford this month announced further production cuts as they adjust their schedules to manage their chip supply. 
Unfilled orders of durable goods increased 1.0% last month after rising 0.5% in July. Durable goods inventories climbed 0.8%, matching July's gain.

""Inventory levels of final goods have been run down, but the durables report shows inventories of manufactured goods steadily increasing,"" said Andrew Hollenhorst, chief U.S. economist at  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) in New York. 
""In some sectors this is because supply-chain issues are emerging after some degree of manufacturing has taken place, meaning partially completed goods, most notably autos, are reflected in the report.""

1293,By Bloomberg,"<span>Sep 27, 2021 08:45AM ET</span>",Orders for U.S. Business Equipment Rise for Sixth Straight Month,"(Bloomberg) -- Orders placed with U.S. manufacturers for business equipment strengthened in August, extending to six months a solid run of robust capital investment that’s helping fuel economic growth.
The value of core capital goods orders, which exclude aircraft and military hardware and is seen as a barometer of business equipment investment, increased 0.5% after an upwardly revised 0.3% a month earlier, Commerce Department figures showed Monday.
Bookings for all durable goods -- or items meant to last at least three years -- rose 1.8% from the prior month, reflecting a pickup in orders for commercial aircraft.
The median estimate in a Bloomberg survey of economists called for a 0.4% increase in core capital goods orders and a 0.7% gain in total durables. 
Business outlays for capital goods such as electronics, construction machinery and power generating equipment have been a key source of strength for the economy. Resilient consumer spending against a backdrop of lean inventories has also propelled demand for durables, even as capacity constraints frustrate factory production efforts.
Core capital goods shipments, a figure that will be used to calculate investment in the government’s third-quarter gross domestic product report, rose 0.7% after a 0.9% gain. 
Bookings for commercial aircraft increased nearly 78%. Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co. earlier reported 53 orders in August, up from 31 a month earlier. The government’s data aren’t always directly comparable on a month-to-month basis.
Outside of the volatile commercial aircraft category, bookings were mixed. While orders rose for communications equipment, electrical hardware and fabricated metals, they declined for motor vehicles, computers and machinery.
Unfilled orders for manufactured durable goods and inventories both rose, illustrating lingering bottlenecks and long lead times faced by manufacturers.
These supply chain disruptions help explain softness in recent manufacturing surveys. A recent survey of purchasing managers by IHS Markit showed an index of manufacturing slipped to a five-month low in September. A measure of order backlogs, however, climbed to the highest in data back to 2007.

1294,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 27, 2021 06:56AM ET</span>","China power crunch spreads, shutting factories and dimming growth outlook","By Shivani Singh and Min Zhang
BEIJING (Reuters) - Widening power shortages in China have halted production at numerous factories including many supplying Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), while some shops in the northeast operated by candlelight and malls shut early as the economic toll of the squeeze mounted.
China is in the grip of a power crunch as a shortage of coal supplies, toughening emissions standards and strong demand from manufacturers and industry have pushed coal prices to record highs and triggered widespread curbs on usage.
Rationing has been implemented during peak hours in many parts of northeastern China since last week, and residents of cities including Changchun said cuts were occurring sooner and lasting for longer, state media reported. 
On Monday, State Grid Corp pledged to ensure basic power supply and avoid electricity cuts.
The power crunch has hurt production in industries across several regions of China and is dragging on the country's economic growth outlook, analysts said. 
The impact on homes and non-industrial users comes as night-time temperatures slip to near-freezing in China's northernmost cities. The National Energy Administration (NEA) has told coal and natural gas firms to ensure sufficient energy supplies to keep homes warm during winter. 
Liaoning province said power generation had declined significantly since July, and the supply gap widened to a ""severe level"" last week. It expanded power cuts from industrial firms to residential areas last week. 
The city of Huludao told residents not to use high energy-consuming electronics like water heaters and microwave ovens during peak periods, and a resident of Harbin city in Heilongjiang province told Reuters that many shopping malls were closing earlier than usual at 4 p.m. (0800 GMT). 
Given the current power situation ""the orderly use of electricity in Heilongjiang will continue for a period of time,"" CCTV quoted the provincial economic planner as saying.
The power squeeze is unnerving Chinese stock markets at a time when the world's second-largest economy is already showing signs of slowing.
China's economy is grappling with curbs on the property and tech sectors and concerns around the future of cash-strapped real estate giant China Evergrande.
PRODUCTION FALLOUT 
Tight coal supplies, due in part to a pickup in industrial activity as the economy recovered from the pandemic, and toughening emission standards have driven the power shortages across China.
China has vowed to cut energy intensity - the amount of energy consumed per unit of economic growth - by around 3% in 2021 to meet its climate goals. Provincial authorities have also stepped up the enforcement of emissions curbs in recent months after only 10 of 30 mainland regions managed to achieve their energy goals in the first half of the year.
China's focus on energy intensity and decarbonization is unlikely to abate, analysts said, ahead of COP26 climate talks - as the 2021 United Nations Climate Change Conference is known - which will be held in November in Glasgow and where world leaders will lay out their climate agendas.
The power pinch has been affecting manufacturers in key industrial hubs on the eastern and southern coasts for weeks. Several key suppliers of Apple and Tesla halted production at some plants.
At least 15 Chinese companies have said in exchange filings that production had been disrupted by power curbs, while more than 30 Taiwan-listed firms with China operations had stopped work to comply with the power limits.
The steel, aluminium and cement industries have also been hard hit by the output curbs, with about 7% of aluminium production capacity suspended and 29% of national cement production affected,  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) analysts wrote in a Monday note. Paper and glass could be the next industries to face supply disruptions, they said.
Producers of chemicals, dyes, furniture and soymeal have also been affected.
GDP CUTS
The fallout of the power shortage has prompted some analysts to downgrade their 2021 growth outlook.
Nomura cut its third and fourth-quarter China GDP growth forecasts to 4.7% and 3.0%, respectively, from 5.1% and 4.4% previously, and its full-year forecast to 7.7% from 8.2%.
""The power-supply shock in the world's second-biggest economy and biggest manufacturer will ripple through and impact global markets,"" analysts at Nomura said in a Sept. 24 note, warning that global supplies of textiles, toys and machine parts could be affected.
Morgan Stanley analysts said production cuts, if prolonged, could knock 1 percentage point off China's GDP growth in the fourth quarter. 

Last week, major coal producers in China met to try and resolve shortages and curb price increases. 
China, the world's biggest energy consumer and source of climate-warming greenhouse gas, has said it aims to bring carbon emissions to a peak by 2030 and to net zero by 2060.

KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - Malaysia's Prime Minister Ismail Sabri Yaakob on Monday tabled a new five-year economic plan, boosting infrastructure spending and committing to a carbon tax under climate change goals as the country looks to chart its way out of a pandemic-induced slump. 
Launching the 12th Malaysia Plan in parliament, Ismail Sabri said the country's financial position was expected to improve in 2023, with the economy targeted to grow 4.5%-5.5% per annum in the next five years. 
Malaysia posted average annual growth of 2.7% between 2016-2020, dragged down by a 5.6% contraction last year due to the outbreak of COVID-19, the premier said. 
Gross national income per capita rose to 42,500 ringgit ($10,150) in 2020, about 20% lower than the level required to become a high-income country. Malaysia now expects to reach that target by 2025, Ismail Sabri said. 
""The 12th Malaysia Plan is a comprehensive development plan that will introduce a number of reforms to ensure sustainable economic growth and more equal distribution of opportunities and results,"" Ismail Sabri said.
Malaysia's export-driven economy has taken a hit from the pandemic. The central bank slashed its full-year growth forecast to 3.0%-4.0% from 6-7.5% last month - the second cut this year. 
The government will spend 400 billion ringgit ($95.53 billion) on existing and new development projects between 2021 and 2025, compared with 260 billion ringgit in the 11th Malaysia plan, Ismail Sabri said.
These include new highways and rail networks linking rural areas with urban and industrial hubs, more affordable housing, as well as improvements in health, education, and broadband connectivity. 
Malaysia also aims to become a carbon neutral country by 2050, Ismail Sabri said, adding that economic instruments such as carbon pricing and a carbon tax will be introduced. 
The government also pledged to stop building coal-fired power stations, as it continues its efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions intensity of GDP by 45% in 2030, the premier said.

Other promises included plans to reduce the country's dependence on foreign labour, provide support to small and medium-sized businesses, and turn Malaysia into a regional investment hub.

1297,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 27, 2021 12:15AM ET</span>","As Americans spend, credit card debt is ticking back up","By Chris Taylor
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Early in the pandemic, there were encouraging and surprising signs about the decline of credit card debt.
Now, that trendline seems to be changing.
Many Americans stayed at home at the start of COVID-19 and did not spend like they usually do. They also received several rounds of emergency cash assistance, helping to chop away at those credit-card bills, at least temporarily.
Spending is ticking back up – and the results are starting to show up on our monthly statements.
In fact, 42% of those with credit card debt, or 59 million Americans, say they have added to their balances since the beginning of the pandemic, according to a new study by personal finance site Bankrate.com.
""Things are better for some, but they are not better for everybody,"" explains Ted Rossman, Bankrate’s senior industry analyst. 
The end of stimulus checks, expanded unemployment benefits and the eviction moratorium does not bode well for debt management, Rossman added.
This trend reversal is reflected in the most recent numbers of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. Its Quarterly Report on Household Debt and Credit found that credit-card bills rose by $17 billion in 2021’s second quarter, to $790 billion nationally. That was the first uptick after four straight quarters of declines.
Also headed north were auto loans, by $33 billion in the quarter, and mortgage debt, by $282 billion. All told it makes for total household debt of $14.96 trillion, a quarterly rise of 2.1%.
DIFFERENT DEBT, DIFFERENT STRATEGIES
Of course, not all debt is the same, nor should it automatically be considered a bad thing. The rise in mortgage debt can be attributed to many people buying homes in a hot real estate market – and with interest rates near historic lows, that is not necessarily a concern for household balance sheets.
Credit card debt is especially pernicious, though. It can be very challenging to escape as balances rise to a certain level, combined with sky-high interest on revolving debt – average rates are currently north of 16%, according to Bankrate. Add in late fees or missed payments, and the cycle is hard to break.
Those concerns are highlighted in a recent survey by real estate firm Clever. Almost one in five of those with credit card debt, 18%, report having bills over $20,000. Meanwhile 40% of those who carry a monthly balance haven’t been debt-free from credit cards since before 2018, and 15% have been struggling with it for more than 15 years.
""We also found that 57% of people had missed a credit-card payment, and the majority of those were in the past year,"" says Francesca Ortegren, lead researcher for Clever. ""It could cause a snowball effect over time, and make it much harder to climb out.""
Chronic debt can make people feel pretty bleak. A third of those with credit card debt think it will take at least a couple of years to pay it off, and 20% say three years or more, according to Clever. Most depressing of all, 3% think it will never be possible.
CHARTING A WAY OUT
To be sure, there are glimmers of good news in the debt data. Even though credit card bills are once again headed back up, the early-pandemic declines means that total amounts are still $140 billion below the end of 2019's levels, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. And student loan debt actually dropped in the second quarter of 2021, by $14 billion.
Meanwhile personal savings rates are still elevated, compared to historic norms. And debt delinquencies and defaults are relatively modest, notes Bankrate’s Rossman -- which is somewhat surprising, given the length and breadth of our ongoing pandemic crisis.
What Rossman worries about: That our early-pandemic frugality will fall by the wayside, and the urge to get out and spend after being cooped up for so long will throw whatever progress we have made into reverse.

Instead, Americans should be proactive. He suggests: Take advantage of the growing number of 0% card balance-transfer offers, partner with nonprofit credit counselors like Money Management International or GreenPath, or pay off high-rate cards with a lower-rate personal loan.
""It would be nice if we could keep lower balances as a part of our future,"" Rossman says. ""You don’t want to throw that all away and run those balances right back up – because this is very expensive debt.""

BRIGHTON, England (Reuters) -BP said nearly a third of its British petrol stations had run out of the two main grades of fuel on Sunday as panic buying forced the government to suspend competition laws and allow firms to work together to ease shortages.
Lines of vehicles formed at petrol stations for a third day running as motorists waited, some for hours, to fill up with fuel after oil firms reported a lack of drivers was causing transport problems from refineries to forecourts.
Some operators have had to ration supplies and others to close gas stations.
""With the intense demand seen over the past two days, we estimate that around 30% of sites in this network do not currently have either of the main grades of fuel,"" BP (NYSE:BP), which operates 1,200 sites in Britain, said in statement.
""We are working to resupply as rapidly as possible.""
The fuel panic comes as Britain faces several crises: an international gas price surge that is forcing energy firms out of business, a related shortage of carbon dioxide that threatens to derail meat production, and a shortage of truck drivers that is playing havoc with retailers and leaving some shelves bare.
Anglo-Dutch oil group Shell (LON:RDSa) said that it had also seen increased demand for fuel.
In response business minister Kwasi Kwarteng said he was suspending competition laws to allow firms to share information and coordinate their response.
""This step will allow government to work constructively with fuel producers, suppliers, hauliers and retailers to ensure that disruption is minimised as far as possible,"" the business department said in a statement. 
Transport minister Grant Shapps had earlier appealed for calm, saying the shortages were purely caused by panic buying, and that the situation would eventually resolve itself because fuel could not be stockpiled.
""There's plenty of fuel, there's no shortage of the fuel within the country,"" Shapps told Sky News.
""So the most important thing is actually that people carry on as they normally would and fill up their cars when they normally would, then you won't have queues and you won't have shortages at the pump either.""
After meeting Kwarteng, industry figures including representatives from Shell and  Exxon Mobil  Corp (NYSE:XOM) said in a joint statement issued by the business department that they had been reassured, and stressed there was no national fuel shortage.
'MANUFACTURED SITUATION'
Earlier, Shapps said the shortage of truck drivers was down to COVID-19 disrupting the qualification process, preventing new labour from entering the market.
Others pinned the blame on Brexit and poor working conditions forcing out foreign drivers.
The government on Sunday announced a plan to issue temporary visas for 5,000 foreign truck drivers.
But business leaders have warned the government's plan is a short-term fix and will not solve an acute labour shortage that risks major disruption beyond fuel deliveries, including for retailers in the run-up to Christmas.
Shapps called the panic over fuel a ""manufactured situation"" and blamed it on a hauliers' association.
""They're desperate to have more European drivers undercutting British salaries,"" he said.

An Opinium poll published in the Observer newspaper on Sunday said that 67% of voters believe the government has handled the crisis badly. A majority of 68% said that Brexit was partly to blame.
Opposition Labour Party leader Keir Starmer, speaking at his party's annual conference in southern England, said ministers had failed to plan for labour shortages following the 2016 Brexit vote and called for a bigger temporary visa scheme.

The country, which until late April had maintained one of the world's best containment records, is seeking to co-exist with the virus instead of trying to maintain a COVID-zero policy. 
The current outbreak and related restrictions on movement have impacted its manufacturing-led economy, forcing the closure of some factories.
""Around Sept. 30, safe localities can ease COVID restrictions and revive business and social activities,"" Chinh told a government meeting. 
""Fighting the pandemic is not just setting up physical barriers and restrictions,"" he said, adding the pandemic was more or less under control.
The decision comes as Vietnam has seen a drop in the daily death rate from the virus. It reported 9,682 new cases on Saturday, marking the third consecutive day the rate of infection has been below 10,000. The country has recorded over 746,600 cases in total, with 18,400 fatalities. 

Foreign investors in Vietnam have warned the government that its strict lockdown rules in the south has forced some companies to move production https://www.reuters.com/business/european-investors-warn-shift-away-vietnam-over-restrictions-2021-09-10 elsewhere.
Vietnam's gross domestic product could grow between 3.5%-4.0% this year, well below the government's earlier target of 6.5%, the country's Minister of Planning and Investment Nguyen Chi Dung was cited by state media as saying.
Vietnam, with a population of 98 million, is accelerating its vaccine programme. Although daily inoculations have reached 700,000, its vaccination rate of 7.61% is one of the region's lowest."

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Sales of new U.S. single-family homes increased for a second straight month in August, but demand for housing has probably peaked after a COVID-19 pandemic-fueled buying frenzy.
The report from the Commerce Department on Friday also showed the supply of new homes on the market last month was the largest in nearly 13 years, with prices unchanged on a monthly basis. It followed on the heels of news on Wednesday that sales of previously owned homes fell in August. 
""These data suggest that the surge in new home sales during the pandemic has ebbed and inventories of unsold homes have risen to a more normal level in relation to sales,"" said Conrad DeQuadros, senior economic advisor at Brean Capital in New York. ""This report and the existing home sales data for August suggest that a considerable portion of the flow adjustment of sales to higher demand may have taken place.""
New home sales rose 1.5% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 740,000 units last month. July's sales pace was revised up to 729,000 units from the previously reported 708,000 units. 
Sales increased 6.0% in the populous South and gained 1.4% in the West. They soared 26.1% in the Northeast, but tumbled 31.1% in the Midwest. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast new home sales, which account for about 11.2% of U.S. home sales, increasing to a rate of 714,000 units.
Sales decreased 24.3% on a year-on-year basis in August. They have struggled to post significant gains since surging to a rate of 993,000 units in January, which was the highest since the end of 2006. Builders have been constrained by higher prices for inputs, as well as shortages of land and labor. 
About 78% of homes sold last month were either under construction or yet to be built.
""This report continues to highlight the ongoing difficulties that homebuilders are facing as they attempt to work through their current construction backlog, due to a shortage of labor and elevated material costs and outright shortages,"" said Mark Palim, deputy chief economist at Fannie Mae in Washington. 
Stocks on Wall Street were trading lower as worries persisted about the spillover from debt-laden China Evergrande. The dollar slipped against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices fell. 
(GRAPHIC: New home sales - https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-STOCKS/dwpkrdqzwvm/nhs.png) 
DEMAND LIKELY PEAKED 
The coronavirus pandemic sparked an exodus from cities as Americans worked from home and took classes online. That boosted demand for bigger homes in the suburbs and other low-density areas, which far outpaced supply, causing bidding wars. 
But demand has likely peaked. The National Association of Realtors reported on Wednesday that sales of previously owned homes fell in August, with house prices continuing to moderate sharply after posting record increases in May. 
Some sellers are reducing their asking prices and consumer sentiment towards buying a home has shifted. 
Demand for housing could cool after the Federal Reserve said on Wednesday it would likely begin reducing its monthly bond purchases as soon as November and signaled interest rate increases may follow more quickly than expected.
Still, the fundamentals for the housing market remain strong. A tightening labor market is lifting wages. The new housing market remains underpinned by an acute shortage of previously owned home. 
The median new house price shot up 20.1% in August to $390,000 from a year ago. Prices were unchanged on a monthly basis. Last month, new home sales remained concentrated in the $200,000-$749,000 price range. 
Sales in the under-$200,000 price bracket, the sought-after segment of the market, accounted for just 3% of transactions.
There were 378,000 new homes on the market in August. That was the most since October 2008, and up from 366,000 in July. Houses under construction made up 62.7% of the inventory, with homes yet to be built accounting for a record 27.8%.

""The need to work through these backlogs should support new home construction in the months ahead even if the pace of sales moves sideways,"" said Nancy Vanden Houten, a U.S. economist at Oxford Economics in New York.
At August's sales pace it would take 6.1 months to clear the supply of houses on the market, up from 6.0 months in July.

BERLIN/FRANKFURT (Reuters) -German business morale fell for the third month running in September, hit by a ""bottleneck recession"" for manufacturers in Europe's largest economy that shows no sign of easing, a survey showed on Friday.
The Ifo institute said its business climate index fell to 98.8 from an upwardly revised 99.6 in August. A Reuters poll of analysts had pointed to a September reading of 98.9.
""Problems in the procurement of raw materials and intermediate products are putting the brakes on the German economy,"" Ifo President Clemens Fuest said in a statement.
""Manufacturing is experiencing a bottleneck recession.""
A separate survey on Thursday also showed Germany's economic recovery from the pandemic lost momentum https://reut.rs/3hXp2yy in September as activity in both the manufacturing and services sectors slowed amid supply bottlenecks and waning catch-up effects.
Ifo economist Klaus Wohlrabe said almost 80% of manufacturers surveyed had complained of intermediate goods shortages, up from 70% last month.
""The supply crisis will remain until at least the end of the year,"" he added. ""The peak lies ahead.""
Adding to the uncertainty facing Germany's economic outlook, the country votes in a national election on Sunday, after which Chancellor Angela Merkel plans to stand down. With the vote fractured, there are multiple potential coalition outcomes https://reut.rs/2ZeqYw3. 
On Wednesday, Ifo said it had cut its growth forecast https://reut.rs/3nU3Ux5 for the German economy for this year as supply chain disruptions and a scarcity of chips and other intermediate goods were slowing down the recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic.
The institute now sees Germany's gross domestic product (GDP) growing 2.5% this year, down 0.8 percentage points from its previous forecast, and 5.1% next year, up 0.8 points.
The weaker-than-expected rebound in 2021 follows a 4.6% plunge of overall economic output in 2020 caused by coronavirus restrictions on public life and business activities to contain the spread of the highly infectious disease.
Jens-Oliver Niklasch, economist at Landesbank Baden-Wuerttemberg, said: ""We are likely to face a difficult fourth quarter, in which the supply chain issue could even replace Corona as the main risk. And Corona is by no means over.""

The government, which so far has been forecasting growth of 3.5% for this year and 3.6% for next, will update its estimates in October.
A survey by the VDMA engineering industry association published last week showed most German mechanical engineering firms were facing noticeable or serious supply chain problems, with production growth expected to be affected next year.

Taiwan's export orders, a bellwether of global technology demand, jumped 17.6% from a year earlier to $53.5 billion in August, data from the Ministry of Economic Affairs showed on Friday. 
While that was the 18th month of expansion, the pace was slower than the median forecast of a rise of 20.7% in a Reuters poll. 
Huang Yu-ling, head of the ministry's statistics department, told reporters that orders for new smartphones were weaker than expected, and fewer people working from home as pandemic lockdown rules eased also affected orders, meaning they needed to buy fewer tablets and laptops.
Taiwanese companies such as Foxconn and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd (TSMC) are major suppliers to Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) Inc and other global tech firms.
Apple unveiled the iPhone 13 and a new iPad mini last week, expanding 5G connectivity and showing off faster chips and sharper cameras without raising the phone's price. 
Looking ahead, the ministry warned COVID-19 cases could pick up globally ahead of winter adding uncertainty to the economic outlook.
However, more consumer electronic products coming to market and ""flourishing"" demand for electric vehicles will help support Taiwan's export order momentum, it added. 
In July, export orders leapt 21.4% from a year earlier to $55.3 billion.
The second half of the year is typically stronger due to high demand for electronics during the year-end holiday shopping season in Europe and the United States.
The ministry said it expects export orders in September to rise between 15.9% and 18.9% from a year earlier. 

Orders from the United States rose 19.2% in August from a year earlier, a faster rate of expansion compared with the 16.5% logged in July, while orders from China were up 15.9%, versus a gain of 20.1% the previous month. 
Orders from Europe increased 3.7%, while those from Japan were up 18.3%.

National statistics institute ISTAT's manufacturing confidence index edged down to 113.0 in September from 113.2 in August, but was still above a median forecast of 112.6 in a Reuters survey of eight analysts.
ISTAT's composite business morale index, combining surveys of the manufacturing, retail, construction and services sectors, came in at 113.8 in September, down from August's reading of 114.0.
However, consumer confidence surged this month to 119.6 from 116.2 in August, easily beating a median forecast of 115.8 in Reuters' poll and posting its highest level since ISTAT's current series began in January 1998.
Prime Minister Mario Draghi's government has been progressively easing restrictions on business and movement since the spring, in response to a decline in coronavirus infection rates and progress in Italy's vaccination campaign.
Hobbled by COVID-19 lockdowns, the euro zone's third largest economy contracted by 8.9% last year, its steepest post-war decline in gross domestic product. 
Rome's official forecast is for a rebound of 4.5% this year, but recent data has been positive and the government is expected to raise its forecast to around 6% when it publishes new projections next week.

1305,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 24, 2021 02:46AM ET</span>","Analysis-Red tape, political hurdles hinder Draghi's drive to reform Italy","By Angelo Amante, Gavin Jones and Giuseppe Fonte
ROME (Reuters) - Prime Minister Mario Draghi set an ambitious reform timeline to relaunch Italy's chronically sluggish economy after the COVID-19 pandemic, but political disputes and cloying bureaucracy are starting to get in his way. 
The government has been trying for weeks to overcome divisions in the multi-party ruling coalition over a tax reform and a market competition law which Draghi had promised by the end of July as part of Rome's Recovery Plan.
Presented to the European Union in April, the Plan sets out infrastructure investments and reforms to raise Italy's growth potential and obtain more than 200 billion euros ($234.52 billion) of EU funds over the next six years.
""The delays in the reforms put at risk the next tranches of EU money, and above all they push back what is most important, that the Recovery Plan is put into action fast and effectively,"" Carlo Bonomi, head of employers lobby Confindustria told its annual assembly on Thursday. 
Draghi made a solid start, meeting initial requirements needed to unlock a first tranche of 25 billion euros, which was paid by the EU in August.
He also hammered out a coalition deal to pass a fiercely contested reform of the criminal justice system, while new rules to speed up civil cases are close to approval in parliament.
However, of the 51 goals set in the Recovery Plan for 2021, 38 are left for the fourth quarter, and the government seems to be faltering just when it needs to accelerate.
Special commissioners responsible for overseeing infrastructure projects in the plan recently wrote to the government complaining that red tape is hindering their work, one of the commissioners told Reuters, asking not to be named.
Another commissioner, Pasqualino Monti, who is in charge of ports in western Sicily, warned that if the state bureaucracy continues to act as a brake on projects ""we will hit an obstacle as insurmountable as the Great Wall of China"".
In a statement after Thursday's cabinet meeting, the government urged ministers to present a road map for all the interventions needed and said it is considering new measures to speed up the projects.
Meetings will be called of all the administrations involved to monitor the progress of the national recovery plan and highlight any hurdles.
Draghi is running up against the same difficulties that have hobbled Italy for decades: political fragmentation, bureaucracy and almost constant electioneering.
Big cities including Rome and Milan will elect new mayors on Oct. 3-4, and the parties in Draghi's national unity government are unwilling to take any steps that could upset their voters.
""The problems Draghi is having now were inevitable,"" said Eugenio Pizzimenti, a politics professor at Pisa University.
""We have been living under a collective illusion that a group of technocrats could fix everything, but these are political decisions, not technical ones, and conflicting interests are at stake.""
NATIONAL SAVIOURS
There are parallels between Draghi and Mario Monti, another non-partisan technocrat who led a similarly broad coalition for just over a year from 2011, when he took office at the height of a debt crisis.
Monti, like Draghi, was initially hailed as a national saviour, but after he passed swingeing budget cuts and a tough pension reform the parties turned against him, his government lost momentum and his personal popularity slumped.
Draghi, whose term ends in 2023, has one big advantage: whereas Monti had to make cuts, he has billions of euros of extra spending to allocate - provided the investment and reform momentum is maintained.
The aim of the delayed tax reform is to simplify the system, reduce income tax and curb evasion, while the competition law is needed to ensure a level playing field for infrastructure investments in ports, telecoms and the national power grid.
Both are being held up by political bickering.
The government, which has said the tax reform will not weigh on public finances, wants to update the taxable value of Italian real estate, which is usually far below real market values.
This is opposed by the right-wing League and Silvio Berlusconi's conservative Forza Italia, key coalition parties.
Both present themselves as staunch defenders of home-owners and say the government's plan is unacceptable because it will result in higher housing levies.
""We defend the right to property. This is not the time to raise taxes,"" said Antonio Tajani, Forza Italia's deputy leader.
Similar tensions are blocking the competition law, with both parties rejecting plans to liberalise the lucrative concessions to run tourist services on Italy's beaches.
These concessions are traditionally family-owned and passed down from one generation to another, despite repeated calls by the European Commission for them to be offered at open tenders.
Politics professor Pizzimenti said the huge differences in Draghi's coalition meant such disputes were only likely to get worse, resulting in more delays and weak reforms.

""I think sooner or later Brussels will tell us we haven't done what we promised,"" he said.

1306,By Bloomberg,"<span>Sep 23, 2021 08:54PM ET</span>",Japan Consumer Prices Stop Falling for First Time in 13 Months,"(Bloomberg) -- Japan’s consumer prices stopped falling in August for the first time in 13 months, ending the country’s longest deflationary stretch since 2011.
Prices, excluding those for fresh food, were unchanged from a year earlier, the ministry of internal affairs reported Friday in a result that matched the estimate from analysts. Rising costs for hotels, processed food and energy cushioned the impact of mobile phone rates that have fallen sharply under pressure from outgoing Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga. 
 
Despite August’s slightly improved reading, Japan’s weak inflation pulse has trapped the Bank of Japan in a holding-pattern while the Federal Reserve and other central banks move toward reining in pandemic stimulus. The BOJ on Wednesday kept its key stimulus tools in place and is likely stuck for the foreseeable future.
“At least we can say prices aren’t falling, so the BOJ can continue to keep a close eye on it, without taking additional easing steps,” said economist Taro Saito at NLI Research Institute. 
While producer prices have jumped recently, climbing 5.5% in August, most Japanese firms aren’t choosing to pass those costs on to customers. Notable exceptions include Yamazaki Baking and dairy company Megmilk Snow Brand, which recently hiked prices due to higher costs of raw materials from oil to sugar.
BOJ Flags Pressure on Economy Ahead of Japan Leadership Vote
Global supply-chain snags and surging commodities prompted the Paris-based OECD this week to raise its forecast for consumer price inflation this year and next in every Group of Seven country, except Japan.
August’s inflation report continued to show the numbers being swayed by government initiatives that analysts say have made it hard to grasp underyling price trends.
The cost of hotel accommodation rose nearly 50% compared with the level last summer, when the government’s “Go-To Travel” discounts to help the ailing tourism industry had just gone into effect. 
BOJ Flags Pressure on Economy Ahead of Japan Leadership Vote
Moving in the opposite direction, the cost of mobile phone service fell by almost the same amount, shaving 1.2 percentage points from the overall price index. Getting phone companies to slash rates was a top priority of the Suga administration. 
What Bloomberg Economics Says...
“We expect the core CPI to rise 0.2% in September, supported by higher energy prices. Beyond that, pent-up demand and a lower base for energy prices last year will support inflation toward the end of the year, assuming virus infections are brought under control by September.”
--Yuki Masujima, economist

With more expensive energy and the continuing hotel-effect, some small price gains should start to take hold in Japan, especially as higher vaccination rates begin to allow for restrictions on businesses to be lifted and shoppers get out more. The latest state of emergency is set to last through the month. 
The ruling Liberal Democratic Party is preparing next week to pick a replacement for Suga, with the new leader widely expected to put together a stimulus package to help the economy get back on a firmer recovery track.

(Reuters) -U.S. household wealth jumped to a new high of $141.7 trillion at the end of June, a report from the Federal Reserve showed on Thursday, boosted by stock market gains and a pandemic-induced real-estate boom. 
Soaring equity markets fueled the increase in overall wealth, adding $3.5 trillion to household assets in the second quarter - a period in which the S&P 500 saw a total return of just over 8.5% after factoring in reinvested dividends. 
Rising real estate values added around $1.2 trillion, according to the U.S. central bank's latest quarterly report https://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/z1 on household, business and government financial accounts.
Overall U.S. household wealth rose by $5.9 trillion from the first quarter.
The amount held in household savings deposits fell to $10.6 trillion in the second quarter from $10.8 trillion in the first quarter. Balances in checking accounts rose to $3.6 trillion from $3.3 trillion in the first quarter, the report showed. 
The latest snapshot of U.S. household wealth and how it has grown over the coronavirus pandemic shows just how unique the downturn has proven to be. With the help of unparalleled monetary and fiscal policy responses that fortified personal balance sheets and sent asset prices soaring, household wealth has rocketed by $31 trillion - 28% - since the first quarter of 2020, an unprecedented increase. 
Much of the support offered to households, including enhanced unemployment benefits or mortgage forbearance, has either ended or will be expiring in the coming months, just as a resurgence in COVID-19 infections is hurting some vulnerable sectors and slowing job growth.
The report showed that household debt grew at an annualized rate of 7.9% in the second quarter, compared to 6.7% in the first quarter. 

Non-financial business borrowing rose at a slower annualized rate of 1.4%, compared to 4.3% in the first quarter. 
And government borrowing increased at an annualized rate of 9.6%, up from 9.0% the previous quarter.

1308,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 23, 2021 11:35AM ET</span>",U.S. weekly jobless claims unexpectedly rise; labor market recovery on track,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits unexpectedly rose last week, boosted by surges in California and Virginia, but the underlying trend remained consistent with a steadily recovering labor market. 
The second straight weekly increase in jobless claims reported by the Labor Department on Thursday puzzled economists. Some pointed a finger at the wildfires in California, while others blamed Hurricane Ida, which devastated U.S. offshore energy production in late August. There was little conviction that ongoing COVID-19 infections, driven by the highly contagious Delta variant of the coronavirus, were a factor.
""Some, but not all, of this recent pickup looks related to Hurricane Ida, as filings in Louisiana have been above their pre-storm trend in recent weeks,"" said Daniel Silver, an economist at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) in New York. ""But even including any storm-related claims, the recent move up in filings has not looked particularly severe so far, and we don't think the labor market recovery has been derailed at this point."" 
Initial claims for state unemployment benefits increased 16,000 to a seasonally adjusted 351,000 for the week ended Sept. 18. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast 320,000 applications for the latest week.
Unadjusted claims in California jumped 24,221 while Virginia reported a rise of 12,879. There were also notable increases in Oregon, Ohio and Kentucky. Claims in Louisiana fell and have been above their pre-hurricane trend in recent weeks.
""Perhaps fires in California and the lingering impact of Ida in Virginia contributed to those increases, but we don't know for certain,"" said Nancy Vanden Houten, lead U.S. economist at Oxford Economics in New York. ""We expect claims to return to their downward path in the weeks ahead, but the data will be more uneven as claims get closer to pre-pandemic levels.""
The four-week moving average of claims, considered a better measure of labor market trends as it irons out week-to-week volatility, fell 750 to 335,750 last week. That was the lowest level since mid-March 2020 when mandatory closures of nonessential businesses were enforced when the nation was slammed by the first wave of coronavirus cases. 
Claims have dropped from a record 6.149 million in early April 2020, but still remain above the 200,000-250,000 range that is viewed as consistent with healthy labor market conditions. 
The Federal Reserve on Wednesday struck an upbeat note on the economy, paving the way to reduce its monthly bond purchases ""soon"" and signaling interest rate increases may follow more quickly than expected.
A survey on Thursday from data firm IHS Markit showed business activity grew at its slowest pace in a year in September as companies struggled with ongoing shortages of raw materials and labor.
But the slowdown is likely temporary. A third report from the Conference Board showed its leading economic index, a gauge of future U.S. economic activity, increased 0.9% in August after rising 0.8% in July. The Conference Board said ""the trend in the LEI is consistent with robust economic growth in the reminder of the year."" 
Stocks on Wall Street were trading higher. The dollar slipped against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices were lower.
WORKER SHORTAGES 
Last week's claims data covered the period during which the government surveyed employers for the nonfarm payrolls portion of September's employment report. Claims were little changed between the August and September payrolls survey periods.
Job growth slowed in August, with payrolls posting their smallest gain in seven months as hiring stalled in the high-contact leisure and hospitality sector. 
The claims report also showed the number of people continuing to receive benefits after an initial week of aid increased 131,000 to 2.845 million in the week ended Sept. 11. Data next week on the so-called continuing claims will offer more clues on how hiring fared in September. 
Pandemic-related factors are causing worker shortages, which are constraining hiring. Fed Chair Jerome Powell told reporters on Wednesday that he anticipated ""more rapid gains in employment"" as these factors, which include lack of affordable childcare and fears contracting the virus, diminish.
There were a record 10.9 million job openings at the end of July. The Fed projected the unemployment rate to be at 4.8% this year. That was up from the 4.5% rate the U.S. central bank projected in June. The jobless rate was 5.2% in August.
There is cautious optimism that the labor crunch will ease following the expiration of government-funded unemployment benefits early this month, which had been blamed by businesses and Republicans for encouraging the unemployed to stay at home. 
At least 11.250 million people were receiving benefits under all programs during the week ended Sept. 4. According to Andrew Stettner, senior fellow at the Century Foundation, more than 8 million people have lost all their pandemic benefits.

It is, however, unlikely that this would boost the labor pool. An early termination of expanded benefits by about 25 states led by Republican governors over the summer did not led to a surge in hiring in those areas and the Delta variant could cause reluctance among some people to return to work.
""For the labor market, recovery is ongoing, but supply shortages remain a headwind,"" said Rubeela Farooqi, chief U.S. economist at High Frequency Economics in White Plains, New York.

1309,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 23, 2021 09:56AM ET</span>",U.S. business activity grows at slowest pace in 12 months - IHS Markit survey,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. business activity expanded at its slowest pace in a year in September amid relentless supply constraints and peaking demand, in line with expectations for a sharp slowdown in economic growth in the third quarter. 
Data firm IHS Markit said on Thursday its flash U.S. Composite PMI Output Index, which tracks the manufacturing and services sectors, fell to 54.5 this month. That was the lowest reading since September 2020 and followed 55.4 in August. A reading above 50 indicates growth in the private sector.
Businesses are struggling with perennial shortages of raw materials and labor as the economy normalizes following unprecedented disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. 
There had been optimism that the supply chains would adjust soon, but the Delta variant of the coronavirus has worsened the scarcity of some raw materials, produced primarily in Southeast Asia. Congestion at ports in China is also contributing to keeping the supply chains tight.
Economists are anticipating a significant slowdown in gross domestic product this quarter also as the boost from pandemic relief money from the government fades. Growth estimates for the third quarter are as low as a 2.6% annualized rate. The economy grew at a 6.6% pace in the April-June quarter.
With bottlenecks in the supply chains persisting, businesses continued to pay higher prices for inputs, a sign that inflation could remain hot for a while even though the monthly pace of consumer price increases has been slowing in recent months. 
The Federal Reserve on Wednesday raised its projection for its key inflation measure to 3.7% this year from 3.0% in June. The U.S. central bank has a flexible 2% target. Fed Chair Jerome Powell told reporters that ""hiring difficulties and other constraints could again prove to be greater and longer lasting than anticipated, posing upside risks to inflation."" 
The IHS Markit survey's flash services sector PMI fell to a 14-month low reading of 54.4 in September from 55.1 in August, Economists polled by Reuters had forecast a reading of 55 this month for the services sector, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity.
The moderation in growth reflected less robust demand conditions and ongoing COVID-19 worries. According to the survey, sales were also hampered by a faster pace of decline in new export orders.

Manufacturing is also losing steam. The survey's flash manufacturing PMI fell to 60.5 this month from a reading of 61.1 in August. Economists had forecast the index for the sector, which accounts for 11.9% of the economy, would edged up to 61.5.
Manufacturers reported longer lead times as trucking issues and capacity shortages led to what the survey said was one of the greatest deteriorations in vendor performance on record.

Initial unemployment claims in regular state programs rose to 351,000 in the week ended Sept. 18, Labor Department data showed Thursday. The median estimate in a Bloomberg survey of economists called for a decrease to 320,000 new applications.
Continuing claims for state benefits increased to 2.8 million in the week ended Sept. 11.
The rise in claims reflects the volatility in weekly data as the figure has broadly declined throughout the economic recovery.
Looking ahead, economic growth is expected to slow in the third quarter amid a pullback in stimulus spending. The end of federal pandemic benefits has not yet led to an increase in job applications, according to employers across industries.

1311,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 23, 2021 07:46AM ET</span>","Spain's quarterly growth revised sharply lower, 2021 outlook at risk","By Belén Carreño and Inti Landauro
MADRID (Reuters) - The pace of Spain's economic recovery from the coronavirus crisis in the second quarter was less than half the initial estimate, official data showed on Thursday, jeopardising upbeat full-year forecasts of a return to pre-pandemic output levels. 
In an unprecedentedly sharp revision, the National Statistics Institute (INE) said the economy grew just 1.1% in the April-June period from the previous quarter, down from a flash estimate of 2.8% released in late July. It also revised the scale of the first-quarter contraction to 0.6% from 0.4%.
Until this revision, the Spanish economy had been recording one of the fastest rebounds among developed countries, after a historic 10.8% slump in 2020.
Just two days ago, the OECD ranked Spain as the fourth-fastest growing economy in the world this year and the Bank of Spain revised higher its full-year growth forecast for 2021 to 6.3%, describing the July estimate for second-quarter expansion as ""a positive and big surprise"".
Economy Minister Nadia Calvino earlier this week announced an expected return to pre-pandemic GDP levels by the end of 2021..
With today's data, such calculations will probably change. 
The INE said its downward revision was prompted by final data on sales, from both large and small companies in the service and manufacturing industries, as well as private consumption. 
'STATISTICAL CHALLENGE'
It now believes the segments most exposed to consumption, such as retail, restaurants and transport, had shrunk 0.4%, while it had previously estimated 5.5% growth. 
""It is a period of large and rapid changes... It poses an unprecedented statistical challenge,"" the INE added.
The INE also revised year-on-year growth for the second quarter to 17.8% from 19.8%. In the same quarter of 2020, Spain was under a strict lockdown. 
""The downward revision of GDP growth... will significantly delay the recovery of the Spanish economy after the COVID-19 crisis and implies a downward bias in our growth scenario for 2021"", said Rafael Domenech, chief economist at BBVA (MC:BBVA).

The Bank of Spain, asked if it would now review its outlook, said it would take the new data into account for future forecasts, adding the INE's July estimate had surprised on the upside.
Skyrocketing electricity prices are also pressuring Spanish household and business spending, the Funcas think-tank said, posing further challenges to Spain's growth.

LONDON (Reuters) -Britain's economy lost more momentum this month as businesses grappled again with rising costs, a survey showed, highlighting the difficult backdrop for Bank of England officials ahead of Thursday's interest rate decision.
The preliminary ""flash"" IHS Markit/CIPS flash Composite Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) dropped for a fourth consecutive month in September to its lowest reading since February, slipping to 54.1 from 54.8 in August.
A Reuters poll of economists had pointed to a reading of 54.5. The survey, a gauge of health for Britain's businesses, showed a slowdown in both the services and the manufacturing sectors.
The readings, which will have been seen by BoE officials in advance of the central bank's 1100 GMT policy announcement, add to signs of fading momentum in the economy just as inflation surges, fuelled by global supply chain problems and rising energy prices.
PMI data company IHS Markit said the figures suggested Britain may be on course for a bout of stagflation - a mixture of poor growth and high inflation associated with the economic malaise of the 1970s.
""While the UK PMIs maybe aren't the best place to look for guidance on where GDP is right now, they nevertheless emphasise that the recovery is stalling as we head into winter,"" ING economist James Smith said.
IHS Markit said there were clear signs that shortages of materials and labour were holding back growth. The composite PMI for Britain lagged behind those for France and Germany.
The PMI for the services sector fell to 54.6 in September from 55.0 in August, its lowest level since February when Britain was still in lockdown.
Business expectations among services companies fell to a nine-month low and they raised prices on the broadest basis since records started in the mid-1990s.
""Brexit was often cited as having exacerbated global pandemic-related supply and labour market constraints, as well as often being blamed on lost export sales,"" Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit, said.

While the BoE has said it expects the current rise in inflation to be transitory, the increase has put rate-setters under more pressure to explain how they plan to unwind the stimulus launched last year to help the economy through the COVID-19 pandemic.
The PMI for the manufacturing sector fell to 56.3 in September from 60.3 in August, also marking its lowest level since February.

(Reuters) - Euro zone business growth was much weaker than expected this month as curbs to limit the Delta variant of coronavirus hit demand and already worsened supply-chain constraints pushed input cost rises to an over two-decade high, a survey showed. 
Despite daily infection rates slowing significantly over the past month, most remaining restrictions are unlikely to be lifted anytime soon in major economies, including Germany and France, on concerns over how the pandemic might develop in the months ahead.
IHS Markit's Flash Composite Purchasing Managers' Index, a good gauge of overall economic health, fell to a five-month low of 56.1 in September from 59.0 in August.
Although it stayed above the 50 level separating growth from contraction for the seventh consecutive month, it was well below a Reuters poll estimate of 58.5.
""September's PMIs suggest that the pace of recovery slowed further at the end of Q3, in part as the euro zone economy approaches its pre-virus size but also as supply shortages continue to bite,"" said Jessica Hinds, Europe economist at Capital Economics.
""Price pressures remain intense and sky-high energy prices suggest that these are unlikely to ease any time soon.""
Those supply distortions - one of the primary drivers of prices throughout the globe over past months - are far from resolved and the trend of higher inflation is here to stay. A sub-index tracking input costs throughout the bloc hit its highest in 21 years. 
European Central Bank policymakers recently acknowledged the risk price growth may exceed their relatively benign projections, but will trim emergency bond purchases over the coming quarter.
The Ifo institute on Wednesday cut its 2021 growth forecast for Germany to 2.5%, pointing to supply chain disruptions.
The purchasing managers' surveys told the same story with Germany and France - the bloc's two biggest economies - suffering slowdowns as the bottlenecks put a brake on activity. Both manufacturing and services sectors grew at a weaker than expected pace. 
In Britain, outside the currency union, the economy also lost more momentum as businesses grappled again with rising costs. [GB/PMIS] 
DEMAND WANES 
Optimism about future output fell to an eight-month low. That contrasts with improving consumer sentiment, according to the latest European Commission data.
""Supply constraints are increasingly weighing on confidence. The weaker confidence was across the board,"" said Peter Vanden Houte, chief economist at ING. 
New services business in the bloc expanded at its slowest pace in five months, according to the PMI survey.

Weakening demand led factories to hire at the slowest pace in six months. Meanwhile, their backlogs of work expanded at a robust pace again, signaling worsening supply constraints.
""Overall, today's data confirm our expectation that, contrary to the ECB's forecast, economic growth in the euro area will weaken significantly in the final quarter,"" said Christoph Weil, senior economist at Commerzbank (DE:CBKG).

IHS Markit's flash Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) showed growth in the manufacturing sector slowed to an eight-month low reading of 58.5 from 62.6 in August. The subindex for the services sector slipped to a four-month low of 56.0 from 60.8 in August.
As a result, the flash composite PMI, which tracks the manufacturing and services sectors that together account for more than two-thirds of the German economy, dropped to a seven-month low of 55.3 from 60.0 in August.
IHS Markit analyst Phil Smith said the survey data suggested that business activity was beginning to level off after rebounding sharply over the summer months.
""However, despite the slowdown in September, the pace of economic growth in the third quarter still looks to have surpassed the 1.6% expansion seen in the three months to June,"" Smith added.

While companies remained upbeat about their business outlook on hopes that the pandemic could be overcome soon, growth expectations were still held back by supply chain concerns and risks posed to demand from rising prices, Smith said.

Data compiler IHS Markit said its preliminary composite Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) - factoring in both the services and manufacturing sectors - fell to 55.1 points in September from 55.9 in August, and below a forecast for 55.8 points.
Overall, the PMI figures for France remained well above the 50-point threshold dividing expansions in activity from contractions.
Nevertheless, the preliminary September PMI figure for France's dominant services sector dipped to 56.0 points from 56.3 in August.
The preliminary PMI figure for the manufacturing sector fell to 55.2 points in September from 57.5 in August, and below a forecast for 57.0 points.
IHS Markit said the preliminary September numbers for the composite and manufacturing PMIs marked a five- and eight-month low, respectively.

""Flash PMI data for September provides clear evidence that economic growth in France is cooling,"" said IHS Markit senior economist Joe Hayes.
""The most striking finding from the September survey was the strong drop-off in manufacturing production growth, which panel members linked to the well-documented supply-side issues that are ongoing at present,"" added Hayes.

1317,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 23, 2021 12:10AM ET</span>",U.S. business optimism in China rebounds to pre-trade war levels -survey,"SHANGHAI (Reuters) - U.S. companies' optimism about business conditions in China has recovered to hit three-year highs even though the firms have reservations about Beijing's COVID-19 policy, an annual survey showed on Thursday. 
Beijing's wide-ranging crackdown on companies has also unnerved U.S. firms, an American industry lobby executive said. 
The American Chamber of Commerce in Shanghai, which conducted the survey with consultancy PwC China, attributed the renewed optimism to rising revenues as well as ebbing concerns over the COVID-19 pandemic in China, which has largely gotten control over its spread with a zero-tolerance policy. 
U.S.-China relations reached a nadir in 2019 during the Trump administration, which launched a bruising trade war with China and also floated sanctions toward some of China's highest-profile tech companies.
The Biden administration, however, has shown more reservation towards taking direct action against Beijing, though relations remain tense.
“Business in China recovered quickly from last year’s lockdown,"" said Ker Gibbs, president of the American Chamber of Commerce in Shanghai which published the survey that was conducted between mid-June and mid-July.
""However, we are still feeling the pandemic’s effects, with members continuing to be negatively impacted by China’s travel restrictions. Overall business performance is good but there are signs of nervousness."" 
Of the 338 respondent companies, 78% described themselves as ""optimistic or slightly optimistic"" about their five-year business outlook in 2021, nearly 20 percentage points more from 2020 and a return toward 2018 levels, the survey said. 
By contrast, in 2021, 10% of respondent companies described themselves as ""pessimistic"" about their five-year outlook, compared to 18% and 21% of respondents in 2020 and 2019, respectively.
But firms expressed reservations toward some Chinese policy in the aftermath of COVID-19, especially with respect to hiring labour, the survey said. 
About two-thirds of respondents said they plan to increase their China headcount this year, a 31.4 percentage point increase from 2020, but 62.3% of respondents described workforce availability as posing some hindrance or a serious hindrance to operations. 
China's borders remained closed to most visitors without proper work and residence permits, and all entrants must complete at least two-week quarantine upon arrival. 
Companies also reported a slight dip in policy transparency. In 2021, 46.7% of respondents called the regulatory environment transparent, down from 51.4% the year prior.

Those figures come during a year of ongoing regulatory tightening from Chinese authorities targeting a range of industries, as well as the implementation of new laws governing data privacy and data security.
“Further hindering our members, many regulatory changes were enacted after our survey closed. While well-intentioned, they were announced with little or no warning, which has unsettled companies,"" Gibbs added.

1319,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 22, 2021 04:11PM ET</span>","U.S. home sales fall, house price inflation cooling","By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. home sales fell in August as supply remained tight, but there are signs the surge in house prices and the COVID-19 pandemic-fueled demand have probably run their course. 
Still, prices remain high enough to keep some potential buyers from a hot housing market. The report from the National Association of Realtors on Wednesday showed the smallest share of first-time homebuyers in more than 2-1/2 years and houses continuing to be snapped up typically after only 17 days on the market.
""The recent moderation in existing home sales reflects some easing of the buying frenzy that carried over into early 2021,"" said Mark Vitner, a senior economist at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) in Charlotte North Carolina. ""The frantic race for space sent prices soaring. We continue to expect the housing market to move back into balance over the next couple of years.""
Existing home sales dropped 2.0% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.88 million units last month. Sales fell in all four regions, with the densely populated South posting a 3.0% decline. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast sales would decline to a rate of 5.89 million units in August.
Single-family sales fell 1.9%, while condo/co-op sales dropping 2.8%. The decrease in sales coincided with a recent change in consumer attitudes towards buying a home.
Home resales, which account for the bulk of U.S. home sales, fell 1.5% on a year-on-year basis. The annual comparison was distorted by the pandemic-driven surge in sales in August 2020. Sales are up 16% so far this year compared to the same period in 2020 and remain well above their pre-pandemic level.
The housing market boomed early in the coronavirus pandemic amid an exodus from cities as people worked from home and took classes online, which fueled demand for bigger homes in the suburbs and other low-density areas. 
The surge, which was skewed towards the single-family housing market segment, far outpaced supply. Expensive building materials as well as land and labor shortages have made it harder for builders to boost production. At the same time, some homeowners are reluctant to sell because of concerns they might not find something affordable, keeping inventory tight. 
Government data on Tuesday showed single-family homebuilding fell for a second straight month in August.
Though the pandemic tailwind is fading, demand for housing remains strong thanks to near record low mortgage rates and rising wages from a tightening labor market. A separate report from the Mortgage Bankers Association showed a modest rise in applications for loans to purchase a home last week. 
Mortgage rates could rise after the Federal Reserve on Wednesday cleared the way to reduce its monthly bond purchases ""soon"" and signaled interest rate increases may follow more quickly than expected.
Stocks on Wall Street were trading higher, recouping some of the recent losses as concerns over a default by Chinese property developer Evergrande eased. The dollar fell against a basket of currencies. Prices of longer-dated U.S. Treasuries rose.

TIGHT SUPPLY
The median existing house price increased 14.9% from a year ago to $356,700 in August. That is a deceleration from a 23.6% jump in May. The slowdown in house price inflation adds to anecdotal evidence that some sellers are reducing their asking prices. Realtors are also noting that bidding wars are subsiding.
""We expect home price growth to slow further over the balance of this year and through 2022 as the housing inventory shortage eases and demand moderates,"" said Scott Anderson, chief economist at Bank of the West in San Francisco.
Sales remained concentrated in the upper price end of the market, with transactions of homes in the below-$250,000 price range continuing to experience double-digit declines.
Residential investment contracted in the second quarter after three straight quarters of double-digit growth. 
August's sales decline implies lower broker commissions. This together with the drop in housing starts suggests a further decrease in residential investment this quarter. 
There were 1.29 million previously owned homes on the market last month, down 13.4% from a year ago. At August's sales pace, it would take 2.6 months to exhaust the current inventory, down from 3.0 months a year ago. A six-to-seven-month supply is viewed as a healthy balance between supply and demand. 
In August, properties typically remained on the market for 17 days, unchanged from July, but down from 22 days a year ago. Eighty-seven percent of the homes sold last month were on the market for less than a month.

First-time buyers accounted for 29% of sales, the lowest since January 2019 and down from 30% in July and 33% a year ago. All-cash sales accounted for 22% of transactions, down from 23% in July and up from 18% a year ago.
""There is a suggestion here in the moderation of price gains and sales, and a declining share of first-time buyers, that a considerable portion of the stock adjustment of demand for homes to low rates and pandemic-driven population moves has taken place,"" said Conrad DeQuadros, senior economic advisor at Brean Capital in New York.

Around 50,200 homes were sold in July, 53% more than in the same month in 2020, according to the figures from the National Statistics Institute.
The July sale figures were 4% above pre-pandemic levels and approached the frenzied pace recorded during Spain's ill-fated real estate boom in 2008, when the month of April alone saw some 55,000 houses sold.
""If you compare with the same month in 2019, the evolution is positive ... which confirms that we've not only surpassed pre-pandemic numbers but also re-entered the big upwards trend in house sales initiated in 2018,"" Maria Matos, a spokesperson for online property portal Fotocasa, said in a statement.

The sale of newly built homes rose 40% compared with July 2020, buoyed by enthusiasm for pools, terraces, gardens and other outdoor areas as remote working let more people move out to bigger properties in the suburbs, where most new developments are, Matos added.
In a bleaker sign of coronavirus impact, the rate of homes passed on through inheritance procedures continued to grow. The latest figures were up 20% year-on-year, representing one in five of all houses on sale, mirroring the surge in mortality amid the pandemic.

The median forecast from a poll of 18 economists expects export orders to jump 20.7% from the year-ago period. Forecasts for growth ranged from 18% to 24.5%.
Taiwan's export orders are a leading indicator of demand for hi-tech gadgets and Asia's exports, and typically lead actual exports by two to three months.

1322,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 21, 2021 03:55PM ET</span>",UK inflation expectations show record jump in Sept -Citi/YouGov,"By David Milliken
LONDON (Reuters) - The British public's expectations for inflation over the coming year have shot up by a record amount this month, raising the risk that the Bank of England will send a hawkish message soon, Citi said on Tuesday.
The Citi/YouGov monthly inflation expectations survey showed that public inflation expectations for the next 12 months jumped to 4.1% in September from 3.1% in August, the biggest monthly increase since the survey began more than 15 years ago.
Longer-term inflation expectations for the next five to 10 years rose to 3.8% in September from 3.5% in August.
""Today's data, especially the movement in long-term expectations, suggest growing risks inflation expectations could become de-anchored to the upside. The sharp increase risks a hawkish response from the (Monetary Policy Committee) this week,"" Citi said.
The BoE's Monetary Policy Committee is meeting ahead of its September policy statement on Thursday. Citi's survey contrasts with a much smaller increase in inflation expectations in a poll for August which the BoE published last week. 
Financial markets expect the BoE to start to raise interest rates early next year, possibly as soon as February, though most economists think a move will only come towards the end of 2022.
The BoE looks closely at inflation expectations for signs the public expect above-average inflation over the medium term, which could lead to greater pressure for pay rises and prompt businesses to raise prices in expectation of higher costs.

Inflation expectations tend to be pushed up by short-term rises in the current rate of inflation. Last month, consumer price inflation jumped to 3.2% from July's 2.0%, and in recent days energy companies have warned of big rises in electricity and heating bills.
The Citi/YouGov survey was based on a poll of 2,005 adults on Sept. 20 and Sept. 21.

1323,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 21, 2021 02:06PM ET</span>","Labor, building material shortages depress U.S. single-family housing starts","By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. single-family homebuilding fell for a second straight month in August as builders continued to struggle with shortages of materials and labor, suggesting the housing market could remain a drag on economic growth in the third quarter. 
The report from the Commerce Department on Tuesday also showed the number of houses authorized for construction but not yet started raced to a record high last month, a sign of reluctance by builders to take on new projects. 
Builders' inability to ramp up the production of single-family homes amid a massive housing shortage is driving up prices and keeping some first-time buyers from the market.
""While lumber prices have plummeted in the spot market, those lower prices have not yet made their way to home builders,"" said Mark Vitner, a senior economist at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) in Charlotte, North Carolina. ""Moreover, other essential building materials remain in short supply, including windows, cabinets, electric breaker boxes and wedge anchors."" 
Single-family starts, which account for the largest share of the housing market, dropped 2.8% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.076 million units last month. The decline was, however, offset by a surge in starts for the volatile multi-family segment. 
As a result, overall housing starts advanced 3.9% to a rate of 1.615 million units in August. Data for July was revised up to a rate of 1.554 million units from the previously reported 1.534 million units. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast starts would rebound to a rate of 1.555 million units. Housing starts jumped 17.4% compared to August 2020.
Single-family starts dropped in the West and Midwest. They rose in the Northeast and the densely populated South.
Building costs remain an issue even though lumber futures have tumbled from a record high of $1,711 per thousand board feet in May to about $604 in Tuesday morning trade. 
Single-family homebuilding has struggled to gain traction since surging to a rate of 1.255 million units in March, which was the highest level since November 2006. 
Starts for buildings with five units or more soared 21.6% to a rate of 530,000 units last month, the highest level since January 2020. The multi-family housing segment is being boosted by demand for rentals as COVID-19 vaccinations allow companies to recall workers to offices in city centers. 
Early in the coronavirus pandemic, there was an exodus from cities as people worked from home and took classes online, fueling demand for bigger homes in the suburbs and other low-density areas. While the pandemic tailwind is fading, demand for housing remains strong thanks to near record low mortgage rates and rising wages from a tightening labor market.
Though the Federal Reserve is expected at the end of a two-day policy meeting on Wednesday to clear the way to trimming its monthly bond purchases later this year, that will likely have a limited impact on mortgage rates. The U.S. central is expected to keep its benchmark overnight interest rate near zero for a while. 
A survey from the National Association of Home Builders on Monday showed confidence among single-family homebuilders edged up from a 13-month low in September, but it noted that ""delivery times remain extended and the chronic construction labor shortage is expected to persist.""
Stocks on Wall Street rose as investors weighed the risk of contagion from debt-saddled Chinese developer Evergrande. The dollar dipped against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices were mixed.
(Graphic: Housing starts, https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-STOCKS/mypmnobydvr/hsbp.png) 
STRONG RENTAL DEMAND
Residential investment contracted in the second quarter after three straight quarters of double-digit growth. A further decline this quarter is likely.
""The softness in single-family starts suggests somewhat lower residential investment,"" said Blerina Uruci, an economist at  Barclays  (LON:BARC) in Washington. 
Permits for future homebuilding rose 6.0% to a rate of 1.728 million units in August. Single-family permits gained 0.6% to a rate of 1.054 million units. Permits for buildings with five units or more jumped 19.7% to a rate of 632,000 units, the highest level since January 1990.
""We conjecture that this strength in multi-family may be a response to the strong increase in asking rents and the low vacancy rates in rental units,"" said Conrad DeQuadros, senior economic advisor at Brean Capital in New York.
The backlog of homes yet to be started increased 3.7% to 251,000 units, a record high. Single-family homes yet to be started were near a 15-year high.
Housing completions fell 4.5% to a rate of 1.330 million units last month. Single-family home completions rose 2.8% to a rate of 971,000 units. The pandemic has lengthened the time from when a permit is issued for single-family home construction to completion, which economists blame on supply constraints.
The inventory of previously owned homes is near record lows, leading to record double-digit annual growth in home prices.
Realtors estimate that single-family housing starts and completion rates need to be in a range of 1.5 million to 1.6 million units per month to close the inventory gap.

The stock of housing under construction increased 1.7% to a rate of 1.404 million units last month.
""Supply issues will constrain production for some time yet and we expect single-family starts will see only a gradual rise from here, reaching 1.16 million annualized by end-2021,"" said Matthew Pointon, a senior property economist at Capital Economics in New York.

The Commerce Department said on Tuesday the current account deficit, which measures the flow of goods, services and investments into and out of the country, rose 0.5% to $190.3 billion last quarter. That was the largest shortfall since the second quarter of 2007.
Data for the first quarter was revised to show a $189.4 billion gap, instead of $195.7 billion as previously reported. 
The current account gap represented 3.3% of gross domestic product last quarter. That was down from 3.4% in the January-March quarter. Still, the deficit remains below a peak of 6.3% of GDP in the fourth quarter of 2005 as the United States is now a net exporter of crude oil and fuel.
The wider deficit is likely not an issue for the United States because of the dollar's status as the world's reserve currency. The current account gap could remain big as the nation leads the global economic recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic.
The economy grew at a 6.6% annualized rate in the second quarter, powered by another quarter of double-digit growth in consumer spending. Domestic demand, which has been buoyed by fiscal stimulus and vaccinations against the coronavirus, is being partially satiated with imports. 
Inventories were depleted in the first half of the year.
Imports of goods increased $29.0 billion to $706.3 billion, primarily reflecting an increase in industrial supplies and materials, mostly petroleum products as well as metals and nonmetallic products.
Exports of goods rose $28.3 billion to $436.6 billion, lifted by industrial supplies and materials such as petroleum products. There were also gains in exports of capital goods, mainly civilian aircraft and semiconductors.
Imports of services increased $9.1 billion to $127.8 billion, mostly reflecting increases in sea freight and air passenger transport as well as other personal travel. 
Exports of services increased $7.6 billion to $189.1 billion. They were driven by personal travel.

Primary income receipts advanced $7.7 billion to $270.6 billion. Payments of primary income rose $8.8 billion to $221.5 billion. The increases in both receipts and payments mainly reflected advances in direct investment income.
Secondary income receipts dropped $0.9 billion to $41.6 billion, pulled down by declines in general government transfers, mostly public sector fines and penalties. Payments of secondary income fell $3.5 billion to $72.6 billion as general government transfers decreased.

Residential starts rose 3.9% last month to a 1.62 million annualized rate after an upwardly revised July print, according to government data released Tuesday. The median estimate in a Bloomberg survey called for a 1.55 million pace. 
Building permits, meanwhile, increased 6% in August, the biggest gain since January, reflecting a sizable jump in multi-family units. Permit applications for single-family homes also edged higher.
The data suggest that builders are making some construction headway despite limited availability of land, labor and materials, which has slowed residential starts from a 15-year high in March. Despite the bottlenecks, housing starts remain mostly above pre-pandemic levels, which is expected keep construction activity elevated for some time.
A measure of homebuilder sentiment out Monday rose in September for the first time in five months amid lower lumber prices and strong housing demand.
The number of single-family houses under construction but not yet completed, a measure of backlogs, rose to 702,000, the most since 2007, further underscoring builders’ struggle to keep up with demand.

The Confederation of British Industry's monthly manufacturing order book balance rose to +22 in September from +18 in August, its highest level since records started in 1977.
Still, the picture was weaker for export orders - which grew at their fastest since March 2019 - and the survey's gauge of output growth fell to its lowest level since April.
""Today's survey highlights how amidst a variety of supply challenges, companies are beginning to struggle to meet high demand,"" CBI deputy chief economist Anna Leach said.
""Despite close to half of manufacturers surveyed reporting order books above normal, output growth has slowed sharply, albeit remaining relatively robust.""
The survey's gauge of price expectations cooled to a four-month low, but Leach warned manufacturers still faced rocketing energy prices.

As economies reopen after COVID-19 lockdowns, wholesale natural gas prices in Europe have soared this year, pushed up by high demand for liquefied natural gas in Asia, nuclear maintenance and lower-than-usual supplies from Russia.
The record prices have strained the British energy sector, destroying the business model of smaller energy traders and sending shockwaves through the chemical and fertiliser markets, leading to a shortage of carbon dioxide used in food processing.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japanese land prices fell for the second straight year as the country's closed borders and state of emergency curbs to combat the coronavirus pandemic hit demand for new restaurants and hotels, an annual government survey showed.
In a sign the pandemic is reshaping the economy, however, land prices for industrial areas rose for the fourth straight year on booming demand for warehouses to stock up on electronic appliances and other goods catering to stay-at-home demand.
Overall property prices in the world's third-largest economy fell 0.4% in the year to July after last year's 0.6% decline, which was the first fall in three years, a land ministry survey showed on Tuesday.
Residential land prices, which have been falling for nearly three decades due to Japan's shrinking population, slid 0.5% after a 0.7% decline in the previous year, the survey showed.
The decline stands in contrast to a troubling surge in property prices in many other industrialised nations such as Australia, where home prices rose a record 6.7% in April-June despite low economic growth.
Commercial property prices in Japan fell 0.5%, bigger than a 0.3% drop a year earlier, as the pandemic forced the country to close its borders to foreign tourists and impose curbs on economic activity.
In Osaka, Japan's second-biggest metropolitan area and among its most popular tourist destinations, they fell 0.6% to mark the first decline in nine years, the survey showed.
""We're continuing to see prices fall as profitability plummets, demand shrinks and the outlook darkens due to the pandemic,"" a land ministry official told a briefing.
By contrast, industrial land, which is mostly used by plants and logistic facilities, saw prices rise 0.8% nationwide from a year earlier reflecting robust demand for goods.
Both Rakuten and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), two of the biggest online commerce operators in Japan, announced plans to open several distribution centres earlier this year given a continued boom for delivery services during the pandemic.

Japan's land prices had risen before the pandemic thanks in part to a wall of money pumped out by the central bank as part of former premier Shinzo Abe's ""Abenomics"" stimulus policies, and a hotel construction boom to cater to an influx of foreign tourists.
The ministry surveyed 21,430 locations nationwide.

The National Association of Home Builders/Wells Fargo Housing Market Index rose one point to 76 last month. A reading above 50 indicates that more builders view conditions as good than poor.
Builder sentiment hit an all-time high of 90 last November as the COVID-19 pandemic fueled a housing market boom, with more people forced to work from home. The outlook for builders has since cooled, with many citing chronic labor shortages and spiraling construction costs as supply chain disruptions at saw mills and ports saw rocketing prices for lumber and some other raw materials. Tariffs on steel imports have also added to building costs.
""The September data show stability as some building material cost challenges ease, particularly for softwood lumber,"" NAHB Chairman Chuck Fowke said in a statement. ""However, delivery times remain extended and the chronic construction labor shortage is expected to persist as the overall labor market recovers.""
Lumber is down more than 60% from its May peak but overall aggregate residential construction material costs increased 13% on an annual basis in the first eight months of this year, according to the NAHB. When combined with the recent surge in home price growth, builders see housing affordability as an issue in the months ahead. 

The survey's measure of current sales conditions also increased one point to 82 and its gauge of sales expectations over the next six months remained unchanged at 81. The component measuring traffic of prospective buyers rose 2 points to 61.
""The single-family building market has moved off the unsustainably hot pace of construction of last fall and has reached a still hot but more stable level of activity,"" said Robert Dietz, the NAHB's chief economist.

LONDON (Reuters) - Asking prices for houses in Britain resumed their upward trend this month as buyer demand far outstripped the supply of houses coming to the market, a survey showed on Monday.
Real estate website Rightmove (OTC:RTMVY) said asking prices rose by 0.3% in its September survey to reach a new record high of 338,462 pounds ($466,671), reversing a 0.3% drop in early August.
Overall the survey added to signs that the housing market has retained some of its upward momentum even after the gradual withdrawal of temporary tax breaks on property purchases.
Finance minister Rishi Sunak cut stamp duty, a tax on house purchases, in July 2020. But in July it started to return to its pre-pandemic level and the tax break fully expires this month.
The tax cut aimed to reverse a slump in property sales at the start of the pandemic, and helped fuel a surge in property prices and some new construction. Many households were already seeking more spacious housing suited to working from home, a factor which has led to big price rises in other countries too.
""The high ratio of buyer demand to properties for sale means that the property market remains stock-starved despite the summer lull lessening overall activity,"" said Tim Bannister, Rightmove's director of property data.
The company said the number of prospective buyers per property had more than doubled compared with pre-pandemic levels - chiming with a similar report from the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors.

The August survey covered property first advertised on Rightmove between Aug. 8 and Sept. 11.

LONDON (Reuters) - More British employers are planning pay rises than at any time since the global financial crisis as they struggle to recruit staff following the coronavirus pandemic and Brexit, data from the Confederation of British Industry showed on Monday.
The CBI said 44% of businesses intended to raise pay in line with inflation and 24% planned above-inflation pay rises, the highest combined percentage since it started surveying businesses about this in 2009.
""Pay intentions are rising across the board as firms reopen and the economy recovers,"" Matthew Percival, the CBI's director of skills and inclusion said.
However he warned that businesses were likely to pass on higher wage bills to their customers unless productivity improved, especially as many also needed to repay loans taken out last year during the pandemic.
The prospect of higher prices is likely to concern the Bank of England as its policymakers meet this week. The BoE expects a short-term rise in inflation due to higher oil prices and supply-chain bottlenecks, but so far has said it does not expect lasting inflationary pressure from the job market.
Just over three quarters of the 422 firms polled by the CBI and recruiters Pertemps Network in late August said labour shortages were hurting competitiveness, the highest proportion in over five years.
The CBI renewed its call for the government to ease post-Brexit visa restrictions on European Union workers with in-demand skills.
Separately, manufacturing trade body Make UK said its members were seeing the fastest output growth in more than 30 years and expected output to return to pre-pandemic levels by the end of 2022, sooner than previously forecast.

""Growth prospects continue to accelerate for manufacturers as economies at home and abroad continue to open up. However, supply chain shortages and the rapidly escalating increase in shipping costs are threatening to put roadblocks on the road to faster growth,"" Make UK chief executive Stephen Phipson said.
Make UK also criticised a recent government decision to raise employers' social security contributions.

The University of Michigan said its consumer sentiment indexedged up to 71 in the first half of September from 70.3 in August - the lowest since December 2011. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast a reading of 72.
Assessments of current conditions slipped further, to 77.1 from 78.5 in August, while the survey's forward-looking expectations index ticked up to 67.1 from 65.1, which had been the lowest since 2013.
""The steep August falloff in consumer sentiment ended in early September, but the small gain still meant that consumers expected the least favorable economic prospects in more than a decade,"" the survey's director, Richard Curtin, said in a statement.

Consumers' views of inflation remain elevated, although they appear to have stopped charging higher as they did over the summer when key official gauges of price increases hit their highest levels in years. 
The survey's one-year inflation outlook ticked back up to 4.7% this month to match July's reading, which had been the highest since 2008, from 4.6% in August. The five-year outlook, meanwhile, held steady at 2.9%.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -Foreign holdings of Treasuries rose for a fourth straight month in July, hitting a record high, data from the Treasury Department showed on Thursday.
Major foreign holders of Treasuries held $7.54 trillion, the highest on record, according to Refinitiv Datastream. In June, foreign holdings of Treasuries stood at $7.50 trillion.
""One of the big drivers is just low interest rates across the world. That's certainly driving a lot more investors to U.S. Treasuries despite their low rates,"" said Gennadiy Goldberg, senior U.S. rates strategist, at TD Securities in New York.
Although U.S. Treasury yields are low, they are higher than government bond yields in many other major countries, boosting their attractiveness to foreign investors.
""Looking back, we saw a fairly significant decline in interest rates in July and the data suggest it was driven at least partly by the buying from foreign investors,"" Goldberg said.
U.S. benchmark 10-year Treasury yields started July with a yield of 1.4680%, falling about 24 basis points to 1.2256% by the end of that month.
Overall, net foreign acquisitions of U.S. long-term and short-term securities, including banking flows, showed a net inflow of $126 billion in July, from a revised net inflow of $32 billion in June.
On a transaction basis, foreigners bought $10.20 billion in Treasuries in July, the second straight month of inflows. U.S. Treasury outflows in May were the largest since April 2020.
Japan remained the largest non-U.S. net holder of Treasuries at $1.31 trillion in July, up from $1.28 trillion in June.
""It's certainly a very large month when you put it into a historical context,"" Goldberg said.
China's holdings rose to $1.07 trillion, the first increase in 5 months.
Foreign investors, meanwhile, sold $34.31 billion in U.S. equities in July, the most for any month in at least 4 years, after being net buyers for 10 of the prior 12 months.

LONDON (Reuters) - British businesses have reported a sharp rise in recruitment difficulties within the space of just a few weeks - partly as a result of a continued lack of European Union workers, official figures showed on Thursday.
Some 41% of companies with 10 or more staff reported greater than usual recruitment challenges in the two weeks to Sept. 5, up from 32% in early August, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said https://www.ons.gov.uk/employmentandlabourmarket/peopleinwork/employmentandemployeetypes/articles/hospitalitybusinessesaremostlikelytobestrugglingtofillvacancies/2021-09-16.
Around a quarter of businesses with recruitment difficulties named a reduced number of EU applicants as a factor, rising to almost half in the transport and storage sector, where a lack of truck drivers https://www.reuters.com/world/the-great-reboot/britains-trucker-shortage-jams-post-pandemic-recovery-2021-09-03 has led to widespread delivery bottlenecks.
Labour shortages were most widespread in hospitality, followed by water utilities, healthcare and construction.
Britain introduced new immigration rules on Jan. 1 which require most EU workers not already living in Britain to get work visas, something that can be time-consuming and costly.
The number of EU nationals employed in Britain in the three months to the end of June was 8.7% lower than before the COVID-19 pandemic, compared with a 2.4% fall in the size of the total workforce, the ONS said.
ONS data earlier this week showed Britain had more than an average of just over 1 million job vacancies in the three months to the end of August, a record high.
Recruitment difficulties had also become a theme in company earnings reports in the past quarter, said Sarah Coles, a personal finance analyst at brokers  Hargreaves  Lansdown (LON:HRGV).
""In some cases, this means businesses are struggling to operate effectively, which in turn is putting the brakes on GDP,"" she said.
Employers have called on the government to temporarily ease visa rules to allow them more time to train British staff, but the government has rejected this so far and said part of the solution is for businesses to improve pay and conditions. 

The Bank of England expects higher oil prices and post-pandemic bottlenecks, including labour shortages, to push inflation up to 4% by the end of the year, although it thinks this will fade and sees potential slack in the job market.
Britain's COVID furlough programme ends on Sept. 30. Businesses said that in the two weeks to Sept. 5, 6% of their staff were receiving furlough payments for some or all of their hours, equivalent to about 1.6 million employees.

1335,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 16, 2021 01:40PM ET</span>",U.S. retail sales surprise to upside in strong boost to economy,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. retail sales unexpectedly increased in August, likely boosted by back-to-school shopping and child tax credit payments from the government, which could temper expectations for a sharp slowdown in economic growth in the third quarter.
The surprise rebound in retail sales reported by the Commerce Department on Thursday defied slumping consumer confidence. Sales were driven by a surge in online purchases, which offset a continued decline at auto dealerships. But sales in July were much weaker than initially estimated. 
Economists have been downgrading their gross domestic product estimates for the current quarter, citing plunging motor vehicle sales, which are the result of an acute inventory shortage, and a flare-up of COVID-19 infections fueled by the Delta variant of the coronavirus.
""U.S. consumption is not slowing as quickly as it appeared a month ago despite the fading stimulus, and the Delta variant did not much affect the industries feeding into retail sales,"" said Chris Low, chief economist at FHN Financial in New York. ""The economy continued to hum in August."" 
Retail sales rose 0.7% last month. Data for July was revised down to show retail sales declining 1.8% instead of 1.1% as previously reported. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast retail sales would drop 0.8%. Sales increased 15.1% from a year ago and are 17.7% above their pre-pandemic level. 
They are holding up even as spending is shifting back from goods to services like travel and entertainment. Retail sales are mostly goods, with services such as healthcare, education, travel and hotel accommodation making up the remaining portion of consumer spending.
Online retail sales rebounded 5.3% after tumbling 4.6% in July. Most school districts started their 2021-2022 academic year in August, with in-person learning resuming after last year's shift to online classes because of the pandemic. 
Qualifying households in mid-July started receiving money under the expanded child tax credit program, which will run through December. Sales at clothing stores edged up 0.1% last month. There were strong gains in receipts at building material and furniture stores.
But sales at auto dealerships tumbled 3.6% after declining 4.6% in July. An ongoing global shortage of microchips is forcing has automakers to cut production. 
The semiconductor crunch, which has been worsened by the latest COVID-19 wave, is also causing shortages of some electronic goods. 
There is also congestion at ports in China. Sales at electronics and appliance stores fell 3.1%. There was also a decrease in receipts at sporting goods, hobby, musical instrument and book stores. 
With coronavirus infections surging, the flow of traffic to restaurants and bars ebbed, keeping sales flat. Restaurants and bars are the only services category in the retail sales report.
Excluding automobiles, gasoline, building materials and food services, retail sales rebounded 2.5% last month after a downwardly revised 1.9% decrease in July.
These so-called core retail sales correspond most closely to the consumer spending component of GDP. They were previously estimated to have dropped 1.0% in July.
Stocks on Wall Street were trading lower. The dollar rose against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices fell.
GROWTH ESTIMATES
The National Retail Federation said the rise in sales despite the headwinds reflected the continued strength of the American consumer and the resilience of the nation's retailers.
""We maintain our confidence in the historic strength of consumers and fully expect a record year for retail sales and a strong holiday season for retailers,"" NRF President Matthew Shay said. 
Americans are sitting on at least $2.5 trillion in excess savings accumulated during the pandemic. Wages are rising as companies scramble to fill a record 10.9 million job openings.
A separate report from the Labor Department on Thursday showed initial claims for state jobless benefits rose 20,000 to a seasonally adjusted 332,000 for the week ended Sept. 11.
Claims were likely boosted by Hurricane Ida, which devastated U.S. offshore energy production and knocked out power in Louisiana. Ida also drenched Mississippi and caused historic flooding in New York and New Jersey.
The number of people continuing to receive benefits after an initial week of aid fell 187,000 to 2.665 million in the week ended Sept. 4, the lowest level since mid-March 2020. The expiration of federal government-funded benefits early this month is expected to boost the labor pool.
""There is no evidence here that the surge in COVID cases related to the Delta variant is forcing a retrenchment in the economy,"" said Conrad DeQuadros, senior economic advisor at Brean Capital in New York.
A third report from the Philadelphia Federal Reserve showed its business activity index jumped to a reading of 30.7 in September from 19.4 in August. A reading above zero indicates growth in manufacturing in the region, which covers eastern Pennsylvania, southern New Jersey and Delaware.
Manufacturers reported a moderation in input prices, which fits in with recent data suggesting that inflation had probably peaked. They also increased hours for workers as they struggled to find labor. Though expectations moderated, manufacturers were upbeat about business conditions over the next six months.
Tanking motor vehicle sales and struggles by businesses to replenish stocks have prompted economists to slash their GDP growth estimates for the third quarter. A fourth report from the Commerce Department on Thursday showed inventory accumulation slowed in July.
On Wednesday, economists at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) again trimmed their third-quarter GDP growth forecast to a 5.0% annualized rate from a 7.0% pace. The Federal Reserve's ""Beige Book"" report last week showed ""economic growth downshifted slightly to a moderate pace in early July through August.""

But after the release of the retail sales report on Thursday, economists at  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) raised their third-quarter GDP growth estimate to a 5.0% rate from a 3.3% pace. Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) raised its forecast to a 4.5% pace from a 3.5% rate, having lowered it to a 5.25% pace early this month.
The economy grew at a 6.6% rate in the second quarter.

Business inventories rose 0.5% after increasing 0.9% in June, the Commerce Department said on Thursday. Inventories are a key component of gross domestic product. July's increase was in line with economists' expectations.
Inventories rose 7.2% on a year-on-year basis in July.
Retail inventories gained 0.4% in July as estimated in an advance report published last month. That followed a 0.5% rise in June. Motor vehicle inventories climbed 0.2% instead of 0.3% as estimated last month. 
Retail inventories excluding autos, which go into the calculation of GDP, rose 0.5% as estimated last month.
Business inventories were depleted in the first half of the year, but shortages amid persistent supply bottlenecks because of the COVID-19 pandemic and recent ports congestion in China are frustrating efforts to replenish stocks. 
Still, inventory rebuilding is expected to underpin economic growth in the second half of the year.

Wholesale inventories increased 0.6% in July. Stocks at manufacturers advanced 0.5%.
Business sales gained 0.5% in July after rising 1.6% in June. At July's sales pace, it would take 1.25 months for businesses to clear shelves, unchanged from June.

The value of overall retail purchases climbed 0.7% last month following a downwardly revised 1.8% decrease in July, Commerce Department figures showed Thursday. Excluding autos, sales advanced 1.8% in August, the largest gain in five months.
The median estimate in a Bloomberg survey of economists called for a 0.7% decline in overall retail sales, with forecasts ranging from a 3.3% drop to a 1.1% gain. 
U.S. stock-index futures pared losses and bonds slipped after the report.
The surprising improvement in sales, underpinned in part by back-to-school shopping and payments for millions of families with children, suggests resilient demand for goods. The report showed firmer receipts at non-store retailers, general merchandise stores, furniture outlets and grocery stores.
The delta variant is curbing demand for services such as travel and leisure. The retail sales data showed receipts at restaurants and bars, the only services-spending category in the report, stagnated in August. Grocery store receipts climbed 2.1%.
Still, a surge in Covid-19 infections, rising prices and persistent supply chain challenges prompted a wave of downgrades to third-quarter economic growth forecasts in recent weeks. 
Earlier this month, economists at  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS). downgraded their third-quarter consumption forecast to a 0.5% annualized decline because of delta’s impact on services spending.
Separate data on Thursday from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York showed an index of services business activity in the region slumped 13 points in September to 14.4, indicating softer growth. Another gauge showed a deterioration in the business climate.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's exports extended double-digit gains in August, led by strong shipments of chip manufacturing equipment, although the pace of growth weakened as COVID-19 hit key Asian supply chains and slowed factory production.
The trade growth is unlikely to dispel worries about the outlook for Japan's economy, which has not yet recovered to pre-pandemic levels after taking an enormous hit from a collapse in global trade in the first quarter of 2020.
Exports rose 26.2% in August compared with the same month a year earlier, the Ministry of Finance said on Thursday, marking the sixth straight month of double-digit growth as strong demand for chip-making equipment offset slowing U.S and European Union-bound shipments of cars.
However, the growth was slower than the 34.0% expected by economists in a Reuters poll and the 37.0% advance in the previous month.
""Exports have been driving the economy. The recovery scenario for Japan's economy may become shaky if they won't grow,"" said Takumi Tsunoda, senior economist at Shinkin Central Bank.
Policymakers are under pressure to keep the fragile recovery intact, which has been thrown into doubt due to a resurgence of the pandemic in other parts of Asia, leading manufacturing hubs such as Vietnam and Malaysia to roll out lockdown measures.
""The semiconductor issue had quite a big impact, which weighed on car exports a lot,"" said Takeshi Minami, chief economist at Norinchukin Research Institute.
""I think it's likely to impact exports at least until the year-end as bottlenecks in parts supply in Southeast Asia continue.""
 Toyota  Motor (NYSE:TM) Corp cut https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/toyota-cuts-annual-auto-production-target-shortage-chips-parts-2021-09-10 its annual production target by 300,000 vehicles last week as rising COVID-19 infections slowed output at parts factories in Vietnam and Malaysia.
While vaccination rates are improving and daily COVID-19 infections appear to have peaked, analysts expect Japan to see annualised 1.2% growth https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/japans-q3-growth-forecast-more-than-halved-covid-19-impact-2021-09-14 in the current quarter, much slower than projected last month, a Reuters poll on Tuesday showed.
By destination, shipments to China, Japan's largest trading partner, rose 12.6% year-on-year in August, led by chemicals and semiconductor parts, the data showed.
Exports to the United States, the world's top economy, soared 22.8%, as strong demand for power-generating machines offset a decline in car shipments.
Shipments to Asia as a whole gained 26.1%, their slowest pace in five months, while those to the European Union advanced 29.9% in August.
Imports jumped 44.7% in August compared with the same month a year earlier, versus the median estimate for a 40.0% increase, due to stronger demand for fuel and medical goods.
That brought a trade deficit of 635.4 billion yen ($5.81 billion), the largest shortfall since December 2012 and bigger than the median estimate for a 47.7 billion yen deficit.

The trade data follows the Reuters Tankan poll on Wednesday, which found confidence among Japanese manufacturers fell to a five-month low in September as the latest wave of COVID-19 forced factory halts around Asia.

Eurostat said the euro zone's unadjusted trade surplus with the rest of the world fell to 20.7 billion euros ($24.4 billion)in July from 26.8 billion euros in July 2020. 
However, the surplus for the first seven months of 2021 was comfortably higher, at 122.4 billion euros from 112.8 billion euros in Jan-July 2020.
Adjusted for seasonal swings, the euro zone trade surplus increased to 13.4 billion euros in July from 11.9 billion euros in June, as exports rose 1.0% on the month while imports were only 0.3% higher.
For the European Union as a whole, the non-seasonally adjusted data showed a decline in the trade surplus in both July and in the Jan-July period from a year earlier. The bloc is a major importer of oil and other raw materials and a major exporter of chemicals, machinery and vehicles.
The European Union's trade deficit with China increased, while its surplus with the United States and Britain expanded in the first seven months of 2021.
To Britain, which has left the bloc, exports rose by 6.2% and imports fell by 17.1%, although Eurostat has calculated trade with Britain differently since the start of the year.
Goods that had an origin outside Britain are now treated as imports from that country rather than from Britain.

1345,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 15, 2021 10:27PM ET</span>",Australian employment slides in August as lockdowns slash workers' hours,"By Wayne Cole
SYDNEY (Reuters) -Australian employment dived in August as coronavirus lockdowns in Sydney and Melbourne forced businesses to lay off workers and slash hours, while the jobless rate was nudged lower by a sharp fall in the number of people looking for work.
Thursday's data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) showed employment fell by 146,000 in August, compared to median forecasts of a drop of 90,000. 
The unemployment rate dipped to 4.5%, having already fallen to 4.6% in July when lockdowns also distorted the data.
The ABS cautioned that the dip in the jobless rate was due to people dropping out of the labour force given how difficult it was to look for work while in lockdown. Only people actively looking for work are counted as unemployed.
""The fall in the unemployment rate reflects a large fall in participation during the recent lockdowns, rather than a strengthening in labour market conditions,"" said Bjorn Jarvis, head of labour statistics at the ABS.
""Hours worked data continues to provide the best indicator of the extent of labour market impacts and recovery from lockdowns,"" he added.
Hours worked in August slid 3.7% nationally, and by 6.5% in New South Wales where Sydney was closed for the entire month.
Likewise, the participation rate fell a steep 0.8 percentage points to 65.2%, while underemployment jumped a full point to 9.3% as workers' hours were restricted.
""The September print for labour force will see a further significant step down, as this will include the full impact of Victoria’s lockdown,"" said Sarah Hunter, chief Australia economist for BIS Oxford Economics.
""The degree of dislocation in economic activity means that GDP is likely to fall by around 4% in the September quarter.""

The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) has cautioned that the unemployment rate will likely rise well above 5% once the full impact is felt, though it is also optimistic the economy will recover quickly once lockdowns ease.
A sharp increase in vaccinations has allowed the New South Wales government to flag a loosening of restrictions by mid-October, with Victoria likely to follow.

Employment dropped by 146,300 last month, compared with economists’ forecast of an 80,000 decline, Australian Bureau of Statistics data showed Thursday. The jobless rate edged down to 4.5% as the participation rate slumped to 65.2% from 66%.
“Throughout the pandemic we have seen large falls in participation during lockdowns — a pattern repeated over the past few months,” Bjorn Jarvis, head of labor statistics at the ABS, said in a statement. “Beyond people losing their jobs, we have seen unemployed people drop out of the labor force, given how difficult it is to actively look for work and be available for work during lockdowns.”
The Australian dollar edged down after the release and traded at 73.36 U.S. cents at 11:55 a.m. in Sydney.
Sydney and Melbourne and large swathes of the east coast are under a lockdown that’s impacting about half the nation’s population. As delta overwhelmed their defenses, the leaders of New South Wales and Victoria are stepping up vaccinations to try to live with the virus, while the federal government has boosted aid to households and businesses.
Reserve Bank of Australia Governor Philip Lowe said this week that he expected the main hit to the labor market to be in hours worked, though he added it wouldn’t be surprising to see the jobless rate climb to the “high fives” for a short period.
Among other details in today’s report:
The RBA this month pressed ahead with a tapering of its weekly bond purchases to A$4 billion ($2.9 billion) from A$5 billion, though it put back a planned review of the program by three months to mid-February. The extension, it said, reflected the delay in the recovery caused by the virus outbreak.

WELLINGTON (Reuters) - New Zealand's economy grew at a much faster pace than expected in the second quarter, officials said on Thursday, reinforcing views that the central bank will start raising interest rates despite a recent outbreak of the coronavirus.
Gross domestic product (GDP) surged 2.8% in the three months through June, Statistics New Zealand said, well ahead of a Reuters poll forecast of a 1.3% increase and the Reserve Bank of New Zealand's (RBNZ) estimate of 0.7%.
The growth surge follows a drop in unemployment in the second quarter to an 18-month low of 4.0% and a rise in annual inflation to 3.3%, above the central bank's 1-3% target range.

""We expect the RBNZ to 'look through' near-term volatility and reduce monetary stimulus, with a series of 25 basis point (rate) hikes starting from next month,"" said Mark Smith, Senior Economist at ASB Bank.
The central bank delayed raising rates last month after the country was put into a snap COVID-19 lockdown over an outbreak of the Delta variant of COVID-19 in Auckland, but said a hike was still on the cards.
The market has already priced in a 100% chance of a 25 basis point hike at the next central bank meeting on Oct 6.
Annual GDP jumped 17.4% from a very weak base as the country was in a complete COVID-19 lockdown in the second quarter last year. A Reuters poll had expected a 16.3% rise.
Second-quarter growth was driven by the tourism sector, after the country opened a trans-Tasman travel bubble with Australia.
New Zealand has rebounded strongly from a recession last year, largely due to its success in eliminating the coronavirus within its borders and reopening its domestic economy well before other advanced nations.
The country had been virus-free for months until an outbreak of the highly infectious Delta strain in August. The biggest city Auckland remains in lockdown, but the rest of the country has opened up again. The travel bubble with Australia, however, has been suspended.
Economists expect growth to contract in the third quarter due to the Delta-driven lockdown, but forecast a rapid recovery as vaccinations increase and the outbreak is contained.

""Given that the economy was running hot going into the lockdown in August, the prospect of another V-shaped rebound becomes more likely,"" said Michael Gordon, Acting Chief Economist at Westpac Bank.
The country recorded 13 new cases of COVID-19 on Thursday, taking the total number of cases in the latest outbreak to 979.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Production at U.S. factories slowed more than expected in August amid disruptions from Hurricane Ida and lingering shortages of raw materials and labor as the COVID-19 pandemic drags on.
An improvement is likely with other data on Wednesday showing a sharp acceleration in a measure of factory activity in New York state this month against the backdrop of strong order growth and shipments of goods. Demand is being fueled by businesses desperate to replenish stocks after inventories were drawn down sharply in the first half of the year.
""Growth in manufacturing going forward is likely to be supported by low inventories,"" said Rubeela Farooqi, chief U.S. economist at High Frequency Economics in White Plains, New York. ""But supply issues and shortages remain a constraint for now that are preventing a stronger rebound.""
Manufacturing output increased 0.2% last month, the Federal Reserve said on Wednesday. Data for July was revised to show production surging 1.6% instead of 1.4% as previously reported.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast manufacturing production would gain 0.4%. 
The Fed estimated that Hurricane Ida, which devastated U.S. offshore energy production and knocked off power in Louisiana at the end of August, subtracted 0.2 percentage point from manufacturing output. The hurricane led to plant closures for petrochemicals, plastic resins and petroleum refining 
Factory production is 1.0% above its pre-pandemic level. 
Output at auto plants edged up 0.1%. The raw materials crunch, most evident in the automobile sector, has been worsened by the latest wave of infections driven by the Delta variant of the coronavirus, primarily in Southeast Asia, as well as by congestion at ports in China. 
General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) said it would cut production at its plants in Indiana, Missouri and Tennessee this month because of an ongoing microchip shortage. Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co is also reducing truck production.
Excluding autos, manufacturing output rose 0.2% in August.
Stocks on Wall Street were trading higher. The dollar slipped against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices were mixed.

IMPORT PRICES FALL
In a separate report on Wednesday, the New York Fed said its ""Empire State"" index on current business conditions surged to a reading of 34.3 this month from 18.3 in August. A reading above zero suggests an expansion in regional business activity.
But supply side challenges remained, with the delivery times measure hitting a record high. Firms in the region were very optimistic that business conditions would improve over the next six months, with capital and technology spending plans increasing markedly. 
""Upbeat goods demand, rising business investment, and rebounding demand from abroad are slated to keep activity growing at a healthy clip into 2022,"" said Oren Klachkin, lead U.S. economist at Oxford Economics in New York. 
""However steadfast supply chain and hiring challenges will concurrently limit the expansion, and these headwinds won’t diminish significantly until the COVID crisis is effectively contained at home and abroad."" 
Graphic: Empire State: https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-STOCKS/klpykgzgapg/empirestate.png 
August's gain in manufacturing output and a 3.3% rebound in utilities raised industrial production by 0.4%. Industrial output increased 0.8% in July. Mining production fell 0.6%, reflecting hurricane-induced disruptions to oil and gas extraction in the Gulf of Mexico. 
Capacity utilization for the manufacturing sector, a measure of how fully firms are using their resources, edged up 0.1 percentage point to 76.7% in August. Overall capacity use for the industrial sector rose 0.2 percentage point to 76.4%. It is 3.2 percentage points below its 1972-2020 average.
Officials at the U.S. central bank tend to look at capacity use measures for signals of how much ""slack"" remains in the economy — how far growth has room to run before it becomes inflationary.
Inflation appears to have peaked. A third report from the Labor Department showed import prices dropped 0.3% last month after increasing 0.4% in July. The first decrease since October 2020 lowered the year-on-year increase to 9.0% from 10.3% in July. 
The report followed on the heels of news on Tuesday that consumer prices recorded their smallest gain in seven months in August. Fed Chair Jerome Powell has steadfastly maintained that high inflation is transitory. 
Graphic: Inflation: https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-STOCKS/egpbkymydvq/inflation.png 
The run-up in prices centered on used cars and trucks, as well as services in industries worst affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, is slowing. But strained supply chains will likely keep inflation elevated for a while. 
Imported fuel prices tumbled 2.3% last month after increasing 3.0% in July. Petroleum prices dropped 2.4%, while the cost of imported food rose 0.6%. 

Excluding fuel and food, import prices fell 0.2%. These so-called core import prices gained 0.1% in July. There were small gains in the prices of imported capital goods and consumer goods, excluding automobiles. 
""Inflation took a little breather in August, but the race or marathon isn't over yet,"" said Jennifer Lee, a senior economist at BMO Capital Markets in Toronto.

The consumer price index rose 4.1% in August from a year earlier, Statistics Canada reported Wednesday in Ottawa, marking the fifth straight month of inflation readings above the Bank of Canada’s 3% cap. That’s the highest since March 2003, when it touched 4.2%. Economists were predicting a yearly gain of 3.9%.
While policy makers are likely to view price pressures as transitory, the report comes at an inopportune time for Trudeau in the final days of a tight election battle. Affordability is a key campaign issue and the main opposition Conservatives have  been accusing the incumbent Liberal government of stoking inflation with debt-financed spending plans.
Still, Bank of Canada Governor Tiff Macklem, whose latest forecasts show inflation creeping up to 3.9% in the third quarter, has warned against overreacting to the  “temporary” spike that is being driven by global supply chain disruptions and pent-up demand for services as the economy reopens. There’s also a weak comparison to last year when price pressures were subdued during the pandemic.
The increase last month was driven by a sharp increase in the cost of airplane tickets and other traveling-related expenses. From a year ago, gasoline prices and housing costs remain key drivers. Gasoline prices rose 32.5% from year ago.
On a monthly basis, prices rose 0.2% versus economist estimates for a 0.1% gain. 
The average of core measures of inflation, often seen as a better gauge of underlying price pressures, rose to an annual 2.57% pace in August, the highest since 2009.

BEIJING (Reuters) -China's factory and retail sectors faltered in August with output and sales growth hitting one-year lows as fresh coronavirus outbreaks and supply disruptions threatened the country's impressive economic recovery.
Industrial production rose 5.3% in August from a year earlier, narrowing from an increase of 6.4% in July and marking the weakest pace since July 2020, data from the National Bureau of Statistics showed on Wednesday. Output growth missed the 5.8% increase tipped by analysts.
Consumer spending also took a big hit from rising local COVID-19 cases and floods with sales rising only 2.5% in August from a year ago, much lower than the forecast 7.0% rise and the slowest clip since August last year.
""Economic growth slowed in August as consumption was hit by the lingering impact of earlier COVID outbreaks and investment remained weak,"" said Louis Kuijs, Head of Asia Economics at Oxford Economics. ""Meanwhile, a new outbreak which started a few days ago in Fujian is posing downside risk to our forecast of a pick-up in growth in Q4 after a weak Q3.""
The world's second-largest economy has made a remarkably strong revival from last year's coronavirus-led slump, but momentum has slowed over the past few months due to supply chain bottlenecks, semiconductor shortages, curbs on high-polluting industries and a crackdown on property investment.
Looking ahead, analysts at Nomura expect the weakness to broadly extend into September given the new wave of Delta cases in Fujian province and worsening conditions in the property market as authorities get tough on the sector.
In the industrial sector, production curbs hit output of aluminium and steel, while a drastic cut in fuel export quotas hurt China's crude oil throughput.[L1N2QH048]
Social restrictions due to the COVID-19 Delta variant in several provinces have hit the catering, transportation, accommodation and entertainment industries.
China's services activity slumped into contraction in August, a private-sector survey showed, as restrictions to curb COVID-19 once again closed shopping malls and many businesses in parts of the country.
KFC operator Yum China Holdings (NYSE:YUMC) Inc said on Tuesday its adjusted operating profit would take a 50% to 60% hit in the third quarter as the spread of the Delta variant in China closed restaurant and ""sharply reduced sales"".
""As growth is approaching the lower end of the officially-estimated potential growth range of 5.0-5.7%, Beijing may step up targeted easing to generate a moderate pick-up in growth in our view,"" said Jingyang Chen, Greater China economist at HSBC. 
""We expect the government to further speed up special bond issuance and the central bank to roll out more targeted easing measures, including targeted RRR cuts, to support SMEs.""
Analysts also expect China to quicken spending on infrastructure projects later this year. 
FOCUS SHIFTS TO PROPERTY
The weak data comes amid growing worries problems in China's property sector could have a wider impact on the broader economy.
Particular focus is on Evergrande Group, one of China's top property developers, which has struggled to pay lenders and suppliers as its housing sales plunge.
Separate data on Wednesday showed China's property investment rose 0.3% in August, the slowest pace in 18 months, while growth in new home prices eased an eight-month low.
Authorities in China have stepped up efforts to rein in a red-hot property market, which rebounded sharply from last year's COVID-19 shock.

For now, analysts expect policymakers to prioritise stability and maintain their property curbs and restrictions on carbon emissions, even if it means a deeper hit to the economy.
""We think Beijing is willing to shoulder some short-term pain in order to seek long-term gains,"" Nomura said.

JAKARTA (Reuters) -Indonesia's exports hit a record high of $21.42 billion in August, boosted by surging commodity shipments, helping Southeast Asia's biggest economy post its largest ever monthly trade surplus, official data showed.
Robust exports helped Indonesia pull out of recession in the second quarter, but analysts say its recovery may be slowed by COVID-19 infections and supply chain disruptions.
The resource-rich country's August shipments rose 64.1% from a year earlier, according to data released by the statistics bureau on Wednesday, handily beating analysts' forecast in a Reuters poll for a 36.90% rise. 
Sales of palm oil, coal and natural gas, its top commodities, surged more than 100%. Shipments of copper, tin and steel also jumped.
The August export value surpassed Indonesia's last record high of $18.65 billion in August 2011, during the previous global commodity boom.
Commodity prices have been rising as more economies reopen from last year's COVID-19 lockdowns. 
Coal and palm oil prices have reached record highs as demand outstripped supply, while tin prices also surged due to a supply crunch.
Riding on the trend, Indonesia has posted a trade surplus every month since May 2020.
August's surplus was $4.74 billion, compared with a $2.36 billion surplus expected in the poll. July's surplus was $2.59 billion.
The G20 economy also booked a 55.26% annual rise in imports in August to $16.68 billion, beating the poll's 45.10% growth prediction. 
Indonesia's COVID-19 restrictions were eased last month after infection numbers gradually fell.
Wisnu Wardana, an economist with Jakarta-based Bank Danamon, said it may not take long before Indonesia's trade numbers normalise and commodity prices fall, adding that authorities should use this as an opportunity to build local industries.
""Judging from the global financial crisis, when the global real sector recovers and we come closer to quantitative tightening, commodity (prices) will adjust,"" he said, referring to some central banks' plans to scale back emergency stimulus.

Maybank Indonesia economist Myrdal Gunarto said resource prices will remain high as long as demand from China remains strong. But he said as Indonesia eases anti-virus mobility curbs further, domestic demand for imports also will rise, narrowing the trade surplus.
The large trade surplus could add to onshore supply of U.S. dollars, helping Bank Indonesia maintain monetary policy accommodative without hurting the rupiah. The central bank is scheduled to review monetary policy next week.

Supply chain bottlenecks, semiconductor shortages, curbs on high-polluting industries and the crackdown on the property sector also contributed to declining growth.

Retail sales growth slowed sharply to 2.5% from a year ago, lower than the 7% estimate in a Bloomberg survey of economists. Industrial output rose 5.3%, versus the median estimate of 5.8%. Fixed-asset investment in the first eight months of the year was largely in line with projections, rising 8.9%. The unemployment rate was unchanged at 5.1%.
Even before the delta variant outbreak from late July, consumers had been cautious to spend, failing to make a comeback to pre-pandemic levels. More recently, regulatory crackdowns in property and education services have weighed on consumer sentiment. 
The virus control measures caused a slump in retail sales and spending on services last month as many people stopped going out to restaurants and shops and canceled holidays. The services sector contracted in August for the first time since early 2020, recent purchasing managers’ surveys showed.
While China quickly brought the late-July outbreak under control, a new virus cluster has developed in southern China this month, suggesting consumers will remain cautious for longer.

The Westpac-Melbourne Institute index of consumer sentiment released on Wednesday rose 2.0% in September, recouping some of August's 4.4% drop.
Sentiment rebounded by 5.3% in New South Wales after the state government flagged a loosening of restrictions as early as mid-October, at least for those fully vaccinated.
The national index was up 13.2% on September last year with the mood never getting as bleak as during the first round of the pandemic. The index reading of 106.2 showed optimists outnumbered pessimists by some margin.
""The resilience of consumer sentiment in a period when Australia's two major cities have been locked down and the economy has been contracting is truly remarkable,"" said Westpac chief economist Bill Evans.
""The improving vaccine situation appears to be a key factor behind these results.""
Evans noted confidence amongst the 57% of respondents that have had at least one dose was running at 103.7, while confidence amongst the 27% that were unvaccinated but willing to get the jab was up at 121.6.
That left 16% of respondents who were either unwilling to be 
vaccinated or undecided.
The optimism showed in the survey's measures of the outlook for the economy over the next 12 months which rose 4.6%, while that for the next five years gained 4.8%.
The measure of family finances compared with a year ago added 1.7% and that for finances over the next 12 months 2.1%.

The only decline was a 2.7% fall in the measure of whether it was a good time to buy a major household, though that could be partly because so many shops are shut right now.
The time to buy a dwelling measure rebounded by 8.8%, recovering all of August's drop. Expectations for house prices rose by another 1.4% to an eight-year peak, with NSW particularly strong.

The South American country is grappling with stubborn inflation that clocked in at an annual rate of 51.4% in the month, even as prices cooled on a month-to-month basis amid price control measures and caps on exports of beef.
The monthly increase compared favorably with the projections of 18 analysts polled by Reuters who had forecast an average rise of 2.8%, ranging from a minimum estimate of 2.5% to a maximum of 3.2%.
Consumer prices rose 32.3% in the first eight months of the year.

However, Isaías Marini, an economist at consultancy Econviews, said: ""Unlike what the government is saying, we expect inflation to overheat as we approach the end of the year to end at 49%.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Underlying U.S. consumer prices increased at their slowest pace in six months in August as used motor vehicle prices tumbled, suggesting that inflation had probably peaked, though it could remain high for a while amid persistent supply constraints.
The broad slowdown in price pressures reported by the Labor Department on Tuesday aligns with Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's long-held belief that high inflation is transitory. Still, economists cautioned it was too early to celebrate and expected the U.S. central bank to lay out plans in November to start scaling back its massive monthly bond-buying program.
""Inflation remains troublingly strong, even if it is not exploding like it did earlier in the year,"" said James McCann, deputy chief economist at Aberdeen Standard Investments in Boston. ""If we continue to see further step-downs in inflation over the next six months, that should ease the pressure on the Fed to quickly follow tapering with interest rate rises.""
The consumer price index excluding the volatile food and energy components edged up 0.1% last month. That was the smallest gain since February and followed a 0.3% rise in July.
The so-called core CPI was held back by a 1.5% decline in prices for used cars and trucks, which ended five straight monthly increases. Robust rises in prices of used cars and trucks, as well as services in industries worst affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, were the key drivers behind a heating up of inflation at the start of the year.
Airline fares plunged 9.1% in August, likely as a resurgence in infections, driven by the Delta variant of the coronavirus, sapped demand for air travel. There were also decreases in motor vehicle rentals and insurance.
In the 12 months through August, the core CPI increased 4.0% after advancing 4.3% in the 12 months through July. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the core CPI would gain 0.3% for the month and increase 4.2% year-on-year.

SUPPLY CONSTRAINTS REMAIN
In addition to the price surge for used cars and trucks appearing to have run its course, hotel and motel accommodation prices are now above the pre-pandemic level, suggesting moderate gains ahead. Prices for hotels and motels accommodation fell 3.3% after shooting up 6.8% in July. Some of the price plunge was probably because of the soaring coronavirus infections.
But bottlenecks in the supply chain remain and the labor market is tightening, pushing up wages. There were a record 10.9 million job openings as of the end of July, forcing companies to boost wages as they compete for workers. 
Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) on Tuesday hiked its average starting wage to $18 per hour. 
A shortage of homes is driving record house price gains and rents are going up as COVID-19 vaccinations allow companies to recall workers to offices, pulling Americans back to cities following a pandemic-fueled exodus to lower-density areas. These factors could contribute to keeping annual inflation higher.
Owners' equivalent rent of primary residence, which is what a homeowner would receive from renting a home, increased 0.3% in August, rising by the same margin for the fourth straight month.
""The biggest upside risk to inflation in the next six months is from the potential pass-through of higher house prices to the CPI shelter component,"" said Bill Adams, a senior economist at PNC Financial (NYSE:PNC) in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.
Prices for furniture and bedding rebounded 2.3%, while appliances accelerated 1.5%, underscoring the supply chain constraints. New motor vehicle prices rose 1.2%, marking the fourth straight month of gains above 1%. A global semiconductor shortage, worsened by the spread of the Delta variant in East Asia has forced auto manufacturers to cut production.
Consumers also paid more for apparel. The cost of healthcare rose at a tame 0.2% as a strong gain in prices for hospital services was offset by a decline in prescription medication. The cost of doctor visits was unchanged.
The government reported last week that producer prices increased solidly in August, with the PPI posting its largest annual gain in nearly 11 years.
Some economists expect officials at the Fed will upgrade their inflation estimates when the U.S. central bank publishes its summary of economic projections at end of the Sept. 21-22 policy meeting. The Fed's preferred inflation measure for its flexible 2% target, the core personal consumption expenditures price index, increased 3.6% in the 12 months through July, matching the gain in June. August's data will published later this month.
The overall CPI rose 0.3% in August, the smallest increase since January, after gaining 0.5% in July. The food index increased 0.4%, slowing down after two straight months of hefty gains, as the cost of dairy products declined. 
Prices for food away from home also moderated. Gasoline prices rose 2.8% after increasing 2.4% in July.
In the 12 months through August, the CPI increased 5.3% after soaring 5.4% on a year-on-year basis in July.

""Even with a slowdown in monthly CPI gains, big year-over-year increases will persist until well into 2022,"" said Chris Low, chief economist at FHN Financial in New York. 
""The slowdown in sectors sensitive to the reopening is another piece of evidence for the transitory story of inflation, but steady increases elsewhere show that inflation should stick around even after those sectors adjust.""

1363,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 14, 2021 10:44AM ET</span>",Sudanese exports increase to $2.53 billion in first half of 2021,"KHARTOUM (Reuters) - Sudan exported goods worth $2.53 billion in the first half of the year, up 68% from the same period last year, the central bank said on Monday, describing the amount as ""insufficient"" compared to an import bill of $4.16 billion.
Sudan is in the midst of a deep economic crisis and the government is pushing for increased exports, particularly from agriculture, to pull the country out, along with foreign aid and investment. 
The largest export was gold, of which Sudan exported 16.7 tonnes, worth about $1 billion, the central bank data showed, almost all of it to the United Arab Emirates. 
Most of the gold produced in Sudan is smuggled, a practice the government has said it is tackling, and the data showed an increase in exports of about 250%.
Other major exports were peanuts, sesame and livestock.
Sudan has run a wide trade deficit ranging between $4 billion to more than $6 billion since the secession of oil-producing South Sudan in 2011.
The lack of foreign reserves has lead to shortages of crucial medicines and lines for fuel and bread, as well as power outages in recent years.
In the first half of the year, Sudan was able to import wheat worth $239 million, petroleum products worth $215 million, and medicines worth $236 million.

LARRY ADAM, CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER AT RAYMOND JAMES, BALTIMORE 
    ""It’s a fairly positive report in the sense that the Fed's wish that inflation is transitory is coming true. If you look at a lot of the areas that were leading the surge in inflation, now they are all starting to come back down to earth. If you look at some of the components - used cars and trucks (prices), car and truck rentals, airline fares, lodging were all down.""
    ""It continues to give the Fed maximum flexibility. Our base case expectation is that they are going to discuss (tapering) at the meeting next week but they won't have an official announcement till the November meeting.""
GENNADIY GOLDBERG, INTEREST RATE STRATEGIST, TD SECURITIES, NEW YORK
“There was a little bit of softening in some of the covid impacted components, as expected. Airfares were down quite precipitously…hotel rates were down as well… so quite a bit of moderation here. The big question of course is in some of the core components, including OER, that’s the big one. Certainly, you had some cooling in used vehicle prices as well, so a lot of what’s been driving CPI higher in recent months, vehicles, a rebound in airfares and hotels, all of them moderated.”
“The big question is some of these core components like shelter. You had fairly tame OER, so that’s actually cooled a little bit on the last few months, but rent has gone up. So rents are reflective potentially of people moving back to the cities, trying to get apartments or housing once again, that could be driving up costs as well. But on net, if you look at shelter prices, they have been going up pretty dramatically, driven by strong OER and strong hotel price increases and now that’s cooled quite significantly as well. So, a bit of a mixed bag I would say, but overall its suggesting moderation in prices, which certainly is going to weigh on yields.”
“It’s unclear whether one inflation number will really move the needle for the Fed. I think, from a broader perspective, the prices part of their requirements for tapering have been met, in terms of inflation. I think the threshold has already been met for tapering, so I don’t think it necessarily changes the outlook very much. The big question I think for the Fed is going to be whether this further moderation pushes inflation lower in the next few months, and whether inflation significantly cools. And that could be interesting for the rate hike component of all of this, which they have been very careful to divorce from tapering. I don‘t think this materially changes the picture for the Fed in terms of tapering, they are focused really on the unemployment side of the picture and most of them would agree that even with this number the prices part, the substantial further progress on inflation, has already been met.” 
ROBERT PAVLIK, SENIOR PORTFOLIO MANAGER, DAKOTA WEALTH, FAIRFIELD, CONNECTICUT
    “Better than expected (data) and that's fuelling the rise in the Dow futures. The CPI was only up three tenths of percent versus four tenths estimate and below the last month, that's giving a little bit of encouragement for the overall market.”
“And so while market participants are cautious on inflation, at least this was a good sign and when you partnered up with a PPI, it's moving in the right direction.”
“It doesn't force the Fed's hand, so there's a possibility that the Fed could drag its feet and when they do announce tapering, it may be smaller than what the Street may be looking for that time.”
“Right now I'm not thinking that they do any tapering in September, but I'm not sure where their heads are all at. If it's up to Powell, he'll wait till November. But other Fed members seem to be on different pages. “
THOMAS HAYES, MANAGING MEMBER, GREAT HILL CAPITAL LLC, NEW YORK.  
    ""We didn't get a really high number on CPI. The fact that they came in just below expectations gives the Fed the chance to punt any taper implementation announcement from September to November."" 
    ""The inflation numbers confirmed that the Fed can push it off a little bit more cause there were worries if inflation numbers came in really hot then the Fed's hand might be forced to move sooner rather than later, in spite of recent employment numbers being weak.""
KATHY BOSTJANCIC, CHIEF US FINANCIAL ECONOMIST, OXFORD ECONOMICS, NEW YORK
    ""Overall, we're getting further moderation in the monthly advance in consumer prices, especially at the core level. The core level was little bit softer than we thought, so that's good news. But the year-on-year rate is only easing slightly. Ongoing supply chain bottlenecks amid strong demand are going to keep the pace of inflation elevated and sticky in the coming months.""
    ""If these inflation readings continue to moderate, then it will be transitory. It's just that transitory could be longer than maybe previously expected.""

ART HOGAN, CHIEF MARKET STRATEGIST, NATIONAL SECURITIES, NEW YORK
    ""The CPI has been running less hot than PPI and that's been true for the last five months. When you look at the month over month number, which is the most important number, there is sequential improvement, which is a very good sign. We're clearly seeing inflation heading in the right direction. These numbers are still elevated for historic norms but the sequential trend is still improving and that's a good sign.""

1365,By Bloomberg,"<span>Sep 14, 2021 08:36AM ET</span>",Consumer Prices in U.S. Increase by Less Than Forecast,"(Bloomberg) -- Prices paid by U.S. consumers rose in August by less than forecast, suggesting that some of the upward pressure on inflation is beginning to wane.
The consumer price index increased 0.3% from July, according to Labor Department data released Tuesday. Compared with a year ago, the CPI rose 5.3%. Excluding the volatile food and energy components, so-called core inflation climbed 0.1% from the prior month and 4% from August 2020.
Follow the reaction in real-time here on Bloomberg’s TOPLive blog
Economists in a Bloomberg survey called for a 0.4% increase in the overall CPI from the prior month and a 5.3% gain from a year earlier, based on the median estimates.
Faced with mounting cost pressures as a result of materials shortages, transportation bottlenecks and hiring difficulties, businesses have been boosting prices for consumer goods and services. While price spikes associated with the economy’s reopening are beginning to abate, tenuous supply chains could linger well into 2022 and keep inflation elevated.
A Federal Reserve Bank of New York survey showed Monday that consumers expect inflation at 4% over the next three years, the highest in data back to mid-2013.
The CPI data precede next week’s Federal Open Market Committee meeting, where Fed officials will debate how and when to begin tapering asset purchases. Fed Chair Jerome Powell said last month that the central bank could begin reducing its monthly bond purchases this year, but didn’t give a specific time line.  
Parts shortages that have driven up input costs are restraining production. In the last week,  Toyota  Motor (NYSE:TM) Corp. and 3M Co. both downgraded their outlooks for car output due to semiconductor shortages, while Nestle said it is introducing even bigger price hikes as commodity and transportation costs surge. 
Meantime, Hurricane Ida halted operations at refineries and petrochemical plants in the south, adding to pandemic-related supply chain bottlenecks and likely price pressures as well.

The bank said the rise in gross domestic product was due to economic recovery in the European Union, the Balkan country's main trade partner.
""All monthly data, especially retail trade, industrial output and export indicate that a historically high increase of local economy in the second quarter has been recorded,"" the bank said in a statement, adding that it might revise up its earlier projection of a 3.4% rise of GDP for 2021.
The bank forecast inflation in 2021 at 1.2%, up from an earlier forecast 0.6%. It explained that the rise was primarily due to a low baseline effect in 2020 when oil prices were at a record low, and the rise in prices of raw materials, transportation and demand.

Norges Bank is widely expected to raise interest rates at a monetary policy meeting next week, from a record low 0%, and has said https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/breaking-ranks-norway-signals-4-rate-hikes-by-mid-2022-2021-06-17 it may hike three times more by mid-2022 if the economy develops as expected.
""Contacts report higher output growth in all sectors over the past three months. The rise has been most pronounced in manufacturing and household services,"" Norges Bank said in a statement accompanying the quarterly sentiment index.
""Close to half of the contacts are facing capacity constraints.""
The Norwegian economy has accelerated thanks to a gradual lifting of COVID-19 restrictions, and policy-makers and analysts expect above-trend growth for several more years.
Norway's crown currency traded largely unchanged on the news at 10.17 against the euro at 0828 GMT.
The sentiment index, most of which was collected from Aug. 2-20, showed employment had risen during the preceding three months and will likely continue to do so.
""At the same time, more contacts than for some time report difficulties in recruiting qualified labour. The supply of raw materials is also cited as a key capacity constraint,"" Norges Bank said.
""Higher raw materials prices are driving an accelerating rise in prices in all sectors,"" it added.
The survey's estimate for annual wage growth in 2021 was revised up to 2.9% up from 2.7% seen in May.
The data provided backing for the central bank's plan to hike rates, Handelsbanken said.

""Norges Bank will hike in both September and December, and at least twice more next year,"" Handelsbanken's economists said in a tweet.
As of Monday, 74% of Norwegians had received at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine, while 64% were fully immunised, according to the country's Institute of Public Health.

1368,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 14, 2021 04:46AM ET</span>",UK employee numbers surge above pre-pandemic level,"By David Milliken and Andy Bruce
LONDON (Reuters) -British employers added a record 241,000 staff last month, lifting the total number of employees on company payrolls to just above the level before Britain first went into a COVID-19 lockdown last year, official data showed on Tuesday.
The robust jobs data https://www.ons.gov.uk/employmentandlabourmarket/peopleinwork/employmentandemployeetypes/bulletins/uklabourmarket/september2021 comes as Britain's government prepares to end its furlough programme on Sept. 30, which helped around a third of employees at its peak, and last month was still supporting around 700,000 workers full time.
Tuesday's figures mark an upturn from July's weak economic data, when Britain's recovery slowed to a crawl as hundreds of thousands of workers had to stay home after being notified of contact with people who had tested positive for COVID-19.
British government bond yields rose after the data - with the two-year benchmark touching its highest since the start of the pandemic - as the figures revived questions about when the Bank of England might start to raise interest rates.
Businesses reported more than 1 million vacancies in the three months to August - an all-time high, and the unemployment rate fell slightly to 4.6% in the three months to July, the Office for National Statistics said, in line with economists' expectations in a Reuters poll.
""The latest data brought more signs that labour market slack is declining fast and that labour shortages are contributing to faster underlying pay growth,"" said Ruth Gregory, economist at Capital Economics.
During the three months to July, the number of people in employment, which includes the self-employed as well as employees, rose by 183,000 to 32.4 million, broadly in line with forecasts.
""Today's statistics show that our plan for jobs is working,"" finance minister Rishi Sunak said. 
The number of people in work on this broader measure was still well below the record 33.1 million just before the pandemic. Fewer people are self-employed and more report being unemployed or ""inactive"" - a category which includes many students, home-makers and those no longer looking for work.
RECORD VACANCIES
Businesses reported 1.034 million vacancies in the three months to August, the highest since these records began in 2001.
Vacancies were especially high in sectors such as accommodation and food services, which laid off many workers last year but have seen a boom in demand as COVID-19 restrictions eased in recent months.
A lack of some key workers such as truck drivers and food processing workers has caused temporary gaps in some supermarket shelves and on restaurant menus.
""Ongoing supply and labour shortages are impeding further growth,"" said Matthew Percival, director of people and skills at the Confederation of British Industry.
The CBI and other business groups have been calling on the government to temporarily relax new post-Brexit immigration rules while they train new workers.
Businesses have reported pay pressure rising sharply. Tuesday's official data showed average weekly earnings in the three months to July were 8.3% higher than the year before, just below the all-time high of 8.8% for the three months to July.
The ONS said these hefty increases should not be taken at face value as low-paid jobs were more likely to have been cut over the past year, and fewer people were now on reduced furlough pay.
Pay excluding bonuses rose by 6.8% year on year in the three months to July, and the ONS said the true underlying rate was probably somewhere between 3.6% and 5.1% -- still high by pre-pandemic standards.
Britain's job market offers a challenge for the BoE as it tries to judge how persistent inflation pressures and supply-chain bottlenecks are likely to be.
Last month, half BoE's policymakers judged that some basic conditions for a rate rise had already been met, but others stressed there was still significant slack in the job market.
Gregory from Capital Economics said she expected labour shortages would be temporary.

""The danger is that they persist for longer than we expect, causing inflation to stay high and the Bank of England to pull the interest rate trigger next year,"" she added.
Financial markets price in a first rate rise to 0.25% from 0.1% by May, while economists polled by Reuters on average see one by late 2022.

India has attracted foreign direct investment at record levels even during the COVID-19 pandemic with total FDI inflows amounting to $81.72 billion in 2020/21, 10% higher than the previous financial year.
The survey conducted at the peak of the second wave of the pandemic showed 44% of the respondents across the United States, UK, Japan, and Singapore said they were planning additional or first-time investments in India. 
Amongst new investors, nearly two-thirds are planning investments in India within the next two years, it showed.
Utilities, particularly energy infrastructure, got 57% votes in terms of sectors that will see new investments while financial services at 49% and healthcare at 48% were other highly ranked sectors.
Deloitte said FDI is widely regarded as a foundation for accelerating a country's economic growth.
""While foreign investment inflows into India have been consistently rising over the past five years, they have not contributed proportionately to the country's capital formation and GDP,"" the report said.
India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi in 2019 had said his country aimed to be a $5 trillion economy by 2024. India's GDP is currently less than $3 trillion.
Several economists have said the pandemic has put at risk the country's $5 trillion economy goal by 2024 and that it will take at least an additional two years to achieve that target. 
Deloitte in an analysis accompanying the report said India will need $8 trillion of gross capital formation or new greenfield assets to become a $5 trillion economy by 2026/27.
""Based on past trends, India will need at least $400 billion, cumulatively, over six years, in FDI,"" it added.
While India is perceived as both politically and economically stable, it scored lower on institutional stability i.e., regulatory clarity and efficient judicial redress and mechanisms, the survey showed.

Inadequate infrastructure was another negative factor cited by existing and potential investors.
""After the challenges of the past 18 months, the Deloitte survey is a positive validation of the underlying strengths of the Indian economy, in particular its appeal for foreign investors,"" said Punit Renjen, Deloitte Global CEO.

It said that for much of 2021 shoppers were shielded from price increases, with more products being sold on promotion compared to 2020.
However, in the past month only 27.5% of spending was done on deals.
""Other than the early days of lockdown last year, that is the lowest level recorded in the 15 years which we have tracked this data, with retailers aiming to offer everyday low prices instead,"" said Fraser McKevitt, head of retail and consumer insight at Kantar.
It said fastest-rising prices are in markets such as savoury snacks, cat food and ambient cakes and pastries, while falling in fresh bacon, vegetables and ambient cooking sauces.
Last week Morrisons, Britain's fourth-largest supermarket group, warned industry-wide price rises were coming. 
It said inflation would be driven by recent sustained commodity price increases and freight costs, and the current shortage of heavy goods vehicle drivers.
Kantar said total year-on-year grocery sales fell by 1.9% in the 12 weeks to Sept. 5. But sales remain higher than they were before the pandemic, up by 8.7% compared with this period in 2019.
Sales at market leader Tesco (OTC:TSCDY) were up 0.2% over the 12-week period year-on-year.

It was the only grocer among Britain's big four players - Tesco, Sainsbury's, Asda and Morrisons - to see a sales increase, pushing its market share up 0.5 percentage point to 27.3%.
Kantar said the market share of online grocery sales fell to 12.2% in the four weeks to Sept. 5 from 13% four weeks ago – the lowest level since May 2020 as consumers continue to move their spending back in-store.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - A measure of Australian business conditions showed a welcome improvement in August as sales and profits weather coronavirus lockdowns in parts of the country, offering hope of a speedy recovery once restrictions ease.
Tuesday's survey from National Australia Bank (OTC:NABZY) showed its index of business conditions rose 4 points to +14 in August, recovering part of July's sharp 14-point drop.
The survey's measure of confidence edged up 2 points to -5, after diving in July as lockdowns spread from Sydney to Melbourne and Canberra.
Importantly, the conditions index remained well above the long-run average and businesses were faring much better than during the first round of lockdowns last year.
""The resilience of the survey during the current episode likely reflects the healthy momentum in the economy before the lockdowns, ongoing fiscal and monetary support as well as greater certainty that the lockdowns will end as vaccines roll out,"" said NAB chief economist Alan Oster.
""While we expect a large hit to activity in Q3, the survey supports our view that once restrictions are eased, activity will rebound.""
The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) also argued last week that the economy could recover quickly once the lockdowns were over and forecast strong growth for next year.
An easing in rules is expected to begin around mid-October when more of the population is vaccinated, though different states have different views about when to open fully.
A separate survey of consumers from ANZ out on Tuesday showed New South Wales' plan to re-open announced last week had an immediate impact, with confidence jumping 10.6% in the state.
That helped lift sentiment nationally by 3.1% as consumers' mood improved on their own financial health and the economy in general.
The NAB survey showed consumers were still shopping as its measure of sales rebounded to +19 in August, from +12 in July, while profitability firmed to +15 from +5.
The employment index fell 2 points to +9, though that was also above the long-run average.

Forward orders picked up sharply to +6, but capacity utilisation dipped back to 80.0% pointing to a lot of slack in the system.
The NAB survey was conducted from Aug. 17-30.

1375,By Bloomberg,"<span>Sep 13, 2021 05:27PM ET</span>",China Likely Suffered Another Economic Slowdown Last Month,"(Bloomberg) -- China’s economy likely slowed further in August, with data on consumption, industrial output and investment due Wednesday to reveal the extent of the damage caused by an outbreak of the delta variant. 
The extent of the slowdown will be closely watched for sign that it’s serious enough to prompt authorities to change their current stance of slowly withdrawing liquidity from markets and keeping stimulus limited. The ongoing regulatory crackdown on sectors like education, the internet and property may have exacerbated the recent economic weakness. 
The Wednesday data will likely show China’s recovery remains uneven. Strong global demand led to record exports in August but domestic consumers turned cautious as lockdowns and fear kept many at home, meaning the industrial sector is expected to have fared better than retail sales.
To better gauge China’s economic performance, here’s a guide to what to watch for in the data:
Consumption 
Consumption took the hardest hit in August as the Covid-19 delta variant spread across China, forcing the closure of tourist spots and some cities during the summer holidays. However even before those outbreaks, China’s consumption rebound was not solid. 
Indicators of the services industry painted a bleak picture for August, with both official and private gauges pointing to the first contraction since early 2020. 
Although China now has the outbreak under control and has relaxed most restrictions, the impact on consumer spending will likely linger and the incomes of service providers will take a long time to recover. 
Property 
Government measures to curb soaring house prices and also the worsening situation at China’s largest property developer likely cooled property investment further. Authorities haven’t stepped in to open the credit taps to support real-estate demand and construction, and there’s no indication yet that will change, with the government aiming to make housing more affordable as part of efforts to reduce inequality.
Home sales sales in the four first-tier cities declined 16% in August from a year ago, according to Bloomberg calculations based on weekly data. What happened with property investment nationwide will be key for the economy, as 28% of gross domestic product is related to the property sector, according to Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) economists. 
Infrastructure
China used to rely on debt-fueled construction to boost growth, but infrastructure investment has disappointed this year, even as the slowdown has sparked hopes for more government action. In July, spending on roads and other infrastructure shrank the most since the pandemic last February, dragged down by the slow pace of borrowing by local governments. 
The finance ministry in late August urged local government to speed up the issuance of special bonds and make good use of the proceeds. While sales of government debt in August were the highest they’ve been all year, it will take time before the effect of any increase in bonds sales shows up in the investment data. Investment is expected to pick up in the coming months but a lack of good projects and local governments’ pressure to cut debt could make the outlook for spending less optimistic. 
Youth Unemployment
Although China’s overall jobless rate has stabilized at pre-pandemic levels, the youth unemployment rate has hovered at an elevated level this year. Authorities have repeatedly emphasized the urgency of this issue and pledged targeted measures to help graduates find jobs or start their own businesses. With the graduation season coming to an end, seeing how many of the 9.1 million fresh graduates have been absorbed by the labor market will be key.
Policy Stance
Policy makers have so far refrained from large-scale stimulus this year, instead resorting to some low-profile tools to increase credit supply to parts of the economy, especially small businesses. With the latest wave of Covid, surging production costs, and a likely slowdown in exports, some economists are calling for more action to support growth. 
Any change in the statistics bureau’s assessment of the current economic operations and policy outlook is worth looking at. In previous reports, it had consistently stated that the momentum of the steady recovery was sustained, despite a number of downside risks. 
The People’s Bank of China is also likely to announce the rate for 1-year loans to banks Wednesday morning, when 600 billion yuan ($93 billion) of lending matures, but there is no expectation the bank will cut the rate if it does make any loans.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. government on Monday posted a $171 billion budget deficit for August, 15% lower than the $200 billion gap a year ago, as recovery-driven tax receipts grew faster than outlays for COVID-19 pandemic relief programs, the Treasury Department said.
The August deficit was $2 billion less than the average forecast by analysts in a Reuters survey. A U.S. Treasury official said the August budget results would not alter the department's estimates for when Treasury's extraordinary financing measures to avoid breaching the $28.4 trillion debt limit would be exhausted.
U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen last week urged Congress to increase or suspend the debt limit, saying that ""cash and extraordinary measures will be exhausted during the month of October,"" leaving the government unable to fully pay its obligations.
Receipts in August rose 20% from the year-earlier period to $268 billion while outlays in the month were up 4% to $439 billion. Some $59 billion in August benefits were paid in July because the month started on a non-business day.

For the first 11 months of the 2021 fiscal year, the deficit totaled $2.711 trillion, down 10% from the $3.007 trillion for the same period last year, as revenues improved.
Year-to-date receipts rose 18% from the same period last year to $3.586 trillion, while outlays rose 4% to $6.297 trillion.

LONDON (Reuters) - A key market gauge of euro zone inflation expectations rose to its highest level since mid-2015 on Monday, a further sign that investor perceptions over the direction of future inflation are shifting.
Euro zone bond yields were broadly steady, although relief over a slowdown in the pace of European Central Bank purchases appeared to be in the past.
And evidence that expectations for higher inflation, boosted by Germany's election race and signs of supply bottlenecks in recent weeks, moved into the spotlight.
The five-year, five-year breakeven inflation forward, a long-term market inflation gauge tracked by the ECB, rose to 1.8207%, its highest level since mid-2015 and a step closer to the ECB's new 2% inflation target.
It has risen almost 15 bps since the start of September and by 1502 GMT it was at 1.7856%.
""The rise in breakevens and inflation is a reflection of much greater inflation risk than in recent years,"" said Antoine Bouvet, senior rates strategist at ING. 
""I don’t think the median long-term inflation expectation has shifted materially higher but the range of possible outcomes is much wider than it was a couple of years ago, and skewed towards high prints,"" he added, citing factors such as supply chain disruptions for the increase in inflation protection. 
Graphic: Euro zone inflation expectations at highest since 2015: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/dwvkrdrzqpm/inflation1310.png 
The ECB's Isabel Schnabel said on Monday that inflation will ""in all likelihood"" ease next year after the current spike but she listed risks to that scenario from supply bottlenecks to higher wages.
Breakeven inflation in Germany, Europe's biggest economy, has also shot up, a sign for some analysts that investors expect policies under the next German government could stoke inflation.
Germany's 10-year breakeven inflation rate is at around 1.59% -- its highest since late 2018.
Olaf Scholz, the Social Democrat candidate to become Germany's next chancellor, beat his conservative rival in a primetime TV debate on Sunday, a snap poll showed, further boosting his chances of succeeding Angela Merkel after the Sept. 26 election.
Most experts think a three-way coalition is the most likely outcome -- a scenario that could take several months to negotiate.
""There is uncertainty about the coalition outcome and that is effecting the term premium in German bonds, especially the inflation expectation component,"" said Rabobank senior rates strategist Lyn Graham-Taylor. ""There is a concern that the next government could have policies that are inflationary.""
Germany's 10-year Bund yield was steady at around -0.33% -- near eight-week highs hit ahead of last Thursday's ECB meeting.
Bond markets were expected to face fresh headwinds in the form of new supply and U.S. economic data. 

Bond issuance steps up this week, with ING estimating that supply could reach 30 billion euros from Germany, the Netherlands, Italy, France and Spain. 
The European Union on Monday mandated banks to sell a new 7-year bond, which will likely on Tuesday, according to a lead manager memo seen by Reuters. And Greece said it may issue a green bond in the second half of 2022.

(Reuters) -U.S. consumers' expectations for how much inflation will change over the next year and the coming three years rose last month to the highest levels since 2013, according to a survey released on Monday by the New York Federal Reserve. 
Year-ahead inflation expectations increased for the 10th straight month to a median of 5.2% in August, according to the monthly survey of consumer expectations. Inflation expectations over the next three years increased to a median of 4.0%. Both metrics are at the highest they've ever been for the survey, which was launched in 2013. 
U.S. central bank officials are keeping a close watch on inflation expectations as they try to evaluate whether the pricing pressures triggered by the coronavirus pandemic will pass or have more lasting effects on the economy. 
Some policymakers say ending the massive asset purchases the Fed launched last year to support markets and the economy sooner rather than later will give officials more options for responding down the road if inflation lasts longer than anticipated. 
Several policymakers said they expect the Fed to begin winding those asset purchases down later this year despite a weakening in jobs growth in August. 
The New York Fed survey showed that consumers are raising their expectations for how much more they may have to spend on housing, food and other essentials over the next year. 
Expectations for how much home prices will increase over the next year dropped again in August for the third straight month, but were still elevated at a median of 5.9%, the survey found.

Food prices are expected to grow by 7.9% over the next year, up from 7.1% in July. Rent is expected to increase by 10% over the next 12 months and the price of medical care is expected to rise by 9.7% over the next year - both up 0.2 percentage point from July. 
The report is based on a rotating panel of 1,300 households.

ISTANBUL (Reuters) -Turkish industrial output rose 8.7% annually in July, much less than forecast after a recent strong rebound, while the current account deficit was wider than expected, data showed on Monday, fuelling speculation about the timing of possible rate cuts.
The disappointing data came after a strong run in which recoveries in consumption, exports and tourism set the economy on a path to near 10% overall growth this year, leaving last year's initial coronavirus fallout behind. 
Month-on-month, industrial output shrank 4.2% in July on a calendar and seasonally adjusted basis, the Turkish Statistical Institute said. 
In a Reuters poll, production was forecast to rise 15.1% annually in July after surging 23.9% in June.
The data, along with figures showing monthly retail sales growth slowing to 0.7% in July from 15% in June, suggested the economy made a soft start to the third quarter, said Jason Tuvey, senior emerging markets economist at Capital Economics.
""The weak hard activity indicators coming alongside comments from the central bank that it is currently putting more emphasis on core inflation... mean that it is more likely than not that an easing cycle begins before the year is out,"" he said.
Last week the central bank governor said the current 19% policy rate was tight enough to bring inflation down in the fourth quarter, suggesting monetary easing is on the way. He also stressed the importance of core inflation, which fell below 17% annually in August. 
Separate data showed a current account deficit of $683 million in July, compared with a poll forecast of $570 million.
The July balance had been expected to show a relatively small deficit, due largely to a partial recovery in tourism revenues. The deficit narrowed from $1.122 billion in June.
The lira was 0.4% stronger at 8.4520 against the dollar after the data. But it has shed 2.5% in the last four trading days and some analysts expect more volatility heading into a monetary policy meeting on Sept. 23.
Societe Generale (OTC:SCGLY) on Monday said the lira would likely weaken to 8.85 by year end, adding the central bank increasingly risks making the mistake of cutting interest rates too early given political pressure for stimulus. 

Many Turkish factories halted work in March last year, soon after the first COVID-19 infection was recorded. Output dropped 31.4% in April and 19.9% in May before a recovery began in June.
Throughout the pandemic Turkey imposed temporary curfews and business closures, including a tough but brief lockdown in April and May of this year. The measures were lifted in June.

1380,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 13, 2021 04:00AM ET</span>",Turkey's current account deficit seen at $570 million in July: Reuters poll,"ISTANBUL (Reuters) - Turkey's current account is expected to record a relatively small deficit of $570 million in July due largely to a partial recovery in tourism revenues, a Reuters poll showed on Tuesday.
For the full year, the median estimate of 11 economists was a $20 billion deficit, with responses ranging from $18 billion to $25 billion.
Turkey's import-reliant economy, worth $717 billion in 2020, has been prone to big trade deficits and a boom-bust growth cycle that was exacerbated by the pandemic.
The current account recorded a deficit of $36.72 billion in 2020 due mostly to a sharp rise in the trade deficit and plunging tourism revenues due to coronavirus fallout.
The median estimate in the Reuters poll showed a deficit of $570 million in July, with estimates ranging between a deficit of $1 billion and a surplus of $39 million.
A major component of the current account, the trade deficit widened 51.3% year-on-year to $4.28 billion in July, according to the Turkish Statistical Institute.
An uptick in tourism revenue from last year, as well as exports are expected to narrow the deficit in 2021 as a whole compared to last year.
Last month, the central bank revised four data points, including trade credits and short-term external debt stock, which is also expected to impact the deficit for the full year.
For 2021 as a whole, the $20-billion forecast was lower than a government estimate of $21 billion released on Sunday as part of its medium-term projections, which also predicted it would drop to $18.6 billion next year.
Central Bank Governor Sahap Kavcioglu said in July that Turkey would record a current account surplus for the rest of the year.

Turkey's 12-month current account ended 2019 in surplus for the first time since 2001, though the monthly reading dipped back towards the end of the year as the economy recovered from a recession brought on by a 2018 currency crisis.
The central bank is scheduled to announce July current account data at 0700 GMT on Sept. 13.

The Russian capital uses cheaper migrant labour, typically workers from the former Soviet Union countries of central Asia, for construction projects across the city of more than 12 million people.
""We hope that in the near future, restrictions on their entry into the country will be eased,"" Yefimov said. ""The shortage of labour resources is leading to employers, first and foremost real estate developers, buying employees from each other, due to which the cost of their services grows.""
Russia imposed wide-ranging travel restrictions at the start of the pandemic in March 2020, many of which remain in force, making cross-border travel a challenge for certain countries' citizens.
House prices in Moscow were stagnant for a few years, Yefimov said, but against the backdrop of the pandemic, the cost of housing has increased, catching up with inflation.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's wholesale inflation hovered near a 13-year high in August as raw material imports continued to rise on solid global demand, data showed on Monday, putting pressure on companies to pass on higher costs to households.
Many analysts, however, expect companies to keep any price hike moderate as state of emergency curbs to combat the coronavirus pandemic weigh on domestic demand.
""It's difficult to pass over the (wholesale) price increase to consumer goods given the weak consumption,"" said Takumi Tsunoda, senior economist at Shinkin Central Bank Research.
""The BOJ might be forced to continue its massive easing even when central banks around the world seek normalisation.""
The corporate goods price index (CGPI), which measures the price companies charge each other for their goods and services, rose 5.5% in August from a year earlier, slightly below a median market forecast for a 5.6% gain, Bank of Japan data showed.
It was the sixth straight month of increase and a tad below the 5.6% surge in July, which was the fastest pace of increase since September 2008.
The index, at 105.8, marked the highest level since 1982, when Japan's economy was booming from an asset-inflated bubble.
While gains in fuel costs moderated, prices rose for chemical, steel and wood products as global demand for such goods remained strong, Shigeru Shimizu, head of the BOJ's price statistics division, told a briefing.
""As the global economy continues to recover thanks to progress in vaccinations, domestic wholesale inflation will remain under upward pressure, though there's uncertainty over the outlook due to a resurgence in infections,"" he said.
Underscoring the huge cost pressure companies were facing, the yen-based import prices rose a record 29.2% in August from a year earlier, the data showed.

Japan's economy has emerged from last year's slump thanks to robust exports. But continuing state of emergency curbs have dampened prospects for a solid recovery in the current quarter.
Core consumer prices fell 0.2% in July from a year earlier, marking the 12th straight month of declines and staying distant from the BOJ's elusive 2% target.

1383,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 10, 2021 03:41PM ET</span>",Strained supply chains keep U.S. producer prices hot,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. producer prices increased solidly in August, leading to the biggest annual gain in nearly 11 years, suggesting that high inflation is likely to persist for a while as the unrelenting COVID-19 pandemic continues to pressure supply chains.
Strong demand and supply constraints were underscored by other data on Friday showing the pace of inventory accumulation at wholesalers slowed in July. It is now taking wholesalers the fewest months in seven years to clear shelves. 
""Supply chain bottlenecks have persisted longer and more intensely than most predicted at the beginning of this year, and widespread labor shortages are among the main input issues producers are dealing with,"" said Will Compernolle, a senior economist at FHN Financial in New York. ""This means consumer price inflation should remain elevated for a while."" 
The producer price index for final demand rose 0.7% last month after two straight monthly increases of 1.0%, the Labor Department said. The gain was led by a 0.7% advance in services following a 1.1% jump in July.
A 1.5% increase in trade services, which measure changes in margins received by wholesalers and retailers, accounted for two-thirds of the broad rise in services. Goods prices jumped 1.0% after climbing 0.6% in July, with food rebounding 2.9%.
Transportation and warehousing prices shot up 2.8%.
The latest global wave of COVID-19 infections, driven by the Delta variant of the coronavirus, has disrupted production at factories in Southeast Asia, key raw materials suppliers for manufactures in the United States. Congestion at Chinese ports is also adding to the pressure on U.S. supply chains.
In the 12 months through August, the PPI accelerated 8.3%, the biggest year-on-year advance since November 2010 when the series was revamped, after surging 7.8% in July.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the PPI gaining 0.6% on a monthly basis and rising 8.2% year-on-year.
Stocks on Wall Street were lower. The dollar was steady against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices fell.
LOGISTICS DELAYS
Though surveys from the Institute for Supply Management this month showed measures of prices paid by manufacturers and services industries fell significantly in August, they remained elevated. Factories and services providers still struggled to secure labor and raw materials, and faced logistics delays. 
This was corroborated by the Federal Reserve's Beige Book report on Wednesday compiled from information collected on or before Aug. 30 showing ""contacts reported generally higher input prices but, as with labor, they were mostly concerned about getting the supplies they needed versus the price.""
The supply bottlenecks are making it harder for businesses to restock after running down inventories in the first half of the year. In a separate report on Friday, the Commerce Department said wholesale inventories rose 0.6% in July after surging 1.2% in June. Sales increased 2.0%. At July's sales pace it would take wholesalers 1.20 months to clear shelves, the fewest since July 2014, from 1.22 in June.
""Producers are struggling to replenish their stockpiles against surging demand,"" said Matt Colyar, an economist at Moody's (NYSE:MCO) Analytics in West Chester, Pennsylvania.
With inventories tight, producers are easily passing on the higher costs to consumers. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has steadfastly maintained that high inflation is transitory. 
Though most economists share this view, some argue that strong wage growth from a tightening labor market suggests inflation could be more persistent. 
""Today's data on wholesale prices should be eye-opening for the Fed, as inflation pressures still don't appear to be easing and will likely continue to be felt by the consumer in the coming months,"" said Charlie Ripley, senior investment strategist at Allianz (DE:ALVG) Investment Management. 
The Fed's preferred inflation measure for its flexible 2% target, the core personal consumption expenditures price index, increased 3.6% in the 12 months through July after a similar gain in June. Data next week will likely show the consumer price index rising 0.4% in August and increasing 5.3% on a year-on-year basis, according to a Reuters survey.
High inflation and supply constraints, which tanked motor vehicle sales in August, have prompted economists to slash their third-quarter gross domestic product growth estimates to as low as a 3.5% annualized rate from as high as 8.25%. The economy grew at a 6.6% rate in the second quarter.
""The danger with inflation is once prices go up, they don't go back down and the economy and producers and consumers all have to live in a costlier world where many don't have the means to do more than just barely survive,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at FWDBONDS in New York. 
There are, however, signs that inflation is likely nearing its peak. Excluding the volatile food, energy and trade services components, producer prices rose 0.3%, the smallest gain since last November. The so-called core PPI shot up 0.9% in July. 
In the 12 months through August, the core PPI accelerated 6.3%. That was the largest rise since the government introduced the series in August 2014 and followed a 6.1% increase in July.

Details of the PPI components, which feed into the core PCE price index, were mixed. Healthcare costs fell 0.2%. Portfolio management fees rose 1.1% and airline tickets increased 8.9% after soaring 9.1% in July.
""Soft medical services suggest that evidence of persistently stronger inflation in PCE may be more limited,"" said Andrew Hollenhorst, chief U.S. economist at  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) in New York.

OTTAWA (Reuters) -Canada posted strong jobs growth in August and the unemployment rate fell to its lowest point since the onset of the coronavirus pandemic, according to data that could boost Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's hopes for reelection later this month. 
Canada added 90,200 jobs last month, close to analysts' average estimate of 100,000, and the jobless rate dropped to 7.1%, below the 7.3% estimate, Statistics Canada reported on Friday. Employment is now within 1% of pre-pandemic levels. 
The ruling Liberals led by Trudeau, now in the crucial last stage of the campaign before the Sept. 20 election https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/canadas-trudeau-tries-boost-reelection-campaign-after-inconclusive-debate-2021-09-10, have seized upon the country's economic rebound to trumpet their fiscal policies, including heavy spending to fight the pandemic.
""These results are a testament to the hard work of Canadians, as well as the strength of our plan to get Canadians through the pandemic to recovery,"" Mona Fortier, the junior finance minister, said in a statement. 
The employment data showed the summer reopening had bolstered the hardest-hit segments of the services sector.
""It was a solid report, probably a little bit better than we expected. The main story is the economy is slowly but surely grinding back,"" said Doug Porter, chief economist at BMO Capital Markets.
Trudeau's hopes of extending his six years in power were dealt a setback last month after data showed Canada's economy unexpectedly contracted https://www.reuters.com/business/canadian-economy-shrank-11-q2-july-gdp-seen-down-04-2021-08-31 in the second quarter and again in July. Next week's inflation numbers are the final major economic release before the vote. Trudeau is in a close race with his main rival, Conservative leader Erin O'Toole.
Economists said while the jobs data was mostly positive, the number of hours worked by Canadians barely changed and remains 2.6% below pre-pandemic levels, which could weigh on economic growth.
""As much as it is nice to see more people going back to work it is a concern that we are not seeing more hours worked in the economy,"" said Andrew Kelvin, chief Canada strategist at TD Securities.
The services sector dominated the job gains, led mostly by the hard-hit accommodation and food services segments. Service-sector employment returned to pre-pandemic levels last month, though that was mostly due to growth in professional services, public administration and educational services.
The construction sector posted its first employment gain since March, helping keep the goods sector in positive territory. That was partially offset by a decline in agricultural jobs.
Analysts noted that challenges remain, especially as a fourth wave of COVID-19 infections threatens to unravel some gains in the services sector. Labor shortages amid a persistent mismatch between job seekers' skills and employers needs will also weigh.

""If Canada wants stable economic growth, we need to make sure we're creating opportunities for a post-pandemic workforce,"" the Canadian Chamber of Commerce's Leah Nord said in a statement.
The Canadian dollar was trading 0.5% higher at 1.26 to the greenback, or 79.37 U.S. cents.

BEIJING (Reuters) - China's factory gate inflation hit a 13-year high in August driven by roaring raw materials prices despite Beijing's attempts to cool them, putting more pressure on manufacturers in the world's second-largest economy.
The producer price index (PPI) rose 9.5% from a year earlier in August, the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) said on Thursday, faster than the 9.0% increase tipped in a Reuters poll and the 9.0% reported in July. That was the fastest pace since August 2008.
China's economy has recovered strongly from last year's coronavirus slump but has been losing steam recently due to domestic COVID-19 outbreaks, high raw material prices, tighter property curbs and a campaign to reduce carbon emissions.
Commodity prices have been on a tear in recent months, hurting the bottom lines of many mid- and downstream factories. China's coal prices soared to a record high on Tuesday over supply concerns as major coal regions started fresh rounds of safety checks.
Earnings at China's industrial firms have slowed for five straight months.
But coal and metals prices will likely drop back as construction activity falls amid restrictions on the property sector and slowing credit growth, Julian Evans-Pritchard, senior China economist at Capital Economics, wrote in a note.
And the higher comparison base towards the end of last year will also pull down overall inflation. ""We doubt producer price inflation will rise much further,"" he said.
The coal, chemicals and metals industries drove much of the price increases in August, according to a statement released alongside the data by Dong Lijuan, an NBS official.
Prices in the coal mining and washing sector grew 57.1% in August from a year earlier.
A separate NBS statement showed that the consumer price index (CPI) in August rose 0.8% from a year earlier, compared with a 1.0% gain in a Reuters poll and below the government target of around 3% this year.
China tightened social restrictions to curb the COVID-19 Delta variant including travel limits, which have hampered service-sector demand, although Beijing has largely contained the latest coronavirus outbreaks.
Declines in airfares, travel and hotel room prices due to the pandemic slowed consumer inflation on a monthly basis, according to NBS's Dong.
Service-sector activity plunged in August to the lowest level since the pandemic's first wave in April 2020, a recent survey showed, as COVID-19 restrictions threatened to derail the recovery.
Many analysts expect the People's Bank of China to deliver a further cut to the amount of cash banks must hold as reserves later this year to lift growth, on top of July's cut, which released around 1 trillion yuan ($155.32 billion) in long-term liquidity into the economy.
""We expect monetary policy to remain prudent with a slightly loosening bias for the rest of the year,"" said Jing Liu, senior economist for Greater China at HSBC, in a note.
China's consumer price inflation, which is likely to stay muted, will not constrain a slight loosening stance, she added.
The core consumer price index, which strips out volatile food and energy prices, stood at 1.2% on year, versus a 1.3% rise in July.

The Commerce Department said on Friday that wholesale inventories rose 0.6% as estimated last month. Stocks at wholesalers increased 1.2% in June. Wholesale inventories climbed 11.5% in July from a year earlier.
Inventories are a key part of gross domestic product. The component of wholesale inventories that goes into the calculation of GDP increased 0.7% in July.
Business inventories were depleted in the first half of the year, but shortages amid persistent supply bottlenecks because of the COVID-19 pandemic and recent ports congestion in China are frustrating efforts to replenish stocks. 

Still, inventory rebuilding is expected to underpin economic growth in the second half of the year.
Sales at wholesalers increased 2.0% in July after accelerating 2.3% in June. At July's sales pace it would take wholesalers 1.20 months to clear shelves, the fewest since July 2014, from 1.22 in June.

The producer price index for final demand increased 0.7% from the prior month and 8.3% from a year ago, a fresh series high, Labor Department data showed Friday. Excluding the volatile food and energy components, the so-called core PPI advanced 0.6%, and was up 6.7% from August of last year.
The median forecasts in a Bloomberg survey of economists called for a 0.6% month-over-month advance in both the overall PPI and the core figure.
A variety of challenges across the production pipeline -- from materials shortages and shipping bottlenecks to rising labor expenses -- have driven up costs for producers. Many companies have passed along those additional costs onto consumers through higher prices in recent months, further stoking consumer inflation.
The PPI report showed prices for goods increased 1% after a 0.6% gain in the prior month, while the cost of services rose 0.7%. 
Meats, residential natural gas, industrial chemicals and motor vehicles were among the goods that moved higher. The rise in services reflected a 7.8% gain in margins for health, beauty and optical goods retailing. 
The PPI data come ahead of next week’s consumer price index report, which is forecast to show a 0.4% advance in the CPI from the prior month and a 5.3% increase from August of 2020.
Producer prices excluding food, energy, and trade services -- a measure often preferred by economists because it strips out the most volatile components -- rose 0.3% from the prior month and increased 6.3% from a year earlier. 
Global Inflation
Producers around the world are raising prices amid soaring costs for commodities and shipping. A separate report out earlier this week showed prices paid to producers in China jumped in August from a year earlier by the most in 13 years.
Costs are growing earlier in the U.S. production pipeline as well. Processed goods for intermediate demand, which include materials and components used in manufacturing and construction, rose 1% in August and were up 23% from 12 months ago, a fresh 46-year high.
Meantime, several districts surveyed by the Federal Reserve “indicated that businesses anticipate significant hikes in their selling prices in the months ahead,” according to the U.S. central bank’s Beige Book released Wednesday.
The elevated cost pressures and supply chain bottlenecks are augmenting the uncertainty already faced by businesses. PPG Industries Inc (NYSE:PPG)., which specializes in paints and coatings, withdrew its 2021 financial guidance on Tuesday as supply-chain disruptions drag on sales and higher raw-material costs hurt profit.

LONDON (Reuters) -Britain's economy unexpectedly slowed to a crawl in July as the Delta variant of COVID-19 spread rapidly after lockdown restrictions were eased and as a 'pingdemic' kept many workers at home self-isolating. 
Economic output rose just 0.1% in July, the Office for National Statistics said on Friday, the smallest monthly increase since January when Britain went into a new national lockdown.
Economists polled by Reuters had mostly expected month-on-month growth of 0.6% in gross domestic product. Only two of the 26 analysts had expected such a weak reading. 
Finance minister Rishi Sunak said he was confident that the economy would continue to recover from the pandemic.
But the slowdown in growth may bolster the case of Bank of England officials who think it is premature to talk about withdrawing stimulus, despite growing inflation pressure.
Earlier this week, BoE Governor Andrew Bailey said he saw a levelling-off in the recovery taking place, with labour shortages, global supply chain problems and Brexit disruption combining to stunt the economic recovery.
""Stalling GDP and rising inflation will leave a whiff of stagflation in the air,"" said Paul Dales, chief UK economist at the Capital Economics consultancy.
Britain saw a sharp increase in COVID-19 cases in July as the Delta variant spread rapidly, leading to hundreds of thousands of workers being ordered to stay at home under self-isolation rules which have been relaxed. 
The ONS said some businesses had complained of staff being unable to come to work because they were required to self-isolate - the so-called pingdemic https://www.reuters.com/world/uk/pingdemic-english-businesses-buckle-under-covid-isolation-demands-2021-07-19 - and a fall in construction output was linked to post-lockdown problems in global supply chains.
SHOPPPERS REIN IN SPENDING 
The dominant services sector was flat in July from June with output in consumer-facing services falling for the first time since January, driven mostly by a drop in the retail sector.
Industrial output grew by 1.2%, boosted by the return to production of an oil field, but manufacturing was flat.
Construction output fell by a monthly 1.6%.
Early signs of how Britain's economy fared in August have suggested that consumers got back to spending, with unofficial measures of retail sales and broader expenditure bouncing back.
Data published on Thursday showed spending on payment cards returned to 99% of its pre-pandemic level in early September.
But businesses continued to struggle in August with staff shortages and supply chain problems - and it remains to be seen how this week's announcement of tax hikes for workers and employers, to fund health and social care, will affect the economy.
""This week the market voted that the impact would be negative, as the share price of economically sensitive companies such as house-builders fell,"" said Emma Mogford, fund manager of Premier Miton's Monthly Income Fund.

Separate ONS data showed Britain's goods trade deficit hit a seven-month high in July at 12.7 billion pounds ($17.60 billion), widened by a slowdown in exports to the European Union which have been hit by post-Brexit trade barriers.

1389,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 10, 2021 03:00AM ET</span>",China vehicle sales fall for fourth month on chip shortages,"BEIJING (Reuters) - China's vehicle sales slid 17.8% in August from a year earlier, falling for a fourth consecutive month, as the world's biggest car market was hard hit by a global shortage of semiconductors.
Overall sales in China stood at 1.8 million vehicles in August, data from the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers (CAAM) showed.
China's vehicle sales jumped 13.7% in the first eight months of 2021 from the same period a year ago, as the market recovered from pandemic lows.
CAAM now expects 2021 growth to be slower than a previously forecast 6.5%, said Chen Shihua, a senior official at CAAM.
A prolonged global chip shortage has unsettled major automakers including Ford Motor (NYSE:F), Honda Motor, General Motors (NYSE:GM) and Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p), forcing many to idle or curtail production.
The shortage was unlikely to be resolved soon as the pandemic rages on in many parts of the world, Chen said.

One bright spot in the data was the strong sales of new energy vehicles, which more than doubled in August to 321,000 vehicles. These include battery-powered electric vehicles, plug-in petrol-electric hybrids and hydrogen fuel-cell vehicles.
The government's promotion of greener vehicles to cut pollution has prompted electric car makers such as Nio (NYSE:NIO) Inc, Xpeng (NYSE:XPEV) Inc and BYD Co (OTC:BYDDF) Ltd to expand manufacturing capacity in China.

1390,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 10, 2021 01:20AM ET</span>","Japan's exports seen surging in August, wholesale prices staying high - Reuters poll","By Kantaro Komiya
TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's exports likely surged for the sixth straight month in August thanks to strong global demand for machinery goods and a flattering comparison with last year's pandemic-induced slump, a Reuters poll showed on Friday.
Japan's wholesale prices were expected to stay at more than 10-year highs in August due to global commodity inflation and a weak yen, while firms' machinery orders likely rose in July, according to analysts polled by Reuters.
Exports likely jumped 34.0% in August from a year earlier, the sixth month of double-digit gains, though they were seen slowing from July's 37.0% increase, the poll showed.
Export growth has been strong even as factory halts and supply issues due to the spread of COVID-19 variants in Southeast Asia and a global chip shortage are hitting Japanese carmakers.
Takeshi Minami, chief economist at Norinchukin Research Institute, said there are heightened worries about whether a steady economic recovery holds up.
""China's economic recovery has stalled recently and the spread of the Delta variant in advanced nations is having a suppressing effect,"" he said.
Imports likely rose 40.0% year-on-year in August, which would result in a trade deficit of 47.7 billion yen ($434.74 million) after two straight months of surpluses, the poll showed.
Separate data from the Bank of Japan is expected to show Japan's wholesale prices rose 5.6% year-on-year in August, matching the prior month's 13-year high.
The corporate goods price index (CGPI), which tracks the prices companies charge each other for their goods, probably rose 0.2% month-on-month in August.
The finance ministry will announce the trade data at 8:50 a.m. on Sept. 16 (2350GMT, Sept. 15), while the CGPI data is due at 8:50 a.m. on Sept. 13 (2350GMT, Sept. 12).
Cabinet Office data due at 8:50 a.m. Wednesday (2350 GMT Tuesday) will likely show core machinery orders, a highly volatile data series as a leading indicator of capital expenditure in the coming six to nine months, gained 3.1% month-on-month in July.
Compared with a year earlier, core orders, which exclude those of ships and electricity utilities, likely grew 15.7% in July partly because of a double-digit drop in the same month last year.

Japan's economy grew faster than initially estimated in the April-June quarter, helped by solid capital expenditure, although a resurgence in COVID-19 is undermining service-sector consumption and clouding the outlook.

1391,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 09, 2021 05:06PM ET</span>",U.S. applications to start a business fall in August,"By Evan Sully
(Reuters) - Applications to start new U.S. businesses declined in August for just the third time this year and the first time since June as the recent surge in coronavirus cases put entrepreneurs on hold. 
The Commerce Department said on Thursday that business applications fell 4.7% to a seasonally adjusted 427,842 last month. The data is derived from business applications for tax identification numbers. 
There were a seasonally adjusted 50,564 applications from corporations, down 2.5% from July. Applications for businesses with planned wages totaled 51,240, a decrease of 3.7% from the prior month. 
Economic growth nationwide is forecast to accelerate this year at the fastest pace in four decades. However, the rise in the number of Americans testing positive for the coronavirus and the lingering Delta variant have halted plans for both entrepreneurs and job applicants. 
""The latest COVID surge brings another wave of uncertainty that may weigh on entrepreneurs' willingness to start new businesses,"" said Oren Klachkin, lead U.S. economist at Oxford Economics in New York. ""The Delta variant will also make it harder for new businesses to hire if people are fearful of contracting the virus in their new job.""
Business applications fell in all four U.S. regions, led by a 6.2% drop in the South. Applications were lower across all industries except in mining, real estate and unclassified services. Mining posted a 6.6% increase from July. 

The largest drop was in utilities, which recorded a 12.8% decline, with other sizable drops in accommodation and food services, as well as the arts and entertainment category. 
Based on last month's figures, the Commerce Department's Census Bureau, which compiles the data, projected about 31,994 new business start-ups with payroll tax liabilities would form within four quarters of application, down 4.5% compared with the estimates for July.

1392,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 09, 2021 01:02PM ET</span>",U.S. labor market recovery on track as weekly jobless claims near 18-month low,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The number of Americans filing new claims for jobless benefits fell to the lowest level in nearly 18 months last week, offering more evidence that job growth was being hindered by labor shortages rather than cooling demand for workers.
The weekly unemployment claims report from the Labor Department on Thursday, the most timely data on the economy's health, also showed the number of people on state unemployment rolls plunging to levels last seen in mid-March 2020 when the economy was reeling from mandatory shutdowns of nonessential businesses to slow the first wave of COVID-19 cases.
The continued downward trend in layoffs followed on the heels of a report on Wednesday showing job openings raced to a new record high in July, indicating a tightening labor market, which some economists argued could put pressure on the Federal Reserve to announce when it would start scaling back its massive monthly bond-buying program. Fed Chair Jerome Powell has offered no signal on when the U.S. central bank plans to cut its asset purchases beyond saying it could be ""this year.""
""There is likely to be a fierce debate at the coming Fed meeting on how tight the labor market is, but if policymakers focus on the most timely data we've got, they will realize that the labor market is close to meeting their more stringent criteria for an interest rate hike let alone the trigger for tapering,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at FWDBONDS in New York.
Initial claims for state unemployment benefits dropped 35,000 to a seasonally adjusted 310,000 for the week ended Sept. 4, the lowest level since mid-March 2020. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast 335,000 applications for the latest week.
Unadjusted claims, which economists say offer a better read of the labor market, fell 8,005 to 284,287 last week. 
The second straight weekly decline in claims came even as filings surged in Louisiana after Hurricane Ida devastated U.S. offshore energy production and knocked off power. There were also notable increases in California, Virginia and Michigan. But those rises were offset by big decreases in claims in Florida, Georgia, New York, Missouri and Tennessee. 
Claims have dropped from a record 6.149 million in early April 2020. They are closing in on the upper end of the 200,000-250,000 range viewed as consistent with healthy labor market conditions. 
President Joe Biden hailed the declining claims as ""further evidence of a durable economic recovery.""
Stocks on Wall Street were mixed. The dollar slipped against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices rose. 
Graphic: Jobless claims - https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-STOCKS/zjvqkkxgevx/joblessclaims.png 
DOWNWARD TREND 
The continued downward trend in claims suggested the labor market was holding up, despite a resurgence in infections, driven by the Delta variant of the coronavirus. Rising cases contributed to holding back job growth in August, with nonfarm payrolls increasing only 235,000, the smallest gain since January. Payrolls surged 1.053 million in July.
""There has been no pickup in job separations even as the economy endures another wave of new virus infections,"" said Conrad DeQuadros, senior economic advisor at Brean Capital in New York.
Job openings surged to a record 10.9 million at the end of July. The Fed's Beige Book report compiled from information collected on or before Aug. 30 showed ""all Districts noted extensive labor shortages that were constraining employment and, in many cases, impeding business activity.""
About 8.4 million people are officially unemployed. This labor market imbalance has been blamed on lack of affordable childcare, fears of contracting the coronavirus, generous unemployment benefits funded by the federal government as well as pandemic-related retirements and career changes. 
There is cautious optimism that the labor crunch will ease starting in September following the expiration of the government-funded unemployment benefits on Monday, including a $300 weekly subsidy, blamed by businesses and Republicans for discouraging the jobless from seeking work.
The new school year is underway, with most school districts offering in-person learning. 
But the Delta variant could cause reluctance among some people to return to the labor force. There is also no guarantee that the expiration of the expanded benefits will force the unemployed to look for work. An early termination of these benefits by about 25 states led by Republican governors over the summer did not expand the labor pool.
The claims report also showed the number of people continuing to receive benefits after an initial week of aid fell 22,000 to 2.783 million in the week ended Aug. 28, the lowest level since mid-March 2020. 
At least 11.930 million people were receiving benefits under all programs during the week ended Aug. 21. According to Andrew Stettner, senior fellow at The Century Foundation, more than 8 million people lost all their pandemic benefits on Monday and another 2.1 million saw their benefits cut by $1,200 per month.
This so-called unemployment insurance cliff could contribute to curbing economic growth this quarter, though consumer spending is likely to remain underpinned by the strengthening labor market and the accompanying strong wage gains. 
Households also accumulated more than $2 trillion in savings during the pandemic and have seen their wealth boosted by record-high stock market and house prices.

""That's going to weigh on growth, but the consumer spending will still increase, just at a somewhat weaker pace,"" said Gus Faucher, chief economist at PNC Financial (NYSE:PNC) in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. 
Growth estimates for the third quarter have been slashed following dismal automobile sales in August, soaring COVID-19 cases and fading fiscal stimulus.

The finance ministry said 1.6 million workers were still furloughed at the end of July, down from almost 2 million a month earlier but a slower decline than in previous months.
More up-to-date data, based on reports from businesses, suggested that the fall slowed further last month.
Britain's statistics office said 6% of the workforce was furloughed as of Aug. 22.
""The number of people coming off furlough over the summer has slowed to a trickle, as some firms and sectors – notably overseas tourism – struggle to return to pre-pandemic levels of activity,"" Charlie McCurdy, an economist at the Resolution Foundation think tank, said.
""As a result, up to a million employees could still be on furlough when the scheme closes at the end of this month.""
Finance minister Rishi Sunak, who rushed out the furlough scheme to keep people employed when the coronavirus pandemic struck last year, celebrated the fall in furlough levels to their lowest since the start of the pandemic.
He pointed to how young people in particular were getting back to work.
Bank of England officials are trying to gauge whether workers still on scheme when it expires can fill the record number of jobs currently open or become unemployed.

Earlier on Thursday the Recruitment and Employment Confederation said businesses faced the most severe shortage of job candidates on record due to the economy's post-lockdown surge and Brexit.
BoE Governor Andrew Bailey on Wednesday said he was anxious about job vacancies not being filled. The end of the furlough scheme would help to correct this but he said he had ""concern about the persistence in the labour market story"".

1394,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 09, 2021 05:35AM ET</span>",China's factory inflation hits 13-year high as materials costs soar,"BEIJING (Reuters) -China's factory gate inflation hit a 13-year high in August driven by roaring raw materials prices despite Beijing's attempts to cool them, putting more pressure on manufacturers in the world's second-largest economy.
The producer price index (PPI) rose 9.5% from a year earlier in August, the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) said on Thursday, faster than the 9.0% increase tipped in a Reuters poll and the 9.0% reported in July. That was the fastest pace since August 2008.
China's economy has recovered strongly from last year's coronavirus slump but has been losing steam recently due to domestic COVID-19 outbreaks, high raw material prices, tighter property curbs and a campaign to reduce carbon emissions.
Commodity prices have been on a tear in recent months, hurting the bottom lines of many mid- and downstream factories. China's coal prices soared to a record high on Tuesday over supply concerns as major coal regions started fresh rounds of safety checks.
Earnings at China's industrial firms have slowed for five straight months.
But coal and metals prices will likely drop back as construction activity falls amid restrictions on the property sector and slowing credit growth, Julian Evans-Pritchard, senior China economist at Capital Economics, wrote in a note.
And the higher comparison base towards the end of last year will also pull down overall inflation. ""We doubt producer price inflation will rise much further,"" he said.
The coal, chemicals and metals industries drove much of the price increases in August, according to a statement released alongside the data by Dong Lijuan, an NBS official.
Prices in the coal mining and washing sector grew 57.1% in August from a year earlier.
A separate NBS statement showed that the consumer price index (CPI) in August rose 0.8% from a year earlier, compared with a 1.0% gain in a Reuters poll and below the government target of around 3% this year.
China tightened social restrictions to curb the COVID-19 Delta variant including travel limits, which have hampered service-sector demand, although Beijing has largely contained the latest coronavirus outbreaks.
Declines in airfares, travel and hotel room prices due to the pandemic slowed consumer inflation on a monthly basis, according to NBS's Dong.
Service-sector activity plunged in August to the lowest level since the pandemic's first wave in April 2020, a recent survey showed, as COVID-19 restrictions threatened to derail the recovery.
Many analysts expect the People's Bank of China to deliver a further cut to the amount of cash banks must hold as reserves later this year to lift growth, on top of July's cut, which released around 1 trillion yuan ($6.47 trillion) in long-term liquidity into the economy.
""We expect monetary policy to remain prudent with a slightly loosening bias for the rest of the year,"" said Jing Liu, senior economist for Greater China at HSBC, in a note.

China's consumer price inflation, which is likely to stay muted, will not constrain a slight loosening stance, she added.
The core consumer price index, which strips out volatile food and energy prices, stood at 1.2% on year, versus a 1.3% rise in July.

Investing.com – China’s factory gate inflation rose to a 13-year high in August. Soaring raw material prices contributed to the gains while exerting further pressure on Chinese manufacturers.
National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) data released earlier in the day showed that the producer price index grew 9.5% year-on-year. The rate was faster than the 9% growth reported during the previous month, which was also the figure in forecasts prepared by Investing.com. It was also the fastest pace of growth since August 2008.
Recent COVID-19 outbreaks, high raw material prices, tighter property curbs and a campaign to reduce carbon emissions have all contributed to the slowdown in China’s economic recovery from COVID-19.
The coal, chemicals and metals industries drove much of the commodity price increases in August, NBS official Dong Lijuan said in a statement released alongside the data.
Meanwhile, the NSB data also said that the consumer price index (CPI) grew 0.1% month-on-month, lower than the 0.5% growth in forecasts prepared by Investing.com and the 0.3% growth reported during the previous month.
The CPI grew 0.8% year-on-year, lower than the 1% growth reported during the previous month and in forecasts prepared by Investing.com.
Consumption was hit by tighter restrictive measures, including travel limits, to curb the latest COVID-19 outbreak. Declines in airfares, travel and hotel room prices thanks to these measures slowed consumer inflation on a monthly basis, said NBS's Dong.
The People's Bank of China is now widely expected to further cut the amount of cash banks must hold as reserves later in 2021. It already cut the amount in July 2021, a move that released around CNY1 trillion ($154.72 billion) in long-term liquidity into the economy.

1396,By Bloomberg,"<span>Sep 08, 2021 10:18PM ET</span>",China Factory Inflation Surges Again as Commodity Boom Persists,"(Bloomberg) -- China’s factory-gate inflation accelerated in August to a 13-year high, with commodity prices remaining elevated despite Beijing’s battle to curb gains.  
Producer prices rose 9.5% from a year earlier, the National Bureau of Statistics said Thursday, faster than the 9% gain in July. The consumer price index rose 0.8% last month from a year earlier, following a 1% gain in the previous month. Economists surveyed by Bloomberg had predicted both rates would be unchanged. 
The rally in commodity prices has been a major driver of factory-gate inflation this year, and even though the government has taken targeted steps to curb the rapid price gains, such as boosting supplies and attempting to cutting back on hoarding, they’ve had limited effect so far.
Business prospects are being affected in different ways by the surge in PPI. Consumer-goods makers and other downstream manufacturers are seeing profits squeezed, while upstream sectors, like raw materials producers, are benefiting.
The People’s Bank of China sees inflation pressure in the economy as controllable, saying last month that the pickup in producer prices in the first half was likely temporary. The economic recovery has also lost steam recently following the outbreak of new virus cases, adding to downward pressure on inflation.
Growth in consumer prices remained subdued in the month, in part because of sluggish consumer spending after authorities imposed restrictions to contain the spread of the delta variant last month. Non-food CPI climbed 1.9% from a year ago.
Pork prices, a key element in China’s CPI basket, continued to fall sharply in the month, resulting in the biggest drop in the food price index since 2017. Core CPI, which strips out volatile items such as food and energy, rose 1.2%. 
While muted consumer inflation pressure provides room for more policy support, this week’s strong export data and comments from central bank officials suggest a smaller chance of more easing in the near future, economists say.

1397,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 08, 2021 08:10PM ET</span>",UK employers face worst shortage of job candidates on record - REC,"LONDON (Reuters) - British employers are facing the most severe shortage of job candidates on record due to the post-lockdown surge in the economy and Brexit, pushing up starting pay for permanent staff at an unprecedented pace, a recruiters' body said.
In a survey which will be studied by the Bank of England as it weighs up the risk of a longer-term inflation problem, the Recruitment and Employment Confederation (REC) said employers were increasingly upbeat about the outlook in August.
But their attempts to hire staff were being frustrated by shortages of staff. BoE Governor Andrew Bailey said on Wednesday he was concerned about getting jobs filled.
REC said a reluctance by employees to switch roles due to the pandemic, fewer European Union workers and skill shortages were contributing to the staffing squeeze.
""Candidate shortages continue to plague businesses, who are all recruiting from the same pool of talent and struggling to fill gaps,"" said Claire Warnes, head of education, skills and productivity at KPMG UK, which co-produces the survey.
The pace of recruitment for permanent posts hit the highest in the survey's nearly 24-year history last month. Temporary hiring and open vacancies were not far off July's record levels.
Salaries for newly placed permanent staff rose at the fastest rate on record. Wage inflation for temp workers was the second-quickest.
Warnes said the expiry of the government's furlough scheme at the end of this month did not mean the staffing ""crisis"" was going to go away as more people become available for work.
""Many businesses will have changed their business model during the pandemic, and so significant numbers of staff returning from furlough may need re-skilling to rejoin the workforce in the same or another sector,"" she said. 
Separately, the British Chambers of Commerce said staff shortages and global post-lockdown supply chain disruption were likely to slow Britain's economic growth in the coming months.
That meant the economy would recover its pre-pandemic size only in the first quarter of 2022, later than the BoE's prediction of the last quarter of 2021, the BCC said.
Investment by businesses was likely to fall this year as the hit to firms' finances from the pandemic, bigger tax bills and concerns over future COVID restrictions outweigh the boost from a tax incentive announced by finance minister Rishi Sunak.

The BCC said business investment would be 5.4% lower than its pre-pandemic level at the end of 2023 while consumer spending is projected to be 5.1% higher.
""It is concerning that business investment  looks like being  the weak point of the recovery because it undermines the UK's ability to raise productivity and increase our long-term growth prospects,"" Suren  Thiru, the BCC's head of economics, said.

1398,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 08, 2021 02:56PM ET</span>",U.S. job openings hit record high as employers struggle to find workers,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. job openings raced to a new record high in July while layoffs rose moderately, suggesting last month's sharp slowdown in hiring was due to employers being unable to find workers rather than weak demand for labor. 
The Labor Department's monthly Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey, or JOLTS report, on Wednesday also showed a steady increase in the number of workers voluntarily quitting their jobs, a sign of confidence in the labor market.
""This is a super tight job market,"" said Jennifer Lee, a senior economist at BMO Capital Markets in Toronto. ""The ongoing struggle to find the right worker for the right role continues.""
Job openings, a measure of labor demand, jumped 749,000 to 10.9 million on the last day of July, the highest level since the series began in December 2000. It was the fifth straight month that job openings, which have been increasing since January, hit a record high. 
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast vacancies rising to 10 million. July's broad increase was led by the healthcare and social assistance, finance and insurance, and accommodation and food services industries.
Job openings rose in the Northeast, South, Midwest and West regions. The job openings rate surged to a record 6.9% from 6.5% in June, driven by medium-sized businesses with 50-249 workers. The rate for large firms with 5,000 or more employees fell.
Hiring slipped 160,000 to 6.7 million, pulled down by decreases in retail trade, durable goods manufacturing and educational services. State and local government education hiring increased, as did federal government employment. 
The hiring rate fell to 4.5% from 4.7% in June. The hires rate dropped for large businesses.
Stocks on Wall Street fell. The dollar rose against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices were higher.
TIGHT LABOR MARKET 
The job openings to hires ratio, a measure of labor market tightness and companies' ability to find workers, rose to 1.64 in July. The JOLTS data followed in the wake of a government report last Friday that showed nonfarm payrolls increased by only 235,000 jobs in August, the smallest gain since January, after surging by 1.053 million in July.
Labor market tightness was underscored by the Federal Reserve's Beige Book report on Wednesday, based on information collected on or before Aug. 30, which showed ""all Districts noted extensive labor shortages that were constraining employment and, in many cases, impeding business activity.""
The COVID-19 pandemic has upended labor market dynamics, creating worker shortages even as 8.4 million people are officially unemployed. 
Lack of affordable childcare, fears of contracting the coronavirus, generous unemployment benefits funded by the federal government as well as pandemic-related retirements and career changes have been blamed for the disconnect. 
The labor crunch is expected to ease starting in September, with the government-funded unemployment benefits having expired on Monday. The new school year is underway and most school districts are offering in-person learning. 
But soaring COVID-19 cases, driven by the Delta variant of the coronavirus, could cause reluctance among some people to return to the labor force. Employment is 5.3 million jobs below its peak in February 2020.
""While we expect the labor market will continue to make some progress in coming months, it will likely take some time for these severe labor imbalances to get resolved,"" said Lydia Boussour, lead U.S. economist at Oxford Economics in New York.
The JOLTS report also showed 107,000 people voluntarily quit their jobs in July, lifting the total to 4.0 million. That reflected increases in the wholesale trade as well as state and local government education areas. 
There were decreases in the number of people quitting in the transportation, warehousing, utilities and federal government categories. Though the overall quits rate was unchanged at 2.7%, the rate for the private sector - a leading indicator of wage growth - increased to 3.1% from 3.0%. 
The quits rate is viewed by policymakers and economists as a measure of job market confidence, and July's rise in the private rate suggested further wage gains, which could keep inflation high for a while. Annual wage growth topped 4% in August. 
Some economists said labor market tightness could put pressure on the Fed to announce when it would start scaling back its massive monthly bond-buying program. Fed Chair Jerome Powell last month affirmed the ongoing economic recovery, but offered no signal on when the U.S. central bank plans to cut its asset purchases beyond saying it could be ""this year.""
""It takes two to tango and the problem with job creation would appear to be a reluctance to supply labor, not a diminishment of demand, and we would love to hear the economic theory that explains how continued Fed bond purchases encourage workers to return to work,"" said Conrad DeQuadros, a senior economic advisor at Brean Capital in New York. 

Layoffs and discharges rose a modest 105,000 to 1.5 million. That lifted the layoffs rate to 1.0% from 0.9% in June. There were 83 unemployed workers for every 100 job openings in July.
""Even if demand slows down or even falters, job seekers remain in a relatively favorable bargaining position,"" said Nick Bunker, director of research at Indeed Hiring Lab.

TOKYO (Reuters) -Japan's economy grew faster than the initially estimated in the April-June quarter, helped by solid capital expenditure, although a resurgence in COVID-19 is undermining service-sector consumption and clouding the outlook.
Revised gross domestic product (GDP) data by the Cabinet Office released on Wednesday showed the economy grew an annualised 1.9% in April-June, beating economists' median forecast for a 1.6% gain and the initial estimate of a 1.3% expansion.
It followed Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga's announcement last Friday that he was stepping down, paving the way for the Sept. 29 ruling party leadership race, in which contenders will outline their plans to revive the world's third-largest economy.
The upward revision was caused by better-than-initially-estimated business spending, as a brisk global economic recovery powered capital expenditure and factory output, which more than offset weak service-sector activity.
Still, Japan's economic recovery remains fragile due to slow COVID-19 vaccinations and as pandemic restrictions hamper private-sector activity.
""Japan's recovery is lagging behind other advanced economies. As such, the economy's fully-fledged recovery needs to wait at least until early next year,"" said Takeshi Minami, chief economist at Norinchukin Research Institute.
However, global chip shortages may put a drag on Japanese car production and shipments while signs of China's economic slowdown emerge as sources of concern.
""The 1.9% April-June growth was not enough to push back the nearly 4% dip in January-March - less than a half of it,"" said Yoshiki Shinke, chief economist at Dai-ichi Life Research Institute. ""On average, 'stalling' could be the main description of Japan's economy during the first half of 2021.""
The second-quarter GDP growth figures translated into a quarter-on-quarter expansion of 0.5% in price-adjusted terms, better than an initial reading of a 0.3% growth and the median estimate for a 0.4% gain.
The capital expenditure component of GDP grew 2.3% in the second quarter from January-March, bigger than the median forecast for 2.0% growth and the preliminary 1.7% gain.
Private consumption, which accounts for more than half of Japan's GDP, grew 0.9% in April-June from the previous three months, up slightly from a preliminary estimate of a 0.8% gain.
Domestic demand contributed 0.8 percentage points to revised growth figures, while net exports - or exports minus imports - shaved 0.3 percentage point off the second quarter growth.
Separate data on Wednesday showed the economy watchers survey, a gauge of service-sector sentiment fell to a seven-month low in August and at the fastest pace since February 2020.

The government downgraded the watchers' overall assessment of the economy, saying ""there are weaknesses in the recovery due to the effect of COVID-19.""
The data came a day after a weaker-than-expected July household spending reading, which suggested https://www.reuters.com/business/retail-consumer/japans-july-household-spending-rises-less-than-expected-2021-09-07 the COVID-19 resurgence could have started hampering consumer activities even earlier in the current quarter.

Gross domestic product grew at an annualized pace of 1.9% in the three months to June, buoyed by companies’ capital spending, extra government spending and stronger private consumption, according to a revised report by the Cabinet Office on Wednesday. 
Economists had expected growth of 1.6% compared with an initial government estimate of 1.3%.
The heftier spending by businesses suggests the corporate world is already looking at growth beyond the pandemic. 
Still, the subsequent surge in cases during Japan’s Olympic summer is likely to have had a bigger impact on spending by firms and shoppers this quarter. It remains unclear who will replace Suga, but economists expect the new premier will unveil a stimulus package to shore up the recovery as the nation heads into a general election this autumn.

Eurostat said on Tuesday that gross domestic product in the 19 countries sharing the euro increased by 2.2% quarter-on-quarter for a 14.3% year-on-year rise. These compared with earlier estimates of respectively 2.0% and 13.6%.
The economies of every euro zone country expanded except Malta, although for Luxembourg there was no data.
However, GDP volumes in the single currency bloc were still 2.5% below their pre-COVID peaks. The United States is already 0.8% higher than its end 2019 level.
Eurostat said household consumption in the April-June period added 1.9 percentage points to the overall quarterly figure, with government spending and investment adding 0.3 and 0.2 points respectively.
A draw-down of inventories pulled 0.2 percentage points off the overall figure, while the net impact of trade was zero.
Eurostat said also employment rose 0.7% quarter-on-quarter in the second quarter and by 1.8% year-on-year. The former figure was above the previously reported 0.5% increase, the latter was the same as that released in August.

House prices rose by 0.7% in August, the biggest month-on-month rise for three months and following a 0.4% rise in July, Halifax said.
In annual terms, house price growth cooled to 7.1% from 7.6% in July, the weakest reading for five months.
The number of property purchases slumped in July when a year-long exemption from stamp duty for the first 500,000 pounds ($687,550) of a house purchase ended in England and Northern Ireland. 
But other gauges of the housing market suggest the gradual expiry of the tax breaks has not resulted in a sharp slowdown.
""We believe structural factors have driven record levels of buyer activity – such as the demand for more space amid greater home working,"" Russell Galley, managing director of Halifax, said.

""These trends look set to persist and the price gains made since the start of the pandemic are unlikely to be reversed once the remaining tax break comes to an end later this month.""
Last week, rival mortgage lender Nationwide said its measure of British house prices rebounded surprisingly strongly in August to show their second-biggest monthly rise in 15 years after a fall in July.

1403,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 07, 2021 03:46AM ET</span>",China's economy gets welcome boost from surprisingly strong Aug exports,"BEIJING (Reuters) - China's exports unexpectedly grew at a faster pace in August thanks to solid global demand, helping take some of the pressure off the world's second-biggest economy as it navigates its way through headwinds from several fronts. 
The Asian giant staged an impressive recovery from a coronavirus-battered slump, but economic momentum has weakened recently due to the Delta variant-driven COVID-19 outbreaks, high raw material prices, slowing factory activity, tighter measures to tame hot property prices and a campaign to reduce carbon emissions.
Shipments from the world's biggest exporter in August rose 25.6% year-on-year, picking up speed from a 19.3.% gain in July, customs data showed on Tuesday, pointing to some resilience in China's industrial sector.
Analysts polled by Reuters had forecast growth of 17.1%. 
""While near-term headwinds remain, supply constraints in China have eased and we think the global economic recovery will continue to underpin China’s exports later this year and in 2022,"" said Louis Kuijs, head of Asia economics at Oxford Economics.
Exports from neighbouring countries also showed encouraging growth last month, with South Korean shipments accelerating on strong overseas demand
The shipments breakdown showed a broad-based uptick across all goods types, said Sheana Yue, assistant economist at Capital Economics.
""In particular, the rebound in Chinese-made consumer goods such as electronics, furniture and recreational products possibly reflected retailers in advanced economies replenishing their inventories ahead of the Christmas shopping season,"" said Yue. 
Moreover, some of the port gridlock appears to have cleared in a boost to China's shippers last month.
The eastern coastal ports have suffered congestion as a terminal at the country's second biggest container port shut down for two weeks due to a COVID-19 case. That put further pressure on global supply chains already struggling with a shortage of container vessels and high raw material prices.
The stretched global shipping capacity has left many boxes of finished goods piled up on Chinese factory floors, a factor set to bump up Chinese export numbers over coming months, said Meng Xianglong, founder of Heji Trade & Credit Research Centre based in the port city of Ningbo.
""I think it's expected that China's robust export growth will extend until the end of this year (around Christmas) or even into the beginning of the next year,"" Meng said, adding that some factories are fully booked until the first quarter of 2022. 
MORE STIMULUS ON TAP?
However, behind the robust headline figures, businesses are struggling on the ground. Companies faced increasing pressure https://www.reuters.com/world/china/chinas-factory-activity-expands-slower-pace-august-official-pmi-2021-08-31 in August as factory activity expanded at a slower pace while the services sector slumped into contraction. A global semiconductor shortage has added to the strains on exporters.
The country appears to have largely contained the latest coronavirus outbreaks of the more infectious Delta variant, but it prompted measures including mass testing for millions of people as well as travel restrictions of varying degrees in August.
Many analysts expect the central bank to deliver a further cut to the amount of cash banks must hold as reserves later this year to lift growth, on top of July's cut https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-economy-rrr-cut-idUSKCN2EF0U4 which released around 1 trillion yuan ($6.47 trillion) in long-term liquidity into the economy.
Imports increased 33.1% year-on-year in August, beating an expected 26.8% gain in the Reuters poll, led by still high commodity prices and partly reflecting the statistical effect of the low figures a year ago. 
Commodity prices remain elevated despite Beijing's attempts to cool them. In July, imports grew 28.1%.
China's coal imports in August rose 35.8% from a year ago due to tight domestic supply and strong demand, while iron ore imports also picked up for the first time in five months.

China posted a trade surplus of $58.34 billion in August, versus the poll's forecast for a $51.05 billion surplus and $56.58 billion in July.
The trade surplus with the United States - a source of years-long friction between the two economic powers - rose to $37.68 billion from $35.4 billion in July, Reuters calculations based on the customs data showed.

Investing.com – China’s trade data for August was surprisingly better than expected, with solid global demand counteracting the impact from the country’s latest COVID-19 outbreak and supply chain bottlenecks.
The country’s economic recovery from COVID-19 was halted due to the recent outbreak of COVID-19 cases involving the Delta strain. High raw material prices, slowing exports, tighter measures to curb property prices and a campaign to reduce carbon emissions also contributed to the slowdown.
Exports grew 25.6% year-on-year, according to data released earlier in the day. Forecasts prepared by Investing.com had predicted a 17.1% increase while the previous month’s growth was 19.3%.
Some of the gridlock in Chinese ports seems to have cleared, giving export figures a boost. Ports on China’s eastern coast were congested as Ningbo Zhoushan port, the country’s second-largest container port, shut down for two weeks thanks to a COVID-19 case. The closure placed further pressure on global supply chains already dealing with a shortage of container vessels and high raw material prices.
Meanwhile, imports grew 33.1% year-on-year, with forecasts prepared by Investing.com predicting a 26.8% growth and a 28.1% growth recorded for the previous month. The trade balance was $58.34 billion, against the $51.05 billion figure in Investing.com forecasts and the previous month’s $56.59 billion reading.
China has brought its latest COVID-19 outbreak largely under control, but the economic damage from restrictive measures imposed to do so has already been done. Investors now widely expect the People’s Bank of China to further reduce the amount of cash banks must hold as reserves later in the year. The central bank already cut the amount in July, which released around CNY1 trillion ($154.82 billion) in long-term liquidity into the economy."

Exports rose 25.6% in dollar terms from a year earlier, while imports grew 33.1%, the customs administration said Tuesday, resulting in a trade surplus of $58.3 billion for the month. Economists surveyed by Bloomberg had forecast exports would increase 17.3% and imports would rise 26.9%.
The pickup came despite port delays and high shipping costs, which have disrupted global supply chains. Signs of a slowdown are starting to emerge globally as Covid cases rise, and while officials have warned of weaker export growth for the rest of the year as risks and challenges build, it’s yet to weigh on the actual value of exports. 
Manufacturing surveys last week showed a contraction in new export orders for a fourth consecutive month in August, which may signal a slowdown in the future. Beyond trade, the economy is taking a knock from a plunge in services activity related to Covid restrictions, a tightening in property curbs and lower infrastructure spending.

Theatres, music festivals and theme parks saw a big jump in spending.
""Socialising, shopping, and staycations were top of the agenda for Brits in August, as families and friends made the most of the school holidays, giving a welcome boost to hospitality and leisure businesses,"" said Raheel Ahmed, Barclaycard head of consumer products.

A breakdown of the data showed that domestic orders fell 2.5% on the month and foreign orders rose by 8.0%.
Orders from the euro area fell by 4.1%, while orders from the rest of the world rose by 15.7%, mainly due to large orders from the shipbuilding sector.
Bastian Hepperle, economist at Bankhaus Lampe, said: ""The development in Germany is disappointing: the order books are still well filled and the order backlog is high.""
""Due to a lack of materials and primary products, there are considerable difficulties in processing orders,"" he added.
A survey showed last week that German manufacturers struggled to meet strong demand for industrial goods in August as supply shortages for raw materials and components such as semiconductors held back production and pushed up prices.

The German economy rebounded in the second quarter https://reut.rs/3mt1SDq with a growth rate of 1.6% compared to the previous three months as an easing of COVID-19 curbs spurred consumers to dip into record savings piled up during the winter lockdown.

The seasonally adjusted IHS Markit Saudi Arabia Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) dropped to 54.1 in August from 55.8 in July, remaining above the 50 mark that separates growth from contraction.
The output sub-index stood at 55.4 against 59.7 in July, its weakest reading since October last year.

The world's largest crude exporter was hit hard last year by the twin shock of the coronavirus and record-low oil prices, but the economy has recovered this year amid improved demand due to the easing of coronavirus-related restrictions.
New business continued to expand in August but at a slower pace, partly because of a softer increase in export sales as rising COVID-19 cases in other parts of the world weighed on the recovery in foreign demand, the survey said.
The rate of job creation was unchanged from July and remained marginal as businesses found levels of staffing sufficient to complete existing work.

“The bad news is that it missed by two thirds basically of expectations and the good news is that it gives the Fed cover to push off tapering. It just means more Fed for longer.

MICHAEL ARONE, CHIEF INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, STATE STREET GLOBAL ADVISORS, BOSTON
    ""The number's a big disappointment and its clear the delta variant had a negative impact on the labor economy this summer. You can tell because leisure and hospitality didn't add any jobs and retail actually lost jobs. It suggests areas that are highly sensitive to the pandemic suffered as the delta variant surged.""
    ""Markets are still signaling a positive open. Bond yields have ticked down some. Investors will conclude that perhaps this will put the Fed further on hold in terms of the timing of tapering. Markets may be ok with that. The market is always concerned the Fed will begin to tighten monetary policy prematurely. A number like this suggests that there's still some more time before the Fed begins to taper.""
DAVID PETROSINELLI, SENIOR TRADER, INSPEREX, NEW YORK
“It's not good news for stocks, obviously. There were a lot of crosscurrents in these numbers at the end of the summer. But at the end of the day, the Delta variant of COVID is definitely keeping people out of the labor force. 
“There’s other stuff in the report to hang on to. Average hourly earnings was big and the unemployment rate was down to. There's some stuff that hit the screws, but the headline number of jobs created was definitely smaller, definitely a disappointment."" 
STEVE RICK, CHIEF ECONOMIST, CUNA MUTUAL GROUP, MADISON, WISCONSIN (email)
""Following the strong jobs gains from July, it is disappointing to see the August jobs failed to meet expectations. However, this is not completely surprising given the emergence of the Delta variant which has continued to beat down the already hurting leisure and hospitality sectors. Though it is disheartening that the labor market couldn’t maintain momentum from the rapid growth, it shows us that our best way to true economic recovery is continuing the work of fully containing COVID-19 cases. 
  ""The beginning of the summer showed a surge in economic growth as COVID-19 cases plummeted and people got vaccinated. In July alone, 943,000 jobs were added to the economy and unemployment fell to 5.4%, the lowest since the pandemic began. The average growth for the three months prior to July was 567,000. While we’ve taken a bit of a step backwards with climbing case numbers again, this summer has illustrated economic rebound potential post-COVID.""

""It doesn’t put pressure on the Fed to make a taper announcement but judging from what I see here it’s an impact of resurgence of COVID and the service sector, people are staying at home and this will change. 
""These numbers are weak now but will strengthen in the months to come as the supplemental unemployment runs out. 

""The hourly wages is a hint that people are going to be demanding more money and with the threat of the virus still around and companies will start to raise salaries.

Investing.com -- Job creation in the U.S. slowed sharply in August as the spread of Covid-19 across southern states and the big coastal cities increasingly acted as a brake on hiring. 
Nonfarm payrolls expanded by only 235,000 through the middle of last month, the Department of Labor said on Friday. That was the smallest gain in seven months and far short of expectations for a gain of 750,000. The disappointment was only slightly mitigated by an upward revision of over 100,000 in July's job gains, to over 1.05 million.
The numbers all but rule out an early move by the Federal Reserve to start running down the bond purchases that have been the mainstay of its monetary support for the economy since the first wave of the pandemic. The spread of the delta variant of the coronavirus, more highly-transmissible than previous strains, had been flagged as a key variable in starting the withdrawal of stimulus by Fed Chair Jerome Powell in his speech at Jackson Hole last week.
The report was dominated by the failure of the leisure and hospitality sectors - labor-intensive sectors with high levels of direct interface with customers - to generate any net jobs at all in the month, after being the biggest driver of job growth in the previous two months.
""While payrolls have recovered dramatically given the magnitude of the Covid recession, the deceleration in August raises the specter of a slowdown similar to what we saw last winter,"" said Daniel Zhao, senior economist with Glassdoor, via Twitter (NYSE:TWTR). He pointed out that overall employment is still more than 5 million below its pre-pandemic level.
U.S. stock futures turned negative in response to the news, however, seeing negative implications for the strength of the economic recovery. Despite the weak-looking headline number, average earnings rose 0.6% on the month, rather than slowing to 0.3% as expected. The annual rate of average earnings accelerated to 4.3%, the highest in six months. 
By 8:45 AM ET (1245 GMT), Dow Jones futures were down 28 points, or 0.1%, while S&P 500 futures and Nasdaq 100 futures were down by a similar amount. The yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury bond rose 3 basis points to 1.32%, its highest level in a week.

LONDON (Reuters) - Euro zone business activity remained strong last month, despite fears about the Delta variant of the coronavirus and widespread supply chain issues, according to a survey which suggested the bloc's economy could be back to pre-COVID-19 levels by year-end.
IHS Markit's final composite Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI), seen as a good guide to economic health, dropped to 59.0 last month from July's 15-year high of 60.2, still well above the 50 mark separating growth from contraction but below a 59.5 ""flash"" estimate.
""Growth momentum in the euro zone is fading according to recent surveys and nowcast indicators. The big question is whether the recovery can carry on at a decent pace and quickly close the gap with pre-pandemic GDP,"" said Bert Colijn at ING. 
The economy will grow 2.2% this quarter, a Reuters poll published earlier on Friday predicted and IHS Markit said the euro zone economy was on track to be back at pre-pandemic levels by the end of the year, if not sooner. [ECILT/EU]
But ongoing supply chain disruptions caused by the pandemic meant the cost of raw materials soared again this month. The input prices index was a near record 69.5 - although down from July's 69.9.
Inflation surged to a ten-year high of 3.0% in August with further rises likely, official data showed on Tuesday, challenging the European Central Bank's benign view on price growth and its commitment to look past what it deems a temporary increase.

Despite the impact of the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, India's economic growth reached a record 20.1% in the June quarter but analysts have said vaccination coverage remains crucial to sustaining the recovery.
The IHS Markit Services Purchasing Managers' Index rose to 56.7 in August - its strongest pace since the pandemic hit the country in March 2020 and well above the 50-level that separates growth from contraction.
It had been below 50 for three months and was 45.4 in July.
""The Indian service sector bounced back in August, led by the reopening of several establishments and improved client confidence due to growing vaccine coverage,"" said Polyanna De Lima, economics associate director at IHS Markit. 
""Service providers foresee a brighter outlook, with firms indicating that the economic recovery could be sustained if restrictions continue to be lifted and further waves of contamination can be avoided."" 
Overall new orders climbed at the fastest rate since January 2013, as optimism reached its highest level in five months. New export orders, however, continued to decline. 
But employment remained in contractionary territory for the ninth month in a row, underscoring weakness in the labour market. 
Persistent supply chain disruptions caused by the pandemic meant input costs rose at their quickest rate since April and firms were unable to pass on some of the surge to customers. Prices charged rose at the slowest pace in four months.
""Another worrying aspect was the evidence that inflationary pressures continued to mount. Input costs increased at the fastest rate in four months, one that outpaced its long-term average,"" added De Lima.

Although the survey indicated inflation could stay beyond the Reserve Bank of India's medium-term target of 4% for some time, analysts believe the likelihood of the central bank tightening policy in the coming months remains low as it focuses more on economic growth.
The overall composite index rose to 55.4 last month from July's 49.2, well above the 50-mark for the first time in four months, as strong growth in services activity offset a softer rebound in manufacturing.

The European Union's statistics office Eurostat said on Friday that retail sales in the 19 countries sharing the euro fell 2.3% in July against June, but were still 3.1% higher than in July 2020.
Economists polled by Reuters had expected a 0.1% monthly increase and a 4.8% year-on-year rise.
June sales were revised up a little, to a rise of 1.8% from 1.5% month-on-month and to 5.4% from 5.0% year-on-year. 

Eurostat said internet and mail order sales fell the most in the month in July, declining 7.3%, while sales of automotive fuel dropped 1.6% and sales of food were down 0.7% on the month.
Still, measured against July 2020, all the retail sales numbers were up, with online sales 11.2% higher, automotive fuel up 0.6% and food sales 1.1% stronger.

The IHS Markit/CIPS UK Services Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) fell to 55.0 in August, revised lower from a preliminary ""flash"" reading of 55.5 and down sharply from 59.6 in July.
Overall the survey added to signs that British economic growth has slowed somewhat in the last month or so. 
The PMI marked a fifth month above the 50 threshold for growth and a record share of services companies said they were hiring staff - but they also struggled against rising costs.
""Many survey respondents commented on long wait times to fill vacancies and an unexpectedly high staff turnover as the UK economy reopened,"" said Tim Moore, economics director at IHS Markit.
A separate survey published earlier on Friday by the Recruitment & Employment Confederation also showed employers were still hunting for more staff than they were just before the pandemic, added to signs of a tight labour market after COVID-19 lockdowns and Brexit.
IHS Markit said consumer demand slowed last month after an initial post-lockdown surge.

Others said a slowing property market caused by partial withdrawal of a tax break on home purchases, a lack of tourists and Brexit trade frictions dampened growth too.
The composite PMI, which combines the services and manufacturing sectors, fell to 54.8 in August from 59.2 in July.

IHS Markit's final PMI services index found that activity in the sector had fallen slightly to 60.8 from 61.8 in July. The reading was also lower than a flash value of 61.5.
The composite PMI index, which comprises both the services and manufacturing sectors, fell to 60.0 from 62.4 in July, reflecting the continued recovery of the manufacturing sector. The reading was lower than a flash figure of 60.6.
""The service sector followed up July's record performance with another sharp increase in business activity in August, and has taken the mantle from manufacturing as the main driver of growth,"" said Phil Smith, Associate Economics Director at IHS Markit. ""Although the rate of expansion on a monthly basis looks like it has passed its peak, the scene is already set for strong growth in the third quarter, even if we were to see a further loss of momentum in September.""

""The Delta variant is a risk to service sector demand in the near term,"" he added. ""But looking ahead, businesses remain optimistic that conditions will have improved come this time next year, with many still hoping for an end to the pandemic and an associated recovery in travel activity.""
This optimism was reflected in a rapid pace of job creation, the survey showed.

The index was slightly below a preliminary reading for August of 56.4 points.
IHS Markit's overall final composite PMI index, which includes the services and manufacturing sectors, fell to 55.9 points in August from 56.6 in July but was in line with an initial reading.
The index for both services and composite PMI remained nevertheless well above the 50-point threshold dividing an expansion in activity from a contraction.
""The economic recovery in France continued to move along at a solid clip during August,"" IHS Markit senior economist Joe Hayes said.
""We're still seeing strong demand, and firms are adjusting their workforces to accommodate growing order books,"" he added.
Supply chain issues due to the pandemic continued to constrain supplies of raw materials, driving up prices, albeit slightly less than in July. 
Meanwhile, the government is looking to wind down most of its crisis support programmes for companies other than those still struggling.

The euro zone's second-biggest economy has spent 80 billion euros - nearly 4% of GDP - in various support programmes to keep companies afloat during the COVID-19 crisis.

IHS Markit's Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) of services companies, which account for around half Spain's economic output, slipped to 60.1 last month, down from 61.9 in July and 62.5 in June. The 50 mark separates growth from contraction.
""The current strong growth phase in the Spanish service sector was sustained during August as the economy continues to benefit from a loosening of lockdown restrictions and successful vaccine rollout,"" Andrew Harker, Economics Director at IHS Markit, said.
The end of most restrictions in Spain, and in other European countries where quarantines had been imposed on tourists returning home, has allowed Spain's tourist sector to take off in the past few months.
As a result companies hired more people and took employees off furlough, he added.
Government data on Thursday showed unemployment had the biggest August decline ever recorded as the tourism industry partly recovered. 

The rate of input cost inflation, most notably energy prices and rising wages, remained a concern for businesspeople in August, IHS said.
Rising vaccination rates and looser COVID-19 restrictions caused Spain's economy to expand by a better-than-expected 2.8% in the second quarter. The government expects 6.5% growth this year after 2020's record 10.8% contraction.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's economy likely grew more than initially reported in the second quarter thanks to stronger business spending, a Reuters poll showed, though a resurgence of coronavirus infections is seen weighing on growth going forward.
Separate data due next week will likely show household spending rebounded in July from a year earlier, in a sign consumer sentiment recovered somewhat before the highly infectious Delta variant spread rapidly in Japan.
Revised gross domestic product (GDP) data is expected to show Japan's economy grew an annualised 1.6% in April-June, more than a preliminary reading of 1.3% growth, the poll of 19 economists showed.
The stronger figure was in part due to an expected 2.0% rise in capital spending, a larger increase than a preliminary 1.7% gain, analysts projected. The world's third-largest economy contracted 1.0% in the first quarter.
""The view that Japan's economy remained stagnant in April-June is unchanged,"" said Saisuke Sakai, senior economist at Mizuho Research Institute.
""Dragged down by the state of emergency curbs, the recovery was weak compared to the dip in January-March.""
Household spending likely rose 2.9% year-on-year in July after a 5.1% fall in June, the poll also showed, as the Olympics opened in Tokyo and a flattered comparison to the slump seen a year earlier.
Household spending was seen up a seasonally adjusted 1.1% in July from the previous month, according to the poll.

The government will release the revised second-quarter GDP data at 8:50 a.m. local time on Sept. 8 (2350 GMT on Sept 7), and announce household spending data at 8:30 a.m. on Sept. 7 (2330 GMT, Sept. 6).

1424,By Investing.com,"<span>Sep 03, 2021 12:39AM ET</span>",China’s Services Sector Contracts as Recent COVID-19 Restrictions Take a Toll,"By Gina Lee
Investing.com – China’s services sector entered contraction territory in August, with recent COVID-19 restrictions continuing to thwart the country’s economic recovery.
The Caixin services purchasing managers’ index (PMI) was 46.7, the lowest level since April 2020. It was also below the 50-mark indicating growth and down from the previous month’s 54.9 figure.
Data released earlier in the week showed that the Caixin manufacturing PMI was at 49.2, while the manufacturing PMI and the non-manufacturing PMI were at 50.1 and 47.5 respectively.
The services sector recovered at a slower pace than its manufacturing counterpart but had been boosted by increasing consumption in recent months.
The strict restrictions, including those on travel, put into place to curb China’s latest COVID-19 outbreak hit the transportation, catering, accommodation and entertainment sectors particularly hard.
Although it seems the outbreak has since been largely contained, the damage has already been done.
""Service costs were still under great pressure amid elevated labor and transportation costs amid the COVID-19 resurgence. Sluggish market demand limited businesses' bargaining power, causing prices charged by service providers to slip after a month of growth,"" Caixin Insight Group senior economist Wang Zhe told Reuters.
Rooms that were originally CNY300-400 ($46.44-$61.92) are now discounted to around CNY200 and ""still no one is coming,"" the manager of a hotel in Zhangjiajie, Hunan province, told Reuters. The province was a hotspot of the latest COVID-19 outbreak.
""COVID-19's Delta variant is so terrible, people don't want to go out,” said the manager, adding that extra business over national holidays for the remainder of 2021 still will not make up for losses incurred during the summer vacation period.
Even businesses that were less impacted by COVID-19 took a hit.
""Inter-provincial flight-plus-hotel travel packages didn't resume until mid-August, which had a pretty big impact on business. Now the peak season has already passed,"" a bed and breakfast owner in Sanya, Hainan province, told Reuters."

The Caixin/Markit services Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) fell to 46.7 in August from 54.9 in July, plunging to the lowest level since the pandemic's first wave in April 2020. The 50-point mark separates growth from contraction on a monthly basis.
The grim readings in the private survey, which focuses more on smaller firms in coastal regions, tally with findings in an official survey earlier this week which also showed growth in the services sector slipped into contraction.
China's services sector was slower to recover from the pandemic than manufacturing, but has been helped by a gradual improvement in consumption in recent months.
The country appears to have largely contained the latest coronavirus outbreaks of the more infectious Delta variant, with just one locally transmitted case reported on Sept. 1 after several days of zero cases. 
But it spurred authorities across the country to impose measures including mass testing for millions of people as well as travel restrictions of varying degrees in August, hitting especially the catering, transportation, accommodation and entertainment industries.
""Service costs were still under great pressure amid elevated labour and transportation costs amid the Covid-19 resurgence,"" said Wang Zhe, senior economist at Caixin Insight Group.
Sub-indexes for new business, prices charged, and employment in the Caixin survey all contracted in August. New export business rose.
""Sluggish market demand limited businesses' bargaining power, causing prices charged by service providers to slip after a month of growth,"" said Wang.
Rooms that were originally 300-400 yuan are now discounted to around 200 yuan and ""still no one is coming,"" said the manager of a hotel in Zhangjiajie, Hunan province, one of the hotspots of the August epidemic.
""Delta is so terrible, people don't want to go out.""
Some extra business over national holidays in the rest of the year won't make up for the loss of the summer vacation period, he said. 
Business owners in areas with few virus cases were also hit.
""Inter-provincial flight-plus-hotel travel packages didn't resume until mid-August, which had a pretty big impact on business - now the peak season's already passed,"" said a bed and breakfast owner in Sanya, in the southern island province of Hainan. 
An index of business confidence in the Caixin survey fell slightly from July but remained at a high level.

The Recruitment & Employment Confederation said on Friday that 1.66 million job advertisements were active during the week to Aug. 29, higher than the 1.55 million average in January and February 2020 and little changed from levels earlier in August.
New job ads posted during the week stood at 193,000, also above the January-February 2020 average of 171,000.
""Demand for workers remains very high across the economy and shows no signs of weakening,"" REC Chief Executive Neil Carberry said. ""With businesses in the particularly squeezed food, logistics and hospitality sectors starting to gear up for Christmas, the months ahead could be difficult – even with a large number of people coming off furlough in August and September,"" he said. 
Britain's unemployment rate of 4.7% in the three months to June is higher than before the crisis when it stood at just under 4% but it has defied forecasts that it would hit 10% or higher during the pandemic crisis thanks in large part to the government's wage subsidy scheme.

That scheme is due to be phased out by the end of September. But the low unemployment rate is also partly due to a rise in workers who are not looking for employment are therefore excluded from calculations for the jobless rate.
Britain's government has rejected calls from retail and logistics companies to temporarily ease post-Brexit immigration rules which they say are contributing to a shortage of truck drivers and acute supply chain disruption.

(Reuters) - Half of U.S. small-business owners reported unfilled job openings in August as finding qualified workers remains an ongoing challenge, a trade group said on Thursday.
The National Federation of Independent Business said in its monthly jobs report that 50% of small business owners reported unfilled job openings in August on a seasonally adjusted basis, up from 49% in July. August's reading is 28 percentage points higher than the 48-year average of 22%.
The report also showed that 91% of owners reported few or no qualified applicants for the positions they were trying to fill last month.
Employers nationwide continue to face labor shortages during a year in which economic growth is forecast to expand at its fastest pace in four decades. However, applicants have faced tough decisions of their own as COVID-19's Delta variant spreads rapidly.
""Small employers are struggling to fill open positions and find qualified workers resulting in record high levels of owners raising compensation,"" NFIB Chief Economist Bill Dunkelberg said in a statement. ""Owners are raising compensation in an attempt to attract workers and these costs are being passed on to consumers through price hikes for goods and services, creating inflation pressures.""
Furthermore, 44% of small businesses surveyed currently have job openings for skilled workers and 27% have openings for unskilled labor. 
""Instead of describing the current environment as a labor shortage, we view this as a temporary mismatch between labor supply and demand that will improve in the coming months,"" said Mahir Rasheed, an economist at Oxford Economics. 

The number of Americans filing new claims for jobless benefits fell last week, while layoffs dropped to their lowest level in more than 24 years in August, suggesting the labor market continues to heal even as COVID-19 infections surge.
On Friday, the Labor Department is expected to report nonfarm U.S. payrolls increased by 750,000 jobs in August after rising by 943,000 in July, according to a Reuters survey of economists. The unemployment rate is forecast to have fallen to 5.2% from 5.4% a month earlier.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The number of Americans filing new claims for jobless benefits fell last week, while layoffs dropped to their lowest level in more than 24 years in August, suggesting the labor market was charging ahead even as new COVID-19 infections surge.
The weekly unemployment claims report from the Labor Department on Thursday, the most timely data on the economy's health, also showed the number of people on state unemployment rolls tumbling to a 17-month low in the third week of August.
Declining layoffs should help to ease concerns about the economy even if August's closely watched employment report on Friday shows a slowdown in nonfarm payrolls growth. 
""Regardless of tomorrow's report, keep in mind that the weekly jobless figures say the labor market screws continue to tighten,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at FWDBONDS in New York. ""There is no sign that the Delta variant is leading to job losses across the country.""
Initial claims for state unemployment benefits dropped 14,000 to a seasonally adjusted 340,000 for the week ended Aug. 28, the lowest level since mid-March 2020 when mandatory closures of nonessential businesses were enforced to slow the first wave of coronavirus cases. 
There were notable declines in applications in California, Illinois and Virginia, while Ohio and Missouri reported big increases. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast 345,000 applications for the latest week. 
Claims have dropped from a record 6.149 million in early April 2020. They, however, remain above the 200,000-250,000 range viewed as consistent with healthy labor market conditions. 
The latest wave of COVID-19 cases, driven by the Delta variant of the coronavirus, and an acute shortage of workers have left some economists expecting moderate job gains in August. Labor market indicators last month were mixed, with a measure of factory employment contracting and private payrolls undershooting expectations. But hiring by small businesses accelerated and consumers' views of the labor market remained fairly upbeat.
Stocks on Wall Street were trading higher, with the S&P 500 index touching a record high. The dollar slipped against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices were mixed.
WORKER SHORTAGES
While last week's claims data has no bearing on August's employment report as it falls outside the survey period, applications trended lower last month. The claims report showed the number of people continuing to receive benefits after an initial week of aid plunged 160,000 to 2.748 million in the week ended Aug. 21, the lowest level since mid-March 2020.
According to a Reuters survey of economists, nonfarm payrolls likely increased by 750,000 jobs last month after rising by 943,000 in July.
""We expect the jobs report to show that the economy continued to add jobs at a rapid pace in August, defying COVID-19 Delta variant outbreaks across the country,"" said Julia Pollak, chief economist at ZipRecruiter. 
That optimism was underscored by a separate report on Thursday from global outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas showing job cuts announced by U.S.-based employers decreased 17% to 15,723 in August, the lowest number since June 1997. So far this year, employers have announced 247,326 job cuts, down 87% compared to the same period last year.
The pandemic has upended labor market dynamics, creating worker shortages even as 8.7 million people are officially unemployed. There were a record 10.1 million job openings at the end of June. Lack of affordable childcare, fears of contracting the coronavirus, generous unemployment benefits funded by the federal government as well as pandemic-related retirements and career changes have been blamed for the disconnect. 
The labor crunch is expected to ease starting in September. The government-funded unemployment benefits lapse on Sept. 6 and schools are reopening for in-person learning. 
But soaring COVID-19 cases could cause reluctance among some people to return to the labor force. The claims report showed about 12.2 million people were receiving benefits under all programs in mid-August. This number is expected to drop sharply after next Monday's expiration of government programs, which will affect about 7.5 million people. 
About 25 states led by Republican governors terminated the expanded benefits several months ago. Those steps did not lead to an increase in hiring, leaving some economists to caution against expectations for an increase in the labor pool.
""Many states already have ended the programs ahead of the federal expiration but so far we have yet to see clear changes associated with the ends of these programs in many of the different variables we have studied,"" said Daniel Silver, an economist at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) in New York.
The labor market recovery is gaining steam despite a slowdown in economic activity caused by the latest coronavirus wave, fading fiscal stimulus and supply constraints. As a result of the expiration of the expanded benefits, weekly unemployment checks for nearly 3.0 million people will be reduced by $300, which economists say will hurt consumer spending.
But the moderation in growth is likely to be mitigated by a shrinking trade deficit. The trade gap narrowed 4.3% to $70.1 billion in July, the Commerce Department said in a separate report on Thursday.

Economists have sharply marked down their gross domestic product estimates for the third quarter to a low as a 2.9% annualized rate from as high as a 9% pace. The economy grew at a 6.6% rate in the second quarter. 
""The slowdown is not broad-based and primarily reflects payback from stimulus spending and ongoing supply issues,"" said Ellen Zentner, chief U.S. economist at  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) in New York.

OTTAWA (Reuters) -Canada posted a narrower trade surplus in July than in the previous month, missing analyst expectations, as imports rose at a faster pace than exports, Statistics Canada data showed on Thursday.
Canada's surplus with the world was C$778 million ($616.6 million) in July, down from a downwardly revised C$2.6 billion surplus in June, the largest in nearly 13 years.
Analysts surveyed by Reuters had on average forecast a surplus of C$1.40 billion in July.
""All things considered, I'd say it's an upbeat month,"" said Peter Hall, chief economist at Canada's export development agency, noting that exports rose in seven of 11 categories.
Exports were up 0.6% in the month, hitting another record high at C$53.8 billion, as gains in motor vehicles and parts, along with energy and other sectors offset a sharp decrease in exports of lumber and forestry products.
""One of the real highlights of the month is that back-to-back sharp increase in the auto sector, giving us a sense that even with the chip shortage the movements of autos and parts are actually occurring,"" said Hall.
Imports, meanwhile, jumped 4.2% to hit a record high of C$53.0 billion, mostly on inbound motor vehicles and parts.
Canada's trade activity with the United States, its largest trading partner, reached record levels in July, mostly driven by growth in auto sector trade. Trade activity with the rest of the world declined.
Economists noted that while risks remain from the computer chips shortage, shipping constraints and pandemic, the July numbers suggest trade could help boost economic activity in the third quarter.
""There's still plenty of data to go for Q3, but it looks like trade will add to GDP growth in the quarter,"" said Benjamin Reitzes, Canadian rates and macro strategist at BMO Capital Markets.

The Commerce Department said on Thursday that factory orders increased 0.4% in July after advancing 1.5% in June. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast factory orders gaining 0.3%.
Orders increased 18.0% on a year-on-year basis. Though demand is shifting back to services, appetite for goods remain strong. This, together with an urgency by businesses to restock after inventories were run down in the first half of the year, should underpin manufacturing, which accounts for 11.9% of the economy.
The Institute for Supply Management reported on Wednesday an unexpected pickup in August even as manufacturers complained that labor and raw materials remained scarce.
The rise in factory goods orders in July was led by primary metals and machinery. But supply constraints depressed orders for computers and electronic products as well as those for electrical equipment, appliances and components. Orders for transportation equipment fell 2.1%.
The Commerce Department also reported that orders for non-defense capital goods, excluding aircraft, which are seen as a measure of business spending plans on equipment, edged up 0.1% in July instead of being unchanged as reported last month.

Shipments of these so-called core capital goods, which are used to calculate business equipment spending in the gross domestic product report, rose 0.9%. Core capital goods shipments were previously reported to have advanced 1.0% in July.
Business spending on equipment was robust in the second quarter, notching the fourth straight quarter of double-digit growth. That contributed to hoisting the level of GDP well above its peak in the fourth quarter of 2019.

Nonfarm productivity, which measures hourly output per worker, increased at a downwardly revised 2.1% annualized rate last quarter. It was previously reported to have advanced at a 2.3% pace. Economists polled by Reuters had expected productivity would be raised to a 2.4% rate. 
Productivity grew at a 4.3% rate in the January-March quarter. It surged early in the pandemic before slumping in the final three months of 2020. Economists attributed the jump to the hollowing out of lower-wage industries, like leisure and hospitality, which they said tended to be less productive.
Compared to the second quarter of 2020, productivity increased at a 1.8% rate. 
Hours worked increased at a 6.0% rate last quarter, revised up from the 5.5% pace estimated last month.

The Commerce Department said on Thursday that the trade gap fell 4.3% to $70.1 billion. Data for June was revised to show the deficit at $73.2 billion instead of $75.7 billion as previously reported.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast a $71.0 billion deficit. Imports slipped 0.2% to $282.9 billion. Goods imports dropped 1.2% to $236.3 billion, likely restrained supply constraints. Demand is also rotating to services from goods amid vaccinations against COVID-19. 
Exports increased 1.3% to $212.8 billion in July. Goods exports shot up 1.8% to $148.6 billion.
If sustained, the narrowing trade deficit could see trade contributing to gross domestic product growth in the third quarter after being a drag on GDP for four straight quarters. 

But, with businesses desperate to rebuild inventories, which were depleted in the first half of the year, July's decline in goods imports could be temporary. 
Growth estimates for the third quarter are converging around a 5% annualized rate. The economy grew at a 6.6% pace in the second quarter.

1433,By Bloomberg,"<span>Sep 02, 2021 08:36AM ET</span>","U.S. Initial Jobless Claims Fell Last Week, Fresh Pandemic Low","(Bloomberg) -- Applications for U.S. state unemployment benefits fell last week to a fresh pandemic low amid a recovering economy.
Initial unemployment claims in regular state programs fell 14,000 to 340,000 in the week ended Aug. 28, Labor Department data showed Thursday. The median estimate in a Bloomberg survey of economists called for a slight decrease to 345,000 new applications.
Continuing claims for state benefits fell to 2.7 million in the week ended Aug. 21.
Initial claims have been drifting lower for months, thanks to the broader reopening of the economy and elevated demand for workers. Even so, claims remain elevated compared to pre-pandemic levels, and the fast-spreading delta variant has injected uncertainty into the economic outlook, posing a risk of future layoffs.
The recent surge in infections has already begun to impact consumer behavior. High-frequency data point to softening demand for services such as air travel, restaurant dining and hotel occupancy. Looking ahead, the fall season may bring labor disruptions as children across the country return to in-person schooling, especially in places with lower vaccination rates.
The claims data come just before the monthly jobs report out Friday, which is forecast to show 725,000 jobs were added in August.
Unadjusted initial claims in California, Illinois and Virginia saw the biggest decreases last week. Missouri and Ohio posted the largest increases.
Roughly half of states ended federal pandemic unemployment programs -- including an extra $300 weekly payment -- before their official Sept. 6 expiration date in hopes of spurring job creation. The White House has said it will not extend jobless aid further, but states can use pandemic relief funds to provide additional assistance to unemployed workers.

The European Union's statistics office Eurostat said prices at factory gates in the 19 countries sharing the euro rose 2.3% month-on-month for a 12.1% year-on-year surge. Economists polled by Reuters had expected a 1.1% monthly and an 11.0% annual rise.

1437,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 01, 2021 07:00PM ET</span>",Brazil GDP slips as second COVID-19 wave stalls recovery,"By Marcela Ayres and Camila Moreira
BRASILIA (Reuters) -Brazil's economy contracted slightly in the three months to June, government statistics agency IBGE said on Wednesday, stalling more than expected as a second wave of the pandemic hurt demand. 
The 0.1% decline in Brazil's gross domestic product from the prior quarter was worse than the median forecast for 0.2% growth in a Reuters poll and marked a sharp slowdown from 1.2% growth in the first quarter.
Brazil's economic rebound sputtered as a severe second wave of COVID-19 cases triggered restrictions in major cities during April and May, hurting household consumption and manufacturing.
Still, more government spending and services activity helped avoid a wider downturn, offsetting a drop in fixed investments and weaker agricultural output during a weak coffee harvest.
Inflation has also surged during the recovery, triggering aggressive interest rate hikes https://www.reuters.com/article/brazil-economy-rates-idUSL1N2PB39E by the central bank and weighing on the outlook for next year, when President Jair Bolsonaro faces an uphill battle to win re-election. 
Central bank chief Roberto Campos Neto told lawmakers the latest GDP data could lower the market consensus outlook for growth this year.
""With today's number, we think there may be a slight downward revision. Let's see,"" he told a congressional hearing.
However, the Economy Ministry's annual forecast is unlikely to change and Brazil's economy is still expected to grow more than 5% this year, Economic Policy Secretary Adolfo Sachsida told Reuters. 
As vaccination rates gather steam and coronavirus cases continue to fall, the 2021 growth outlook in a weekly central bank poll of economists climbed as high as 5.3% this month before settling at 5.2% in the latest poll.
""The pandemic is improving, opening up the economy, so the outlook is more positive in the third quarter and the end of year, if vaccination really advances,"" said Carlos Pedroso, chief economist at Banco MUFG Brasil.
However, he warned that a severe drought would continue to hurt agribusiness and raise the risk of energy rationing if reservoirs run dry at major hydropower plants.
Vice President Hamilton Mourao said on Wednesday that the drought, one of the worst in the past century, could lead to energy rationing, contradicting other officials https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/drought-may-force-brazil-ration-power-says-vice-president-mourao-2021-09-01.
Despite the stagnation in the second quarter, activity was 12.4% higher than a year earlier, when the onset of the pandemic hammered Brazil's economy. Economists had expected a 12.8% rise.
Resurgent demand, a weaker currency and soaring prices for commodities and energy have pushed 12-month inflation in Brazil to nearly 9%, forcing the central bank to make its biggest rate hike in 18 years and scrap an outlook for 'neutral' policy. 

Central bank sources have told Reuters they are aware that Bolsonaro has been unhappy about a recent law reinforcing the independence of the central bank, but he had not applied any direct pressure on monetary policy.
The bank's policymakers have also voiced indirect criticism of his efforts to raise public spending to win votes.

1438,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 01, 2021 12:11PM ET</span>",U.S. manufacturing activity rises; shortages linger,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON(Reuters) - U.S. manufacturing activity unexpectedly picked up in August amid strong order growth, but a measure of factory employment dropped to a nine-month low, likely as workers remained scarce.
The survey from the Institute for Supply Management (ISM) on Wednesday continued to highlight persistent problems securing enough raw materials, a situation worsened by disruptions caused by the latest wave of COVID-19 infections, primarily in Southeast Asia, as well as ports congestion in China.
""A surprising turn of events for manufacturing activity in the U.S., but it doesn't change the story of supply disruptions and shortages holding back stronger growth,"" said Jennifer Lee, a senior economist at BMO Capital Markets in Toronto.
The ISM said its index of national factory activity inched up to 59.9 last month from a reading of 59.5 in July. A reading above 50 indicates expansion in manufacturing, which accounts for 11.9% of the U.S. economy. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the index falling to 58.6. 
Manufacturing is holding up even as spending is rotating back to services from goods because of vaccinations against COVID-19. All of the six largest manufacturing industries, including computer and electronic products, chemical products and transportation equipment reported moderate to strong growth. 
Manufacturers of computer and electronic products said while a global semiconductor shortage was impacting supply lines, they had so far ""been able to manage it without impacting clients.""
Chemical goods producers said they continued to ""see extended lead times due to port delays and sea container tightness."" Transportation equipment makers reported that ""strong sales continue, but production is limited due to supply issues with chips."" 
The ISM survey's forward-looking new orders sub-index rebounded to a reading of 66.7 last month after two straight monthly declines. Fourteen out of 18 manufacturing industries, furniture and related products, machinery and electrical equipment, appliances and components reported growth in new orders. Only nonmetallic mineral products reported a drop.
Demand is being driven by businesses desperate to replenish stocks after inventories were drawn down sharply in the first half of the year. Inventory accumulation, which is expected to be the main driver of economic growth for the rest of this year and into 2022, has been frustrated by the supply constraints.
Stocks on Wall Street were trading higher. The dollar slipped against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices were mixed.
INFLATION ABATING
Scarce inputs have boosted prices for both manufacturers and consumers. But there appears to be light at the end of the tunnel. The ISM measure of delivery performance of suppliers to manufacturing organizations eased further in August, indicating some improvement in the pace of deliveries. 
The survey's measure of prices paid by manufacturers fell to an eight-month low of 79.4 from a reading of 85.7 in July. This measure has dropped from a record 92.1 in June. 
It was the latest indication that inflation has probably peaked. Data last week showed the Federal Reserve's preferred inflation measure recorded its smallest monthly gain in five months in July.
But worker shortages persist, with ISM chair Timothy Fiore highlighting ""a clear cycle of labor turnover as workers opt for more attractive job conditions."" 
A measure of factory employment contracted last month and fell to its lowest level since November. 
Together with the ADP National Employment Report, which showed on Wednesday that private payrolls increased by 374,000 jobs last month after rising 326,000 in July, the ISM factory index poses a downside risk to job growth in August. Economists had forecast the ADP report would show private payrolls increased by 613,000 jobs.
The ADP report is jointly developed with Moody's (NYSE:MCO) Analytics and was published ahead of the Labor Department's more comprehensive and closely watched employment report for August on Friday. But it has a dismal record predicting the private payrolls count in the department's Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) employment report because of methodology differences.
According to a Reuters survey of economists, nonfarm payrolls likely increased by 728,000 jobs last month after rising 943,000 in July.
""ADP is far from consistent in predicting changes in the BLS payrolls data,"" said Rubeela Farooqi, chief U.S. economist at High Frequency economics in White Plains, New York. ""Overall, job growth has strengthened in recent months, even as companies continue to report labor supply shortages."" 
The pandemic has upended the labor market dynamics, creating worker shortages even as 8.7 million people are officially unemployed. The were a record 10.1 million job openings at the end of June. Lack of affordable child care, fears of contracting the coronavirus, generous unemployment benefits funded by the federal government as well as pandemic-related retirements and career changes have been blamed for the disconnect. 
The labor shortage is expected to ease starting in September. The government-funded unemployment benefits lapse on Sept. 6 and schools are reopening for in-person learning. 

But the resurgence in new COVID-19 cases, driven by the Delta variant of the coronavirus, could cause reluctance among some people to return to the labor force.
The labor shortages led to a building up of the backlog of uncompleted work at factories in August.

The IHS Markit Canada Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) rose to a seasonally adjusted 57.2 in August from 56.2 in July. It was the PMI's highest level since April and the 14th straight month above the 50 threshold marking growth in the sector.
""Canada's manufacturing sector recorded another robust improvement in operating conditions in August,"" Shreeya Patel, an economist at IHS Markit, said in a statement.
""The latest uptick gained momentum from that seen in July after demand in both domestic and international markets rose further.""
The gauge of new orders advanced to 55.8 from 55.3 in July, while the stocks of purchases index was at 53.7, up from 52.8.
That marked the second-highest level of pre-production inventories in the near 11-year history of the survey as higher sales, freight delays and material shortages encouraged firms to raise the level of stocks they hold as a buffer.
Restrictions related to the coronavirus pandemic have contributed to bottlenecks globally.
The factory sector's main concern ""has been price and supply chain pressures which have often stemmed from material shortages,"" Patel said. ""With costs intensifying over the course of the month, prices look set to remain elevated for some time.""

The input prices index rose to a series high of 77.2 from 72.0 in July, while the measure of output prices was also elevated as firms passed on higher material and shipping prices to their clients.
Still, firms grew more upbeat about prospects for growth. The future output index climbed to 66.7 from 63.1 in July.

(Reuters) - Mortgage applications decreased last week in step with a drop in refinancing as mortgage rates remained unchanged.
The Mortgage Bankers Association (MBA) said on Wednesday its seasonally adjusted market composite index tracking mortgage applications fell 2.4% from a week earlier, reflecting a 3.8% decline in applications to refinance existing loans in the week ending Aug. 27. 
The average contract interest rate for traditional 30-year mortgages was unchanged at 3.03%. Purchase applications rose 0.6%, hitting the highest level since early July, the MBA said.

After hitting record lows at the end of 2020 below 2.9%, mortgage rates climbed in the first part of this year and peaked in the spring. Rates had been drifting lower since, held down in large part by the U.S. Federal Reserve's extraordinary stimulus measures aimed at helping the economy rebound from the novel coronavirus pandemic.
""Despite low rates, refinance applications declined, with some borrowers still waiting for rates to drop even lower,"" said Joel Kan, MBA’s associate vice president of economic and industry forecasting. ""Recent uncertainty around the economy and pandemic have kept rates low over the past month, which is why the refinance index has oscillated around these levels.""

LONDON (Reuters) -British house prices rebounded surprisingly strongly in August, chalking up their second-biggest monthly rise in 15 years after a fall the month before when a pandemic-era tax break began to be phased out.
Mortgage lender Nationwide Building Society said British house prices rose by 2.1% month on month in August after a 0.6% fall in July, well above economists' forecasts in a Reuters poll for a modest 0.2% increase.
Property purchases slumped in July when a year-long exemption from stamp duty for the first 500,000 pounds ($687,550) of a house purchase ended in England and Northern Ireland.
""The bounce back in August is surprising because it seemed more likely that the tapering of stamp duty relief in England at the end of June would take some of the heat out of the market,"" Nationwide chief economist Robert Gardner said.
But the pick-up in prices in August suggests the importance of other factors such as a shortage of houses and demand for more spacious accommodation suited to working from home, which have pushed up prices in Britain and in other countries.
""With the amount of second-hand stock on the market currently extremely limited, house prices could continue to surprise on the upside even after the stamp duty holiday takes a little heat out of demand,"" said Andrew Wishart, property economist at consultants Capital Economics.
House prices in August were 11.0% higher than a year ago, a bigger increase than the 10.5% rise Nationwide recorded in July and bucking economists' expectations in a Reuters poll for a slowdown to 8.6%.
Britain's official government house price index showed prices rose by 13.2% in the year to the end of June, the biggest annual rise since November 2004.
Demand for property priced 125,000-250,000 pounds, which still benefits from the tax break until the end of September, as well as lack of homes to buy, could be behind the rise, Nationwide said. 

Underlying demand was likely to remain strong in the short term but could weaken later when the stamp duty exemption ends and the government withdraws furlough support for workers who have been unable to work due to the pandemic, it added.

LONDON/TOKYO (Reuters) - Global factory activity lost momentum in August as the ongoing coronavirus pandemic-disrupted supply chains, raising concerns faltering manufacturing would add to economic woes caused by slumping consumption, surveys showed on Wednesday.
Many firms reported logistical troubles, product shortages and a labour crunch which have made it a sellers' market of the goods factories need, driving up prices.
While factory activity remained strong in the euro zone, IHS Markit's final manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) fell to 61.4 in August from July's 62.8, below an initial 61.5 ""flash"" estimate.
""Despite the strong PMI figures, we think that lingering supply-side issues and related producer price pressures might take longer to resolve than previously expected, increasing the downside risk to our forecast,"" said Mateusz Urban at Oxford Economics.
In Britain, where factories also faced disruptions, manufacturing output grew in August at the weakest rate for six months. The United States likely suffered a similar slowdown, data is expected to show later on Wednesday. [GB/PMIM]
Canada's economy unexpectedly shrank last quarter and in July, official data showed on Tuesday - hurt by decreases in manufacturing, construction and retail trade - and Australia reported slower growth in the second quarter on Wednesday.
CHINA BRAKES
Meanwhile, Southeast Asia - a low-cost manufacturing hub for many global companies - was hit particularly hard with factory activity shrinking in Vietnam, Indonesia and Malaysia because of virus outbreaks and output suspensions.
And in a worrying sign for the global economy, China's factory activity slipped into contraction in August for the first time in nearly 1-1/2 years as COVID-19 curbs, supply bottlenecks and high raw material prices weighed on output.
China's Caixin/Markit Manufacturing PMI fell to 49.2 in August, from 50.3 in July, breaching the 50-mark separating growth from contraction.
The result was well below market expectations, underscoring the fragile nature of China's recovery that had helped the global economy emerge from pandemic-induced doldrums.
The private survey followed an official PMI on Tuesday, which showed the index falling in August but staying above the 50 mark.
""The elephant in the room for the long North Asia, short ASEAN view is China. This morning, the Caixin Manufacturing PMI followed yesterday's official number South, falling under 50,"" said Jeffrey Halley at OANDA.
""That rounds out a grim week for China's PMIs as COVID-19 lockdowns and the same supply chain challenges the rest of the world is experiencing erode economic performance.""
Export power-houses Japan, South Korea and Taiwan also saw manufacturing activity expand at a slower pace in August, a sign chip shortages and factory shutdowns in the region could delay a sustained recovery from the pandemic-induced slump.
The surveys highlight the pandemic's broadening damage in Southeast Asia, where soaring infections and subsequent lockdown measures have hurt both the service and manufacturing sectors.
Delta variant outbreaks in the region have caused supply chain headaches for the world's largest manufacturers, many of which rely on auto parts and semiconductors made in low-cost bases such as Thailand, Vietnam and Malaysia.
""If the strict lockdown measures continue, Southeast Asia may find it hard to remain a global production hub,"" said Makoto Saito, an economist at NLI Research Institute.
Japan's PMI eased and new export orders posted their first contraction since January. South Korea's index fell to 51.2.
In Vietnam and Malaysia, activity was hurt by lockdown measures and rising infections that forced some factories to suspend operations. Vietnam saw factory activity shrink while Malaysia's PMI stood at 43.4 in August.

Once seen as a driver of global growth, Asia's emerging economies are lagging advanced economies in recovering from the pandemic's pain as delays in vaccine rollouts and a spike in Delta variant cases hurt consumption and factory production.
Growth in India's factory sector activity slowed as persistent pandemic-related weakness weighed on demand and output, forcing firms to cut jobs again following a brief recovery in July.

The IHS Markit/CIPS UK Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index fell to 60.3 last month from July's 60.4, slightly higher than a preliminary reading of 60.1. 
While still far above the 50 mark that denotes growth, the reading was again flattered by supply chain delays which in normal times reflect strong demand.
Global shipping problems, tight supplies of semiconductors and shortages of some goods such as motor vehicles have contributed to rising inflation in many countries - including in Britain.
Despite a healthy influx of new orders, IHS Markit's gauge of British factory output slid to its lowest level since February. The slowdown was evident especially in producers of intermediate goods, who often sit in the middle of supply chains.
Survey respondents said supplier delays had been caused by a shortage of materials, shipping delays, port bottlenecks, Brexit and a shortage of logistics industry staff - all contributing to rising costs.

Last month a separate survey of small- and medium-sized manufacturers showed nearly all are struggling with cost pressures.
Wednesday's survey showed manufacturers remained upbeat nevertheless, as the survey's gauge of future output rose to a three-month high.

Data compiler IHS Markit said its final manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) fell to 57.5 points from 58.0 in July – its lowest reading since February's 56.1.
The index was nevertheless slightly above a preliminary reading for August of 57.3 points and remained well above the 50 point line dividing expansions in activity from contractions.
""Economic conditions in France's manufacturing sector remain strong as we head towards the end of the third quarter, although further slowdowns in the rate of output and new order growth suggest we're well past the peak"" said IHS Markit senior economist Joe Hayes.
""Fears are however starting to mount as to when the material shortages, delivery delays and intense price pressures will take their toll,"" Hayes added.
A global semiconductor chip shortage has caused major delays to manufacturing, with automakers cutting down on production and electronic device makers struggling to keep up with a pandemic-led surge in demand for phones, TVs and gaming consoles.
The strained supply chains increasingly leave firms with little choice but to raise their prices.
Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said this week that the French economy was ""doing well"" thanks to a rise in consumer spending, even with restrictions still in place to tackle a fourth coronavirus wave in the country.

He said the aim now was for the euro zone's second-biggest economy to return to pre-COVID-19 growth levels by year-end.

1448,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 01, 2021 04:15AM ET</span>",Supply bottlenecks slow German factory growth to six-month low -PMI,"BERLIN (Reuters) - German manufacturers struggled to meet strong demand for industrial goods in August as supply shortages for raw materials and components such as semiconductors continued to hold back production and push up prices, a survey showed on Wednesday.
IHS Markit's final Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) for manufacturing, which accounts for about a fifth of Europe's biggest economy, fell to 62.6 from 65.9 in July.
That was the lowest in six months but still comfortably above the 50 mark that separates growth from contraction.
The German economy rebounded in the second quarter with a growth rate of 1.6% compared to the previous three months as an easing of COVID-19 curbs spurred consumers to dip into record savings piled up during the winter lockdown.
The government expects the economy to grow 3.5% this year and 3.6% next, though supply bottlenecks and rising COVID-19 cases are leading companies to take a dimmer view.
Corporate efforts to increase industrial production in light of vibrant demand were often hampered by supply shortages for basic materials and intermediate products, the survey showed.
""Growth in output has now fallen behind that of new orders to an extent previously unseen in over 25 years of data collection,"" IHS Markit economist Phil Smith said.
The supply bottlenecks led to rising backlogs of work, falling stock levels and acute price pressures across Germany's large manufacturing sector. Among the items most often reported by survey participants as having risen in price were aluminium, electronics, plastic, steel and timber.

The supply problems and related price pressures also clouded the outlook in manufacturing, with the sub-index on firms' optimism about future activity falling to its lowest level since last October, the survey showed.
""Still, many goods producers are hopeful that conditions will have improved come next summer, and a further steep rise in employment levels shows that efforts are still being made to expand capacity and prepare for higher output in the future,"" Smith said.

1449,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 01, 2021 04:06AM ET</span>","Euro zone Aug factory growth strong - as were price rises, PMI shows","LONDON (Reuters) - Euro zone manufacturing growth remained strong in August but supply chain issues caused by the coronavirus pandemic continued to constrain supplies of the raw materials factories need, driving up prices, a survey showed on Wednesday.
The easing of restrictions imposed to stop the coronavirus from spreading has driven demand but many firms have reported logistical troubles, product shortages and a labour crunch.
IHS Markit's final manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) fell to 61.4 in August from July's 62.8, below an initial 61.5 ""flash"" estimate.
An index measuring output, which feeds into a composite PMI due on Friday and seen as a good guide to economic health, fell from July's 61.1 to 59.0. Anything above 50 indicates growth.
""Euro zone manufacturers reported another month of buoyant production in August, continuing the growth spurt into its 14th successive month,"" said Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit.
""The overriding issue was again a lack of components, however, with suppliers either unable to produce enough parts or facing a lack of shipping capacity to meet logistics demand.""
An ongoing shortage of materials and a lack of transport availability meant sellers of the goods factories need were again able to ramp up their charges. The input prices index thus remained high at 87.0, although shy of July's record 89.2.
As a result, factories again sharply increased the prices they charge. 
Euro zone inflation surged to a 10-year high last month, official data showed on Tuesday, challenging the European Central Bank's benign view on price growth.

The ECB wants inflation at 2% but prices in the 19 countries sharing the euro rose 3.0% in August, fuelled by unusually large increases in the prices of industrial goods.
Despite those price rises, demand remained resilient and factories built up a backlog of work even though they increased headcount and depleted their stocks of finished goods.

The CBI said its monthly growth indicators, based on business surveys it conducted between July 27 and Aug. 17, rose to +34 from July's +33, driven by stronger growth in consumer services and retail. 
But manufacturing activity slowed, and most businesses expect a slower pace of growth over the next three months, in part due to supply-chain difficulties and a lack of workers.
""Evidence of labour shortages has been growing – in some cases, these shortages are having a material impact on operations. Meanwhile, disruption to global supply chains during the pandemic has led to sharp rises in material and shipping costs, adding further pressure,"" CBI economist Anna Leach said.

Leach said it was unclear how persistent the labour shortages and other disruption were likely to be. 
Changes to COVID self-isolation rules - which had required hundreds of thousands of workers to stay at home in July and August - were likely to help, and there still remained many people who had lost work in the pandemic, she said.

The BRC's measure of shop price inflation - unlike most other inflation measures - is typically negative. July's reading showed a fall of 1.2% and the average annual decline over the past 12 months was 1.5%.
""There are some modest indications that rising costs are starting to filter through into product prices,"" BRC chief executive Helen Dickinson said.
Price rises were most noticeable for electrical goods due to global shipping delays and a shortage of microchips, she said.

Food prices were also likely to rise over the coming months due to rising commodity prices, increased transport costs reflecting a shortage of truck drivers, and greater post-Brexit costs for importing food from the European Union, she added.
""Disruption has been limited so far, but in the run up to Christmas the situation could get worse, and customers may see reduced choice and increased prices for their favourite products and presents,"" she said.

The Federal Statistics Office said retail sales dropped 5.1% on the month in real terms after a revised jump of 4.5% in June and an increase of 4.6% in May. The July reading missed a Reuters forecast for a fall of 0.9%.
The monthly comparison was distorted heavily by the lifting of COVID-19 restrictions on shopping in most parts of the country in June, the statistics office said.
Retail sales - a volatile indicator often subject to revisions - edged down by 0.3% in real terms year on year, it added. Compared with February 2020, the month before the coronavirus crisis hit Germany, retail sales were up 3.8%.
The German economy returned to growth in the second quarter but bounced back less strongly than other euro zone countries as supply chain bottlenecks slowed industrial output.
Supply problems with raw materials and intermediate goods, coupled with rising COVID-19 cases because of the more contagious Delta variant, are driving companies to take a dimmer view of the coming months.

Bankhaus Lampe analyst Alexander Krueger believes that retail sales are likely to recover in the comings months, with the labour market strong and more companies scaling back short-time work schemes introduced during the pandemic.
However, overall support for the economy from household spending could be less strong in the third quarter than many had hoped for, he added.

New home prices in 100 cities climbed 0.2% in August from a month earlier, slowing from a 0.35% gain in July, according to data from China Index Academy, one of the country's largest independent real estate research firms. 
Authorities have stepped up efforts to rein in housing prices this year with measures such as restrictions on home purchases and higher mortgage rates. 
The southern city of Guangzhou on Tuesday introduced a pricing reference for resale homes to curb its red-hot market. Around 10 cities including Shanghai and Shenzhen have already implemented similar pricing systems. 
""In the third and fourth quarter, property control measures will continue to be refined, and become more comprehensive and frequent, to plug any (policy) loopholes,"" said Cao Jingjing, research director at China Index Academy.
Prices in the biggest tier-one cities such as Shanghai and Beijing rose the slowest, compared with price growth in tier-two cities and even smaller cities, up 0.11% versus July's 0.54% growh.
The slowdown in tier-1 cities was mainly due to control policies in those markets and COVID-19 related measures in Shanghai due to a recent outbreak in the financial hub, said Cao. 
On an annual basis, China's new home prices grew 3.51% in August, slowing from July's 3.81% increase, the slowest clip since December 2020. 

Land sales to developers by floor space declined 32% in August from a month earlier, and fell 42% on an annual basis, according to separate data from the group.

IHS Markit's Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) for the sector fell to 46.5 from July's 47.5, slipping further below the 50.0 mark that separates expansion from contraction.
""Russian manufacturers saw the health of the sector continue on a downward trajectory during August, as demand conditions weakened further. Total sales fell at a quicker pace amid worsening domestic and foreign customer demand,"" said Sian Jones, an economist at IHS Markit, which compiles the survey.
New orders decreased at the fastest pace since November, while total sales were dampened by weaker foreign customer demand, which showed its sharpest fall since May 2020. 
Employment fell for a third consecutive month as some firms did not replace voluntary leavers. 
""Cost cutting efforts were also reflected in a sharp drop in input buying,"" Jones said.

Average cost burdens rose once again in August albeit at the slowest pace for almost a year, as the surveyed companies cited higher supplier charges and raw materials shortages.
Russian goods producers remained optimistic about the coming year, however, betting on a recovery in demand in coming months.

Data on Tuesday showed Asia's third-largest economy grew by a record annual pace of 20.1% last quarter, driven by a surge in manufacturing and a strong rebound in consumer spending, but spiking infections from the Delta variant of the coronavirus and slow vaccination rates in some states are likely to hurt growth.
The Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index, compiled by IHS Markit, fell from July's three-month high of 55.3 to 52.3 in August, but stayed above the 50-level that separates growth from contraction on a monthly basis.
Although new orders and output expanded for a second month, growth slowed sharply in August.
""August saw a continuation of the Indian manufacturing sector recovery, but growth lost momentum as demand showed some signs of weakness due to the pandemic,"" said Pollyanna De Lima, economics associate director at IHS Markit.
""Uncertainty regarding growth prospects, spare capacity and efforts to keep a lid on expenses led to a hiring freeze in August."" 
Employment slipped back into contractionary territory in August after growing in July for the first time in 16 months, indicating the job market is far from pre-pandemic levels.
Shortages of raw materials and higher freight fees continued to put pressure on input costs, forcing firms to increase prices at the fastest pace since May, indicating inflation would remain elevated.
However, that was not expected to prompt the Reserve Bank of India to tighten monetary policy, as support for economic growth continues to be the central bank's main priority.

Still, optimism weakened in August as companies were concerned about inflation and the pandemic's lingering impact. 
""The 12-month outlook for production remained positive, though confidence faded amid worries concerning the lasting scars of the pandemic and the adverse impact of rising costs,"" added De Lima.

Investing.com – China’s factory activity entered contraction territory for the first time in nearly one-and-a-half years in August. Lockdown measures to contain the latest COVID-19 outbreak, supply bottlenecks and high raw material prices all contributed to a slowdown in the world’s second-largest economy’s recovery.
The Caixin manufacturing purchasing managers index (PMI), released earlier in the day, was at 49.2, below the 50-mark indicating growth. Forecasts prepared by Investing.com had predicted a 50.2 reading, while July’s number was 50.3.
Just the day before, the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) released data that showed the manufacturing PMI at 50.1 and the non-manufacturing PMI at 47.5, in August.
Whilst the strict lockdowns, imposed as part of China’s ‘zero-COVID-19-cases’ goal, were successful in curbing the latest outbreak across several provinces, it also had an economic impact.
""The latest COVID-19 outbreak posed a severe challenge to the economic normalization that began in the second quarter of 2020,"" Caixin Insight Group senior economist Wang Zhe said in comments released alongside the data.
The COVID-19 restrictions also led to dampened demand and sourcing difficulties, including a chips shortage that also impacted the manufacturing sector.
""Due to the lack of chips this year, the demand for auto parts has decreased. Our factory has been continuously reducing production, and in July and August, I heard that some factories stopped production. At the moment, it looks like chips will continue to be in short supply,"" an auto parts exporter surnamed Huang told Reuters.
The slowdown in the manufacturing sector also highlighted the fragility of the ongoing economic recovery. Expectations are now growing that China will introduce further support measures to get the recovery back on track.
The Caixin services PMI is due on Friday."

The slowdown in the manufacturing sector underscores the fragility of the ongoing economic recovery and the impact of strict coronavirus curbs in the country, backing expectations Beijing will roll out more support measures to revitalise growth.
Two separate official surveys released on Tuesday showed China's factory activity grew at a slower pace, while the services sector slumped into contraction.
The Caixin/Markit Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) fell to 49.2 last month, from 50.3 in July, breaching the 50-mark that separates growth from contraction. 
The result was well below expectations by analysts polled by Reuters, who had forecast the index at 50.2. New export orders tumbled into contraction for the first time since February, while factories laid off more workers than they hired.
The strict lockdown measures of China's ""zero-cases"" approach to COVID-19 controls successfully squashed an outbreak of the more infectious Delta variant across several provinces in August, but also hit economic activity.
""The latest COVID-19 resurgence has posed a severe challenge to the economic normalization that began in the second quarter of last year,"" said Wang Zhe, senior economist at Caixin Insight Group, in comments released alongside the data.
Many analysts expect the central bank to deliver a further cut to the amount of cash banks must hold as reserves later this year to lift growth, on top of July's cut which released around 1 trillion yuan ($6.47 trillion) in long-term liquidity into the economy.
A sub-index for production fell to 47.7, the slowest pace of expansion since February last year at the height of the pandemic, while another sub-index for new orders slipped to 48.0.
Companies reported COVID-19 restrictions had dampened demand and led to sourcing difficulties.
A shortage of chips has also been crimping manufacturing. 
""Due to the lack of chips this year, the demand for auto parts has decreased,"" said an auto parts exporter in eastern China's Suzhou surnamed Huang.
""Our factory has been continuously reducing production, and in July and August, I heard that some factories stopped production. At the moment it looks like chips will continue to be in short supply,"" he said.

An index of confidence in the year ahead stood steady. Input and output prices continued to rise and at a faster pace.

1458,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 31, 2021 09:54PM ET</span>",Australia Economy Expands Faster Than Expected on Households,"(Bloomberg) -- Australia’s economy expanded faster than expected last quarter as strong household and government spending outweighed a drop in export volumes, underscoring the central bank’s view that it entered a renewed lockdown with solid momentum.
Gross domestic product rose 0.7% in the three months through June from the prior quarter, when it advanced an upwardly revised 1.9%, Australian Bureau of statistics data showed Wednesday. Economists had forecast a 0.4% gain. From the year earlier period, when GDP tumbled in response to Covid lockdowns, the economy expanded 9.6% versus a forecast 9.1%.
GDP was underpinned by “continued growth across household spending, private investment and public sector expenditure,” Michael Smedes, head of National Accounts at the ABS, said in a statement. “Lockdowns had minimal impact on domestic demand, with fewer lockdown days and the prolonged stay at home orders in New South Wales only commencing later in the quarter.”
The Australian dollar was little changed after the release, trading at 73.13 U.S. cents at 11:47 a.m. in Sydney.
The result underscores Australia’s powerful rebound from the virus through the first part of the year, when it recouped output and employment lost during 2020’s lockdowns. That recovery is under threat from an outbreak of delta that started in Sydney -- now in its 10th week of lockdown. Infections have spread along the populous east coast, forcing shutdowns across the economy, as in many countries around Asia.
Today’s report showed:
The data, even more than normal, is a look at the economy through the rearview mirror given that Australia’s two largest cities are in lockdown. Sydney and Melbourne, when combined with their surrounding states, account for more than half of the nation’s GDP.
Australia’s labor market had been tightening rapidly until the delta outbreak The jobless rate dropped to 4.6% in July, the lowest level since 2008, though that was largely due to a fall in participation as Sydneysiders were unable to hunt for work. 
Unemployment is expected to rise in coming months due to the restrictions imposed to combat Covid.
On a more positive note, in response to the worsening outbreak, authorities have ramped up vaccinations as they seek to emulate northern hemisphere counterparts in trying to navigate an approach to living with the virus.
The central bank has so far maintained that Australia’s economy will bounce back rapidly from the latest outbreak, as it did in 2020. However, the prolonged duration of lockdowns and the likelihood that the virus won’t be suppressed quickly could cast doubt on such an outcome

SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea's exports accelerated in August, towed by solid demand for memory chips, petrochemicals and other major items, with the trade ministry seeing only a limited impact from the coronavirus Delta variant across the region.
Exports rose 34.9% in August from a year earlier, accelerating from 29.6% in July but falling short of 35.7% growth predicted in a Reuters survey.
Imports soared 44.0% from a year earlier, the fastest growth since May 2010 and quicker than a 38.1% rise in July. That brought the trade balance to a $1.67 billion surplus.
Breakdown of Wednesday's data showed exports of semiconductors, petrochemicals and cars jumped 43.0%, 81.5% and 16.9%, respectively, while those of wireless devices, biohealth products and secondary batteries soared 62.2%, 17.1% and 10.9%, respectively.
By destination, overall exports to China, the United States and European Union rose 26.8%, 38.1% and 41.6%, respectively.
""Despite concerns about production disruptions due to the spread of the recent Delta variant ... its impact on exports is seen limited so far,"" the ministry said in a statement.
""As the global Delta variant spread and shipping delay remain as risks, however, the ministry will make all-out efforts to sustain the export momentum in the second half of the year.""
South Korea has been setting record numbers of COVID-19 cases in the past weeks, even as tighter curbs were enforced to prevent the spread of the Delta variant during its peak summer holiday season.
A separate survey on Wednesday showed factory activity grew at a slower pace last month, as output contracted for the first time in 12 months and demand eased on surging virus infections and supply chain disruptions.

To support the pandemic-hit economy, the government on Tuesday unveiled a record 604.4 trillion won ($521.21 billion) budget plan for next year.

The IHS Markit purchasing managers' index (PMI) for August stood at 51.2, falling from 53.0 in July but staying above the 50 threshold, which indicates expansion in activity, for an 11th straight month.
""A renewed rise in virus infections and severe, sustained supply chain disruptions, notably in the key semiconductor market, dampened operating conditions,"" said Usamah Bhatti, economist at IHS Markit.
That resulted in a contraction in output levels, while the resurgence in coronavirus across the wider region partially offset solid demand from key export markets such as the United States and Japan, Bhatti added.
The sub-index for output stood at 49.1, ending the 11th consecutive month of expansion, and falling from 53.5 a month earlier.
Total new orders rose further last month, but at the softest pace in 10 months, while export orders growth also eased as the highly contagious Delta variant and related curbs dented global demand.
Still, firms were seen raising staffing levels for another month in preparation of incoming orders in the second half of the year.
Meanwhile, the survey signalled further rises in average cost burdens at South Korean manufacturers on continued raw material shortages, which led to higher output prices.
""Firms commonly noted that global shortages of raw materials and freight capacity, notably in the semiconductor market had led to weaker readings across the majority of indices,"" Bhatti said.

""Yet businesses remained confident that this would pass, and activity would rise over the next 12 months.""
The sub-index for future output, which indicates business confidence, rose to 61.2 in August from 59.5 in July, on hopes of a wider economic recovery from the pandemic and that supply chain bottlenecks would ease.

Manufacturers withstood the pandemic's hit in part thanks to their positive outlook for the coming twelve months, even as the highly infectious COVID-19 Delta variant is pushing countries in Asia-Pacific back into lockdown mode.
The final au Jibun Bank Japan Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) in August eased to 52.7 on a seasonally adjusted basis from 53.0 in the previous month, and up slightly from a 52.4 flash reading.

""Severe supply chain disruption partly caused by pandemic restrictions and raw material shortages remained a dampener on production and orders.""
The PMI survey showed that overall new orders expanded at their slowest pace since January, while new export orders posted their first contraction since that month.
Overall output saw a rise, but its pace eased from the prior month as the intensifying health crisis and a lack of raw materials weighed on production.
The survey also showed output for intermediate goods grew at their fastest pace in four-and-a-half years, offsetting weaker demand for investment and consumer products.

Input prices maintained a sustained increase, while companies' expectations for the year ahead remained firm, though they eased to the softest since January.
""Though still optimistic, Japanese goods producers were wary of the continued impact of the pandemic and supply chain disruption,"" said Bhatti.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australian home prices rose at the fastest annual pace since 1989 in August as coronavirus lockdowns weighed more on supply than demand, though months of blistering gains are increasingly putting housing beyond the reach of many.
Data from property consultant CoreLogic out on Wednesday showed national home prices climbed 1.5% in August, even as the spread of the Delta variant shut Sydney and Melbourne.
Values were up an eye-watering 18.4% on last year, the biggest gain since July 1989, with houses surging 20.8% amid a pandemic-driven shift to working from home.
The boom has been a key support for household wealth and consumer confidence. The Australian Bureau of Statistics estimates the value of homes rose a record A$450 billion in the March quarter alone to reach A$8.3 trillion ($6.09 trillion).
However, it also means homes are becoming increasingly unaffordable.
""Housing prices have risen almost 11 times faster than wages growth over the past year, creating a more significant barrier to entry for those who don't yet own a home,"" said CoreLogic's research director, Tim Lawless.
He noted national home values had risen by roughly A$103,400 in the past year, or A$1,990 per week, far beyond average annual wage growth of 1.7%.
While lockdowns had some impact on auctions and sales, they also constrained the supply of listed homes. As a result, prices in Sydney still rose 1.8% in August to a median A$1.04 million, with Melbourne up 1.2%
""We are still seeing a disconnect between advertised supply and housing demand, which is keeping upwards pressure on prices despite challenges faced by both buyers and sellers,"" said Lawless.
Cities with few restrictions fared even better, with Brisbane rising 2.0% and Adelaide 1.9%.

Buyers have been encouraged by the outlook for super-low borrowing costs, with the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) saying rates were likely to remain at just 0.1% until 2024.
Regulators, however, have been warning banks not to loosen lending standards and analysts suspect they could tighten loan rules in coming months if the market remains this hot.

1463,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 31, 2021 03:11PM ET</span>","Surging COVID-19 cases dampen U.S. consumer confidence, house prices post record gains","By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. consumer confidence fell to a six-month low in August as worries about soaring COVID-19 infections and higher inflation dimmed the outlook for the economy.
The survey from the Conference Board on Tuesday showed consumers less inclined to buy a home and big-ticket items like motor vehicles and major household appliances over the next six months, supporting the view that consumer spending will cool in the third quarter after two straight quarters of robust growth.
Still, more consumers planned to go on vacation, indicating a rotation in spending from goods to services was underway as economic activity continues to normalize following the upheaval caused by the coronavirus pandemic. Increased spending on services, which account for the bulk of economic activity, should keep a floor under consumer spending.
""The report does raise the warning flag that if the pandemic worsens, and given the continued unwillingness of many to get vaccinated that is a real possibility, we could see people stashing away funds just in case,"" said Joel Naroff, chief economist at Naroff Economics in Holland, Pennsylvania. ""We could see growth moderate faster than expected.""
The Conference Board's consumer confidence index dropped to a reading of 113.8 this month, the lowest since February, from 125.1 in July. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the index falling to 124.0. The cutoff for the survey was Aug. 25, before the killing of 13 service members in Afghanistan and Hurricane Ida slammed Louisiana.
The measure, which places more emphasis on the labor market, held up well compared to other surveys. The University of Michigan's survey of consumers showed sentiment tumbling to near decade lows in August because of rising prices for goods like food and gasoline, as well as the resurgence in COVID-19 cases that has been driven by the Delta variant of the coronavirus.
""While the resurgence of COVID-19 and inflation concerns have dampened confidence, it is too soon to conclude this decline will result in consumers significantly curtailing their spending in the months ahead,"" said Lynn Franco, senior director of economic indicators at the Conference Board in Washington.
Consumers' inflation expectations over the next 12 months rose to 6.8% from 6.6% last month. There are signs, however, that price pressures have peaked, with data last week showing the Federal Reserve's preferred inflation measure posting its smallest gain in five months in July.
Wall Street's main indexes hovered near record highs. The dollar was steady against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices were lower.
LABOR MARKET HOLDING UP
The Conference Board's so-called labor market differential, derived from data on respondents' views on whether jobs are plentiful or hard to get, slipped to a still-high reading of 42.8 this month from 44.1 in July, which was the highest since July 2000.
This measure closely correlates to the unemployment rate in the Labor Department's closely watched employment report.
""It continues to send a pretty favorable signal about labor market conditions,"" said Daniel Silver, an economist at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) in New York.
Nonfarm payrolls likely increased by 750,000 in August after rising 943,000 in July, according to a Reuters survey of economists. The unemployment rate is forecast falling to 5.2% from 5.4% last month.
Though fewer households intended to buy long-lasting manufactured goods such as motor vehicles and household appliances like washing machines and clothes dryers this month, more expected to travel domestically, with many intending to fly to their destinations. 
Households accumulated at least $2.5 trillion in excess savings during the pandemic, laying a strong foundation for consumer spending. Gross domestic product growth estimates for the third quarter are around a 5% annualized rate. The economy grew at a 6.6% pace in the second quarter.
The Conference Board survey also showed less enthusiasm among consumers for home purchases over the next six months amid higher house prices, which are sidelining some first-time buyers from the market. 
Demand for housing soared early in the pandemic as Americans sought more spacious accommodations for home offices and home schooling, but supply severely lagged, fueling house price growth. COVID-19 vaccinations have allowed some employers to recall workers to offices. Schools and universities have reopened for in-person learning. 
A separate report on Tuesday showed the S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller national home price index jumped a record 18.6% in June from a year ago after rising 16.8% in May. Economists, however, believe that house price inflation has peaked, with homes becoming less affordable especially for first-time buyers.

""Some early data suggests that the buyer frenzy experienced this spring is tapering, though many buyers still remain in the market,"" said Selma Hepp, deputy chief economist at CoreLogic. ""Nevertheless, less competition and more for-sale homes suggest we may be seeing the peak of home price acceleration. Going forward, home price growth may ease off but stay in the double digits through year-end.""
A third report from the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) showed its house price index rose a record 18.8% in the 12 months through June. House prices surged 17.4% in the second quarter compared to the same period in 2020. FHFA believes house prices peaked in June.

SANTIAGO (Reuters) - The Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean (ECLAC) has adjusted upwards its economic growth forecast for the region this year to 5.9%, as expectations improve for a global recovery following the COVID-19 pandemic. 
The United Nations body had projected an expansion in the region's gross domestic product (GDP) of 5.2% at the start of July, but said the panorama was looking brighter amid the gradual reopening of economies and relaxation of sanitary measures around the region. 
ECLAC warned however that a better performance this year would still not see countries in the region returning to pre-pandemic levels of economic activity and that longer term growth remained uncertain, given the uneven progress of the COVID-19 vaccination roll-out in Latin America.
It also said some economies had structural problems that had hindered sound growth even before the pandemic. 
Private consumption will be the biggest driver of growth in 2021 and 2022, representing more than half of the increase in economic activity, ECLAC said. 
Public consumption would play a lesser role, it said, since the extraordinary measures implemented by governments to combat the pandemic mostly consisted of direct cash transfers to households ""that for accounting purposes are reflected in an increase in private consumption.""

ECLAC adjusted its 2021 projection for Brazil's economy upwards to 5.2% from 4.5% previously and that of Mexico to 6.2% from the previous projection of 5.8%. 
The agency maintained its projection for 2022 regional growth at 2.9%.

1465,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 31, 2021 11:30AM ET</span>","Euro zone inflation surges to 10-year-high, in headache for ECB","FRANKFURT (Reuters) -Euro zone inflation surged to a 10-year-high in August with further rises likely, challenging the European Central Bank's benign view on price growth and its commitment to look past what it deems a temporary increase.
Consumer inflation in the 19 countries sharing the single currency accelerated to 3% this month from 2.2% in July, far above expectations for 2.7% and moving well clear of the ECB's 2% target. 
The increase was fuelled by energy costs, but food prices also surged, while there were unusually large increases in the prices of industrial goods too, according to Eurostat, the EU's statistics agency. 
Markets mostly shrugged off the data, with stocks rising and yields increasing just a basis point or two, suggesting the narrative of temporary inflation and ultra-easy central bank policy for years to come remains the central one. 
Still, the numbers are likely to make for uncomfortable reading at the ECB.
The central bank has repeatedly raised its inflation projection this year only for the actual numbers to beat its forecasts, and price growth now seems likely to peak only in November. 
With inflation in Germany, the euro zone's largest economy and the ECB's biggest critic, expected to approach 5% in coming months, the bank is likely to come under increasing public pressure to address price developments that are reviving long-dormant memories of runaway prices.
ONE-OFF FACTORS?
The ECB argues that a slew of one-off factors including production bottlenecks related to the economy's reopening after the COVID-19 pandemic account for the bulk of the inflation surge, and that price growth will quickly moderate early next year.
""The effects of re-opening and supply problems could intensify in the next few months. But we suspect that they will begin to fade next year as global consumption and trade patterns return to something like their pre-pandemic norms,"" Capital Economics said in a note. 
""We think the headline rate will drop to about 2% in January and trend down throughout 2022 to end next year at around 1%,"" it added.
Longer-term market based inflation expectations [EUIL5YF5Y=R] are also holding well below 2%, even if they have moved steadily higher this year. 
ECB policymakers agree and predict that inflation will languish well below the bank's target for years to come, so they even reinforced their commitment last month to keeping monetary policy exceptionally loose to generate price pressures.
Speaking to Reuters last week, ECB chief economist Philip Lane argued that these inflation surprises still did not challenge his views about the temporary nature of price pressures as wage growth, a necessary component of durable inflation, remained muted.
While ECB policymakers are acknowledging that they underestimated price pressures in the near term, they continue to point to weak underlying inflation readings as supporting evidence for loose policy.
Core inflation, however, also surged in August with inflation excluding volatile food and fuel prices accelerating to 1.6% from 0.9%, while an even narrower measure that also excludes alcohol and tobacco, rose to 1.6% from 0.7%.
The ECB will next meet on Sept. 9 and must decide on the pace of its bond purchases over the coming quarter. While some adjustment is possible, Lane argued that it would be at the margins as the ECB is committed to maintaining ""favourable financing conditions"".

After Tuesday's reading, not all observers are quite so sanguine.
""This is not to say that there is no upside risk to the inflation outlook,"" ING economist Bert Colijn said. ""So hold tight: inflation has the potential to go higher from here.""

(Reuters) -U.S. single-family home prices in 20 key urban markets rose in June from a year earlier at the fastest pace on record, a closely watched survey showed on Tuesday.
The S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller composite index of 20 metropolitan areas gained 19.1% through the 12 months ended in June from an upwardly revised 17.1% in the 12 months through May, marking the largest annual price increase in the survey's two decades. A Reuters poll of economists had forecast an increase of 18.5%. 
On a month-to-month basis, the 20-city composite index rose 1.8% from May, in line with estimates from economists polled by Reuters. 
Among the 20 cities, Phoenix, San Diego, and Seattle reported the largest year-over-year gains in June.
A separate report from the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) on Tuesday showed its house price index rose a record 18.8% in the 12 months through June. House prices surged 17.4% in the second quarter compared to the same period in 2020.
The FHFA's index is calculated by using purchase prices of houses financed with mortgages sold to or guaranteed by mortgage finance companies Fannie Mae and  Freddie Mac  (OTC:FMCC).
Home prices have surged this year as a result of limited supply and increased demand from potential buyers seeking to enter the market. In comparison to the run-up prior to the 2007-2009 financial crisis, the current boom does not include a frenzy of speculators and buyers with low credit scores purchasing homes and trying to flip them. 
""Today’s S&P Case Shiller Index spotlights a hot summer’s housing market, where buyers prepared with cash for down payments and low interest rate loans placed competing bids for an evaporating supply of homes available for sale and drove prices higher,"" said George Ratiu, manager of economic research for Realtor.com.

Contracts to purchase previously owned homes declined for the second consecutive month in July in step with limited supply that's been unable to match demand from potential homebuyers, the National Association of Realtors (NAR) said on Monday.
""Rising prices during summer months reflected a combination of peak demand and larger homes for sale, as families with school-age children competed to secure a place for the new school year,"" Ratiu said. ""In a noticeable shift, July saw real estate markets welcome a larger influx of new listings, as homeowners across the country decided to move on with pandemic-delayed plans to sell.""

1467,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 31, 2021 07:06AM ET</span>","China's economy under pressure as factory activity slows in Aug, services contract","By Gabriel Crossley
BEIJING (Reuters) - China's businesses and the broader economy came under increasing pressure in August as factory activity expanded at a slower pace while the services sector slumped into contraction, raising the likelihood of more near-term policy support to boost growth. 
The world's second-biggest economy staged an impressive recovery from a coronavirus-battered slump, but momentum has weakened recently due to domestic COVID-19 outbreaks, high raw material prices, slowing exports, tighter measures to tame hot property prices and a campaign to reduce carbon emissions.
The official manufacturing Purchasing Manager's Index (PMI) fell to 50.1 in August from 50.4 in July, data from the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) showed on Tuesday, holding just above the 50-point mark that separates growth from contraction.
Analysts polled by Reuters had expected it to slip to 50.2.
""The worse-than-expected August PMIs add conviction to our view that the growth slowdown in H2 could be quite notable,"" Nomura economists wrote in a note.
""We expect Beijing to maintain its policy combination of 'targeted tightening' for a few sectors, especially the property sector and high-polluting industries, complemented by 'universal easing' for the rest of the economy.""
Nomura is not alone in its views as many other analysts also expect the central bank to deliver a further cut to the amount of cash banks must hold as reserves later this year to lift growth, on top of last month's cut which released around 1 trillion yuan ($6.47 trillion) in long-term liquidity into the economy.
The manufacturing PMI showed demand slipped sharply, with new orders contracting and a gauge for new export orders falling to 46.7, the lowest in over a year. Factories also laid off workers, at the same pace as July.
SERVICES SECTOR DOWNTURN
Adding to signs of a broadening economic slowdown, COVID-19-related restrictions drove services sector activity into sharp contraction for the first time since the height of the pandemic in February last year.
The official non-manufacturing PMI in August was 47.5, well down from July's 53.3, data from the NBS showed.
""The latest surveys suggest that China's economy contracted (in August) as virus disruptions weighed heavily on services activity. Industry also continued to come off the boil as supply chain bottlenecks worsened and demand softened,"" said Julian Evans-Pritchard, senior China economist at Capital Economics, in a note.
While most of the weakness should reverse with relaxing COVID-19 restrictions, tight credit conditions and weakening foreign demand will continue to weigh on China's economy, he said. 
""This epidemic in multiple provinces and locations was a fairly big shock to the services industry, which is still in recovery,"" said Zhao Qinghe, of the NBS.
Catering, transportation, accommodation and entertainment industries were most affected, said Zhao. Construction activity accelerated to the fastest pace since March.
There are signs China may have largely contained the latest coronavirus outbreaks, with zero locally transmitted cases reported on Aug 30., for the third day in a row.
But it spurred authorities across the country to impose measures including mass testing for millions of people as well as travel restrictions of varying degrees and port shutdowns.
Meishan terminal at China's Ningbo port resumed operations in late August after shutting down for two weeks due to a COVID-19 case. The closure caused logjams at ports across the country's coastal regions and further strained global supply chains amid a resurgence of consumer spending and a shortage of container vessels.

Higher raw material prices, especially of metals and semiconductors, have also pressured profits. Earnings at China's industrial firms in July slowed for the fifth straight month.
The official August composite PMI, which includes both manufacturing and services activity, fell to 48.9 from July's 52.4.

The Labour Office said the number of people out of work fell by 53,000 in seasonally adjusted terms to 2.538 million. A Reuters poll had forecast a fall of 40,000.
""""A decline in August is rather unusual. It is remarkable,"" Labour Office head Detlef Scheele told journalists at a news conference, adding that unemployment usually rises in summer as companies postpone hiring until after the holidays.
The seasonally-adjusted jobless rate fell to 5.5%, the lowest since March 2020, when Germany entered its first coronavirus lockdown.
The number of employees put on reduced working hours in job protection schemes, also known as Kurzarbeit, also declined, Scheele said, expecting the figure to drop to one million soon, after peaking at around 6 million in April 2020.

Companies have become more active in recruitment in August especially in the electric and mechanical engineering sector, data by the Munich-based Ifo institute showed last week.
Coronavirus cases have been rising in Germany since July, but the number of deaths has fallen with more than half of the population fully vaccinated, pushing the government to stop using the coronavirus infection rate as its yardstick for deciding on restrictions.

The euro zone's second-biggest economy grew 1.1% in the three months to the end of June after showing no growth the previous three months, INSEE said, revising the second quarter rate up from 0.9%.
The increase leaves the economy 3.2% below pre-crisis levels reached at the end of 2019, a gap the government expects to be closed before the end of this year.
Activity recovered quickly in the second half of the second quarter as the economy emerged from lockdown and a vaccination programme gained speed.
Consumer spending, the traditional motor behind the French economy, rose 1.0% in the second quarter while business investment was up 1.9%, INSEE said.

However, consumer spending got off to a soft start in the third quarter with monthly data for July from INSEE showing that it fell 2.2% from June, more than the 0.5% fall expected on average in a Reuters poll of economists' expectations. 
The government expects the economy to grow 6% this year after contracting 8.0% last year.

Retail sales in July rose 2.9% from a year earlier to HK$27.2 billion ($3.50 billion), government data showed on Tuesday. July's increase compared with 5.8% growth in June.
""The electronic consumption vouchers that the government began to disburse in August have helped stimulate consumption sentiment and will render support to the retail business in the rest of the year,"" a government spokesman said, referring to electronic vouchers given to certain consumers to spend in retail stores.
In volume terms, retail sales in July grew 0.9% from a year earlier, compared with a revised 2.9% surge the previous month.
For the first seven months of 2021, total retail sales increased 7.6% in value terms and rose 6.2% in volume.
Online retail sales in July jumped 29.0% in value year-on-year, compared with a revised growth of 64.0% in June.
Sales of jewellery, watches, clocks and valuable gifts, which before the pandemic relied heavily on Chinese tourists from the mainland, climbed 27.1% in July versus a revised 31.9% surge in June, the data showed.
Clothing, footwear and allied products rose 30.6% in July.
Tourist arrivals in July plunged 57.9% from a year earlier to 8,666 after posting a 57.6% drop in June. 
""It is essential for the community to keep the epidemic under control and strive towards more widespread vaccination, so as to strengthen the foundation for continued recovery of the retail sector and the overall economy,"" the spokesman added. 
Hong Kong's economy grew a revised 7.6% in the second quarter from a COVID-induced slump a year earlier and the government upgraded its growth forecast for 2021 to 5.5%-6.5% from 3.5%-5.5%.

Seasonally adjusted unemployment slipped to 5% in the May-July quarter, the lowest since the January-March period in 2020, as private consumption expenditure improved. That was compared with 5.5% in the April-June period.

INSEE said its index of EU-harmonised consumer prices rose 0.7% from July, giving a 12-month inflation rate of 2.4%, jumping from 1.5% in July to hit the highest since October 2018.
The surge exceeded expectations for a rate of 2.1% in a Reuters poll of 16 economists in which the highest forecast was 2.2%.

Inflation has jumped worldwide as economies recover after the coronavirus crisis, straining supply chains and creating shortages that are driving prices higher.
French central bank governor Francois Villeroy de Galhau said last week that although tight supply chains would push inflation higher in the short term, he continued to expect the increase to be temporary.

TOKYO (Reuters) -Japan's industrial output shrank in July as car production took a hit from a coronavirus resurgence in Asia that has cast doubt over the recovery in the world's third-largest economy.
A spike in highly contagious Delta variant cases has forced governments in Asia to impose fresh lockdowns and curbs, which are causing disruptions in parts supply across the region, adding to a global chip shortage.
""There's a risk output will stall heading into the year-end,"" said Takeshi Minami, chief economist at Norinchukin Research Institute.
""Car production is likely to be a drag on output in August and September.""
Factory output dropped 1.5% in July from the previous month, official data showed on Tuesday, hit by a decline in the production of autos, including passenger cars and small buses.
The fall offset growing output of production machinery items, such as those used for manufacturing semiconductors, and electronic parts and devices.
That meant output fell back below pre-coronavirus pandemic levels again after surging 6.5% in the prior month, though it was stronger than a 2.5% drop forecast in a Reuters poll of economists.
Manufacturers surveyed by the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) expected output to advance 3.4% in August and 1.0% in September.
Overall output was projected to get a boost from a sharp jump in production machinery manufacturing next month, even as that of transport equipment, which includes car production, was seen shrinking more than 7% from the previous month.
But the forecast for the decline in transport equipment was probably not fully factoring in parts supply disruptions in Southeast Asia, a government official said.
 Toyota  Motor (NYSE:TM) Corp, the world's largest automaker by sales volume, said this month it would cut September production by 40% from its previous plan due to the chip crunch.
Manufacturers' finely tuned supply chains mean carmakers often optimise car parts supplies, increasing the risk of output delays once inventories run out and replacement parts fail to turn up, said Minami.
Separate data on Tuesday showed the jobless rate edged down for the second straight month, dropping to 2.8% from 2.9% in June, with the actual number of those unemployed posting the first year-on-year fall in 18 months.
An index gauging job availability gained slightly to 1.15 from 1.13 in June, labour ministry data showed.
A separate government survey showed consumer confidence worsened in August, falling to a three-month low, as wider curbs in response to rising numbers of COVID-19 cases weighed on people's willingness to spend.

Japan's economy expanded an annualised 1.3% in the second quarter, driven by solid consumption and exports.
But growth is expected to remain modest in the current quarter, with some analysts forecasting a possible contraction, as the country struggles with a COVID-19 resurgence, which has burdened medical facilities and shows no signs of abating.

Investing.com – China’s economic recovery from COVID-19 came under more pressure in August, with factory activity expanding at a slower pace and the services sector tumbling into contraction territory.
A recent COVID-19 outbreak, high raw material prices, a slowdown in exports, tighter measures to regulate property prices and a carbon emissions reduction campaign all contributed to weakening momentum for a strong recovery to date.
National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) data released earlier in the day showed that the manufacturing purchasing managers’ index (PMI) was at 50.1 in August. This was lower than the 50.2 in forecasts prepared by Investing.com as well as the previous month’s 50.4 figure.
The non-manufacturing PMI at 47.5, below the 50-mark indicating growth and below the previous month’s 53.3 reading.
""The worse-than-expected August PMIs add conviction to our view that the growth slowdown in the second half could be quite notable. We expect Beijing to maintain its policy combination of 'targeted tightening' for a few sectors, especially the property sector and high-polluting industries, complemented by 'universal easing' for the rest of the economy,"" Nomura analysts said in a note.
Other analysts also expect the People’s Bank of China (PBOC) to further cut the amount that cash banks must hold as reserves later in 2021 to lift growth. PBOC already cut the amount in July 2021, which released around CNY1 trillion yuan ($154.54 billion) in long-term liquidity into the economy.
The recent lockdowns that were implemented to curb the country’s latest COVID-19 outbreak also contributed to a steep fall in service sector activity.

The official manufacturing purchasing managers’ index fell to 50.1 from 50.4 in July, the National Bureau of Statistics said Tuesday, slightly lower than the 50.2 median estimate in a Bloomberg survey of economists. 
The non-manufacturing gauge, which measures activity in the construction and services sectors, slumped to 47.5, signaling a contraction for the first time since March 2020. 
China imposed stringent measures, including travel curbs, mass testing and quarantines, for about a month to bring a new wave of Covid cases under control. The outbreak was the most widespread since the initial flareup in 2020, sweeping across nearly 50 cities in 17 provinces in the country. Confidence among businesses weakened and consumers cut back on spending after authorities rushed to close tourist sites, call off cultural events and cancel flights. 
Beyond the virus outbreaks, the economy’s recovery is also showing signs of faltering in the wake of recent regulatory crackdowns and weak demand at home. The central bank has signaled it may provide more targeted support for some industries, while the government has pledged to accelerate fiscal spending in the second half of the year, helping to cushion growth.

BERLIN (Reuters) -Germany's annual consumer price inflation accelerated to a fresh 13-year high in August, data showed on Monday, underlining growing price pressures as Europe's largest economy recovers from the pandemic and companies struggle with supply shortages.
Consumer prices, harmonised to make them comparable with inflation data from other European Union countries (HICP), rose 3.4% compared with 3.1% in July, preliminary figures from the Federal Statistics Office showed.
The August reading was in line with a Reuters poll and marked the highest since July 2008, when the harmonised inflation rate also hit 3.4%.
The national inflation rate (CPI) even soared to 3.9% in August, hitting its highest since December 1993 when the economy boomed following German reunification.
""This is due to higher energy and food prices, while the core inflation probably even fell slightly form 2.9% to 2.8%,"" Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) analyst Ralph Solveen said.
Germany's preliminary consumer price figures do not include values for core inflation.
LBBW economist Elmar Voelker said the inflation rate would rise further in the coming months, pointing to special factors and base effects from a temporary reduction in VAT rates in the second half of 2020 that affected comparisons.
""From the beginning of 2022, price pressures ... will probably ebb, but the exciting question will be how quickly and how strong this weakening will be,"" Voelker added.
Recent hikes in producer and import prices could be an early indication that increased inflation rates will ultimately be more persistent at the consumer level than previously thought.
""In this case, the debate within the European Central Bank, which is currently still primarily centered around the risk of low inflation, could take on a new direction,"" Voelker said.
German central bank chief Jens Weidmann has said he is worried about the prospect of the ECB's low-interest-rate environment being extended for too long.
Weidmann said last month his advisers anticipated inflation nearing 5% in Germany later this year.
Data released earlier on Monday showed German inflation outpaced wage growth in the second quarter as rising price pressures caused by the economic recovery and supply bottlenecks in manufacturing reduced the spending power of consumers.
The latest data suggests wages will not keep up with inflation also for the rest of the year. This means there are no signs yet of a wage-price spiral which is seen as a prerequisite for inflation to remain at an elevated level in the medium term.
In Spain, EU-harmonised consumer prices rose 3.3% year-on-year in August from 2.9% in July, separate data from the National Statistics Institute (INE) showed.
The German and Spanish figures suggest that euro zone inflation, due on Tuesday, has strengthened further in August.
A Reuters poll of analysts predicts euro zone inflation (HICP) to jump to 2.7% from 2.2% in the previous month.

""We think euro zone inflation will remain high this year, peaking at close to 3% in Q4, before returning to 1.5% next year,"" Oxford Economics analyst Daniela Ordonez said.
The ECB, which next meets on Sept. 9, will have to decide whether to maintain an elevated volume of bond purchases or allow them to decline, given a drop in yields and a weakening of the euro since the last policy meeting.

The European Commission's economic sentiment index, released on Monday, eased to 117.5 in August from an all-time high of 119.0 in July. Optimism deteriorated in all major sectors -- in industry to 13.7 from 14.5, in services to 16.8 from 18.9 and among consumers to -5.3 from -4.4.
Still, selling price expectations in industry, heralding likely future inflationary pressures, hit a record in August.
Also among consumers, inflation expectations rose to 31.1 in August from 30.0 in July, though they were still well below the all-time high of 38.7 from 2001.
German inflation already outpaced wage growth in the second quarter, data showed on Monday, as rising price pressures caused by an economic recovery and supply bottlenecks in manufacturing reduced the spending power of consumers.

Still, hiring plans in construction, retail trade and services drove employment expectations up by 1.2 points to 112.8 in the euro zone, its highest level since November 2018, signalling more spending power and consumer demand ahead.
Overall, France recorded the sharpest drop in economic sentiment of 4.5 points, followed by the Netherlands. Italy and Spain were also weaker. Sentiment in the biggest euro zone economy, Germany, eased only slightly by 0.3 points.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's retail sales rose for a fifth straight month in July, beating expectations as the consumer sector continued its recovery, although a coronavirus resurgence has cast doubts over the spending outlook.
A surge in Delta variant cases this month forced the government to widen state of emergency restrictions, which are now threatening to hurt consumer spending and derail a fragile economic recovery.
Retail sales advanced 2.4% in July from the same month a year earlier, government data showed on Monday, slightly faster than economists' median forecast for a 2.1% rise in a Reuters poll. It followed a 0.1% increase in June.
""The recent strength in retail sales is unlikely to last,"" Marcel Thieliant, Senior Japan Economist at Capital Economics, said in a note.
""The severe Delta wave now hitting the country coupled with an ever-expanding list of prefectures under states of emergency resulted in a renewed weakening in consumption this quarter,"" Thieliant said.
The better-than-expected rise in retail sales in July came as authorities struggled https://www.reuters.com/lifestyle/sports/tale-two-cities-bubble-tokyo-outside-2021-07-29 to get a defiant public to heed stay-at-home restrictions in major cities like Tokyo, which hosted the Olympics during the month.
The trade ministry data found strong demand for a variety of items such as cars, clothing, general merchandise and food while fuel was helped by higher petrol prices.
Small retail establishments like convenience stores and drug stores saw biggest sales growth from a year earlier.
However, growth was also flattered by the comparison with last year's steep slide, when consumer demand was hurt by the coronavirus pandemic.
Compared with the previous month, retail sales gained a seasonally adjusted 1.1% as consumption continued the surprising growth seen in the second-quarter, helped by the Tokyo Olympics.
The world's third-largest economy grew at a better-than-expected rate in the April-June quarter, thanks largely to private consumption, which makes up more than half of the country's gross domestic product.

But rebounding consumer activity poses a challenge to policymakers as the more contagious Delta variant of COVID-19 upends the nation's healthcare system, with state of emergency curbs now covering nearly 80% of Japan's population.

1478,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 30, 2021 03:51AM ET</span>",China August factory activity seen growing at slightly slower pace: Reuters poll,"BEIJING (Reuters) - Growth in China's factory activity likely cooled further in August, a Reuters poll showed on Monday, as COVID-related restrictions and high raw material prices continued to pressure manufacturers and the economy lost momentum.
The official manufacturing Purchasing Manager's Index (PMI)is expected to slip to 50.2 in August from 50.4 in July, a fifth month of slowing growth, according to the median forecast of 33 economists polled by Reuters. A reading above 50 indicates expansion from the previous month.
PMIs for manufacturing and services will likely moderate in August due to COVID-19 outbreaks of the more infectious Delta variant and ensuing lockdown measures, said analysts at  Barclays  (LON:BARC) in a note.
""With slowing growth momentum and dovish signals (from China's central bank) we expect more easing, but still at a measured pace as policymakers eye headwinds in 2022."" 
The world's second-largest economy staged an impressive recovery from a coronavirus-battered slump, but growth has recently shown signs of losing steam due to domestic COVID-19 outbreaks, slowing exports, tighter measures to tame hot property prices and a campaign to reduce carbon emissions. 
To bolster the economy, the People's Bank of China(PBOC) in mid-July cut the amount of cash banks must hold as reserves, releasing around 1 trillion yuan ($6.47 trillion) in long-term liquidity.
Many analysts expect another cut later in the year.
China's latest coronavirus outbreaks appear to have been largely brought under control, with zero locally transmitted cases reported on Aug 29., for the second day in a row.
But it spurred authorities across the country to impose counter-epidemic measures including mass testing for millions of people as well as travel restrictions of varying degrees and port shutdowns.
Meishan terminal at China's Ningbo port resumed operations in late August after shutting down for two weeks due to a COVID-19 case. The closure caused logjams at ports across the country's coastal regions and further strained global supply chains amid a resurgence of consumer spending and a shortage of container vessels.
Higher raw material prices, especially of metals andsemiconductors, have also pressured profits. Earnings at China's industrial firms in July slowed for the fifth straight month.
The official PMI, which largely focuses on big andstate-owned firms, and its sister survey on the services sector,will both be released on Tuesday.

The private Caixin manufacturing PMI will be published onWednesday. Analysts expect the headline reading will slip to 50.2 from July's 50.3.

1480,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 27, 2021 08:41PM ET</span>","Automobiles restrain U.S. consumer spending, monthly inflation slowing","By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. consumer spending slowed in July as a decline in motor vehicle purchases due to shortages offset a rise in outlays on services, supporting views that economic growth will moderate in the third quarter amid a resurgence in COVID-19 infections.
But the foundation for the recovery remains solid, with the report from the Commerce Department on Friday showing wages rising and Americans further boosting savings. Inflation appears to have peaked, which could preserve households' purchasing power. Businesses are also restocking and exporting more goods, suggesting a slowdown in growth this quarter could be temporary.
""There are clear downside risks to spending if more events and trips are canceled and more products are delayed getting to shelves,"" said Sal Guatieri, a senior economist at BMO Capital Markets in Toronto. ""But it's a bit early to throw in the towel on the economic outlook given supportive wage and saving trends and a likely boost from business investment, inventories, and trade in the third quarter.""
Consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, increased 0.3% last month after advancing 1.1% in June. Last month's rise was in line with economists' expectations.
Demand is rotating back to services like travel and leisure, but spending has been insufficient to compensate for the drop in goods purchases, which are also being impacted by shortages.
Goods spending fell 1.1% last month, led by motor vehicles. A global shortage of semiconductors is hampering auto production. There were also decreases in spending on recreational goods as well as clothing and footwear. Still, goods spending is 20% above its pre-pandemic level.
Spending on services rose 1.0%, a broad increase led by food services and accommodations. Outlays on services last month were 1% above their February 2020 level. Healthcare, transportation and recreation are yet to recoup their pandemic losses. 
Credit card data suggests spending on services like airfares and cruises as well as hotels and motels slowed in August amid soaring COVID-19 cases driven by the Delta variant. 
Fears about the virus knocked consumer sentiment to a more than 9-1/2-year low in August.
Inflation continued to rise last month, fanned by the unrelenting supply constraints and the economy's move toward normalcy after the upheaval caused by the pandemic. But the pace of increase is slowing.
The personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index, excluding the volatile food and energy components, climbed 0.3% in July. That was the smallest gain in five months and followed a 0.5% advance in June. In the 12 months through July, the so-called core PCE price index rose 3.6% after a similar increase in June. The core PCE price index is the Federal Reserve's preferred inflation measure for its flexible 2% target.
Fed Chair Jerome Powell in a speech to the Jackson Hole economic conference on Friday defended his long-held view that high inflation would be transitory. Powell said the economy continued to make progress towards the U.S. central bank's benchmarks for reducing its massive support, but stopped short of signaling the timing for any policy shift.
Powell's comments buoyed U.S. stocks, with the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq scaling record highs. 
The dollar fell against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices rose.
INCOME, SAVINGS RISE
High inflation chipped away at consumer spending last month. Consumer spending adjusted for inflation dipped 0.1%. The so-called real consumer spending rose 0.5% in June. Real consumer spending is slightly above the second-quarter average.
""Spending growth in the current quarter is still guaranteed to be far below the 11.6% annualized rate of the first half of the year, but at least it is starting in positive territory,"" said Lou Crandall, chief economist at Wrightson ICAP (LON:NXGN) in Jersey City.
The Atlanta Fed cut its third-quarter GDP growth estimate to a 5.1% rate from a 5.7% pace. The resurgence in COVID-19 cases, which is global, could cause more supply disruptions.
The economy grew at a 6.6% pace in the second quarter, which raised the level of gross domestic product above its peak in the fourth quarter of 2019.
But the drag from slowing consumer spending this quarter is likely to be limited by a narrowing trade deficit and the replenishing of depleted inventories by businesses. 
In another report on Friday, the Commerce Department said the goods trade deficit decreased 6.2% to $86.4 billion last month as imports fell and exports rose. 
Retail inventories gained 0.4%, while stocks of goods at wholesalers increased 0.6%. 
Overall, the economy remains supported by record corporate profits. Households accumulated at least $2.5 trillion in excess savings during the pandemic. Growth is expected to pick up in the fourth quarter, in part driven by inventory accumulation. 
The saving rate increased to 9.6% last month from 8.8% in June as some of the money disbursed by the government under the Child Tax Credit program to qualifying households was socked away. Personal income shot up 1.1% after gaining 0.2% in June.
Wages also rose as companies compete for scarce workers, increasing 1.0% in July. Income at the disposal of households after accounting for inflation rebounded 0.7% after three straight monthly declines. 

Household wealth is also being boosted by high stock market prices and accelerating home prices.
""The overall position of the household sector is strong and consumers have plenty of buying power,"" said Conrad DeQuadros, senior economic advisor at Brean Capital in New York.

1481,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 27, 2021 01:35PM ET</span>",U.S. consumer sentiment plummets to near-decade low,"By Evan Sully
(Reuters) -U.S. consumer sentiment plunged to its lowest level in nearly a decade in August as consumers' views of their personal financial prospects continued to worsen due to smaller income gains amid higher inflationary trends, a survey showed on Friday.
The University of Michigan said its consumer sentiment index fell to 70.3 in August - the lowest since December 2011 - from July's final reading of 81.2. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast a reading of 70.7.
August's final reading was little changed from the preliminary reading of 70.2 earlier this month. The losses were widespread across all demographic groups and regions.
""The extraordinary falloff in sentiment also reflects an emotional response, from dashed hopes that the pandemic would soon end and lives could return to normal,"" Richard Curtin, the survey director, said in a statement. 
The economy is still expected to grow this year at its fastest pace in four decades after falling into a brief recession in 2020 caused by the coronavirus pandemic. 
However, the recovery is showing some indication of cooling off and COVID-19 cases have continued to climb in August as the more transmissible Delta variant spreads rapidly across the country. Labor shortages across the service sector also persist while supply chain disruptions have continued.
The survey's gauge of consumer expectations declined to 65.1 in August, its lowest reading since October 2013, from July's 79.0, and was little changed from the mid-month reading of 65.2.
The survey's one-year inflation expectation eased to 4.6% from 4.7% in July, while the survey's five-year inflation outlook ticked up to 2.9% from 2.8%.

""With the economy moving past peak growth and peak inflation, we expect cooler inflation readings in the coming months to support an uptick in optimism among consumers,"" said Mahir Rasheed, an economist at Oxford Economics. ""Greater vaccine uptake and a stronger labor market will also encourage greater optimism with vaccination rates improving while restraints on labor supply will relax in the fall.""
Consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, also slowed in July, supporting views that economic growth will ease in the third quarter.

1482,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 27, 2021 03:55AM ET</span>",French consumer confidence holding up despite COVID curbs,"PARIS (Reuters) -French consumers were only marginally less confident about their economic prospects in August despite a surge in coronavirus cases and new rules requiring a health pass to enter many retail outlets, a monthly survey showed on Friday.
The INSEE official statistics agency said its monthly consumer confidence index fell to 99 from 100 in July, just short of the average expectation for 100 in a Reuters poll of 10 economists.
The index had peaked at 102 in June - the highest since the pandemic started - as vaccination rates picked up and coronavirus restrictions were eased.
But with France now facing its fourth coronavirus wave as the Delta variant spreads, the government began requiring people earlier this month to show proof of vaccination to enter cafes, restaurants, trains and big shopping malls.
Nonetheless, the survey found that the proportion of households considering that it is a good time to make large purchases remained stable in August above the long-term average while saving intentions rose for the first time in three months.
Concerns about unemployment were also unchanged from July with 'help wanted' signs increasingly popping up as companies face growing trouble finding staff.
The share of households expecting prices to rise in the coming months rose slightly as strained supply chains increasingly leave firms little choice but to raise their prices.

The relatively small decline in consumer confidence suggests that at least for now the new health pass is having a limited impact on economic activity even though it has fuelled regular weekend protests across the country.
After a stronger than expected first half of the year, French central bank governor Francois Villeroy de Galhau said on Thursday the bank could raise its 2021 growth forecast of 5.75% when it updates its estimates next month, adding that economic impact from the Delta variant was expected to be limited.

The prices in one of the most expensive property markets gained for the seventh month in a row, according to last month's data, and compared with a revised 0.1% increase in June.
Realtors expect the price index, which stood at 396.3 in July, will break the 396.9 record posted in May 2019 in the third quarter. 
""A high turnover in the market is positive for buyers' sentiment,"" said Thomas Lam, executive director of Knight Frank. ""The buying power can persist into end of year.""

Elevated raw material prices and supply chain constraints from extreme weather as well as sporadic coronavirus cases dragged on earnings in the manufacturing sector, data from the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) showed on Friday. 
Industrial firms' profits in July increased 16.4% on an annual basis - the slowest clip this year - to 703.67 billion yuan ($108.51 billion), the NBS said. That compared to a 20% gain in June.
China's economy has staged an impressive recovery from a coronavirus-battered slump, but the expansion is losing steam as businesses grapple with higher costs and supply bottlenecks, and as consumers remain cautious with spending. 
The headwinds to growth back expectations Beijing will keep, or even bolster, its accommodative stance. The People’s Bank of China in mid-July lowered the reserve requirement ratio for banks, releasing around 1 trillion yuan ($154.19 billion) in long-term liquidity.
""On economic fundamentals, signs of a notable economic slowdown have emerged, and I expect policymakers to fine-tune the macro-economic policy, currently neutral but with a loosening bias, in an pre-emptive way to counter the headwinds,"" said Nie Wen, Shanghai-based economist at Hwabao Trust. 
""If growth keeps sliding, the government might even roll out quantitative measures,"" said Nie. 
Zhu Hong, senior statistician at the NBS, attributed the slower growth in July to sporadic COVID-cases and flooding, as well as high commodity prices that have pressured profitability for small mid-stream and downstream firms. 
""Overall, profits at industrial firms above the designated size maintained a steady growth in July, but we have to recognise that the unevenness and uncertainty in the recovery of corporate earnings still exist,"" Zhu said. 
In the first seven months of the year, industrial firms' profits grew a hefty 57.3% on year, due to base effects, although the pace slowed from the 66.9% surge in first half of 2021. 
China's factory output growth slowed sharply in July, and analysts expect it to come under increasing pressure due to COVID-19 social distancing rules and tightening measures in the property sector and high-polluting industries.
Commodity prices have been on a tear in recent months, hurting the bottom lines of many mid- and downstream factories. Chinese coke and coking coal futures hit record highs this week while iron ore futures rose for the fourth day on Thursday.
COVID-19 cases of the more transmittable Delta strain in July and record rainfalls in transportation hub Henan province have also hurt industrial production. The terminal at China's major Ningbo port paused services as part of the government's effort to curb the spread of the virus.

Liabilities at industrial firms rose 8.2% on an annual basis at end-July, down from 8.5% growth as of end-June.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australian retail sales plunged in July as coronavirus lockdowns shut shops and services in the nation's largest city, further evidence the economy is set to contract sharply this quarter as the Delta variant of the virus spreads.
Figures from the Australian Bureau of Statistics out on Friday showed retail sales fell 2.7% in July to A$29.8 billion ($21.55 billion) from June, when travel restrictions had already caused a 1.8% drop. It was the largest decline this year and even worse than market forecasts of a 2.3% fall.
The A$360 billion retail sector accounts for around 18% of gross domestic product and further weakness is expected this month as lockdowns engulf Melbourne and Canberra.
Sales in New South Wales state collapsed by nearly 9% in July, and a similar drop is likely for Victoria in August. 
The harsh hit to consumption, employment and hours worked is sure to see economic output shrink this quarter ending what had been a remarkably strong rebound from last year's pandemic-driven downturn.
""We estimate that 550,000 workers have been stood down because of the lockdowns,"" said CBA's head of Australian economics Gareth Aird. 
""We have downwardly revised our Q3 GDP estimate to look for a contraction of 4.25%, from -2.75% previously.""
That might even trigger another recession, though analysts are hopeful that recent rapid progress in vaccinations will allow stricken cities to open up enough in the fourth quarter to avoid such a bleak outcome.
The vaccination pace has picked up markedly after a hesitant start to hit an average of 260,000 a day in the past week. Just over 32% of the adult population is now fully vaccinated, while 55% have at least one dose.
The conservative government of Prime Minister Scott Morrison has laid out plans to start opening the economy once 70% of adults are vaccinated, and to avoid lockdowns altogether once 80% are covered.
The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) has also been counting on a rapid recovery in consumption once restrictions ease, which is why it decided to press ahead with plans to trim its bond buying campaign despite the latest lockdowns.

However, with Sydney and Melbourne now set to be shut for far longer than first thought the central bank is under pressure to delay the taper at its next policy meeting on Sept. 7.

1486,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 26, 2021 01:41PM ET</span>",U.S. corporate profits soar in second quarter; economic growth raised,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. corporate profits surged to a fresh record high in the second quarter, boosted by robust demand and higher prices, suggesting that an anticipated slowdown in economic growth this quarter because of soaring COVID-19 cases could be temporary. 
The jump in profits reported by the Commerce Department on Thursday was despite businesses facing increased costs owing to shortages of raw materials and labor. The resurgence in infections driven by the Delta variant of the coronavirus is chipping away demand for services like air travel and cruises, leading economists to cut their third-quarter growth estimates.
""Based on the profits data, any slowdown in growth as a result of slower consumer spending is likely to prove temporary,"" said Conrad DeQuadros, senior economic advisor at Brean Capital in New York.
Profits from current production increased by $234.5 billion, or at a 9.2% quarterly rate, to a record $2.8 trillion, after rising at a 5.1% pace in the first quarter. They were driven by a $169.8 billion surge in profits at domestic nonfinancial corporations. There were also gains in domestic financial corporations profits as well as rest-of-the-world profits.
Pre-tax profits as a share of GDP, a proxy for economy-wide profit margins, rose 0.7 percentage points to 12.3%, their highest since 2014. 
National after-tax profits without inventory valuation and capital consumption adjustments, conceptually most similar to S&P 500 profits, increased $303.6 billion, or at a 12.8% pace, up from the 9.4% pace notched in the January-March period.
Profits were up 69.3% from a year ago, partially exaggerated by low base comparisons in the second quarter of 2020 following mandatory shutdowns of nonessential businesses.
""Elevated margins suggest higher costs have not yet meaningfully eaten into firms' profits, as firms appear to have more pricing power today than they typically would this early in an expansion,"" said Jay Bryson, chief economist at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) in Charlotte, North Carolina. 
Gross domestic product increased at a 6.6% annualized rate, the government said on Thursday in its second estimate of GDP growth for the April-June period. That was revised up from the 6.5% pace of expansion reported in July. 
Economists polled by Reuters had expected that second-quarter GDP growth would be raised to a 6.7% pace. The economy grew at a 6.3% rate in the first quarter, and has recouped the steep losses suffered during the two-month COVID-19 recession.
The level of GDP is now 0.8% higher than it was at its peak in the fourth quarter of 2019. The upward revisions to last quarter's GDP growth reflected a slightly more robust pace of consumer spending and business investment than initially estimated. Demand was driven by one-time stimulus checks from the government to some middle- and low-income households. 
The Federal Reserve has maintained its ultra-easy monetary policy stance, keeping interest rates at historically low levels and boosting stock market prices. 
Stocks were trading lower. The dollar rose against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices were mostly lower. 
SPEED BUMP
Consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of the U.S. economy, appears to be cooling. Credit card data suggests spending on services like airfares, cruises as well as hotels and motels has been slowing.
""This is a speed bump due to the interaction of Delta and supply-side constraints,"" said Michelle Meyer, chief U.S. economist at Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) Securities in New York. ""We still believe the foundation for the economy is solid and all signs point to strong underlying demand.""
Bank of America Securities has slashed its GDP growth estimate for the third quarter to a 4.5% pace from a 7.0% rate. 
Growth is expected to pick up in the fourth quarter, in part driven by businesses replenishing inventories, which were drawn down in the first half of the year to meet the strong demand. Overall, economists expect growth of around 7% this year, which would be the strongest performance since 1984.
Though the boost from fiscal stimulus is waning, demand remains underpinned by a strengthening labor market. 
A separate report from the Labor Department on Thursday showed initial claims for state unemployment benefits rose 4,000 to a seasonally adjusted 353,000 for the week ended Aug. 21. 
Adjusting the data for seasonal fluctuations is tricky around this time of the year, a task that has been complicated by the pandemic. That could account for the increase in applications last week. Unadjusted claims dropped 11,699 to 297,765 last week.
Companies are clinging to their workers amid worker shortages blamed on a lack of childcare facilities and fears of contracting the virus. There were a record 10.1 million job openings as of the end of June. 
At least 25 states led by Republican governors have pulled out of federal government-funded unemployment programs, including a $300 weekly payment, which businesses claimed were encouraging unemployed Americans to stay at home. 

There is, however, no evidence that the early termination of federal benefits has led to an increase in hiring in these states. The government-funded benefits will expire on Sept. 6, affecting more than 11 million people.
""While states implementing an early termination argued that benefits were impeding labor supply, we only find a marginal effect,"" said Gregory Daco, chief U.S economist at Oxford Economics in New York. ""It appears the expiry of benefits will weigh more on the personal income ledger of the economy than it does to support employment growth.""

The GfK institute said its consumer sentiment index, based on a survey of around 2,000 Germans, dropped to -1.2 points for September, from a revised -0.4 points a month earlier. The reading compared with a Reuters forecast for -0.7.
""Prices have been rising rapidly since the middle of this year. This has a dampening effect on the consumer mood,"" GfK consumer expert Rolf Buerkl said in a statement.
Germany's harmonised annual consumer prices rose 3.1% in July, hitting a 13-year high and fuelling a debate about whether the increase in the cost of living will persist.
An increase in coronavirus infections and a slower pace of vaccinations have also hit consumers' expectations for the economy and affected their propensity to buy, Buerkl added. 
Germany reported 11,561 new coronavirus infections on Wednesday and a seven-day incidence rate of 61.3 per 100,000 people, according to the Robert Koch Institute for infectious diseases.
Some 59.4% of the population are fully vaccinated with around 64.4% having received at least one dose.
The consumer climate indicator forecasts the development of real private consumption in the following month.
An indicator reading above zero signals year-on-year growth in private consumption. A value below zero indicates a drop compared with the same period a year ago.
According to GfK, a one-point change in the indicator corresponds to a year-on-year change of 0.1% in private consumption.
The ""willingness to buy"" indicator represents the balance between positive and negative responses to the question: ""Do you think now is a good time to buy major items?""

Power, LMC Automotive","(Reuters) - U.S. auto retail sales are expected to fall in August, as the global semiconductor shortage coupled with the fast spreading Delta variant of the coronavirus squeezed inventory at dealerships, consultants J.D. Power and LMC Automotive said.
Retail sales of new vehicles are expected to fall 14.3% to 987,100 in August from a year earlier, they said in a report released on Thursday.
The chip shortage continues to weigh on manufacturing activity, with automakers cutting production despite strong demand for personal transportation during the COVID-19 crisis. 
""Global light vehicle demand remains under pressure from the severe inventory constraints caused by the semiconductor shortage as well as disruption from the COVID-19 Delta variant,"" said Jeff Schuster, president of Americas operations and global vehicle forecasts at LMC.
Dealers currently have about 942,000 vehicles in inventory, compared with about 3 million, two years ago, according to the report.
""The industry has insufficient inventory at dealerships to meet strong consumer demand. The consequence is that the retail sales pace is depressed, but transaction prices are elevated."" said Thomas King, president of data and analytics division at J.D. Power.
Average transaction prices are expected to rise 16% to $41,378, partly due to fewer manufacturer incentives.

Tight inventories are unlikely to meaningfully improve in September as ongoing supply chain issues and recent announcements of further production cuts by several manufacturers continue to weigh, the report said.
The consultants lowered their forecast for 2021 global light vehicle sales by 2 million units to 83.8 million units, due to a lack of sufficient production volume.

Initial unemployment claims in regular state programs totaled 353,000 in the week ended Aug. 21, up 4,000 from the prior week, Labor Department data showed Thursday. The median estimate in a Bloomberg survey of economists called for a slight increase to 350,000 new applications.
Continuing claims for state benefits fell slightly to 2.9 million in the week ended Aug. 14.
The increase in unemployment claims likely reflects volatility in the weekly data against a backdrop of elevated labor demand. The delta variant that’s fueled a recent surge in new infections across the country poses a risk, though there’s so far been little evidence to suggest that health concerns are leading to dismissals.
Still, lawmakers are wary of the threat the highly infectious variant poses to a broader economic recovery.
Companies are postponing a return to the office, issuing mask requirements and vaccine mandates to curb the spread. The Biden administration has emphasized the need to reopen the economy, but cautioned that businesses need to protect workers and consumers.

BENGALURU (Reuters) - Indian economic growth likely touched a record high in the quarter through June, reflecting a very weak base last year and a rebound in consumer spending, a Reuters poll found.
The Aug. 20-25 Reuters poll of 41 economists showed gross domestic product rose 20.0% in the three-month period, compared with a record contraction of 24.4% in the same quarter a year earlier.
Forecasts in the poll ranged from 10.5% to 31.6%, showing the considerable uncertainty around those base effects. 
The rebound came despite the drag from the deadly second wave of the coronavirus, which forced states across India to reimpose localised lockdowns and stop mobility completely from late April to early June.
But unlike during the nationwide lockdown last year, repeat state-level lockdowns had a less pronounced impact on the economy as they left more room for consumers to spend. 
""India's second COVID-19 wave acted as a stumbling block to the robust recovery that was underway. Still, the economic damage appears to be less than previously expected,"" said Rahul Bajoria, chief India economist at  Barclays  (LON:BARC).
If the poll median is realised, it would be India's fastest growth since official quarterly data started being released in the mid-1990s. That's up sharply from 1.6% in the previous quarter, but a bit slower than the Reserve Bank of India's 21.4% projection.
The second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic began in April just as the economy was beginning to rally from a lull at the start of the year, throwing the recovery off course, although not as much as many feared.
""Humanitarian costs of the health crisis were high, but the economic impact was less severe than the first wave and activity rebounded faster,"" said Radhika Rao, economist at DBS Bank.
A separate Reuters poll a month ago predicted India's GDP would expand 19.8% in the April-June quarter, little different to the latest median, and 9.4% for the current fiscal year. [ECILT/IN]

However, the spread of potential new virus variants poses a threat.
""The recovery remains uneven,"" said Aditi Nayar, chief economist at ICRA. ""The risks to watch out for are a third wave of COVID-19, a slower than expected pace of vaccinations, and lastly, new variants that may emerge which may not be very amenable to the vaccines which exist right now.""

TOKYO (Reuters) -The prices Japanese companies charge each other for services rose for a fifth straight month in July, data showed on Thursday, a sign the economy was holding up despite the hit from a resurgence in COVID-19 cases and curbs to combat the pandemic.
But the annual pace of increase slowed for two straight months and paled in comparison to a recent jump in wholesale inflation, underscoring the pain the pandemic has inflicted on the country's service sector.
""Companies' pricing behavior is fundamentally different in Japan,"" said Atsushi Takeda, chief economist at Itochu Economic Research Institute. ""Companies have imprinted the idea that if they raise prices, the customer will go away.""
The services producer price index rose 1.1% in July from a year earlier after a revised 1.3% gain in June, Bank of Japan data showed.
The increase was driven by a 1.4% rise in transportation fees with international freight costs jumping 24.6%, highlighting the cost pressure companies are facing amid robust global demand.
Hotel service fees rose 10.8% to mark the biggest annual increase in nearly six years, reflecting a boost to demand from the Tokyo Olympics during July 23 to Aug. 8, the data showed.
""The recent increase in infections will weigh on services producer prices, though we could see service demand perk up if progress in vaccinations help re-open the economy,"" said Shigeru Shimizu, head of the BOJ's price statistics division.
Robust exports have helped Japan's economy emerge from last year's doldrums, though stop-and-go state of emergency curbs have weighed on consumption and dashed policymakers' hope of a sharp rebound in July-September growth.
Rising commodity prices are also pinching margins for firms, many of which remain cautious about passing on higher costs to customers due to weak household spending.

Japan's wholesale prices spiked 5.6% in July from a year earlier to mark the fastest annual increase in 13 years.
By contrast, core consumer prices fell 0.2% in July to mark a 12th straight month of declines on weak domestic demand.

1493,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 25, 2021 10:40PM ET</span>",Australian businesses were spending big before lockdowns bit,"By Wayne Cole
SYDNEY (Reuters) -Australian business investment jumped to two-year highs in the June quarter as firms ramped up spending plans for the year ahead, bullish plans that are now being threatened by coronavirus lockdowns across Sydney and Melbourne.
Figures from the Australian Bureau of Statistics out on Thursday confirmed the economy had a good head of steam in the second quarter before the lockdowns likely threw it into reverse.
Business investment rose 4.4% in the second quarter to a real A$32.7 billion ($23.76 billion), topping forecasts of a 2.5% rise and the highest amount since 2019.
That strength suggests the gross domestic product report due next week will show reasonable growth for the quarter, and a huge improvement from last year when lockdowns tipped the economy into recession.
Generous tax breaks helped boost spending on equipment by 4.3% to the highest since late 2012, while building investment rose a solid 4.6%.
Promisingly firms also lifted spending plans for the year to June 2022 by almost 13% to A$127.7 billion.
""Given that businesses were surveyed in July, after the current Delta outbreaks had emerged, the data is surprisingly upbeat,"" said Sarah Hunter, chief Australia economist for BIS Oxford Economics.
""But risks to this outlook are clearly to the downside,"" she warned. ""Momentum in capex is likely to slow sharply, particularly in New South Wales and Victoria, and there are risks of a longer term drag if major projects are now abandoned as too risky.""
Analysts are certain the economy will shrink sharply this quarter, with much of retailing and services shut in Australia's two most populous states, but are hopeful growth will rebound next quarter should restrictions ease as hoped.

For now, the outlook is uncertain with NSW reporting a record 1,029 new COVID-19 cases on Thursday and looking likely to remain locked down until at least October. [L1N2PW2RP]

Volumes dropped by an annual 37.6% to 53,438 vehicles last month, according to the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT), which also blamed the timing of summer factory shutdowns. 

As cases rose last month, hundreds of thousands of people were being ""pinged"" by the National Health Service's contact-tracing app and instructed to self-isolate, although it has since been tweaked to reduce the numbers contacted.

(Reuters) - Mortgage applications increased last week, as purchasing applications posted their largest increase since early July while mortgage rates edged down.
The Mortgage Bankers Association (MBA) said on Wednesday its average contract interest rate for traditional 30-year mortgages declined to 3.03% from 3.06% in the week ending Aug. 20. The seasonally adjusted market composite index tracking mortgage applications rose 1.6% from a week earlier, reflecting a 0.9% increase in applications to refinance existing loans. 
Purchase applications rose 3.0%, the MBA said.
After hitting record lows late last year below 2.9%, mortgage rates climbed in the first part of this year and peaked in the spring. Rates had been drifting lower since, held down in large part by the U.S. Federal Reserve's extraordinary stimulus measures aimed at helping the economy rebound from the coronavirus pandemic, but ticked higher last week after data showed a hiring surge last month.
""The purchase index was at its highest level since early July, despite still continuing to lag 2020’s pace,"" said Joel Kan, MBA’s associate vice president of economic and industry forecasting. ""There was also some easing in average loan sizes, which is potentially a sign that more first-time buyers looking for lower-priced homes are being helped by the recent uptick in for-sale inventory for both newly built homes and existing homes.""
Existing home sales climbed for the second consecutive month in July, a report from the National Association of Realtors showed Monday.

New home sales also increased in July after three consecutive monthly declines, the Commerce Department said Tuesday. However, momentum in the housing market appears to be slowing down as housing prices have continued to surge this year amid tight supply.
""Strong demand, still-low mortgage rates and a modest increase in the inventory of existing homes are supportive of home sales,"" said Nancy Vanden Houten, lead economist at Oxford Economics in New York. ""However, supplies are still historically tight, and home prices at or near record levels will continue to temper the pace of home sales.""

1496,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 25, 2021 11:51AM ET</span>",U.S. business equipment spending strong even as new orders flat in July,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - New orders for key U.S.-made capital goods were unexpectedly flat in July amid supply constraints and a shift in demand to services, suggesting that business spending on equipment could slow in the second half after robust growth over the past year.
Still, business investment in equipment remains strong, with the report from the Commerce Department on Wednesday showing shipments of these capital goods accelerating last month. Orders are 18% above their pre-pandemic levels. Investment in equipment is expected to help offset cooling consumer spending and keep the economy on a solid growth path this quarter.
""Overall, the July data point to solid equipment spending growth at the start of third quarter,"" said Oren Klachkin, lead U.S. economist at Oxford Economics in New York. ""But with producer prices running hot and the recovery tilting in favor of high-contact services, we're likely to see a gradual moderation in real equipment spending growth in the second half of 2021."" 
Last month's unchanged reading in orders for non-defense capital goods excluding aircraft, a closely watched proxy for business spending plans, followed an upwardly revised 1.0% increase in June. These so-called core capital goods orders were previously reported to have advanced 0.7%. 
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast core capital goods orders climbing 0.5%. Shipments of core capital goods rose 1.0% last month after increasing 0.6% in June. Core capital goods shipments are used to calculate equipment spending in the government's gross domestic product measurement.
Stocks on Wall Street were trading higher. The dollar gained versus a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices were lower.
Business spending on equipment notched four straight quarters of double-digit growth, helping to power the economy's recovery from a short and sharp COVID-19 pandemic recession, driven by strong demand for goods, thanks to record-low interest rates and massive fiscal stimulus. 
July's slowdown in core capital goods orders likely reflected supply chain bottlenecks as well as the rotation of spending back to services from goods. There were decreases in orders for computers and electronic products. An ongoing global semiconductor shortage has hampered production of these goods.
Orders for electrical equipment, appliances and components also fell. But orders for primary metals, machinery and fabricated metal products increased.

https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-STOCKS/zjvqkkaenvx/capgoods.png 
VERY LEAN INVENTORIES
With inventories extremely lean after they were depleted in the first half of the year, core capital goods orders are likely to pick up in the coming months and underpin manufacturing, which accounts for 11.9% of the economy. Unfilled core capital goods orders increased 0.9% in July after rising 1.2% in June.
""As production has not kept up with demand but demand has remained persistently strong, we would expect strong demand to keep production supported well into 2022 as supply issues are eventually resolved,"" said Veronica Clark, an economist at  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) in New York. 
The resilience is welcome amid signs that consumer spending is cooling as the Delta variant of the coronavirus causes a resurgence in new infections across the country.
Retail sales fell in July in part because of motor vehicle shortages. Credit card data suggests spending on services like airfares, cruises as well as hotels and motels has been slowing. 
Economists at Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) last week cut their third-quarter GDP growth estimate to a 5.5% annualized rate from a 9% pace. Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) Securities slashed its GDP growth estimate for this quarter to a 4.5% pace from a 7.0% rate. The economy grew at a 6.5% rate in the second quarter, pulling the level of GDP above its peak in the fourth quarter of 2019.
Orders for durable goods, items ranging from toasters to aircraft that are meant to last three years or more, dipped 0.1% in July after rising 0.8% in June. They were pulled down by a 2.2% decline in orders for transportation equipment, which followed a 1.4% increase in June. 
For a graphic on Durable goods:
https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-STOCKS/xmvjoojljpr/durgoods.png 
Orders for civilian aircraft tumbled 48.9%. Boeing (NYSE:BA) reported on its website that it had received 31 aircraft orders last month compared to 219 in June. Orders for motor vehicles and parts rose 5.8% in July after climbing 1.8% in June. 

Automakers have been adjusting their production schedules, including foregoing annual plant shutdowns for retooling in July, to manage their chip supply. That likely contributed to the jump in motor vehicle orders last month.
""Make no mistake, auto-production is still struggling to keep up with demand,"" said Tim Quinlan, a senior economist at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) in Charlotte, North Carolina.

BERLIN (Reuters) -German business morale fell for the second month running in August, as supply bottlenecks and rising COVID-19 cases drove companies to take a dimmer view of the coming months in Europe's largest economy, a survey showed on Wednesday.
The Ifo institute said its business climate index came in at 99.4, missing an analyst consensus of 100.4 in a Reuters poll and down from a downwardly revised reading of 100.7 in July.
""The mood in the German economy has clouded over again,"" Ifo President Clemens Fuest said in a statement. ""Supply bottlenecks for intermediate products in manufacturing and worries about rising infection numbers are putting a strain on the economy.""
Concerns were growing in the hospitality and tourism sectors in particular, he added.
Data on Tuesday showed the economy grew more than expected in the second quarter as the easing of COVID-19 curbs spurred consumers to dip into record savings piled up during the winter lockdown, and the state pressed on with a huge debt-financed stimulus push.
But with government officials warning of a fourth COVID-19 wave during the autumn, the months ahead look more problematic.
Ifo economist Klaus Wohlrabe told Reuters the outlook for that period gave cause for concern as 70% of industrial businesses surveyed complained about supply chain bottlenecks.
Earlier, the Statistics Office said German exports to China declined for the first time in nearly a year in July, easing by 3.9% year-on-year to 8.4 billion euros ($9.9 billion).
""The decline in German companies' exports to China in July is a sobering sign,"" said Volker Treier, head of foreign trade at the DIHK Chambers of Industry and Commerce, adding that shipping problems were disrupting international supply chains.
Earlier this month, BMW raised its 2021 profit forecast after strong quarterly results, but said the global semiconductor chip shortage and rising raw materials prices would hurt its performance in the second half of the year.
Siegfried Russwurm, president of the BDI industry group, said the COVID-19 pandemic continued to cause problems, such as with closed ports in China. ""The situation remains fragile,"" Russwurm added, referring to the pandemic.

ING economist Carsten Brzeski said the Ifo reading pointed to a loss of economic momentum in the second half of the year.
""A levelling-off of GDP growth rates (then)... would imply that the German economy will not return to pre-crisis levels this year but only in early 2022."" he said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Sales of new U.S. single-family homes increased in July after three straight monthly declines, but housing market momentum is slowing as surging housing prices amid tight supply sideline some first-time buyers from the market.
Though the report from the Commerce Department on Tuesday showed a big increase in new housing inventory, the jump was driven by a record rise in homes that are yet to be built. Builders are taking longer to complete houses, hobbled by expensive raw materials as well as scarce land and workers.
""While demand for new homes remains strong, high prices and backlogs in construction will temper sales in the months ahead,"" said Nancy Vanden Houten, a U.S. economist at Oxford Economics in New York. ""Homebuilders are reportedly turning away buyers as they attempt to reduce the backlog of sales."" 
New home sales rose 1.0% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 708,000 units last month. June's sales pace was revised up to 701,000 units from the previously reported 676,000 units.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast new home sales, which account for 10.6% of U.S. home sales, increasing to a rate of 700,000 units in July. Sales dropped 27.2% on a year-on-year basis in July. The median new house price soared 18.4% from a year earlier to a record $390,500 in July. 
Sales jumped to a rate of 993,000 units in January, the highest since the end of 2006, driven by historically low mortgage rates and a desire for spacious accommodations as Americans worked from home and took online classes during the COVID-19 pandemic. 
The market for new homes is being driven by an acute shortage of previously owned houses. But builders have struggled to fully take advantage of the supply squeeze, hampered by soaring lumber prices as well as shortages of other building materials and household appliances.
Though lumber prices have dropped sharply from May's record highs, they remain above their pre-pandemic levels. Reports this month showed single-family building permits fell in July, while confidence among homebuilders hit a 13-month low in August. 
A report on Monday showed sales of previously owned homes rose modestly in July.
Stocks on Wall Street were trading higher, with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq indexes hitting record highs, boosted by oil and travel-related shares. The dollar was flat against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices were mostly lower. 
LOWER-COST STATES
Last month's gain in new home sales was driven by a 1.3% rise in the populous South and a 14.4% jump in the West. Sales plunged 24.1% in the Northeast and decreased 20.2% in the Midwest. 
""The pandemic has accelerated the migration to suburban markets and metro areas in lower-cost states such as Arizona, Utah, Texas and Florida,"" said Mark Vitner, a senior economist at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) in Charlotte, North Carolina. ""By contrast, new home sales weakened in areas where population growth has slowed, in part due to an outflow of residents seeking more affordable real estate, lower taxes and other lifestyle advantages.""
New home sales were concentrated in the $200,000-$749,000 price range. Sales in the under-$200,000 price bracket, the sought-after segment of the market, accounted for a mere 1% of transactions.
""Affordability is becoming an increasing issue in the new-home market,"" said Bernard Yaros, and economist at Moody's (NYSE:MCO) Analytics in West Chester, Pennsylvania. ""Single-family sales prices are up 20% from their pre-pandemic level, which is a touch lower than the run-up in sales prices in the existing-home market but still enough to deter potential homebuyers.""
There were 367,000 new homes on the market in July, the highest since November 2008 and up from 348,000 in June. Homes yet to be built accounted for record 28.6% of supply. Completed houses made up only 9.8% of supply. 

At July's sales pace it would take 6.2 months to clear the supply of houses on the market, up from 6.0 months in June. About 75% of homes sold last month were either under construction or yet to be built.
""We expect sales to move upward as the year continues, as sufficient demand is present, but the pace at which acceleration occurs will likely be determined by the speed at which homebuilders can clear their current backlogs and overcome material availability and other supply constraints,"" said Mark Palim, deputy chief economist at Fannie Mae in Washington.

Gross domestic product grew an adjusted 1.6% on the quarter, the Federal Statistic Office said on Tuesday, up from its previous estimate of 1.5% and following a revised first quarter contraction of 2%.
On the year, Europe's largest economy expanded by a calendar-adjusted 9.4% in the second quarter, leaving economic activity 3.3% below the pre-crisis levels of the fourth quarter of 2019.
Private consumption grew by 3.2% between April and June, contributing 1.6% percentage points to overall growth and pushing the savings rate down to 16.3%. In the first quarter, when shops, bars and restaurants were closed under Germany's lockdown, that rate hit a record high of 22%.
Public consumption expanded 1.8%, contributing 0.4% to the overall growth rate.
State spending to cushion the impact of the coronavirus crisis, financed with unprecedented new borrowing, blew a 80.9 billion euro ($95 billion) hole in the public finances in the first half of the year, the statistics office said.
This equated to a public sector deficit of 4.7% of GDP, the largest in 26 years and what Carsten Brzeski from ING Bank termed ""the downside of the rapid economic recovery.""
The stimlus should help lift the economy back to pre-crisis levels before the end of 2021 but will leave the government that emerges from next month's federal election with a heavy burden to shoulder, Brzeski said.

Data firm IHS Markit said on Monday its flash U.S. Composite PMI Output Index, which tracks the manufacturing and services sectors, fell to 55.4 - the lowest since last December - from 59.9 in July. A reading above 50 indicates growth in the private sector.
Shortages of raw materials and labor now appear to be holding back output as well as fanning inflation, according to the IHS Markit data. New order growth was the weakest so far this year, while employment grew at the slowest rate in more than a year. 
""Not only have supply chain delays hit a new survey record high, but the August survey saw increasing frustrations in relation to hiring,"" said Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit. ""Jobs growth waned to the lowest since July of last year as companies either failed to find suitable staff or existing workers switched jobs."" 
The IHS Markit survey's flash services sector PMI fell to a reading of 55.2 from 59.9 in July. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast a reading of 59.5 this month for the services sector, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity.
The survey's flash manufacturing PMI slid to 61.2 in August from July's all-time high reading of 63.4. Economists had forecast the index for the sector, which accounts for 11.9% of the economy, would dip to 62.5.
IHS Markit's measures of prices paid by services companies and manufacturers both rose, with factory input prices hitting another record high.
The survey's findings dovetail with a growing view that the pace of economic expansion is tailing off after two successive quarters of growth above 6%, a back-to-back performance not seen since the 1980s and fueled by massive fiscal stimulus. Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) economists, for example, last week slashed their third-quarter gross domestic product estimate to 5.5% from 9%, and the slowing momentum calls into question the consensus among Federal Reserve policymakers that growth would hit 7% this year.
JACKSON HOLE CONFERENCE
The Fed will hold its annual Jackson Hole economic symposium later this week in a virtual format for the second straight year due to the pandemic. Fed Chair Jerome Powell will speak on the economic outlook on Friday.

Powell's remarks will be closely watched for any fresh signal on how soon the Fed may cut back on its crisis-era accommodation. That policy turn appears to be in the offing by the end of the year as the economy remains squarely in growth mode and inflation well over target despite the latest headwinds from the Delta variant and the fading boost from government spending. The labor market, for instance, has added roughly 1.9 million jobs in the past two months, although the IHS Markit data suggests that pace has cooled in August.
The government is due to publish its revised estimate of second-quarter GDP on Thursday, with economists polled by Reuters estimating growth to be marked up to an annualized rate of 6.7% from the advance estimate of 6.5%. The economy in the second quarter also regained a record level of output, recouping all of the record-setting drop triggered by the pandemic in just four quarters.

(Reuters) -U.S. existing home sales increased for the second consecutive month in July as inventories improved moderately, while prices eased from the prior month's record level.
Existing home sales increased 2.0% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.99 million units last month from June's upwardly revised pace of 5.87 million units, the National Association of Realtors said on Monday. Sales were unchanged in the Northeast, but increased in the Midwest, South and the West.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast sales would decline to a rate of 5.83 million units in July.
Home resales, which account for the bulk of U.S. home sales, increased 1.5% on a year-on-year basis. The median sales price slipped to $359,900 from June's record level, but was still up 17.8% from the year-earlier period.
The sales rate increase suggests the drop-off in sales after a sharp run-up late in 2020 and early this year may have run its course. 
""We see inventory beginning to tick up, which will lessen the intensity of multiple offers,"" Lawrence Yun, NAR's chief economist, said in a statement. ""Much of the home sales growth is still occurring in the upper-end markets, while the mid- to lower-tier areas aren't seeing as much growth because there are still too few starter homes available.""
Homebuilding fell more than expected in July amid supply constraints, the Commerce Department reported last week, as surging construction costs and home prices continued to constrain the housing market. There was, however, a rebound in building permits following three consecutive monthly declines.
Demand for housing soared throughout the coronavirus pandemic. Since then, the combination of robust demand and record-low mortgage rates has far outpaced supply. This has also made it harder for potential homebuyers to enter the market.
For example, a report from the Mortgage Bankers Association last week showed that applications for loans to purchase a house declined in the week ending Aug. 13. 
""Going forward, the market for existing homes will be supported by strong demand and mortgage rates that remain relatively low,"" said Nancy Vanden Houten, lead economist at Oxford Economics in New York. ""However, inventory remains lean despite the increase in July, and that will keep a floor under home prices, which are unaffordable for many prospective buyers.""

Data on new home sales for July are due on Tuesday. Sales are forecast to rise to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 700,000 units, according to a survey of economists polled by Reuters, after hitting a 14-month low in June. 
""Continued economic recovery is key to maintaining sales momentum,"" said Danielle Hale, chief economist at Realtor.com. ""Anything that disrupts progress, such as rising COVID cases, could knock home sales off course.""

LONDON (Reuters) -Business activity in the euro zone grew strongly this month, only dipping from July's two-decade high monthly pace, as a rapid COVID-19 vaccination drive allowed more firms to reopen and customers to venture out, a survey showed.
Without ongoing supply chain disruptions, activity could have expanded faster, but fears new coronavirus strains may lead to renewed restrictions continued to dent optimism.
IHS Markit's Flash Composite Purchasing Managers' Index, seen as a guide to economic health, fell to 59.5 in August from 60.2 last month. It was ahead of the 50-mark separating growth from contraction but just shy of a Reuters poll estimate for 59.7.
""The euro zone economy is firing on all cylinders again as reopening has had the expected positive effect on growth. Concerns about the impact of the Delta variant and input shortages remain but have not derailed the rebound thus far,"" said Bert Colijn at ING.
Both the services and manufacturing indices remained in growth territory in Germany, confirming Europe's biggest economy was on a recovery path, an earlier survey showed.
Economic growth in Germany could miss projections this year and the resurgence of the pandemic may put unexpected strain on the economy in the autumn, the Bundesbank said in a monthly report on Monday.
In France, the bloc's second-biggest economy, growth in business activity slowed compared to July but remained resilient, as problems with supplies of goods and COVID-19 health protocols impacted trade.
But Britain's post-lockdown economic bounce-back slowed sharply as companies struggled with unprecedented shortages of staff and materials, although strong inflation pressures cooled.
""Overall, August's flash PMIs underline two key risks to our forecasts. First, that the economic recovery might be slowing a bit faster than we had thought, posing a downside risk to our view that the economy will return to its pre-pandemic level by October,"" said Kieran Tompkins (NYSE:TMP) at Capital Economics.
""Second, that materials and staff shortages might feed into second-round effects of rising wage growth, meaning that inflation is higher for longer.""
Markets were unmoved by the PMI data and were instead focused on worries about the Delta variant hampering growth as investors weighed up the possible timeline for the tapering of monetary stimulus ahead of Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's speech at Jackson Hole this week. [MKTS/GLOB]
JOB BOOST
Firms increased headcount in the euro zone at a near-record pace but were still unable to complete all new business coming in, building up a backlog of work at the third-fastest pace in survey history. The composite employment index held at 56.1.
A PMI covering the bloc's dominant service industry nudged down to 59.7 from July's 15-year high of 59.8. The Reuters poll had predicted 59.8.
Demand slowed marginally from July - suggesting the rebound will continue - but the services business expectations index, which measure optimism about the year ahead, dropped to 68.6 from 69.1.
""We continue to see the potential spread of more virulent virus variants and the prolongation of supply chain issues as the main risks to the economic recovery,"" said Maddalena Martini at Oxford Economics.
""Therefore, the level of uncertainty around the forecast remains very high, but we still expect a strong recovery over the coming quarters.""

Manufacturers had another solid month, their PMI remaining well above the breakeven mark at 61.5, albeit below July's 62.8 and the 62.0 poll estimate. An index measuring output that feeds into to the composite PMI fell to 59.2 from 61.1.
But supply delays - the delivery times index was near a survey low - again played a key role in driving up the costs of the raw materials factories need. The input prices index was 87.3, although down from July's record high of 89.2.

The Confederation of British Industry's index for stock adequacy fell to the lowest since the survey began in 1977, sinking to -14 from July's -11, the third record low in as many months.
The survey also showed expectations for output price growth over the next three months remained close to June's nearly 30-year high, something the Bank of England will note after it said this month that it planned modest tightening of monetary policy.
The CBI's index for industrial output growth in the three months to August slipped from a record high in July, easing back to +22 from +37. But orders edged up to +18 from +17. Economists polled by Reuters had expected a reading of +16 for orders.
""Manufacturing activity remained strong this month, with total order books remaining firm and most sub-sectors reporting rising output,"" Alpesh Paleja, a CBI economist, said.
""However, early signs from the data suggest that growth in activity may have peaked.""
The slowing of output growth was largely caused by the motor vehicles sub-sector which has been hit hard by a shortage of chips.

LONDON (Reuters) -Britain's post-lockdown economic rebound slowed sharply in August as companies struggled with unprecedented shortages of staff and materials, though strong inflation pressures cooled a bit, a survey showed on Monday.
The IHS Markit/CIPS flash composite PMI dropped for the third month in a row, sinking to 55.3 from 59.2 in July, its lowest since February and a sharper fall than a median forecast of 58.4 in a Reuters poll of economists.
The pace of growth was still slightly above the pre-pandemic average but IHS Markit said there were clear signs of the recovery losing momentum after a buoyant second quarter. 
""Despite COVID-19 containment measures easing to the lowest since the pandemic began, rising virus case numbers are deterring many forms of spending, notably by consumers, and have hit growth via worsening staff and supply shortages,"" Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit, said.
The equivalent PMI for the euro zone slowed much less, dropping to 59.5 from 60.2.
Companies have complained that self-isolation requirements for contacts of people with COVID-19 have made it hard for them to find staff but those requirements were dropped from Aug. 13 for those fully vaccinated.
""Some businesses are finding recruitment difficult. With supply chain disruptions also persisting inflationary pressures remain a concern for now despite the slowdown in CPI inflation in July,"" Lloyds (LON:LLOY) Bank economist Rhys Herbert said.
On a brighter note, the PMI's employment growth measure hit its highest since the series began in 1998 as furloughed workers return, and businesses were more optimistic about future output. 
The PMI's gauge of input prices fell after hitting its highest in more than 20 years in July, and the prices charged by factories moved further away from June's record high.
The Bank of England is watching to see whether a jump in inflation turns into more stubborn price growth.
The central bank said earlier this month it expected ""modest monetary tightening"" would be needed over its three-year forecast period.

The fall in the PMI was mostly driven by services firms who make up the bulk of Britain's economy. Manufacturing dipped only slightly although automotive and electrical goods production fell into decline mainly due to supply constraints.
Data for the survey was collected between Aug. 12 and Aug. 19.

As a result, the flash composite PMI, which tracks the manufacturing and services sectors that together account for more than two-thirds of the German economy, fell to 60.6 from 62.4 in July.
All three indices remained firmly in growth territory, confirming that Europe's biggest economy remains firmly on a recovery path from the coronavirus pandemic.
""Although growth has slowed down since July, the data are still pointing to a stronger economic expansion in the third quarter than the provisional 1.5% increase in GDP seen in the three months to June,"" said Phil Smith, Associate Director at IHS Markit.

""This is despite signs of a further slowdown in manufacturing, where production levels continue to be held back by supply bottlenecks and businesses remain under pressure from record cost increases,"" he added. 
""Services has taken over as the main growth driver, having followed up July's record expansion with another stellar performance in August, as demand across the sector continues to rebound.""

Problems with global shipping and transport have resulted in supply chain issues for many companies around the world.
Several Chinese ports are facing congestion as vessels due to call at Ningbo are being diverted and cargo processing is slowed, partly due to stricter disinfection measures under China's ""zero-tolerance"" coronavirus policy.
Some French businesses are also struggling with rules requiring customers to hold a COVID-19 health pass to eat or drink in a restaurant or enter a shop.

""Another strong month of growth across France was signalled by the flash PMI figure for August,"" said IHS Markit senior economist Joe Hayes.
""There are, however, factors holding back growth to some extent.

OTTAWA (Reuters) - Canadian retail sales surged 4.2% in June from May, led by a strong rebound in demand for clothing and accessories, while July retail sales likely fell 1.7%, data showed on Friday.
The June gain was slightly below the average analyst estimate of 4.4%, Statistics Canada data showed. Excluding motor vehicles and parts, retail sales were up 4.7%, just beating expectations of 4.6%. 
Sales increased in eight of 11 subsectors, representing 69.5% of retail trade, as COVID-19 restrictions were eased and Canadians flocked back to nonessential stores, Statscan said.
""There's nothing like some retail therapy to cure the post-lockdown blues,"" Royce Mendes, senior economist at CIBC Capital Markets, said in a note to clients. 
""The general rebound following lockdowns shows the willingness of Canadians to spend and, more broadly, how quickly the economy can bounce back when Covid cases are low,"" he added.
While the preliminary estimate for July was disappointing, economists noted that even with the decline, retail sales remain well above their pre-COVID-19 levels. The drop in July could also signal a shift to more spending in bars and restaurants.
""It's very possible that spending was redirected to services as that sector more fully reopened,"" said Benjamin Reitzes, Canadian rates and macro strategist at BMO Capital Markets.
Canadian provinces eased restrictions through the spring as new COVID-19 cases fell amid a successful inoculation campaign. But a Delta variant-driven rebound of COVID-19 cases is starting to cloud the outlook.

The value of receipts rose 4.2% in June, Statistics Canada reported Friday in Ottawa. However, that bounce-back was quickly reversed in July with a preliminary estimate showing a 1.7% decline on the month. That brings total sales down about 5% from their post-pandemic peak in March. 
The report suggests consumers were initially eager to buy goods when businesses reopened, though the weakness in July could reflect a shift in consumption to services. That kind of change has been expected by economists, who anticipate more spending on things like restaurant meals and haircuts now that they’re allowed.
“Canadians probably started replacing goods purchases with services. And even with the retreat in July, retail sales are still well above pre-Covid levels,” Royce Mendes, an economist at Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, said by email.

LONDON (Reuters) -British retail sales unexpectedly fell in July, official data showed on Friday, suggesting at least some consumers skipped shopping to follow England's run in the Euro 2020 soccer tournament, or stayed at home due to rising COVID-19 cases.
Retailers reported that the tournament - in which England reached the final - and bad weather kept shoppers away from stores, the Office for National Statistics said.
Sales volumes fell by 2.5% from June, the biggest drop since January when Britain returned to lockdown. Economists polled by Reuters had expected a 0.4% month-on-month rise.
An ONS official said there had been no feedback from retailers that worries about rising coronavirus cases were behind the drop in sales.
But analysts said the size of the fall probably reflected the impact of the fast-spreading Delta variant and the requirement for hundreds of thousands of people to isolate after being ""pinged"" by a government tracing app.
""July's sharp decline in retail sales can be blamed largely on rising COVID-19 cases, which prompted some households to steer clear of shops and forced others into self-isolation,"" said Samuel Tombs, an economist with Pantheon Macroeconomics.
The self-isolation requirement for contacts of someone with COVID-19 has now been dropped for people who have had two vaccinations. 
The ONS said food store sales were down by 1.5%, reflecting a jump in June and the opening of more hospitality venues. Non-food stores reported a fall of 4.4%, though sales remained 5.8% above their pre-pandemic levels in February 2020.
In a possible sign of renewed caution among shoppers, or July's bad weather, online sales rose to 27.9% of total spending after hitting a pandemic low in June.
Earlier this month, Barclaycard said its data for July showed a jump in entertainment spending as people returned to cinemas, theatres and sports events.
BOUNCE-BACK SLOWS 
Britain's economy has recovered most of its nearly 10% slump in 2020 when the country suffered one of the world's heaviest coronavirus death tolls and stayed locked down for longer than many other European nations.
But there are signs that the bounce-back has slowed after a strong March and April as restrictions began to be lifted.
An opinion poll published on Friday by market research firm GfK showed consumer confidence dipped only slightly in August from its highest level since before the pandemic.
But it also showed consumers were less willing to make major purchases and were opting to save more money.
The recovery in the economy has also helped finance minister Rishi Sunak to reduce the government's huge borrowing.
The ONS said the budget deficit in the first four months of the 2021/22 financial year was running 26 billion pounds ($35.43 billion) below an estimate set out by the Office for Budget Responsibility, the government's forecaster, in March.
July's borrowing of 10.4 billion pounds was less than a median forecast of 11.8 billion pounds in the Reuters poll.
Sunak is on course to spend a total of 350 billion pounds in his response to the coronavirus crisis, but his jobs subsidies programme, the most expensive element, is being wound down.
The deficit in July also narrowed thanks to higher tax receipts as individuals filed tax returns before a deadline.

The Institute for Fiscal Studies, a think tank, said the deficit remained huge at 10.8% of economic output in the 12 months to July, more than four times its historic average, and would probably require ""very difficult decisions"" when Sunak gives a half-yearly update on the public finances on Oct. 27.

TOKYO (Reuters) -Japan's core consumer prices narrowed their annual pace of falls for three straight months in July, a sign global commodities inflation was offsetting some of the deflationary pressure from a pandemic-induced spending slump.
But analysts expect consumer inflation to stay well below levels seen in the United States and Europe, as Japan's decision on Tuesday to extend state of emergency curbs into mid-September is seen dealing a blow to already weak household spending.
""Cost-push inflation is driving up goods prices, while service prices remain weak due to the pandemic's impact,"" said Toru Suehiro, an economist at Daiwa Securities.
""Given the increase in Delta variant cases, this trend will continue for the time being.""
Japan's core consumer price index (CPI), which includes oil but excludes fresh food prices, fell 0.2% in July from a year earlier, marking the 12th straight month of declines, government data showed on Friday.
The fall was due in part to a change in the base year for the CPI that gives a heavier weighting to mobile charge fees, which plunged a record 39.6% in July.
But the drop was smaller than market forecasts for a 0.4% fall and a 0.5% decrease in June due to the boost from rising food and fuel costs, including a 19.6% spike in gasoline bills.
Prices of refrigerators and air conditioners, as well as accommodation fees, also rose in a sign some households were keen to spend after hunkering down during repeated stop-and-go state of emergency curbs.
But the pent-up demand is still too weak for companies to pass on rising costs to households as aggressively as their counterparts in western economies, analysts say.
The drop in Japan's consumer prices contrasts sharply with moves in wholesale prices, which spiked 5.6% in July to mark the fastest annual increase in 13 years.
The so-called core-core consumer price index, which strips away not just fresh food but energy costs, fell 0.6% in July from a year earlier.
The data may lead to a cut in the Bank of Japan's inflation forecast at its next quarterly review due in October, as its current projections do not take into account of the base-year effect, some analysts say.
In present projections made in July, the BOJ expects core consumer prices to rise 0.6% in the year ending in March 2022.
""The BOJ's current outlook is based on the scenario that economic activity will start to normalise toward the end of this year,"" said Takeshi Minami, chief economist at Norinchukin Research Institute.
""But the timing of the recovery may be delayed.""

Japan's economy rebounded more than expected in the second quarter after slumping in the first three months of this year, a sign consumption and capital expenditure were recovering from the coronavirus pandemic's initial hit.
But many analysts expect growth to remain modest in the current quarter as curbs reimposed to combat a spike in infections weigh on household spending.

LONDON (Reuters) - Already-expensive British home prices will see further substantial gains over the next few years, bolstered by low borrowing costs, supply shortages and a desire for more living space, a Reuters poll of housing market analysts found.
As in much of the developed world, millions of Britons have spent the past 17 months working from home as measures imposed to contain the coronavirus pandemic shut offices and restricted travel.
That enforced time at home, which has allowed some to accumulate more savings and is likely to continue at least part time, has meant people want more room as they adapt their properties to be both living and working areas.
""The current trend of wanting more space has some way to run. It takes many years for supply to catch up with demand after the type of fundamental shift in buyer requirements over the last year,"" said Ray Boulger at mortgage broker John Charcol.
Asked what would be the biggest driver of UK home prices over the next 12 months, four of 12 respondents to an additional question in the Aug. 13-19 Reuters poll cited a desire for more living space, three named supply shortages and five others said easy monetary policy.
CHEAP MONEY
As the pandemic battered the economy, the Bank of England - like its peers - slashed interest rates to a record low 0.10% and restarted its bond buying programme, making it far cheaper for those who can to pay a mortgage on a home.
""The low cost of borrowing is the thing that underpins house price affordability and therefore house price growth the most,"" said Russell Quirk at real estate firm Proper PR.
""If you look at the correlation between lower interest rates over the last 10 or 12 years and house prices there is a direct correlation - the cheaper money gets the more expensive house prices get.""
On the flip side, when asked what posed the biggest downside risk to prices, six of 12 respondents said higher interest rates. Others mentioned new coronavirus variants, high unemployment or a return to a full-time office working week.
While a Reuters poll of economists earlier this week found the central bank would wait until 2023 before raising interest rates, they did say there was a chance an increase may come sooner than that.
""If things go to plan and we learn to live with COVID-19, tighter monetary policy is probably the biggest risk,"" said Aneisha Beveridge at estate agent Hamptons.
Still, medians in the wider poll of 15 market experts showed house prices would rise 6.0% this year, 3.5% next year and 3.0% in 2023, far outstripping expectations for overall inflation. 
The forecasts for this year and next were higher than in a May poll and the highest since polling began for those periods.
In London they were predicted to rise 2.8% this year, 2.5% in 2022 and 2.4% the following year.
Those price rises mean affordability will worsen over the coming few years, according to six of 12 respondents to an additional question. Four said it would stay the same and two said it would improve.

""Demand will continue to push prices as will low mortgage rates. Yet wage inflation will also boom. The result will be prices that are yet more 'unaffordable' especially for stretched first-time buyers (of property),"" Quirk said. 
The average asking price for a home was 337,371 pounds ($461,962) this month, according to property website Rightmove (OTC:RTMVY), more than 10 times the average British salary. With wage rises unlikely to keep pace with home price increases that affordability gap will probably widen.

A third wave of coronavirus infections and a longer-than-expected lockdown caused the economy, Europe's largest, to shrink by 2.1% in the first three months of the year compared to the previous quarter.
The finance ministry said in its monthly report that sentiment surveys and forward-looking indicators such as truck toll mileage pointed to ""unbroken optimism"" among businesses and high activity in the economy over the summer months.
The re-opening of the economy and falling COVID-19 cases in early summer have pushed up household spending which translated into booming retail sales in May and June, it said.
The economic recovery has also lifted tax revenues, though accumulated tax revenues from January to July are still 1.7% lower compared to the same period in the pre-pandemic year of 2019, the ministry said. This shows what a large hole the pandemic has blown in Germany's public finances.

Finance Minister Olaf Scholz got the green light from parliament to suspend debt limits in the constitution to allow record new borrowing of up to 240 billion euros this year and more than 130 billion euros last year.
Scholz, the centre-left Social Democrat candidate to succeed conservative Angela Merkel as chancellor in a September election, has proposed suspending the debt brake for a third year in a row in 2022 to allow additional borrowing of nearly 100 billion euros next year.

1521,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 19, 2021 05:11PM ET</span>",New Zealand house price 'madness' to leave affordability stretched for years: Reuters poll,"By Vivek Mishra
BENGALURU (Reuters) - New Zealand's runaway housing market, which has accelerated rapidly during the pandemic, will cool next year, according to a Reuters poll of property market analysts, but affordability will stay stretched or worsen over the next few years.
House prices have nearly doubled in the last seven years thanks to super-low interest rates, slashed from 3.50% to 0.25% over that period, leaving first-time homebuyers and low-income earners behind as prices climbed beyond their reach.
After soaring 30% in just the past 12 months, the most among OECD nations, home prices were forecast to jump another 20% this year, according to a Reuters poll of 10 property market analysts taken Aug. 11-19.
With a series of Reserve Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ) interest rate rises set to start in the coming months, that blistering pace of house price appreciation was expected to slow dramatically to 2.5% next year and in 2023.
""While we think the annual (house price rise) is very close to its peak, the ratio of house prices to incomes is simply off the chart,"" said Sharon Zollner, chief economist at ANZ. ""Properties available for sale remain very low, and the only real solution to this madness is to build more houses. 
""But the scary thing is, even if we assume house price inflation from here to the end of time is zero, and that income growth can run at the very solid pace of 5% per annum, it would still take six years for this ratio to return to pre-COVID-19 levels,"" Zollner added. ""Without outright house price falls, it's a slog.""
Only two analysts in the poll forecast a fall in prices, and one of them said not until 2023. All but one who answered a question about affordability over the next two to three years said it would stay the same or worsen.
CONSIDERABLE TIME 
Measures introduced this year by the government and the RBNZ - with rates still at record lows - so far have failed to cool the market.
""Nationwide affordability continues to worsen,"" said Brad Olsen, principal economist at Infometrics. ""(For) house price to income ratios to fall back from around 7 to the more affordable ratio of 3 would require a 56% fall in house prices or a 130% increase in incomes, meaning improved affordability will take a considerable time.""
Earlier this month, the Human Rights Commission announced an inquiry into New Zealand's property market, saying the housing crisis is having a ""punishing impact"" on marginalized communities and is leaving many people homeless.
However, all respondents in the poll to an additional question said central bank and government measures to cool property prices would have a significant impact, including one who said very significant.
Asked what was the biggest downside risk, analysts said higher interest rates or tighter monetary policy.

""The house always wins ... We expect that house prices will continue to rise over the coming year, but that the pace of increase will slow as mortgage rates lift from their recent lows,"" said Michael Gordon, chief economist at Westpac.
""That's likely to take some of the steam coming out of the housing market,"" Gordon added. ""And combined with changes to the tax system, the middle part of the decade is likely to see some modest price declines.""

1522,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 19, 2021 03:56PM ET</span>",U.S. second-quarter growth likely to be revised higher after slew of strong data,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. economic growth for the second quarter is likely to be revised higher following a recent raft of stronger than initially thought data covering that period, which reflected the economy's reopening amid improved public health. 
The Commerce Department's quarterly services survey, or QSS report, on Thursday added to a flow of data such as retail sales and inventories in suggesting that gross domestic product grew much faster than the 6.5% annualized rate reported by the government in its advance estimate last month.
The QSS provided data on services spending and intellectual property products investment, which will be incorporated by the Commerce Department's statistics agency, the Bureau of Economic Analysis, into its second estimate of GDP growth.
""We think these components will be revised up slightly in the BEA's upcoming GDP release as a result of the QSS data,"" said Daniel Silver, an economist at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) in New York.
Following the QSS data, upward revisions to June core retail sales and steady inventory accumulation, economists expect second-quarter GDP growth could be revised to as high as a 7.3% pace, when the BEA to be publishes its second estimate next Thursday. 
The QSS report showed services industry revenue increased 4.0% in the second quarter, and was 5.7% above its pandemic level. The growth in revenue was led by the leisure and hospitality as well as the travel sectors. 
Though a resurgence in COVID-19 infections, driven by the Delta variant of the coronavirus poses a risk, economists were generally optimistic that the services industries would continue to grow in the second half of the year.
""This wave of COVID-19 cases in the U.S. will likely have less economic cost,"" said Ryan Sweet, a senior economist at Moody's (NYSE:MCO) Analytics in West Chester, Pennsylvania. ""A number of the high-frequency measures that we monitor have softened a little, but nothing that raises a red flag.""

Nevertheless, economists at Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) on Wednesday cut their third-quarter GDP growth estimate to a 5.5% rate from a 9% pace, citing higher inflation and the Delta variant. They, however, lifted their forecasts for the fourth quarter and 2022.
The economy is expected to grow by about 7% this year, which would be the strongest performance since 1984.

1523,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 19, 2021 03:30PM ET</span>",Philly Fed factory index falls in July to lowest since December,"By Evan Sully
(Reuters) -Growth in factory activity in the U.S. mid-Atlantic region slowed for the fourth consecutive month in August after hitting its highest pace in nearly half a century earlier this spring, a survey showed on Thursday.
The Philadelphia Federal Reserve Bank said its business activity index fell to 19.4, the lowest since December, from 21.9 in July. That was below economists' expectations for a reading of 23.0, according to a Reuters poll.
Any reading above zero indicates expansion in the region's manufacturing. The survey covers factories in eastern Pennsylvania, southern New Jersey and Delaware.
It is seen as one of the first monthly indicators of the health of U.S. manufacturing leading up to the national report by the Institute for Supply Management, next due out September 1.
Supply constraints have continued to slow manufacturing activity nationwide, indicating that the economics recovery might be slowing down in a year in which growth is projected to accelerate at its fastest pace in nearly four decades. In March, the Philly Fed's factory activity gauge hit its highest level since 1973.
""Manufacturing activity in the mid-Atlantic region will stay entrenched in a solid growth mode through the end of 2021,"" said Oren Klachkin, lead U.S. economist at Oxford Economics. ""There’s still plenty of pent-up activity yet to be released, and solid goods demand and rising capital investment will keep the gears of regional manufacturers turning at a healthy clip.""
The Philly Fed employment index increased to a record-high of 32.6 from 29.2 in July. 
Additionally, the price paid index rose to 71.2 in August from 69.7 in the month prior, after reaching a 42-year high in June.

""Covid still poses the greatest downside risk to the regional recovery currently,"" Klachkin said.
Though manufacturing production at factories surged in July, manufacturing itself is being underpinned by domestic demand. That is effectively straining the supply chain and manufacturers struggling with shortages of both raw materials and labor.

(Reuters) -A gauge of future U.S. economic activity increased in July, suggesting the economy continued to expand from the recession caused by the coronavirus pandemic even in the face of a resurgence in cases fueled by the Delta variant.
The Conference Board on Thursday said its index of leading economic indicators (LEI) rose 0.9% last month to 116.0. Economists polled by Reuters had expected an increase of 0.8%. 
Even though the U.S. economy is forecast to grow this year at its fastest pace since the 1980s, there are signs the recovery could be cooling off. Supply-chain bottlenecks continue to slow manufacturing growth, and consumer sentiment plummeted in early August to a decade-low as Americans gave faltering outlooks on everything from personal finances to inflation and employment.
Meanwhile, consumer price increases slowed in July, the Labor Department said last week, but inflation overall remained at a historically high level amid supply-chain disruptions as well as stronger demand for travel-related services.
""The U.S. LEI registered another large gain in July, with all components contributing positively,"" said Ataman Ozyildirim, the Conference Board's senior director of economic research. ""While the Delta variant and/or rising inflation fears could create headwinds for the U.S. economy in the near term, we expect real GDP (gross domestic product) growth for 2021 to reach 6.0% year-over-year, before easing to a still robust 4.0% growth rate for 2022.""
The LEI's coincident index, a measure of current economic conditions, rose 0.6% in July after increasing 0.4% in June. 

But the lagging index increased 0.6% last month after being unchanged in June and increasing 0.8% in May.
""Even with more moderate growth in the second half of the year, the economy’s momentum remains encouraging with constraints on labor supply easing, a trove of excess savings still waiting to be drawn down, and strong vaccine numbers that will insulate the economy from the worsening health situation more so than prior waves,"" said Mahir Rasheed, U.S. economist at Oxford Economics.

1525,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 19, 2021 11:56AM ET</span>",U.S. weekly jobless claims hit 17-month low; ranks of unemployed shrinking,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits fell to a 17-month low last week, pointing to another month of robust job growth, though surging COVID-19 infections pose a risk to the labor market recovery.
The weekly unemployment claims report from the Labor Department on Thursday, the most timely data on the economy's health, also showed the number of people on state jobless rolls dropped in early August to levels last seen in mid-March 2020, when the economy almost ground to a halt amid mandatory business closures aimed at slowing the first wave of COVID-19 cases.
The labor market's prospects were boosted by other data showing a measure of manufacturing employment in the mid-Atlantic region rose to a record high this month and factories increased hours for workers. But the pace of growth in factory output slowed for a fourth straight month amid scarce raw materials and a shift in spending to services from goods. 
""We can infer that hiring remains strong in August, pointing to a healthy jobs report for this month,"" said Robert Frick, corporate economist at Navy Federal Credit Union in Vienna, Virginia. 
Initial claims for state unemployment benefits fell 29,000 to a seasonally adjusted 348,000 for the week ended Aug. 14. The fourth straight weekly decline pushed claims to their lowest level since mid-March 2020. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast 363,000 applications for the latest week. 
The four-week moving average of initial claims, considered a better measure of labor market trends as it irons out week-to-week volatility dropped 19,000 to 377,750, also a 17-month low.
Last week's decrease in filings was led by Texas. There were also notable declines in Illinois, Kentucky and Michigan. But applications increased in Virginia, California and New Mexico.
Claims have declined from a record 6.149 million in early April 2020. They, however, remain above the 200,000-250,000 range that is seen as consistent with healthy labor market conditions. Claims have been grinding lower, with employers hanging on to their workers amid a labor shortage as vaccinations allow the economy to fully reopen. More than half of the population has been fully immunized against COVID-19.
The drop in claims below the 350,000 level is a major milestone for the economy, which fully recovered in the second quarter the sharp loss in output suffered during the very brief pandemic recession. President Joe Biden hailed the progress, noting that an average of more than 830,000 Americans were filing claims when he took office in January. 
""While our economic recovery is far from complete, the Biden plan to grow the economy from the bottom up and middle out is working and delivering real results for American workers,"" Biden said in a statement. 
Stocks on Wall Street were trading mixed after minutes of the Federal Reserve's July 29-28 policy meeting released on Wednesday showed U.S. central bank officials believed their employment benchmark for decreasing support for the economy ""could be reached this year.""
The dollar gained versus a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices rose.

GOOD OMEN FOR HIRING
The claims data covered the period that the government surveyed business establishments for the nonfarm payrolls portion of August's closely watched employment report. 
With claims firmly below 400,000, payrolls growth likely remained strong after the economy created a whopping 943,000 jobs in July. 
The number of people continuing to receive benefits after an initial week of aid tumbled 79,000 to 2.820 million in the week ended Aug. 7, the lowest level since mid-March 2020. 
Data next week on the so-called continuing claims will offer more clues on how hiring fared in August. But surging COVID-19 infections, driven by the Delta variant of the coronavirus, loom large. Economists at Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) on Wednesday cut their third-quarter GDP growth estimate.
While economists generally do not see large-scale business shutdowns as happened early in the pandemic, there are worries that soaring COVID-19 cases could keep some unemployed people at home, especially if children are unable to attend schools in person.
Lack of childcare facilities and fears of contracting the virus have been blamed for worker shortages, which are partly contributing to employment remaining 5.7 million jobs below its peak in February 2020. There were a record 10.1 million job openings as of the end of June. About 8.7 million people were officially unemployed in July. 
At least 25 states led by Republican governors have pulled out of federal government-funded unemployment programs, including a $300 weekly payment, which businesses claimed were encouraging unemployed Americans to stay at home. There is, however, no evidence that the early termination of federal benefits has led to an increase in hiring in these states.
The government-funded benefits will expire on Sept. 6. At least 11.7 million people were collecting unemployment benefits under all programs at the end of July.
A report from the Philadelphia Fed on Thursday showed its measure of manufacturing activity in the region that covers eastern Pennsylvania, southern New Jersey and Delaware, fell to 19.4 this month from 21.9 in July. Any reading above zero indicates expansion in the region's manufacturing

Manufacturers were also a little less upbeat about business prospects over the next six months. But with inventories depleted, manufacturing is likely to continue growing at a steady clip. 
""Overall the report doesn't signal an obvious big shift in momentum in the manufacturing sector,"" said Daniel Silver, an economist at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) in New York.

1526,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 19, 2021 08:45AM ET</span>",U.S. Initial Unemployment Claims Drop for Fourth Straight Week,"(Bloomberg) -- Applications for U.S. state unemployment benefits dropped for a fourth consecutive week, a trend that suggests labor market conditions are improving as the economy recovers.
Initial unemployment claims in regular state programs dropped 29,000 to 348,000 in the week ended Aug. 14, a pandemic low, Labor Department data showed Thursday. Economists in a Bloomberg survey had called for a decline to 364,000.
Continuing claims for state benefits fell to 2.8 millionin the week ended Aug. 7, also the lowest since the pandemic began.
The decrease in initial claims points to strengthening business and fewer dismissals as economic activity improves. That said, a pickup in initial filings in the next few weeks could point to labor market weakness as the delta variant of Covid-19 spreads. 
Some states and cities have reintroduced mask mandates in recent weeks in response to coronavirus variants, and businesses have pushed back their return-to-office plans. But there’s little evidence so far to suggest the delta variant has resulted in layoffs, especially because restrictions haven’t been put on restaurants, bars and entertainment venues.
Texas and Illinois posted the largest declines in initial claims last week. Virginia posted the largest increase, followed by New Mexico and California. 
More than 20 governors have prematurely ended federal unemployment programs -- including an extra $300 weekly payment -- put into place during the pandemic, hoping that removing the enhanced payments would incentivize workers to look for jobs. Lawsuits in some of those states challenging the governors’ legal authority to end the aid could restore the halted benefits until they officially expire in early September. 
The initial claim figures coincide with the survey week for the Labor Department’s monthly job report.
Continuing claims in all programs declined to 11.7 million in the week ended July 31. That compares to a high of about 32.8 million in June 2020.

The median forecast from a poll of 12 economists expects export orders to jump 20.85% from the year-ago period. Forecasts for growth ranged from 14% to 30%.
Taiwan's export orders are a leading indicator of demand for hi-tech gadgets and Asia's exports, and typically lead actual exports by two to three months.
The island's June export orders, a bellwether of global technology demand, leapt 31.1% year-on-year to $53.73 billion.

Taiwan's manufacturers, such as the world's largest contract chipmaker Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd, are a key part of the global supply chain for technology giants including Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL).
The data for July will be released on Friday.

The jobless rate declined to 4.6% in July, compared with economists forecasts for a rise to 5%, Australian Bureau of Statistics data showed Thursday. The economy added 2,200 positions, versus a forecast 43,100 drop, while the participation rate fell to 66%.
“The labor market changes in New South Wales between June and July had a large influence on the national figures,” Bjorn Jarvis, head of labor statistics at the ABS, said in a statement. “There were big falls in New South Wales in both employment and unemployment, with the labor force reducing by around 64,000 people. In addition, hours worked in New South Wales fell by 7%.”
The Australian dollar edged lower and was trading at 72.17 U.S. cents at 12:06 p.m. in Sydney. 
The resilience is unlikely to last as coronavirus outbreaks have emerged all along the east coast, forcing lockdowns and curtailing activity in Australia’s most populous region. Even so, the Reserve Bank plans to push ahead with its tapering of bond buying next month, wagering the economy will roar back from an expected contraction this quarter.
“Businesses in the travel, hospitality and retail sectors are particularly exposed to domestic travel restrictions, which will weigh on employment in the months to come,” said Sarah Hunter, chief economist for BIS Oxford Economics. “Overall, employment and GDP are set to record a substantial contraction in the September quarter, and momentum will not return until the government’s vaccination targets are reached and restrictions can be materially eased.”
A slow nationwide vaccine rollout is Australia’s biggest obstacle to getting the economy back to normal and reopening borders that were closed in early 2020. 
At one point in July, half of Australia’s population was under stay-at-home orders as South Australia joined Victoria and New South Wales in lockdown down.

Business support groups South West Manufacturing Advisory Service (SWMAS) and Manufacturing Growth Programme said rising supply chain prices had presented difficulties for 96% of respondents. Some 55% described the problem as ""major"".
Global shipping problems, tight supplies of semiconductors and shortages of some goods such as motor vehicles have contributed to rising inflation in many countries.
Thursday's survey suggested the problems were hurting margins among small manufacturers. The proportion expecting profits to rise in the next six month fell to 46% from 52% at the start of this year.
Around half of the firms surveyed said recruitment and transport problems were hindering growth for manufacturers who account for about 10% of British economic output.
""It appears we are seeing the first signs of supply chain struggles starting to hinder the upturn,"" said Nick Golding, managing director of SWMAS.
""The challenges highlighted have been caused in part by government policies as a direct result of Brexit and the COVID-19 pandemic.""

Official data published on Wednesday showed signs of continued inflation pressure in prices paid and charged by factories. Output costs rose in annual terms by the most in nearly 10 years.
Thursday's survey of 260 small and medium-sized British manufacturers was conducted last month.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Confidence among Japanese manufacturers hit a more than three-and-half-year high in August and service-sector sentiment turned positive, the Reuters Tankan poll showed, suggesting the economy was shaking off the drag from the COVID-19 slump.
The monthly poll, which tracks the Bank of Japan's (BOJ) closely watched tankan quarterly survey, found that manufacturers' mood would slip a little while staying buoyant in three months and service-sector sentiment would recover further.
The poll follows a gross domestic product report this week that showed the world's third-largest economy grew an annualised 1.3% in April-June, thanks to brisk exports and stronger-than-expected consumption.
In the Reuters poll of 503 big and medium-sized companies, in which 252 firms responded on condition of anonymity, managers expressed optimism over a demand recovery to pre-coronavirus levels, due to strong overseas orders for products such as high-tech goods.
""The semiconductor market is booming and demand for related materials is strong,"" a manager at a ceramics maker wrote in the poll, adding its industrial products and car parts businesses were benefiting from it.
The Reuters Tankan sentiment index for manufacturers rose to 33 from 25 in July, its highest since January 2018, the poll conducted Aug. 4-16 showed. The service index rose to 5 from minus 3 the previous month, its highest since February last year. 
Some managers, however, worried about uncertainty from the virus and the impact of rising raw material costs and a prolonged state of emergency in parts of Japan that now covers nearly 60% of the population.
""Raw material prices are rising worldwide and there is uncertainty over the outlook,"" a manager at a chemical maker wrote in the survey.
The Reuters Tankan poll showed manufacturers' business confidence was seen falling to 31 in November, while that of service-sector firms was expected to rise to 13.
""Conditions aren't bad considering the coronavirus, but they aren't at a level that should have been expected either,"" a manager at a food maker said.

The BOJ's own ""tankan"" business survey released in July showed business confidence improved to a two-and-half-year high, while service-sector sentiment turned positive for the first time in five quarters.
The Reuters Tankan index readings are calculated by subtracting the percentage of respondents who say conditions are poor from those who say they are good. A positive reading means optimists outnumber pessimists.

The reading is a preliminary estimate of the BLS' annual ""benchmark"" revision to the closely watched payrolls data. The leisure and hospitality sector, which was hardest hit by the COVID-19 pandemic, accounted for the bulk of the revision, with employment growth revised down by 597,000 or 4.6%.
Leisure and hospitality employment is 1.7 million below its peak in February 2020, though the industry has led the labor market recovery from the pandemic.
""It is somewhat ambiguous what this means for future employment in this sector beyond March 2021,"" said Daniel Silver, an economist at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) in New York. 
""This could suggest that more jobs need to be added to return closer to pre-pandemic levels but also that the pandemic-related hit to that sector was more severe and or longer-lasting than previously reported.""
But the transportation and warehousing sector added 247,900 more jobs than previously thought, while professional and business services payrolls were revised up by 214,000. Government employment was raised by 255,000 jobs. 

Once a year, the BLS compares its non-farm payrolls data, based on monthly surveys of a sample of employers, with a much more complete database of unemployment insurance tax records.
A final benchmark revision will be released in February along with the BLS' report on employment for January. Government statisticians will use the final benchmark count to revise payroll data for months both prior to and after March.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. homebuilding fell more than expected in July, the latest sign that surging construction costs and home prices continued to constrain the housing market early in the third quarter.
Though the report from the Commerce Department on Wednesday showed a rebound in building permits after three straight monthly declines, the gain was in the volatile multi-family home segment, which will do little to ease an acute housing shortage that is driving up prices.
The number of houses authorized for construction but not yet started last month was the third highest on record, indicating builders remained hesitant to undertake new projects.
""There is no question that home building has hit some sort of near-term ceiling, with surging home prices reducing affordability and leading to a record drop in the proportion of consumers that feel now is a good time to buy a home,"" said Mark Vitner, a senior economist at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) in Charlotte, North Carolina.
Housing starts dropped 7.0% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.534 million units last month. Data for June was revised up to a rate of 1.650 million units from the previously reported 1.643 million units. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast starts would fall to a rate of 1.600 million units. 
Homebuilding fell in the Northeast, Midwest and West, but rose in the populous South. Starts increased 2.5% on a year-on-year basis in July. Single-family starts, which account for the largest share of the housing market, fell 4.5% to a rate of 1.111 million units. Starts for the multi-family segment tumbled 13.1% to a rate of 423,000 units. 
Permits for future homebuilding rose 2.6% to a rate of 1.635 million units in July. Single-family permits fell 1.7% to a rate of 1.048 million units. They are lagging starts, suggesting a modest rebound in single-family homebuilding.
Permits for multi-family housing projects jumped 11.2% to a rate of 587,000 units, reflecting a rebound in demand for rental accommodation as the economy fully reopens.
The report followed on the heels of a survey from the National Association of Home Builders on Tuesday showing confidence among single-family homebuilders dropped to a 13-month low in August because of higher material costs and home prices, which are cooling demand for houses.
Stocks on Wall Street were mixed in volatile trade. The dollar was steady against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices fell.
HIGH HOUSE PRICES   
Building costs remain an issue even though lumber futures have tumbled from a record high of $1,711 per thousand board feet in May. Land and labor shortages persist.
Homebuilding has struggled to gain traction since racing to a rate of 1.725 million units in March, which was the highest level since June 2006. 
Housing demand boomed during the COVID-19 pandemic, which fueled a migration from cities to the suburbs and other low-density areas as Americans sought spacious accommodations for home offices and schooling. The robust demand, also driven by record-low mortgage rates, far outpaced supply. 
The inventory of previously owned homes is near record lows, leading to double-digit annual growth in home prices. 
But the pandemic tailwind is gradually fading as vaccinations allow companies to recall workers back to offices in city centers and schools reopen for in-person learning for the new academic year. 
Potential homebuyers are also balking at the high house prices. A report from the Mortgage Bankers Association on Wednesday showed applications for loans to buy a home decreased last week.
Residential investment contracted in the second quarter after three straight quarters of double-digit growth. A modest rebound is expected in the third quarter.
Last month, building permits fell in the Northeast and South. They rose in the West and Midwest. 
The backlog of homes yet to be started increased 2.6% to 241,000 units, the third-highest reading in the series' history, which should help to keep housing starts supported.
""Some of these permitted units that haven't been started will be canceled, but most will eventually show up as starts as homebuilders work through their pipeline of homes under construction, supply chain bottlenecks are resolved, and prices of critical inputs such as lumber come off the boil,"" said Ryan Sweet, a senior economist at Moody's (NYSE:MCO) Analytics in West Chester, Pennsylvania.
Housing completions jumped 5.6% to a rate of 1.391 million units last month. Single-family home completions increased 3.6% to a rate of 954,000 units. The pandemic has lengthened the time from when a permit is issued for single-family home construction to completion, which economists blamed on supply constraints.
Realtors estimate that single-family housing starts and completion rates need to be in a range of 1.5 million to 1.6 million units per month to close the inventory gap.

The stock of housing under construction climbed 0.4% to a rate of 1.373 million units last month.
""Solid housing demand and low inventory will incentivize homebuilders and support housing starts, but higher input and labor costs will temper activity,"" said Oren Klachkin, lead U.S. economist at Oxford Economics in New York. ""We expect a modest pickup in housing starts in third quarter in the wake of last quarter's 2% decline.""

(Reuters) - Mortgage applications declined last week, especially for refinancing, as mortgage rates rose back over 3% for the first time in about a month.
The Mortgage Bankers Association (MBA) said on Wednesday its average contract interest rate for traditional 30-year mortgages inched up to 3.06% from 2.99% in the week ending Aug. 13. The seasonally adjusted market index tracking mortgage applications fell 3.9% from a week earlier, reflecting a 5.3% decrease in applications to refinance existing loans. 
After hitting record lows late last year below 2.9%, mortgage rates climbed in the first part of this year and peaked in the spring. Rates had been drifting lower since, held down in large part by the U.S. Federal Reserve's extraordinary stimulus measures aimed at helping the economy rebound from the coronavirus pandemic, but ticked higher last week after data showed a hiring surge last month.

""Mortgage rates followed an overall increase in Treasury yields last week, which started higher from the strong July jobs report before slowing because of weaker consumer sentiment and concerns about rising COVID-19 cases,"" said Joel Kan, MBA’s associate vice president of economic and industry forecasting. ""The eligible pool of homeowners who stand to benefit from a refinance is smaller now.""
Purchase applications declined 0.8%, the MBA said.

House prices were 13.2% higher than in June 2020, the Office for National Statistics said, following a 9.8% annual increase in May.
Finance minister Rishi Sunak cut stamp duty, a tax on house purchases, in July 2020. But from last month it started to return to its pre-pandemic level.
The tax cut aimed to reverse a slump in property sales at the start of the pandemic, and helped fuel a surge in property prices and some new construction. Many households were already seeking more spacious housing suited to working from home.
""Prices went berserk as the stamp duty taper closed in,"" said Lucy Pendleton from London-based estate agent James Pendleton.

More timely gauges of the housing market suggest the market has cooled a little since June - but only a little.
At the top end of the scale, house prices in the north west of England rose in June by 18.6% in annual terms, the ONS said. London stood at the bottom end but house prices there were still up 6.3%.

LONDON (Reuters) -British inflation fell to the Bank of England's 2% target last month in an unexpectedly sharp slowdown that economists said was most likely a blip as the reopening of the economy after lockdown drives prices higher.
Economists polled by Reuters had expected Wednesday's official data to show a 2.3% rise in consumer prices in July following a 2.5% rise in June.
Sterling showed little reaction to the figures as investors judged they were unlikely to alter the rising trend for inflation and would not sway Bank of England policymakers much.
Earlier this month the BoE said it expected to tighten monetary policy moderately over the next three years. 
July's slowdown in inflation reflected a jump in prices in the same month last year when Britain's economy was emerging from its first coronavirus lockdown.
Prices of clothing and footwear and computers, games and toys also dragged on the rate of price growth last month, the Office for National Statistics said.
""The fall in year-on-year inflation last month masks the strength of inflationary pressures currently within the UK economy,"" Yael  Selfin, chief economist at KPMG UK, said.
Earlier this month the BoE said it expected inflation to jump to 4.0% around the end of the year, which would be a decade high. But the BoE stuck to its view that the acceleration of inflation would prove to be temporary.
""We see inflation falling back to around 2% at the end of next year as production facilities expand, requiring only minimal tightening by the Bank of England in the short term,"" Selfin said.
As in earlier months, Wednesday's figures showed second-hand cars were a big driver of inflation in July - a phenomenon also seen in the United States.
Global shipping problems, tight supplies of semiconductors and shortages of some goods such as motor vehicles have contributed to rising inflation in many countries.

The ONS data showed signs of continued inflation pressure in prices paid and charged by factories.
Output costs rose in annual terms by the most in nearly 10 years, increasing by 4.9% compared with July last year. Input costs also rose by more than expected, jumping by almost 10%.

TOKYO (Reuters) -Japan's exports marked a fifth straight month of double-digit growth in July, driven by U.S.-bound shipments of automobiles in a positive sign for a trade-led economy, although a key gauge of capital spending fell for the first time in four months.
The mixed batch of indicators underscored fragility in the world's third-largest economy, which grew 1.3% in the April-June quarter due to solid exports and a surprise gain in private consumption.
However, prolonged coronavirus curbs on bars, restaurants and other face-to-face service sector businesses cloud the outlook, piling pressure on Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga to deploy another big stimulus package.
Ministry of Finance data out on Wednesday showed Japanese exports grew 37.0% year-on-year in July, a tad slower than a 39.0% increase expected by economists in a Reuters poll, although the gain was exaggerated by the contrast to the prior year's COVID-induced slump.
It followed a 48.6% growth in the prior month.
""Exports remained in an uptrend, which will continue in the coming months even though car production may face supply constraint due to chip shortages,"" said Yoshimasa Maruyama, chief economist at SMBC Nikko Securities.
""Although the service sector may take a hit from a prolonged COVID pandemic, corporate capital spending and output will stay on firm footing,"" he said.
Still, Suga may roll out stimulus package of around 30 trillion yen ($274 billion), which will be used as a show of political will to back the economy at the time of the elections, Maruyama added.
By region, exports to China, Japan's largest trading partner, rose 18.9% in the year to July, led by chip-making equipment and plastic, the data showed.
U.S.-bound shipments, another key market for Japanese goods, grew 26.8% in July led by exports of cars, car parts and motors, it showed.
Imports rose 28.5% in the year to July, versus the median estimate for a 35.1% increase, bringing the trade balance to a surplus of 441 billion yen ($4 billion), compared with the median estimate for a 202.3 billion yen surplus.
Brisk external demand has helped underpin Japan's factory activity although a global chip shortage and signs of stalling in China's economic recovery are sources of concern.
Separate data by the Cabinet Office showed core machinery orders, a highly volatile indicator of capital spending for the coming six to nine months, fell 1.5% in June from the previous month, versus a 2.8% decline expected by economists in a Reuters poll.

Year-on-year, core orders, which exclude those of ships and electricity utilities, jumped 18.6% in June, a third straight month of annual gain, prompting the Cabinet Office to maintain its view machinery orders are showing signs of pick-up.

1537,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 17, 2021 05:40PM ET</span>",U.S. homebuilder confidence falls to 13-month low in August,"By Evan Sully
(Reuters) -U.S. homebuilder confidence in the market for single-family homes fell in August to its lowest reading in 13 months, driven by higher construction costs and supply shortages, a report released on Tuesday showed.
The NAHB/Wells Fargo Housing Market index declined 5 points to a reading of 75 this month, its lowest level since July 2020, from 80 in July. Economists polled by Reuters had expected the index to remain unchanged from the month prior. 
A reading above 50 means more builders view market conditions as favorable than poor. The index hit an all-time high of 90 in November 2020.
Surging home prices and limited supply has put a lid on home sales throughout this year. Consequently, fewer U.S. consumers believe that now is a good time to purchase a home.
""Some prospective buyers are experiencing sticker shock due to higher construction costs,"" said NAHB Chairman Chuck Fowke. ""While the demographics and interest for home buying remain solid, higher costs and material access issues have resulted in lower levels of home building and even put a hold on some new home sales.""
The NAHB survey's measure of single-family home sales expectations in the next six months held steady at a reading of 81 in August, while a gauge of current sales conditions decreased 5 points to 81.
The prospective buyers index fell 5 points to 60.
""Many of the constraints exacerbated by Covid, including high materials prices, a limited supply of workers and limited land plots for construction, will continue dragging on homebuilder activity heading into the autumn,"" said Oren Klachkin, lead U.S. economist at Oxford Economics. ""For instance, while lumber prices have come down, plenty of raw materials are still very expensive.""
The report also revealed some regional divergences that may indicate an impact from the surge in the Delta variant of the coronavirus, with most of the report's softness concentrated in the South and Midwest where caseloads have been rising the fastest.

NAHB's Midwest index dropped to its lowest reading since June 2020, while its gauge tracking the South declined to its lowest level since July 2020. That contrasted with the West region, which ticked up 1 point, and the Northeast, which rose to a 4-month high.
""I think the surge in Covid cases in those regions might have contributed to the decline in prospective buyer traffic, helping to drag down the overall index,"" said Nancy Vanden Houten, lead economist at Oxford Economics. Still, ""I think any impact from the virus was probably at the margin and that higher home prices, which are making homebuying unaffordable for many, played a bigger role.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. retail sales fell more than expected in July as shortages depressed motor vehicle purchases and the boost to spending from the economy's reopening and stimulus checks faded, suggesting a slowdown in economic growth early in the third quarter.
The weak sales reported by the Commerce Department on Tuesday also reflected a rotation in spending back to services from goods. Retail sales mostly capture the goods component of consumer spending, which accounts for a smaller share, with bulky services such as healthcare, travel and hotel accommodation making up the rest.
The school year gets into full swing later in August and most education districts are reverting to in-person learning. As such, consumer spending is likely to remain strong and keep the economy growing, though rising COVID-19 cases and a plunge in consumer sentiment this month to a decade low are wild cards.
""If anything, today's data suggests that spending is not keeping pace at the start of the third quarter after the fiscal stimulus-fueled and re-opening-led surge in consumption growth in second quarter,"" said Kevin Cummins (NYSE:CMI), chief U.S. economist at NatWest Markets in Stamford, Connecticut. 
""We still expect sales to bounce back for the quarter as a whole. Spending will benefit from recent strength in job gains and a boost from back-to-school spending as kids begin to return to in-school classrooms.""
Retail sales dropped 1.1% last month. Data for June was revised up to show retail sales increasing 0.7% instead of rising 0.6% as previously reported. Retail sales are 17.2% above their pre-pandemic level.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast retail sales slipping 0.3%. Sales increased 15.8% compared to July last year. 
Receipts at auto dealerships fell 3.9% after declining 2.2% in June. Motor vehicle production has been hampered by a global shortage of semiconductors. 
There was some encouraging news, with a separate report from the Federal Reserve on Tuesday showing motor vehicle output surged 11.2% in July as automakers either pared or canceled annual retooling shutdowns to work around the chip shortage. That boosted manufacturing production last month. 
Online retail sales dropped 3.1%, payback after Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) pulled forward its Prime Day to June from July. Sales at clothing stores fell 2.6%. A rebound is expected as parents shop for the new school year. Qualifying households in mid-July started receiving money under the expanded Child Tax Credit program, which will run through December.
Sales at building material stores fell as did receipts at sporting goods, hobby, musical instrument and book stores. 
But consumers increased spending at restaurants and bars, leading to a 1.7% rise in receipts. Sales at restaurants and bars increased 38.4% compared to July 2020. Restaurants and bars are the only services category in the retail sales report.
Sales at electronics and appliance stores gained 0.3%.
The National Retail Federation said July's decline did ""nothing to derail our outlook for a record year,"" noting that consumer finances were in good shape. The labor market is strengthening, while higher stock and house prices are boosting household wealth. 
Stocks on Wall Street slipped after the benchmark S&P 500 and the Dow industrials closed at record highs on Monday. The dollar rose against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices were higher.

DELTA VARIANT WILD CARD
Excluding automobiles, gasoline, building materials and food services, retail sales fell 1.0% last month after an upwardly revised 1.4% increase in June. These so-called core retail sales correspond most closely with the consumer spending component of gross domestic product. They were previously estimated to have accelerated 1.1% in June.
Spending is shifting from goods to services like travel and entertainment, with more than 50% of the United States' population fully vaccinated against COVID-19.
Rising infections driven by the Delta variant of the coronavirus could, however, slow the services spending boom.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in late July urged fully vaccinated Americans to resume wearing masks in indoor public places in areas where the virus is surging.
""We've long held the view that discretionary services would lift overall consumer spending this year as the economy trended back to some semblance of normal,"" said Tim Quinlan, a senior economist at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) in Charlotte, North Carolina. ""But now with the resurgence of COVID, those gains may be more tepid."" 
Still, the foundation for consumer spending growth remains strong. Employers are raising wages as they try to fill a record 10.1 million job openings. Households are sitting on at least $2.5 trillion in excess savings accumulated during the pandemic. 
Consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, notched double-digit growth in the second quarter, helping to pull the level of GDP above its peak in the fourth quarter of 2019.

The economy grew at a 6.5% annualized rate in the second quarter. The anticipated slowdown in consumer spending was likely to be offset by strong growth elsewhere. With the latest data in hand, including reports from the Treasury and Labor Department, the Atlanta Fed raised its GDP growth estimate for the third quarter to a 6.2% rate from a 6.0% pace.
""A slower pace of consumer spending in the months ahead could act to dampen overall growth, but likely only modestly so,"" said Ben Ayers, a senior economist at Nationwide in Columbus, Ohio.

1539,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 17, 2021 10:21AM ET</span>",U.S. business inventories rise solidly in June,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. business inventories increased strongly in June, though raw material shortages continue to frustrate efforts by motor vehicle retailers to restock.
Business inventories rose 0.8% after advancing 0.6% in May, the Commerce Department said on Tuesday. Inventories are a key component of gross domestic product. June's increase was in line with economists' expectations.
Inventories increased 6.6% on a year-on-year basis in June.
Retail inventories gained 0.3% in June as estimated in an advance report published last month. That followed a 0.9% drop in May.
Motor vehicle inventories decreased 0.3% as estimated last month. A global semiconductor shortage is undercutting auto production, leading to stocks being run down and holding back retail sales.
Retail inventories excluding autos, which go into the calculation of GDP, increased 0.5%, instead of 0.6% as estimated last month.
Business inventories were depleted at a rapid clip in the second quarter amid booming domestic demand fueled by massive fiscal stimulus and the economy's reopening following disruptions early in the COVID-19 pandemic.
The government reported last month that consumer spending picked up in the second quarter, with outlays on goods rising solidly, even as demand rotates back to services because of COVID-19 vaccinations. The double-digit growth in consumer spending last quarter helped to lift the level of GDP above its peak in the fourth quarter of 2019.
Inventory rebuilding is expected to underpin economic growth in the second half of the year.
Wholesale inventories increased 1.1% in June. Stocks at manufacturers advanced 1.0%.
Business sales increased 1.4% in June after falling 0.2% in May. At June's sales pace, it would take 1.25 months for businesses to clear shelves, down from 1.26 months in May.

1540,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 17, 2021 09:45AM ET</span>",U.S. manufacturing production accelerates on autos in July,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Production at U.S. factories surged in July, boosted by an acceleration in motor vehicle output as auto makers either pared or canceled annual retooling shutdowns to work around a global semiconductor shortage. 
Manufacturing output jumped 1.4% last month after falling 0.3% in June, the Federal Reserve said on Tuesday. 
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast manufacturing production rising 0.6%.
Last month, production at auto plants soared 11.2%. The shortage of semiconductors has forced auto companies to adjust their production schedules. The Fed noted that ""a number of vehicle manufacturers trimmed or canceled their typical July shutdowns,"" when they retool their plants.
Despite the surge, production of motor vehicles and parts in July was about 3.5% below its recent peak in January 2021, the Fed said. 
Excluding autos, manufacturing output rose 0.7% in July. Overall manufacturing in July was 0.8% above its pre-pandemic level. Manufacturing, which accounts for 11.9% of the U.S. economy, is being underpinned by strong domestic demand. But that is straining the supply chain, leaving manufacturers struggling with shortages of raw materials and labor. 
The situation could be worsened by the resurgence in COVID-19 infections from the Delta variant of the coronavirus.
The increase in manufacturing output and a 1.2% rise in mining combined to boost industrial production by 0.9% last month. Industrial output rose 0.2% in June. Mining was driven by higher oil prices, which are supporting drilling activity. Utilities output fell 2.1%.

Capacity utilization for the manufacturing sector, a measure of how fully firms are using their resources, increased 1.1 percentage points to 76.6% in July. Overall capacity use for the industrial sector rose 0.7 percentage point to 76.1%. It is 3.5 percentage points below its 1972-2020 average.
Officials at the U.S. central bank tend to look at capacity use measures for signals of how much ""slack"" remains in the economy — how far growth has room to run before it becomes inflationary.

The value of overall retail purchases dropped 1.1% last month following a upwardly revised 0.7% increase in June, Commerce Department figures showed Tuesday. The median estimate in a Bloomberg survey of economists called for a 0.3% decrease. Excluding autos, sales decreased 0.4% in July.
The data suggest that consumers are beginning to curb spending on merchandise in favor of services now that many pandemic-related restrictions have been lifted. At the same time, the emergence of the delta variant poses a risk to economic activity and could curb demand for services like travel and entertainment.
Higher prices for things like groceries, meals out, personal care and apparel risk limiting discretionary spending in the coming months. A report last week from the University of Michigan showed buying conditions deteriorated to the lowest since April of last year as inflation remained elevated. The retail sales data are not adjusted for price changes.
Economists forecast consumer spending to grow at an annualized 4.5% pace in the current period, significantly slower than the pace estimated a month ago and a sharp deceleration from the sizzling 11.8% rate seen in the second quarter.
This week includes earnings reports from many retailers, including  Target  Corp. (NYSE:TGT) and Macy’s Inc. Earlier Tuesday, Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc. posted stronger-than-expected comparable sales and the retail giant boosted its full-year outlook.
Results from  Home Depot  Inc (NYSE:HD)., however, showed weaker-than-expected results that signal a cooling in the home-improvement boom.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) -The euro zone economy grew 2% in the second quarter, the European Union statistics office said on Tuesday, confirming its earlier reading as the easing of coronavirus restrictions spurred economic activity after a brief recession.
In a separate release Eurostat also said that employment in the 19-nation bloc grew 0.5% in the April-June period compared to the previous quarter, in line with forecasts of economists polled by Reuters.
The healthy 2% increase in gross domestic product (GDP) compared to the previous quarter was paired with a 13.6% rise from the same period last year, when the euro zone economy suffered the worst phase of the pandemic.
The annual GDP reading was slightly revised downward from Eurostat's earlier estimate of 13.7% growth, released at the end of July.
The quarter-on-quarter growth followed two quarters of GDP decline with the euro zone economy shrinking by 0.6% in the last quarter of 2020 and by 0.3% in January-March.
The GDP growth fuelled a rise in employment in April-June, with the indicator increasing 0.5% on the quarter and 1.8% on the year. The annual growth was above forecasts of a 1.5% rebound after a series of falls.
Strong growth is expected to continue in the third quarter, said Jessica Hinds of research firm Capital Economics, forecasting a limited fallout on the euro zone economy from the spread of the more contagious Delta variant of the new coronavirus.
HOUSEHOLD SPENDING
Despite the robust rebound in the second quarter, the euro zone economy remains some 3% smaller than it was at the end of 2019, unlike the U.S. and Chinese economies, which have pulled above their pre-pandemic peaks.
Among the euro zone's largest economies, Spain and Italy posted the largest GDP rises, growing respectively by 2.8% and 2.7% on the quarter, Eurostat data showed, confirming its previous reading.
Italy, which was among the euro zone's worst hit countries last year, grew also in the first quarter of 2021, when the bloc's GDP fell.
Germany and France recorded more moderate GDP increases, respectively of 1.5% and 0.9% on the quarter.
A third final release of GDP figures for the second quarter will be issued by Eurostat on Sept 7. That reading will include a breakdown by economic sectors. 
Available data from euro zone countries show that household spending was a major driver of growth in the second quarter, with figures released on Tuesday by the Netherlands indicating a nearly 6% jump in consumer spending there as bars and restaurants were allowed to gradually reopen from March after a six-month lockdown.
Trade is also contributing to the economic expansion. In June euro zone exports of goods outside the bloc rose by more than 20% on the year to nearly 210 billion euros ($247 billion), Eurostat said last week.

Industry output has instead fallen both in June and May on the month, more than offseting a production rise in April, Eurostat data showed.

LONDON (Reuters) -The number of employees on British company payrolls has moved closer to pre-pandemic levels and pay growth hit a record high, albeit distorted by the effects of coronavirus lockdowns, official data showed on Tuesday.
As Britain's economy extends its recovery from last year's slump, payrolls https://tmsnrt.rs/3xWIyjQ rose by 182,000 in July to 28.9 million - 201,000 below the level before the COVID-19 pandemic hit.
The Office for National Statistics also said the headline unemployment rate fell to 4.7% in the three months to June, its lowest since the three months to August 2020. 
Economists polled by Reuters had mostly expected the unemployment rate to hold at 4.8%.
The figures are likely to bolster Bank of England officials' confidence that the economy will emerge from the pandemic with less long-term damage than first feared by many forecasters.
""Overall, today's report once again points to a rapidly firming labour market,"" said Investec economist Ellie Henderson.
""However, with the latest data indicating that 1.9 million people were still in furloughed employment in June, the real test will be how the labour market responds to the ending of the furlough scheme in September,"" she said, referring to the government's job-retention scheme. 
On the strength of Tuesday's labour market report, JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) brought forward its forecast for the first BoE interest rate increase by six months to the second quarter of 2022 - broadly in line with expectations in financial markets. 
A Reuters poll of economists published on Monday suggested the BoE would wait until 2023, despite the bounce-back in the economy. [ECILT/GB]
The ONS said hours worked in a week surpassed the 1 billion mark for the first time since the pandemic began and there was no sign of a surge in redundancies before the expiry of the furlough programme at the end of September. At its peak, in May 2020, the scheme paid the wages on 8.9 million jobs.
""I know there could still be bumps in the road but the data is promising,"" finance minister Rishi Sunak said. 
The BoE believes unemployment has probably peaked and no longer expects a jump when the furlough scheme ends.
Vacancies in the three months to July hit a record high of 953,000, up by 168,000 on their pre-pandemic level, the ONS said. Many employers have said they are struggling to find staff as the economy emerges from lockdowns.
PAY POWERS HIGHER
The ONS said average weekly earnings in the three months to the end of June rose by 8.8% compared with a year earlier - the highest reading since records started 20 years ago but skewed upwards by the effects of the pandemic.
More people on low wages lost their jobs than people who are better paid.
The average weekly earning figures for the May-July period, due to be published next month, are used in the ""triple lock"" process for deciding the increase in the value of state pensions. 
Sunak has suggested he will not automatically follow that process this year.
Underlying total pay could be rising at between 4.9% and 6.3% a year, the ONS said, noting uncertainties about how the estimates were reached.

Samuel Tombs, an economist at consultancy Pantheon Macroeconomics, said he thought pay growth was likely to lose momentum after the end of the furlough programme.
""As such, there is enough slack in the labour market to prevent wage growth concerning the (Bank of England),"" he said.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Foreign holdings of U.S. Treasuries in June climbed to their highest since February 2020, Treasury Department data showed on Monday, in what analysts described as broad-based demand that helped drive yields lower for the month.
Major foreign holders held $7.202 trillion in Treasuries, up from $7.135 trillion in May. Foreign holdings of Treasuries in June were the second largest on record. The month also saw about $67 billion in Treasury purchases, the largest monthly increase in a year.
""Some of the biggest additions to foreign Treasury holdings were in custodian countries such as Ireland, Cayman Islands, and Luxembourg, which tells me that buying was pretty broad-based,"" said Gennadiy Goldberg, senior U.S. rates strategist, at TD Securities in New York.
""This is consistent with the rally in Treasuries during the month. You obviously had buying in May and June, but it looks like in June, it had the effect of driving rates lower,"" he added. 
U.S. benchmark 10-year Treasury yields started June with a yield of 1.6062%, falling 14 basis points to 1.4680% by the end of that month. 
Japan remains the largest non-U.S. holder of Treasuries with holdings of $1.277 trillion in June, from $1.266 trillion the previous month.
China's holdings, on the other hand, declined to $1.061 trillion in June, from $1.078 trillion in May. China's June holdings were the lowest since October 2020.
On a transaction basis, foreigners bought $10.86 billion in Treasuries, after selling $93.36 billion in May, data showed. U.S. Treasury outflows in May were the largest since April 2020. 
In March this year, Treasuries showed record inflows of $118.87 billion.
Data also showed U.S. corporate bonds had inflows for a sixth straight month with $13.835 billion in June, from $17.31 billion in May.

Foreign investors, meanwhile, bought $25.2 billion in U.S. equities in June after selling $2.4 billion in May.

The regional Fed's ""Empire State"" index on current business conditions fell around 25 points to 18.3, lower than a reading of 29.0 forecast by analysts polled by Reuters. The index had hit a record high of 43 in July.
A reading above zero signals the New York manufacturing sector is expanding.
Supply constraints have continued to slow manufacturing activity nationwide, indicating that the economic recovery might be cooling off in a year in which growth is projected to accelerate at its fastest pace in almost four decades.
The headline index was lower than all but one of the 30 estimates in the Reuters forecast, and the 24.7 point drop was the largest since April 2020, early on in the pandemic.
""We expect constraints on pandemic-stricken supply chains and labor markets to ease gradually in the coming months, but these headwinds risk staying strong as the Delta variant spreads rapidly,"" said Oren Klachkin, lead U.S. economist at Oxford Economics. 
New York's manufacturing firms were optimistic, however. The survey's six-month outlook gauge rose seven points to 46.5. 

The indexes for future new orders and shipments rose to similar levels. 
""Looking ahead, solid goods demand, rising business investment, and revitalizing growth overseas will keep manufacturing’s gears churning healthily into 2022,"" Klachkin said.

1547,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 16, 2021 06:58AM ET</span>","China economy under pressure as factory output, retail sales growth slow sharply","By Kevin Yao and Gabriel Crossley
BEIJING (Reuters) -China's factory output and retail sales growth slowed sharply and missed expectations in July, as new COVID-19 outbreaks and floods disrupted business operations, adding to signs the economic recovery is losing momentum.
Industrial production in the world's second largest economy increased 6.4% year-on-year in July, data from the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) showed on Monday. Analysts had expected output to rise 7.8% after growing 8.3% in June.
Retail sales increased 8.5% in July from a year ago, far lower than the forecast 11.5% rise and June's 12.1% uptick.
China's economy has rebounded to its pre-pandemic growth levels, but the expansion is losing steam as businesses grapple with higher costs and supply bottlenecks. New COVID-19 infections in July also led to fresh restrictions, disrupting the country's factory output already hit by severe weather this summer.
Asian share markets slipped on Monday after the data showed a surprisingly sharp slowdown in the engine of global growth.
Data earlier this month also showed export growth, which has been a key driver of China's impressive rebound from the COVID-19 slump in early 2020, unexpectedly slowed in July.
Consumption, industrial production and investment could all slow further in August, analysts from Nomura said in a note, due to COVID-19 controls and tightening measures in the property sector and high-polluting industries.
Production controls sent crude steel output to the lowest monthly level since April 2020 in July.
Meanwhile China tightened social restrictions to fight its latest COVID-19 outbreak in several cities, hitting the services sector, especially travel and hospitality in the country.
""Given China's 'zero tolerance' approach to Covid, future outbreaks will continue to pose significant risk to the outlook, even though around 60% of the population is now vaccinated,"" said Louis Kuijs, head of Asia economics at Oxford Economics, in a note.
The country has also faced severe weather in several provinces, with record rainfall in Henan province last month causing floods that killed more than 300 people.
Higher commodity prices are also pressuring small and medium-sized firms in particular. Smaller companies are unable to pass on recent rises in raw material costs to buyers, said a sales manager at a medical equipment factory in the eastern province of Jiangsu.
""We don't dare to increase our prices...but our prices cannot fall, otherwise there will be no profit at all,"" he said.
China's producer price inflation, which grew 9.0% from a year earlier in July, will likely remain high for some time, the NBS said on Monday.
GROWTH OUTLOOK
A growing number of analysts have been cutting their third quarter growth estimates for China. The country's gross domestic product (GDP) expanded 7.9% in the April-June quarter from a year earlier.
ANZ downgraded its GDP forecast for 2021 to 8.3% from 8.8% after the disappointing July data.
""Although they are unlikely to inject massive stimulus to boost headline growth, the central bank will maintain an easing bias,"" said ANZ analysts in a note. 
After the central bank reduced the amount of cash banks must hold as reserves in July, many analysts expect another cut later this year to support growth.
China's central bank injected billions of yuan through medium-term loans into the financial system on Monday, which many market participants interpreted as an effort to prop up the economy, although the cost of such borrowing was left unchanged.
Policy insiders told Reuters earlier in August that China is poised to quicken spending on infrastructure projects while the central bank supports the economy with modest easing steps.
Fixed asset investment grew 10.3% in January-July from the same period a year ago, compared with an 11.3% rise tipped by a Reuters poll and a 12.6% increase in January-June.

Property investment, a crucial growth driver of China's recovery from COVID-19 disruptions, grew 12.7% in January-July, versus a 15% rise in the first half of this year.
China's new home prices rose at the slowest clip in six months in July, as authorities further tightened rules in the red-hot property sector.

Average new home prices in China's 70 major cities rose 0.3% in July from a month earlier, slowing from a 0.5% gain in June, according to Reuters calculations based on data released by the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS).
Separate data showed property investment also rose at a slower pace in January-July from a year earlier, amid tightened financing rules.
China's property market rebounded quickly from the COVID-19 crisis last year, triggering concerns about financial risks in an overheated market.
That has prompted authorities to step up curbs this year, including restrictions on borrowing by developers, caps on banks' lending to the sector, guiding banks to raise mortgage rates and a crackdown on illegal funding in the market.
""In most cities, both newly built and resale homes have seen a clear slowdown in price growth,"" said Zhang Dawei, chief analyst with property agency Centaline.
""The housing price growth is expected to continue to soften, as the credit policy returns to normal (from easy to tight),"" Zhang said.
Last month, a top decision-making body of the ruling Communist Party repeated an earlier government warning that ""homes are for living in, not for speculation"".
Authorities in the southern tech hub of Shenzhen earlier this month said that 2.155 billion yuan ($332.46 million) of loans meant for business use had been unlawfully used for home purchases.
Price growth in China's biggest cities such as Shanghai and Beijing eased in July to 0.4% from June's 0.7% growth, the NBS said.
In Beijing, which has China's most stringent property curbs, residents are not allowed to buy additional homes after owning two properties.
Centaline's Zhang said authorities had slapped a record 380 new curbs on the sector this year.
Prices in smaller tier-three cities rose 0.2% on-month, versus a 0.3% gain in June. Tier-two cities, which include some provincial capitals, gained 0.4%, slowing from June's 0.5% rise.
In August, Jinhua, a small city in eastern Zhejiang province, and Huizhou, in southern Guangdong province, took action after the housing ministry told them to strengthen controls.
The softening has spread with 51 cities reporting month-on-month gains in July, the smallest number since January and down from 55 in June.
Compared with a year earlier, China's new home prices grew 4.6% in July, down from a 4.7% increase in June.

1549,By Investing.com,"<span>Aug 16, 2021 01:19AM ET</span>","China’s July Industrial Output and Retail Sales Disappoint, Recovery Slows Down","By Gina Lee
Investing.com – China's factory output and retail sales grew at a slower pace in July, signaling that the economic recovery in the world's second-largest economy is losing momentum. Business operations were disrupted by the latest COVID-19 outbreak and adverse weather, which also contributed to the disappointing data.
National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) data released earlier in the day said industrial production rose 6.4% year-on-year in July, down from the 7.8% in forecasts prepared in Investing.com and the 8.3% growth recorded in June. Retail sales grew 8.5% year-on-year in the same month, also down from the 11.5% growth in Investing.com forecasts and June’s 12.1% growth.
Although China’s economy has recovered to pre-COVID-19 growth levels, businesses are facing higher costs and supply bottlenecks that are causing the growth to lose steam.
China's recovery also remains uneven due to sporadic COVID-19 outbreaks and natural disasters, NBS spokesperson Fu Linghui said at a briefing earlier in the day.
The country tightened restrictive measures in several cities thanks to its latest COVID-19 outbreak, hitting the services sector, particularly travel and hospitality, hard.
“July’s data suggest the economy is losing steam very fast... the resurgence of delta also adds extra risk to August’s activities,” Australia and New Zealand Banking Group chief economist for Greater China Raymond Yeung told Reuters.
Severe weather in some provinces, with July's record rainfall in Henan province causing floods that killed more than 300 people, added to the country’s woes.
All this could impact the government’s growth target, currently set at a modest above-6% for 2021. However, the data could prompt investors to lower their growth forecasts for 2021, which currently stand at a median of 8.5%, according to Bloomberg.
The People’s Bank of China on Monday rolled over only CNY600 billion ($92.62 billion) of the CNY700 billion in one-year loans that matured, in a step to reduce liquidity. However, the rate on the loans remained unchanged at 2.95%."
1550,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 15, 2021 10:27PM ET</span>",China’s Recovery Weakens as Delta Outbreak Adds New Risks,"(Bloomberg) -- China’s economic activity slowed more than expected in July, with fresh virus outbreaks adding new risks to a recovery already hit by floods and faltering global demand.
All the main data missed forecasts: retail sales expanded 8.5% in July from a year earlier, lower than the 10.9% predicted by economists; industrial output increased 6.4% versus the median estimate of 7.9%; fixed-asset investment grew 10.3% in the first seven months of the year, compared with a forecast of 11.3%. The unemployment rate rose to 5.1%.
China’s most widespread virus outbreaks since last year are weighing on an economic recovery that was already starting to soften into the second half of the year. The new virus cases since mid-July have been linked to the fast-spreading delta variant, prompting yet another round of targeted lockdowns, travel curbs and mass testing across the country.
The government’s aggressive moves to achieve a goal of zero Covid-19 infections could prove economically costly as consumers cut back on spending and supply chains get disrupted. Financial institutions like  Nomura Holdings  (NYSE:NMR) Inc.,  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS). and JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM) have already cut their growth projections for the third quarter and full year.
“July’s data suggest the economy is losing steam very fast,” said Raymond Yeung, chief economist for Greater China at Australia and New Zealand Banking Group. “The resurgence of delta also adds extra risk to August’s activities.”
On a two-year average basis, which strips out statistical distortions from last year’s pandemic shutdowns, the data show a notable slowdown across the board:
Consumption, especially of services, is taking a knock from the targeted lockdowns. Authorities rushed to close tourist sites, call off cultural events and cancel flights to contain the virus outbreaks since last month.
Factory production faced a number of other constraints in July, including disruptions from heavy rain and floods, a continued shortage of computer chips, faltering demand and environmental curbs.
“Given the continuously evolving global situation of the epidemic, the increasingly complex and severe external environment, and the combined impact of sporadic local outbreaks of Covid-19 and natural disasters on the economy of some regions, the economic recovery is still unstable and uneven,” the National Bureau of Statistics said in a statement.
China‘s benchmark 10-year bond yield fell one basis point to 2.87% after earlier being about two basis points higher on the day. Futures contracts of the same tenor rose after the economic data release.
Adding to the economy’s woes are a slowdown in export growth, rising factory-gate prices and a real estate market that remains subdued given tighter restrictions on the property market. Local governments have also been slow to sell bonds this year, implying a moderate rollout of infrastructure spending.
The government has set a modest growth target of above 6% for this year. The slowdown may prompt economists to lower their growth forecasts for the year, which currently stand at a median of 8.5%, according to a Bloomberg survey.
Policy makers have signaled more targeted support for the economy as they look to cushion the recovery. At a Politburo meeting last month, where economic priorities for the second half of the year were laid out, top leaders pledged more steps to help struggling small businesses, a boost to fiscal spending and providing sufficient liquidity via monetary policy.
Economists now see the chance of more cuts to the reserve requirement ratio for banks in coming months after a surprise reduction in July. Some are even calling on the People’s Bank of China to lower interest rates, though the central bank said in its latest quarterly report that rates were at a “reasonable level” and vowed to avoid flooding the economy with stimulus.
On Monday, the central bank reduced liquidity by only rolling over 600 billion yuan ($92.7 billion) of the 700 billion yuan in 1-year loans that matured, while keeping the rate on the loans unchanged at 2.95%.

1551,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 15, 2021 10:15PM ET</span>","Japan's economy rebounds in Q2, COVID clouds outlook","By Leika Kihara and Tetsushi Kajimoto
TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's economy rebounded more than expected in the second quarter after slumping in the first three months of this year, data showed, a sign consumption and capital expenditure were recovering from the coronavirus pandemic's initial hit.
But many analysts expect growth to remain modest in the current quarter as state of emergency curbs reimposed to combat a spike in infections weigh on household spending.
The world's third-largest economy grew an annualised 1.3% in April-June after a revised 3.7% slump in the first quarter, preliminary gross domestic product (GDP) data showed on Monday, beating a median market forecast for a 0.7% gain.
Still, the rebound was much weaker than that of other advanced economies including the United States, which marked a 6.5% annualised expansion in the second quarter, highlighting the fallout from Tokyo's struggle in containing the pandemic.
""There's not much to be optimistic on the outlook with a spike in infections heightening the chance of stricter curbs on activity,"" said Yoshihiki Shinke, chief economist at Dai-ichi Life Research Institute.
""Japan's economy stagnated in the first half of this year and there's a risk of a contraction in July-September. Any clear rebound in growth will have to wait until year-end,"" he said.
An unexpected rebound in April-June consumption also highlighted the dilemma the government faces, as citizens are becoming less responsive to voluntary, repeated stop-and-go requests to stay home.
""I have very mixed feelings about this GDP result. It shows that households' consumption appetite is very strong despite the state of emergency curbs,"" Economy Minister Yasutoshi Nishimura told reporters after the data's release.
""Our priority is to prevent the spread of the virus. It's very bad for the economy for this situation to drag on.""
Consumption rose 0.8% in April-June from the previous quarter, confounding market forecasts for a 0.1% decline and rebounding from a 1.0% drop in January-March, the data showed.
Capital expenditure also increased 1.7% after falling 1.3% in the previous quarter. As a result, domestic demand contributed 0.6% point to GDP growth.
Exports rose 2.9% in April-June from the previous quarter in a sign the global recovery continued to underpin the world's third-largest economy.
""Private consumption grew unexpectedly and capital expenditure turned out to be firm. That said, the data left the impression that the economy's rebound from the first quarter slump was weak,"" said Takeshi Minami, chief economist at Norinchukin Research Institute.

Japan's economy emerged from last year's initial blow from the pandemic thanks to robust exports, though slow vaccinations and repeated state of emergency curbs have hurt consumption.
A spike in Delta variant cases in Asia has caused supply chain disruptions for some Japanese manufacturers, which could weigh on factory output and add to gloom for an already fragile recovery.

1552,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 15, 2021 07:46PM ET</span>",UK home asking prices slip for first time this year: Rightmove,"By Andy Bruce
LONDON (Reuters) - Asking prices for houses in Britain slipped over the past month for the first time this year, as the partial removal of a temporary cut to property purchase taxes took the edge off demand for larger homes, a survey showed on Monday.
Real estate website Rightmove (OTC:RTMVY) said asking prices fell by 0.3% in its August survey after a 0.7% increase in July, dragged down by ""upper end"" houses of four bedrooms or more, which saw asking prices fall by 0.8% in July.
The August survey covered property first advertised on Rightmove between July 11 and Aug. 7.
The readings chimed with a report from the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors last week, which also suggested the reversal of property purchase tax cuts had started to affect an otherwise strong market.
Finance minister Rishi Sunak cut stamp duty, a tax on house purchases, in July 2020. But from last month it started to return to its pre-pandemic level.
The tax cut aimed to reverse a slump in property sales at the start of the pandemic, and helped fuel a surge in property prices and some new construction. Many households were already seeking more spacious housing suited to working from home.
""Our analysis shows that average prices have only fallen in the upper-end sector, which is usually more affected by seasonal factors such as the summer holidays and has also seen the greatest withdrawal of stamp duty incentives,"" said Tim Bannister, director of property data at Rightmove. 

He said buyer demand remained strong, with Rightmove predicting a renewed bounce in selling activity and asking prices during the coming months.
""We also anticipate that more property will come to market when those owners have more clarity over their employers' long-term balance of home and office working,"" Bannister said.

1553,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 15, 2021 07:45PM ET</span>","UK employers have strongest hiring plans in over 8 years, survey shows","By David Milliken
LONDON (Reuters) - British employers plan to increase staff numbers by the most in more than eight years over the coming months and few intend to make staff redundant when government furlough support ends next month, a survey showed on Monday.
The quarterly survey by Britain's Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development (CIPD http://www.cipd.co.uk) added to signs of labour market shortages as the economy emerges from the coronavirus pandemic, though it offered less evidence of wage or inflation pressures
The CIPD said the net employment intentions balance - the difference in percentage points between employers who are hiring and those cutting staff - rose to +32 from +27 three months earlier, its highest since the survey began in early 2013.
""Employers are very optimistic, indicating strong recruitment intentions, and redundancy expectations appear much lower than originally predicted during the pandemic,"" Jonathan Boys, labour market economist at CIPD, said.
Only 13% of employers plan to make staff redundant, down from 33% a year ago when there were much greater fears that a premature end to government furlough support would create a spike in unemployment.
Earlier this month the Bank of England forecast that the unemployment rate would not rise beyond its current 4.8%, much lower than the peak of around 7.5% it saw earlier.
The CIPD survey also showed staff shortages, especially in the hospitality sector where many employers shed staff during the pandemic due to lengthy closures of hotels, pubs, restaurants and other venues.
But there was less sign that this was leading to big rises in wages, in contrast to some other surveys of recruiters and employers. The BoE has said it is keeping a close eye on wage pressures because of the potential longer-term inflation impact.
The CIPD survey showed that employers offered an average annual pay rise of 2% to staff this summer, unchanged from the spring and in line with pre-pandemic norms.

Raising pay was not generally seen as the solution to staff shortages either. Only 23% of employers with hard-to-fill vacancies said they would raise wages, compared with 44% who aimed to train existing staff to fill these roles.
The CIPD survey was based on online polling of 2,042 employers conducted by YouGov between June 16 and July 12.

(Reuters) -U.S. consumer sentiment dropped sharply in early August to its lowest level in a decade, in a worrying sign for the economy as Americans gave faltering outlooks on everything from personal finances to inflation and employment, a survey showed on Friday.
The unexpected reading could give Federal Reserve policymakers pause if it translates in the months ahead to a dent in economic activity. The central bank has been getting closer to a decision on when to begin pulling back the extraordinary stimulus it put in place to shield the economy from the COVID-19 pandemic.
The University of Michigan said its preliminary consumer sentiment index fell to 70.2 in the first half of this month from a final reading of 81.2 in July. That was the lowest level since 2011, and there have been only two larger declines in the index over the past 50 years. Those were at the depths of the 2007-2009 recession and during the first wave of shutdowns in April 2020 at the beginning of the pandemic.
The losses were widespread across income, age, and education subgroups and spanned all regions. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the index would remain unchanged at 81.2.
U.S. stock market indexes slipped immediately after the report was released, while the price of gold gained ground. U.S. Treasury bond yields hit session lows.
""The renewed plunge suggests the latest wave of virus cases driven by the Delta variant could be a bigger drag on the economy than we had thought,"" said Andrew Hunter, an economist at Capital Economics.
Economic growth is still expected to grow this year at its fastest pace in four decades after falling into a brief recession in 2020 caused by the coronavirus pandemic. But the recovery is showing some indication of cooling off.
COVID-19 cases have doubled in the past two weeks to reach a six-month peak as the more transmissible Delta variant spreads rapidly across the country. Labor shortages across the service sector also persist while supply chain disruptions have continued.
""The pandemic's resurgence due to the Delta variant has been met with a mixture of reason and emotion...mainly from dashed hopes that the pandemic would soon end,"" Richard Curtin, the survey director, said in a statement.
The survey's gauge of current economic conditions also declined to a reading of 77.9 from 84.5 in July while its measure of consumer expectations slid to 65.2 from 79.0 in July. 
The survey also showed consumers raising their expectations for medium term inflation, another measure the central bank is closely monitoring to ensure that inflation expectations remain anchored. 

The survey's one-year inflation expectation edged lower to 4.6%, down from 4.7%, but its five-year inflation outlook ticked up to 3.0% from 2.8% in July.
Consumer price increases slowed in July, the Labor Department said on Wednesday, but inflation overall remained at a historically high level amid lingering supply-chain disruptions and stronger demand for travel-related services.

1555,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 13, 2021 10:05AM ET</span>",EU exports to Britain rise in June as they fall to rest of the world,"By Francesco Guarascio
BRUSSELS (Reuters) -European Union exports to Britain rose in June after a volatile start to the country's first year outside the single market, while the bloc's exports to the rest of the world dropped slightly in the same month.
The EU statistics office Eurostat said on Friday seasonally adjusted exports to Britain increased by 4.7% in June on the month, whereas imports from the UK were ""nearly unchanged"" and the bloc's exports to other countries dropped 0.6%.
The month-on-month rise in exports to Britain followed a plunge, surge and second drop earlier this year, which were also recorded in imports, as firms adapted to new trade requirements after Brexit. The EU's trade with the rest of the world has remained largely stable in the first half of the year.
Seasonally-adjusted exports to Britain remained below the levels of the last months of 2020 in June but were higher than June 2020 when COVID restrictions were stricter, Eurostat figures showed.
On the year, non adjusted figures showed that the 27-country bloc recorded a 22.3% increase in exports in June for a total volume of 188.3 billion euros ($221.1 billion), and a 29.6% rise in imports resulting in a trade surplus of 14.8 billion euros, down from 20 billion euros in June 2020.
The smaller euro zone, which comprises 19 of the 27 EU members, recorded a nearly 22% increase of exports and a rise of almost 17% in imports on the month which resulted in a 18.1 billion euros surplus in June from 7.5 billion euros in May. In June 2020, the euro zone surplus was 20 billion euros.
IMPORTS FROM BRITAIN
In the first half of the year, EU imports of goods from Britain were nearly 20% below their levels in the same period of 2020 and in June and May were also lower than volumes recorded at the end of last year, Eurostat data showed.
The figures were at odds with data released on Thursday by the UK Office for National Statistics (ONS) which showed British exports to the European Union in May and June exceeded their levels immediately before it left the single market at the start of this year, excluding volatile trade in precious metals.
The discrepancy is partly due to a change in the way Eurostat calculates trade with Britain after Brexit.
When Britain was still part of the EU's single market, all goods which moved from Britain to an EU member state were treated as British exports.
But since the start of the year, goods which had an origin outside Britain - China for example, are now treated as imports from that country, rather than from Britain.
""Statistics Eurostat publishes for 2021 are not on the same basis as statistics for previous years,"" the ONS said last month.
""The larger falls seen in the Eurostat data over this time period will reflect not only changes in trade, but also the fact that imports are being recorded as being from different countries than was previously the case,"" it added. 
Eurostat agreed with this interpretation of its data.

In the first half of this year, exports to Britain rose by 5.5% compared with the same period last year, leading to an EU trade surplus with the country of 69.6 billion euros in June, Eurostat said.

TAIPEI (Reuters) -Taiwan's economy will grow at its fastest pace in more than a decade in 2021, the statistics office said on Friday, upgrading its outlook on a strong rebound in exports for the tech heavyweight island.
The revision came as the statistics office bumped up its export growth forecast for this year, with global demand for the island's technology products buoyed by a work-and-study-from-home boom during the COVID-19 pandemic, as workers and students rushed to buy smartphones, tablets and laptops.
Gross domestic product (GDP) is expected to rise 5.88% this year, the fastest pace since it expanded 10.25% in 2010, the Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics said, and up from a growth forecast of 5.46% made in June.
Giving its first forecast for 2022, the office said it saw GDP growth reaching a more modest 3.69% next year. 
""The distance business opportunities catalysed by the epidemic have accelerated the digital transformation of global companies, and demand for technology products is strong,"" the statistics agency said.
While it warned of uncertainty over virus variants, the future of monetary and fiscal policy globally amid growing inflation concerns and possible international carbon taxes, it saw a bullish outlook for Taiwan next year.
Taiwan stands ready to benefit from the global economic recovery, especially with production of more advanced chip nodes coming online at home, the office noted.
Taiwan's exports are a bellwether of demand for global tech giants such as Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), as the island is a major producer of semiconductors, a global shortage of which has rattled firms like auto makers and boosted Taiwanese corporate profits.
The statistics agency forecast exports in 2021 would rise 28.15% year-on-year, up from a previous prediction for a 20.4% increase.
For next year, it said it saw exports expanding 5.22% year-on-year.

In the second quarter, GDP expanded by a revised 7.43% from a year earlier, slightly down from a preliminary reading of 7.47%, the agency added. It slowed from 8.92% growth in the first quarter as a sudden spike in domestic COVID-19 cases that began in May weighed on consumption.
The outbreak has since been contained and restrictions, including on personal gatherings and in-restaurant dining, were eased last month.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's export boom extended into in July but consumer prices likely fell, a Reuters poll showed, highlighting the divergence between manufacturers benefiting from robust global demand and retailers suffering from a resurgence in COVID-19 infections.
The mixed batch of data will likely highlight the challenge policymakers face in combating a spike in Delta variant cases, without choking off a fragile economic recovery.
Exports likely surged 39.0% in July from a year earlier after a 48.6% spike in the previous month, according to analysts polled by Reuters, though the figures are inflated by the base effect of last year's pandemic-induced slump.
""Exports will remain strong with capital and IT-related goods serving as main drivers thanks to robust global demand for capital expenditure,"" said Kenta Maruyama, an economist at Mitsubishi UFJ (NYSE:MUFG) Research and Consulting.
Imports likely rose 35.1% in July from a year earlier partly due to rising raw material costs, the poll showed.
In a sign of weak domestic demand, Japan's core consumer prices likely fell 0.4% in July from a year earlier, according to the poll.
The drop is partly due to a change in the base year for the consumer price index (CPI) that gives a heavier weighting to cellphone charge fees, which have fallen sharply recently.
Analysts expect the base-year change to shave about 0.7 percentage point off core CPI. Under the new base year, core consumer prices fell 0.5% in June, according to the government, compared with a 0.2% gain under the old base year.
""Japan won't see inflation accelerate as much as in the United States and Europe with service-sector firms under strain from the pandemic,"" said Takeshi Minami, chief economist at Norinchukin Research Institute.

Core machinery orders, meanwhile, likely shrank 2.8% in June, falling for the first time in four months in a worrying sign for capital expenditure, the poll showed.
The government will release the trade and machinery orders data at 8:50 a.m. on Aug. 18 (2350GMT, Aug. 17). The consumer price data is due out 8:30 a.m. on Aug. 20 (2330GMT, Aug. 19).

U.S. producer prices increased more than expected in July, the Labor Department said on Thursday, suggesting inflation could remain high as strong demand fueled by the recovery continues to hurt supply chains. In the 12 months through July, the PPI jumped 7.8%, a record high since the measure was introduced in 2010. 
The producer price index for final demand increased 1.0% last month after rising 1.0% in June. Three-quarters of the gain was driven by a record one-month increase in final demand services, while the goods advance was half what it was in June.
The report followed data on Wednesday that showed U.S. consumer prices increases slowed in July even as they remained at a 13-year high on a yearly basis amid tentative signs inflation has peaked as supply-chain disruptions caused by the pandemic work their way through the economy.
""We expect the July report to mark the peak of producer price inflation as supply pressures gradually unwind in the coming months and demand moderates from its blistering pace in the first half of the year. However, stubborn pandemic disruptions will continue to hamper supply through year-end,"" said Mahir Rasheed, an economist at Oxford Economics.
The recent pace of price increases has intensified debate at the U.S. Federal Reserve over whether faster action may be needed in dialing back its extraordinary support of the pandemic-hit economy, including beginning to reduce its $120 billion in monthly bond purchases.
Fed Chair Jerome Powell has repeatedly said the current burst in inflation is likely temporary but other officials have become increasingly wary price increases will persist above the central bank's 2% inflation target, a flexible average.
Last month's increase in the costs of services was led by a 1.7% jump in trade services, which measure changes in margins received by retailers and wholesalers. Twenty percent of the increase in services was due to margins for automobiles and parts retailing, which rose 11.2%.
There were also gains in the prices of airline passenger services, hospital outpatient care, machinery and equipment wholesaling, and traveler accommodation services.
The swiftness of the economic recovery has caused a mismatch between supply and demand. Producers have had to grapple with low inventories, higher commodity prices, a global shipping container crisis and increased labor costs due to a shortage of willing workers. 
The lack of inventory because of supply chain issues are making it easier for producers to pass on the costs to consumers. 
JOBLESS CLAIMS CONTINUE TO FALL
Elsewhere, initial claims for state unemployment benefits fell 12,000 to a seasonally adjusted 375,000 for the week ended August 7, a separate Labor Department report showed on Thursday. Data for the prior week was revised to show 2,000 more applications received than previously reported.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast 375,000 applications for the latest week. Unadjusted claims, which offer a better read of the labor market, decreased 5,198 to 320,517 last week.
Claims remain well above their pre-pandemic level of 256,000, though they have dropped from a record 6.149 million in early April 2020. 
There are still fears that rising coronavirus cases, caused by the Delta variant, could slow the employment recovery amid a shortage of workers. There were a record 10.1 million job openings at the end of June. About 8.7 million people are officially unemployed.
The claims report showed the number of people continuing to receive benefits after an initial week of aid fell 114,000 to 2.866 million during the week ended July 31.
Those collecting benefits under the Pandemic Unemployment Assistance and Pandemic Emergency Unemployment Compensation programs dropped by nearly 730,000 in the week ended July 24. At a combined 8.67 million, their rolls were the lowest since May 2020.

The labor market recovery has a long way to go. About 12.055 million people, the same as the prior report, were receiving unemployment checks under all programs in late July, the lowest level since late March 2020.
The economy has swiftly regained momentum and past its pre-pandemic peak in the second quarter as trillions in government relief and increasing vaccinations against COVID-19 fueled spending on goods and services.

1559,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 12, 2021 08:54AM ET</span>",Prices Paid to Producers in U.S. Increase More Than Forecast,"(Bloomberg) -- Prices paid to U.S. producers rose in July by more than expected, suggesting that higher commodity costs and supply bottlenecks are still adding to inflationary pressures for companies.
The producer price index for final demand increased 1% from the prior month and 7.8% from a year earlier, Labor Department data showed Thursday. Excluding volatile food and energy components, the so-called core PPI also rose 1% and was up 6.2% from July 2020.
The increase in the PPI from a year ago was the largest in data back to 2010.
The median forecasts in a Bloomberg survey of economists called for a 0.6% month-over-month advance in the overall PPI and a 0.5% increase in the core figure.
Producer prices have been accelerating for much of this year against a backdrop of robust demand, supply chain constraints and shortages of materials. The increases in input costs, combined with recent upward pressure on wages, help explain higher consumer inflation.
A report Wednesday showed the consumer price index climbed in July at a more moderate pace, though not enough to provide major relief from the cost increases weighing on sentiment and driving policy debate.
Federal Reserve officials, including Chair Jerome Powell, say recent price increases represent temporary shocks that are associated with the reopening of the economy. Some policy makers and investors, however, worry that cost pressures will lead to more persistent inflation.
Services Inflation
Almost three-fourths of the jump in the July PPI reflected a record 1.1% pickup in services. The advance in final demand services was broad and included strength in margins at wholesalers and retailers.
The PPI report showed prices for goods increased 0.6% after a 1.2% advance in the prior month.
Prices of energy climbed by the most in four months, while food costs fell for the first time this year.
Producer prices excluding food, energy, and trade services -- a measure often preferred by economists because it strips out the most volatile components -- jumped 0.9% from the prior month, the most since January. Those costs were up 6.1% from July 2020.

Continuing claims for state benefits fell to 2.9 million in the week ended July 31.
Jobless claims have been largely falling this year as a pickup in economic activity strengthens business conditions and leads to a record number of job openings.

1561,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 12, 2021 05:41AM ET</span>",Diners and doctors help UK economy to extend recovery,"By William Schomberg and Andy Bruce
LONDON (Reuters) -Britain's economy grew by a faster-than-expected 1.0% in June, the first full month of indoor service for many hospitality firms, and also helped by the healthcare sector due to a rise in routine medical checkups after the pandemic.
But the official data https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/grossdomesticproductgdp/bulletins/gdpmonthlyestimateuk/june2021 showed British gross domestic product remained 2.2% smaller than it was immediately before the pandemic struck the country, a reminder of the damage done by Britain's long coronavirus lockdowns last year.
Britain's economy slumped by almost 10% in 2020, one of the biggest hits suffered by a rich nation, and the Bank of England expects it to regain its pre-pandemic size only at the end of 2021. The U.S. economy has already made up the hit.
The GDP figures have yet to show the impact of a surge in coronavirus cases in July although other data published on Thursday showed consumer spending in the week to Aug. 5 rose to within a whisker of its February 2020 level.
The month-on-month growth for the overall economy in June was stronger than an increase of 0.8% expected in a Reuters poll of economists.
Sandra Horsfield, an economist with Investec, said confidence among consumers and businesses was likely to build over time as long as there was no return to lockdowns.
""How smooth the transition will be is the big unknown, with perhaps the biggest question marks hanging over the performance of the labour market once the furlough scheme fully ends in late September,"" she said.
Finance minister Rishi Sunak repeated on Thursday that he had no plans for a further extension of the furlough programme which has protected the incomes of millions of workers.
SERVICES LEAD THE WAY
Britain's huge services sector grew by 1.5% in June. Healthcare contributed the most to growth, as family doctors saw more of their regular patients due to an easing of coronavirus precautions, the Office for National Statistics said.
Output from food and beverage services such as pubs and restaurants jumped by more than 10%, helped by the Euro 2020 soccer tournament.
Industrial output shrank by 0.7%, hit by maintenance of oil field production sites and a swing in the volatile pharmaceutical industry. The narrower measure of manufacturing grew by 0.2%, while construction output fell by 1.3%.
Compared with the first quarter of this year, when much of Britain's economy was in the grip of a third lockdown, economic output was up by 4.8%, the ONS said.
The International Monetary Fund expects Britain's economy to grow by 7% in 2021, the same as the United States, as it bounces back from last year's slump.
However, the Bank of England thinks Britain's economy will eventually settle back into its pre-crisis rut of slow growth. It expects British GDP to grow 5.75% next year but by only 1.25% in 2023.
Last week the BoE laid out its plans for a ""modest tightening"" of its huge stimulus programme.
The ONS lowered its estimate for growth in May to 0.6% from an originally reported 0.8% increase but revised up April's rebound to 2.2% from 2%.

Gross domestic product in the three months to the end of June was 22.2% higher than in the same period of 2020, reflecting the impact of the first coronavirus shutdown last year and the lifting of restrictions this year.
Separate trade data from the ONS showed British exports to the European Union in May and June exceeded their levels immediately before Britain left the EU's single market at the start of this year, excluding volatile trade in precious metals.

1562,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 12, 2021 02:01AM ET</span>",Japan wholesale inflation hits 13-year high as import costs rise,"By Leika Kihara
TOKYO (Reuters) -Japanese wholesale prices rose in July at their fastest annual pace in 13 years, data showed on Thursday, a sign that global commodity inflation and a weak yen were pushing up raw material import costs for a broad range of goods.
There is uncertainty, however, on whether companies will start to pass on the higher costs to households and prop up consumer inflation, which remains stuck around zero due to weak consumption, unlike in other advanced nations, analysts say.
""The pass-through of raw material costs to consumer goods prices is slow,"" said Chisato Oshiba, an economist at Dai-ichi Life Research Institute.
""While wholesale inflation is accelerating at a very fast pace now, it will take time for this to lead to higher consumer prices,"" she said.
The corporate goods price index (CGPI), which measures the price companies charge each other for their goods and services, rose 5.6% in July from a year earlier, Bank of Japan data showed, increasing for the fifth straight month and beating a median market forecast for a 5.0% gain.
It accelerated sharply from a 5.0% increase in June and marked the fastest pace of growth since September 2008, when emerging market demand triggered a spike in prices dubbed the commodities ""super cycle"".
On a month-on-month basis, wholesale prices rose 1.1% in July after gaining 0.6%, marking the biggest increase in nearly two years.
Prices rose for many raw materials including those for wood, which spiked 33.1% in July from a year earlier, and oil and coal goods, which saw prices rise 38.8%.
Some countries, including the United States and Britain, have seen inflation rise faster than expected as demand recovers from the coronavirus pandemic, triggering debate on how quickly they should wean their economies off massive monetary stimulus.
Few analysts expect Japan to see the same kind of rise in consumer inflation. Slow vaccinations and curbs in activity to combat the pandemic have hurt consumption, discouraging firms from passing on higher costs to households.
The dynamics were evident in wholesale price data. Domestic final goods prices rose just 2% in July from a year earlier, even as raw material prices spiked 48%.
Back in 2008, Japan's annual core consumer inflation hit 2.4% in July and August on rising commodity costs, but slowed to 0.2% in December and started falling from March 2009.
The spike in inflation during the period was driven largely by a handful of raw material costs, with prices of most items staying roughly flat, the BOJ said in a report issued in July.
""Given such historical experience, any rise in consumer prices driven by increases in upstream costs will highly likely to be transitory,"" the BOJ report said.
Japan's economy has emerged from last year's slump thanks to robust exports.

But a resurgence in infections forced the government to impose fresh state of emergency curbs, dashing policymakers' hope for a strong rebound in July-September growth.
Core consumer prices rose just 0.2% in June from a year earlier due to weak household spending, well below the BOJ's elusive 2% target. Analysts expect a change in the base year from the July data, due on Aug. 20, to push down core consumer inflation by around 0.7 of a percentage point.

The Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (RICS) said its monthly gauge of house prices eased in July to +79 from +82 in June, which had been highest level since the late 1980s. A Reuters poll of economists had pointed to a reading of +76.
Finance minister Rishi Sunak cut stamp duty, a tax on house purchases, in July 2020. But from last month it started to return to its pre-pandemic level.
The tax cut aimed to reverse a slump in property sales at the start of the pandemic, and helped fuel a surge in property prices and some new construction. Many households were already seeking more spacious housing suited to working from home.
""Although the tapering in stamp duty is beginning to have some impact on RICS activity indicators, the overall tone to the market remains firm with the metrics capturing price expectations showing few signs of wavering,"" said Simon Rubinsohn, RICS chief economist.

While buyer enquiries weakened for the first time after four months of increases, Rubinsohn said buyers continued to put a premium on spacious properties - explaining why house price expectations remained elevated.
Mortgage lender Halifax said last week that this had helped to keep momentum in the market, after it reported an unexpected month-on-month increase in house prices for July.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. government on Wednesday posted a July budget deficit of $302 billion, a record for that month, as COVID-19 relief spending stayed elevated while receipts returned to a more normal pace after a delayed July tax deadline last year.
The Treasury Department said the July deficit compared to a year-earlier $63 billion budget gap. Receipts for the month totaled $262 billion, down 54% percent from July 2020, while outlays were $564 billion, down 10% from the year-earlier period.
The U.S. deficit for the first 10 months of fiscal 2021 came to $2.540 trillion, down 10% from the year-earlier record of $2.807 trillion.
A U.S. Treasury official said that the smaller year-to-date outlays and deficits reflected some tapering of COVID-19 relief spending, with Labor Department outlays for supplemental unemployment benefits down 8% to $359 billion, and Small Business Administration outlays down 40% to $338 billion.

Meanwhile, revenues reflected the general recovery of the U.S. economy, with year-to-date corporate tax receipts up 61% to $324 billion and non-withheld individual taxes up 35% to $763 billion.
The Treasury official declined to comment when asked whether the July budget results would alter the department's forecasts on when the federal government would exhaust extraordinary measures to continue borrowing under the statutory debt limit of $28.4 trillion.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -U.S. consumer prices increases slowed in July even as they remained at a 13-year high on a yearly basis and there were tentative signs inflation has peaked as supply-chain disruptions caused by the pandemic work their way through the economy.
The data could provide some support to Fed officials who have repeatedly said that the current burst in inflation is temporary and likely to fade as the handful of categories that have caused inflation to surge in recent months get back on an even keel.
The consumer price index increased 0.5% last month after climbing 0.9% in June, the Labor Department said on Wednesday. In the 12 months through July, the CPI advanced 5.4%. The drop in the month-to-month inflation rate was the largest in 15 months.
Price gains for used cars and trucks, which have accounted for an outsized chunk of the inflation boost in recent months, rose 0.2%, a sharp drop from the 10.5% increase the prior month. Prices for airline fares also edged down 0.1%. 
Excluding the volatile food and energy components, the CPI rose 0.3% after increasing 0.9% in June. That was the smallest gain in four months and the first deceleration in the so-called core CPI since February.
The core CPI rose 4.3% on a year-on-year basis after advancing 4.5% in June. Annual inflation rates have been lifted by the fading out of last spring's weak readings from the CPI calculation but those so-called base effects are leveling off.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the overall CPI would rise 0.5% and the core CPI would rise 0.4%. U.S. Treasury prices slipped following the release of the data.[US/] 
""It fits the Fed's narrative and they can pretty much stand pat on their current strategy,"" said Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at Cresset Capital Management in Chicago.
AS SOME PRICES EASE, OTHERS RISE
The U.S. Federal Reserve is paying close attention to price pressures as it mulls when to begin to reduce its massive bond holdings and how soon to begin lifting rates from near zero. It also remains on the lookout for any signs that price pressures may broaden.
Inflation ""seems to have crested"" and should drop back in coming months, Richmond Fed President Thomas Barkin told Reuters in an interview on Wednesday. 
Even if inflation has peaked, it is expected to remain elevated through part of 2022. There were also possible hints that the rise in price pressures may not fall back rapidly as other sectors saw price gains holding or accelerating. 
New vehicle prices rose by 1.7%, the third straight month of gains above 1.5%. A global semiconductor shortage which has held back auto production has stripped automakers of inventory and could continue to cause price gains in the months ahead.
Prices for shelter and energy also increased while the recent jump in bar and restaurant prices showed no sign of a slowing. They rose 0.8% in July, the fourth month of accelerating gains, and an indication that a continuing shortage of workers and rising wages are being passed through. 
The swiftness of the economic recovery has caused a mismatch between supply and demand with consumers bolstered by low interest rates and nearly $6 trillion in government relief. 

The U.S. vaccination drive, with nearly 170 million Americans immunized against COVID-19, and the arrival of summer with less restrictions compared to last year, have caused a surge in demand for airline travel, hotel and motel accommodation. Hotel room rates rose by 6% in July. 
The Fed's preferred inflation measure, the core personal consumption expenditures price index, jumped 3.5% in June, the largest gain since December 1991.

Faced with supply constraints and surging demand, businesses are raising prices for goods and services as cost pressures mount. Ongoing challenges including materials shortages, shipping bottlenecks and hiring difficulties will likely continue to put broader upward pressure on prices in the months ahead.
At the same time, the outsized gains may ease as some price surges linked to the economy’s reopening ebb.

(Reuters) - Mortgage applications rose last week as the key 30-year mortgage rate held below 3% for a second straight week.
The Mortgage Bankers Association (MBA) said on Wednesday its average contract interest rate for traditional 30-year mortgages inched up to 2.99% from 2.97% in the week ending Aug. 6. The seasonally adjusted market index tracking mortgage applications rose 2.8% from a week earlier, the MBA said. 
""Homeowners continue to respond to lower rates, with refinance activity climbing to the highest level since February 2021,"" Joel Kan, MBA’s associate vice president of economic and industry forecasting, said in a statement.
After hitting record lows late last year below 2.9%, mortgage rates climbed in the first part of this year and peaked in the spring. Rates have been drifting lower since, held down in large part by the U.S. Federal Reserve's extraordinary stimulus measures aimed at helping the economy rebound from the coronavirus pandemic.

The MBA's mortgage market index rise reflected a 3.2% increase in applications to refinance existing loans, while purchase applications rose 1.8%.
""With low for-sale inventory keeping home-price appreciation in many markets at record highs, the jump in FHA purchase applications is potentially a sign that more first-time buyers are finding purchase options despite the high prices,"" Kan said.

The world's biggest auto market saw sales drop 11.9% from the same month a year earlier to 1.86 million vehicles, according to data from the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers (CAAM).
For the first seven months of the year, China's vehicle sales have jumped 19% as the market recovered from pandemic lows. CAAM said that rebound is set to peter out with sales for the rest of 2021 expected to be below relatively high year-ago levels, although the market is still expected to log growth overall on an annual basis.
Chen Shihua, a senior CAAM executive, cautioned that the global chip shortage, which has led to automakers curtailing production, was unlikely to resolve itself soon as the pandemic rages on in many parts of the world.

One bright spot in July was continued strong sales of new energy vehicles, which more than doubled to 271,000. These include battery-powered electric vehicles, plug-in petrol-electric hybrids and hydrogen fuel-cell vehicles.
The government's promotion of greener vehicles to cut pollution has prompted electric car makers such as Nio (NYSE:NIO) Inc, Xpeng Inc and BYD Co (OTC:BYDDF) Ltd to expand manufacturing capacity in China.

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Singapore's bellwether economy expanded more than initially estimated in the second quarter and the government raised its forecast for 2021 as COVID-19 vaccinations progressed at home and in other key markets.
Gross domestic product (GDP) is forecast to grow 6% to 7% in 2021, versus a prior estimate for an expansion of 4 to 6%, the Ministry of Trade and Industry said.
GDP grew 14.7% year-on-year in the second quarter, higher than the 14.3% growth seen in the government's advance estimate. Analysts had expected a 14.2% increase, according to a Reuters poll.
In absolute terms, GDP remained 0.6% below its pre-pandemic level in the second quarter of 2019.
On a quarter-on-quarter seasonally-adjusted basis, the economy contracted 1.8% in the second quarter, a reversal from the 3.3% expansion in the prior quarter.
""Barring a major setback in the global economy, the Singapore economy is expected to continue to see a gradual recovery in the second half of the year, supported in large part by outward-oriented sectors,"" said Gabriel Lim, permanent secretary for trade and industry.
He said easing border restrictions would also help in the recovery of consumer-facing sectors and alleviate labour shortages in sectors that are reliant on migrant workers.
However, aviation- and tourism-related sectors are projected to recover more slowly than previously expected, with activity expected to remain significantly below pre-COVID levels even by the end of the year.
The small and open economy is charting an uneven recovery after posting its worst ever recession last year due to the pandemic. Much of its fast growth this year is due to the low comparison base of last year when the virus paralysed economies around the world.
The central bank had maintained its accommodative monetary policy at its last meeting in April. The next policy review is due in mid-October.
The revised 2021 forecast was consistent with the current monetary policy stance, which remained appropriate, said Edward Robinson, the deputy managing director of the Monetary Authority of Singapore.
Economists do not expect the MAS to make any moves in October, citing benign domestic inflation and the need to measure the effectiveness of vaccines against new virus variants, which will impact the pace of reopening and recovery. 
""That gives them more room to respond and probably tighten in April next year,"" said Brian Tan, regional economist at  Barclays  (LON:BARC).

Jeff Ng, senior treasury strategist at HL Bank, expects economic activity to improve in 2022.
""Going forward by the end of the year, Singapore will be looking to move forward to the endemic stage of the recovery,"" he said.

1570,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 10, 2021 08:54PM ET</span>",Australian Consumer Confidence Drops on Delta Variant Lockdowns,"(Bloomberg) -- Australia’s consumer confidence declined this month, though not as far as might have been feared given its two largest cities are under stay-at-home orders to try to contain an outbreak of the delta variant of coronavirus.
The sentiment index dropped 4.4% to 104.1 points in August, the lowest point in a year,  Westpac Banking  (NYSE:WBK) Corp. said Wednesday in a statement. But optimists still outweighed pessimists, with 100 points the dividing line between the two.
“This is a significant further loss of confidence but better than might have been expected,” said Matthew Hassan, senior economist at Westpac. “The virus situation locally is clearly troubling, but consumers appear reasonably confident that it will come back under control, and that once it does, the economy will see a return to robust growth.”
The highly contagious delta variant has caused shutdowns across the nation’s eastern coast, its most populated area. The Reserve Bank of Australia estimates household spending drops about 15% during lockdowns and has acknowledged the economy will likely contract this quarter.
Still, the RBA expects a solid recovery to resume, and has decided to stick with plans to taper bond purchases for now.
The apparent resilience of consumer sentiment will give some comfort to the RBA, suggesting the consumer and the wider economy remain well placed to snap back once virus restrictions ease, Hassan said.
Sydney has been hitting record daily infections despite being in its seventh week of strict stay-at-home orders. The city accounts for 25% of Australia’s output and 22% of employment. The crisis reflects a tardy vaccine roll-out that’s left the population vulnerable to the delta variant during the southern hemisphere winter.
“The availability of effective Covid vaccines is a key source of support for confidence,” Hassan said. “Notably, sentiment is much stronger amongst those that have either been vaccinated or plan to get the jab.”
The poll was based on responses from 1,200 people and conducted from Aug. 2-7.

1572,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 10, 2021 10:36AM ET</span>",U.S. productivity growth slows in Q2; labor costs revised down in Q1,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) -U.S. worker productivity growth slowed in the second quarter and labor costs were far weaker than previously estimated in the first quarter, the Labor Department said on Tuesday.
Nonfarm productivity, which measures hourly output per worker, increased at a 2.3% annualized rate last quarter. Data for the first quarter was revised lower to show productivity rising at a 4.3% rate instead of the previously reported 5.4% pace.
Economists polled by Reuters had expected productivity to rise at a 3.5% rate. Productivity jumped early in the pandemic before slumping in the final three months of 2020, and has since rebounded. The see-sawing has been partly attributed to the cratering of lower-wage industries, like leisure and hospitality, which have been reopening over the past few months at an increasingly brisk pace.
Compared to the second quarter of 2020, productivity rose at a 1.9% pace. Hours worked increased at a 5.5% rate last quarter, accelerating from a revised 4.0% growth pace in the January-March period.
Overall output is now 1.2% above pre-pandemic levels but hours worked remain 2.8% below it, the report also showed. The resurgence in economic activity has not been matched by people flooding back into the workforce. On Monday, U.S. job openings jumped to a fresh record high in June, Labor Department data showed.
Small business owners across the United States grew less confident in the economic recovery in July as labor shortages remained an issue, according to a National Federation of Independent Business survey released on Tuesday.
The cooling in the most recent data notwithstanding, Oxford Economics lead U.S. economist Lydia Boussour said the pandemic appears to have ""induced an upside shock to productivity.""
""The adoption of technology has accelerated, new firms are being created at an historic pace, and the shift to remote work is likely to outlast the crisis,"" she wrote in a note on Tuesday. ""While some of the pandemic-driven efficiencies could take years to be fully realized, we think these four forces will lead to a sustained productivity revival in the medium run.""

Unit labor costs - the price of labor per single unit of output - rose at a 1.0% rate. They contracted at a revised 2.8% pace in the first quarter. Unit labor costs increased at a 0.1% rate from a year ago. They have also been distorted by the pandemic's disproportionate impact on lower-wage industries.
Hourly compensation rose at a 3.3% rate last quarter. That followed a revised 1.4% growth pace in the first quarter. Compensation increased at a 2.0% rate compared to the first quarter of 2020.

(Reuters) - Small business owners across the United States grew less confident in the economic recovery in July as labor shortages remained an issue, according to a survey released on Tuesday.
The National Federation of Independent Business (NFIB) Optimism Index fell 2.8 points to a reading of 99.7 in July, almost erasing all of June's gain. Six of the 10 index components declined, three improved and one was left unchanged.
""Small business owners are losing confidence in the strength of the economy and expect a slowdown in job creation,"" Bill Dunkelberg, the NFIB's chief economist, said in a statement.
While the economy is projected to expand this year at its fastest pace since the 1980s, there are signs it may be cooling. Supply chain bottlenecks continue to dent manufacturing growth, and consumer sentiment has declined recently amid concerns about inflation.
A net 27% of businesses plan to create new jobs in the next three months, down one point from the month prior, the NFIB survey showed.
Last week, the trade group said in its monthly jobs report that a record high 49% of small business owners reported unfilled job openings in July on a seasonally adjusted basis.
The quality of labor ranked as businesses' ""single most important problem,"" with 26% of respondents selecting it among 10 issues, near the survey high of 27%, the NFIB said in its latest optimism survey. 
""As owners look for qualified workers, they are also reporting that supply chain disruptions are having an impact on their businesses,"" Dunkelberg said. ""Ultimately, owners could sell more if they could acquire more supplies and inventories from their supply chains.""

Some 57% of respondents said they had few or no qualified applicants for open jobs in July, up one point from June.
Businesses in the NFIB survey also flagged inflation as a worry, with 44% planning to increase prices in the next three months, which was unchanged from June's record high reading.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's current account surplus jumped in the first half of this year as exports to the United States and Asia boomed, data showed on Tuesday, with robust global demand for durable goods helping to cushion the economic blow from the pandemic.
In contrast, the country's services deficit widened in January-June from a year earlier as the pandemic kept foreign visitors from entering the country, the finance ministry data showed, highlighting the pain the crisis has inflicted on Japan's once-booming tourism industry.
A separate survey showed sentiment in Japan's services sector improved in July though an index gauging the outlook worsened, underscoring the fragile nature of the country's recovery.
""Infection numbers continue to rise, triggering government requests for people to avoid travelling during the summer holiday season,"" analysts at SMBC Nikko Securities wrote in a research note. ""Private consumption may have held up in July but seen slumping in August.""
Japan reaped a current account surplus of 10.47 trillion yen ($94.78 billion) in the first half of this year, up 3.5 trillion yen from the same period last year, due largely to a 22.2% jump in exports, the data showed.
Exports of cars, auto parts and chip-making equipment boomed particularly for those bound to Asia and North America, the data showed, a sign that manufacturers benefited from strong global demand for durable goods.
By contrast, Japan saw its services deficit widen by 146.7 billion yen to 2.09 trillion yen in January-June due to a 97.6% drop in overseas visitors, the data showed.

Japan's economy emerged from last year's pandemic-induced doldrums thanks to solid exports. But slow vaccine rollouts and a resurgence in COVID-19 infections have weighed on consumption, clouding its recovery prospects.
The tourism industry has been hit hard by closed borders and the government's stay-at-home requests. Many analysts say the Tokyo Olympic Games, which ended on Sunday, gave little boost to the economy as no spectators were allowed for most events.

Business confidence slumped to minus-8 points from plus-11 in June, National Australia Bank (OTC:NABZY) Ltd. said in a statement Tuesday. The conditions index -- measuring hiring, sales and profits -- dropped to 11 points from a revised 25. The survey ran from July 20-30.
The result showed “optimism collapsing on the back of ongoing restrictions,” said Alan Oster, chief economist at NAB. “The fear is that lower capacity utilization and a fading pipeline on work may see businesses pull back on hiring and investment intentions.”
The highly contagious delta variant has caused shutdowns across Australia’s east coast, the nation’s most populated area, with Sydney now in its seventh week of lockdown. The central bank estimates household spending tends to drop about 15% during lockdowns and expects the economy will likely contract this quarter.
Indeed, a weekly gauge of consumer confidence released by Australia & New Zealand Banking Group (OTC:ANZBY) Ltd. earlier Tuesday fell below the neutral level of 100 for the first time since early November last year.
All three components of NAB’s business conditions fell: trading dropped 20 points, profitability 19 and employment declined 8 points.
“We know that once restrictions are removed that the economy has tended to rebound relatively quickly,” Oster said. “The hope is that the economy again rebounds strongly, and we see little pullback in the very positive investment and hiring intentions we have seen by business in recent months.”
Reserve Bank chief Philip Lowe signaled last week that he’s adopting a similar outlook, pushing ahead with a planned taper of bond purchases in the expectation there will be a rapid recovery. In addition, the governor maintains that fiscal policy is the best tool for aiding households during such episodes -- and federal and state governments have boosted assistance.
Australian authorities are trying to ramp up vaccinations to counter the outbreak after a sluggish roll out left the population vulnerable to delta.

1576,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 09, 2021 09:20PM ET</span>",Slow growth in Japan's bank lending shows COVID-19 cash crunch easing,"By Leika Kihara
TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's bank lending rose in July at the slowest annual pace in nearly nine years, data showed on Tuesday, a sign companies were emerging steadily from a cash crunch last year caused by the coronavirus pandemic.
But the slowdown in lending also reflected sluggish consumption as households hoarded cash instead of spending, underscoring the fragile nature of Japan's economic recovery.
Total bank lending rose 1.0% in July from a year earlier, Bank of Japan data showed, slowing from a 1.4% gain in June and marking the lowest year-on-year increase since November 2012.
Bank lending surged last year when companies were in need of immediate cash to ease the impact of the coronavirus pandemic on business.
""Some companies were paying back loans they tapped as a precaution,"" a BOJ official told a briefing. ""Bank deposits remain at high levels, which shows households are cautious about boosting spending,"" he added.
The average balance of bank deposits rose 5.7% in July from a year earlier at 831 trillion yen ($7.53 trillion), far exceeding the 578 trillion yen for that of bank lending, the data showed.
Major banks saw lending fall 1.4% in July from a year earlier after a 1.6% drop in June, largely in reaction to last year's surge in fund demand to deal with the pandemic's shock.
Regional banks increased lending by 2.3% in July, a slowdown from a 2.9% gain in June, suggesting that cash constraints were easing even for small and mid-sized borrowers.

Japan's economy emerged from last year's hit from the pandemic thanks to robust overseas demand, though the outlook is clouded by a resurge in COVID-19 infections that is crippling private consumption.

Job openings, a measure of labor demand, shot up by 590,000 to 10.1 million on the last day of June, the Labor Department said in its monthly Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey, or JOLTS report, on Monday. 
Graphic: Job openings are at a record high, https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-ECONOMY/xlbpgqmwkpq/chart.png 
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast job openings would rise to 9.28 million in June. Vacancies increased in all four regions and the job openings rate rose to 6.5% from 6.1%. 
Employers have struggled to quickly rehire workers to keep up with the speed from which the economy has emerged from the depths of the COVID-19 pandemic, which upended many businesses as restrictions and fears of the virus kept people home.
The ratio of openings to hires, despite easing in June, remained at historically elevated levels,"" JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) analyst Peter McCrory said. 
Graphic: Openings still far exceed hires, https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-ECONOMY/znvnedaolpl/chart_eikon.jpg 
Acute labor shortages have been reported, particularly in leisure and hospitality. Generous unemployment benefits, childcare issues and lingering worries about the virus have also been cited as factors holding back people returning to the workforce.
The largest increases in vacancies in June were in professional and business services, retail trade and accommodation and food services. 
But Monday's data offered a hopeful sign as hiring rose to 6.7 million in June from 6.0 million in the prior month, the second largest increase since the government started tracking the series in 2000. It fell short only of the number of hires in May 2020, which was fueled by the economy reopening after the first wave of shutdowns. Economists generally are expecting a larger bump in hiring as schools reopen and crisis-era unemployment benefits come to an end. 
Graphic: Hiring was brisk in June, https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-ECONOMY/zjpqkqzgqpx/chart_eikon.jpg 
It also tallies with more recent data. The government reported on Friday that job growth accelerated in July as U.S. employers hired the most workers in nearly a year and continued to raise wages.
The rise in hiring in June was led by retail trade, with 291,000 more positions filled, while state and local government education filled 94,000 jobs.
Worries remain, however, that a resurgence in infections, driven by the Delta variant of the coronavirus, could once again discourage some unemployed people from returning to the labor force.
Elsewhere, the report showed the number of people voluntarily leaving their employment in June increased to 3.9 million from 3.6 million in May, well above pre-pandemic levels. 
Graphic: Quits: Retail and accommodation & food services, https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-ECONOMY/lgpdwmzzevo/chart_eikon.jpg 
The quits rate is usually seen as a barometer of job market confidence, and in June quits were up in all but five of the 21 private industry sectors in the report. 
Graphic: JOLTS, https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-STOCKS/klpykeylapg/JOLTS.png 

A record 1.35 million people quit jobs in the retail and accommodation and food industries in June, but that only represented 35% of all quits and is roughly in line with those sectors' share over the longer term.

Mexico's national statistics agency INEGI said consumer prices increased by 5.81% in the year through July, above the consensus forecast of a Reuters poll for a reading of 5.77%.
The July reading was the lowest since March, and compared with a rate of 5.88% in June.
The Bank of Mexico, which will hold its next monetary policy meeting on Thursday, targets an inflation rate of 3%, with a one percentage-point tolerance range above and below that.
Expectations have been growing that Banxico, as the bank is known, could hike its benchmark interest rate for the second meeting in a row in a bid to contain price pressures in Latin America's no. 2 economy.
""We expect supply-side shocks to fade in coming months, but core inflation will struggle to revert to target until the second half of next year,"" said Joan Domene, senior economist at Oxford Economics.
The INEGI data showed that the index of core annual inflation, which strips out some volatile items, accelerated to 4.66%, the highest rate since the end of 2017. That figure was in line with the reading of the Reuters poll.
""We believe that Banxico's June hike marked the start of a normalization cycle that will bring the policy rate to a terminal level of 5.25% by year-end,"" said Domene, who forecast there would be rate hikes of 25 basis points at every monetary policy meeting until December.

Seventeen of 19 analysts surveyed by Reuters said they expect Banxico to raise the rate by 25 basis points to 4.50% on Thursday.
Compared with the previous month, headline consumer prices rose by 0.59% in July, while the core price index advanced by 0.48% from June, the data showed.

(Reuters) - U.S. consumers' inflation expectations for the near future remained elevated last month while the outlook for their financial prospects over the next year dimmed, according to a survey released on Monday by the New York Federal Reserve. 
Median expectations for inflation over the next year stayed at a series high of 4.8% in July, following a substantial jump in June, according to the monthly survey. 
Expectations for what inflation will be over the next three years increased slightly to a median of 3.7% from 3.6% in June, reaching the highest level since August 2013. 
The survey of consumer expectations, which is based on a rotating panel of 1,300 households, can be a helpful gauge for the U.S. central bank as it weighs its inflation outlook. 
Fed policymakers are discussing how and when to begin removing the support provided during the coronavirus pandemic, with some officials concerned recent inflationary pressures may last longer than anticipated. The Fed last year cut its benchmark overnight interest rate to near zero and began buying $120 billion in Treasuries and mortgage-backed securities each month to bolster the economy.
Consumers' expectations for how much home prices will rise over the next year dropped to a median 6.0% in July from 6.2% in June. That drop was driven mostly by respondents aged 40 and higher, as well as by those living in the West and the Midwest. 

More people said they were worse off financially now than they were a year ago, and fewer respondents said they expect their financial situation to improve a year from now. The average perceived odds of missing a minimum debt payment over the next three months rose to 10.4%, above the trailing 12-month average of 10.0%. 
The mean perceived probability of becoming unemployed over the next year rose to 12.2%, but was still the second lowest reading for the survey launched in 2013.

1581,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 09, 2021 03:15AM ET</span>",'What a run!': German exports jump despite supply bottlenecks,"By Michael Nienaber
BERLIN (Reuters) -German exports rose more than expected in June despite persisting supply bottlenecks in manufacturing, data showed on Monday, suggesting a solid recovery in Europe's biggest economy.
The data, released by the Federal Statistics Office on Monday, brought some relief after manufacturing figures showed on Friday that industrial output unexpectedly fell in June due to supply bottlenecks for intermediate goods.
""Exports are now up for the 14th month in a row. What a run!"" VP Bank analyst Thomas Gitzel said.
Seasonally adjusted exports jumped by 1.3% on the month in June after a slightly revised rise of 0.4% in May. Imports rose 0.6 % after an increase of 3.4% the prior month.
The strong rise in exports widened the trade surplus to 13.6 billion euros from a revised 12.8 billion euros in May.
A Reuters poll had pointed to a 0.4% increase in exports, a 0.5% rise in imports and a trade balance of 13.4 billion euros.
Compared to February 2020, the month before the start of the COVID-19 pandemic in Germany, seasonally adjusted exports rose by 1.1% and imports jumped by 10%, underlining strong domestic demand and massive state spending during the crisis.
The monthly trade data did not include a breakdown by country.
On the year, exports jumped 23.6% and imports soared 27%, mainly driven by business with the United States and China, Germany's two most important trading partners outside the European Union's single market.
Exports of ""Made in Germany"" goods to the United States were up by nearly 40% on the year in June and exports to China rose 16%. Exports to Britain increased 11% on the year while imports from the UK were up by 11.5%.
VP Bank analyst Gitzel cautioned there was risk that the supply bottlenecks for intermediate products in manufacturing could soon be reflected more clearly in the export figures.
""The problem of material shortages will eat its way through the entire economic figures,"" Gitzel added.

The central bank said last month economic growth could accelerate further this summer if there were no ""significant setbacks"" in the fight against the pandemic and if supply bottlenecks eased.
On this condition, the Bundesbank expects the economy to reach its pre-pandemic levels at the end of the third quarter, growing 3.7% this year and 5.2% next year.

The world's second-biggest economy is on track to expand more than 8% this year but analysts say pent-up coronavirus demand has peaked and forecast growth to moderate amid supply chain bottle necks and outbreaks of the Delta variant of COVID-19.
The producer price index (PPI) grew 9.0% from a year earlier, matching the high seen in May, the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) said in a statement on Monday. Analysts in a Reuters poll had expected the PPI to rise 8.8%, unchanged from June.
Consumer inflation slowed slightly, the data showed, giving policymakers room to act if required.
China's economy has largely recovered from disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, but the expansion is losing steam as businesses face intensifying strains from higher commodity prices and global supply chain bottlenecks.
""We believe domestic inflationary pressure is largely controllable, and Beijing will unlikely overreact to the stronger-than-expected July inflation data,"" analysts from Nomura wrote in a note.
""Instead, we expect Beijing to maintain its unique policy mix of 'targeted tightening + universal easing' through the remainder of this year.""
China cut the amount of cash that banks must hold as reserves in July, releasing around 1 trillion yuan ($154.40 billion). Many analysts expect another cut later in the year.
The global spread of the more-infectious Delta variant of the virus and new outbreaks of cases at home, on top of recent heavy rainfall and floods in some Chinese provinces have also disrupted economic activity. 
""The pandemic worsened and caused more disruption in the global supply chain,"" said Zhiwei Zhang, chief economist at Pinpoint Asset Management. 
The PPI, a benchmark gauge of a country's industrial profitability, inched up 0.5% on a monthly basis, accelerating from a 0.3% uptick in June. 
ECONOMY LOSING MOMENTUM
Higher crude oil prices and increased demand for thermal coal as China copes with hot weather helped drive up prices, said Dong Lijuan, an official with NBS, in a statement released alongside the data.
Prices in the coal mining and washing and ferrous metal extraction industries jumped 45.7% and 54.6% in July year on-year, respectively.
China's ""zero tolerance"" policy to COVID cases will probably put further stress on the supply chain, and inflation pressure may persist in the second half, said Zhang.
China reported 125 new cases of COVID-19 on the mainland for Aug. 8, with most local infections in the central province of Henan and the eastern province of Jiangsu. 
Uncertainties caused by the fresh outbreak in China and government response measures led analysts from Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) and  Barclays  (LON:BARC) to recently revise down their third quarter growth forecasts.
The country's export growth unexpectedly slowed in July, with firms citing extra pressure from high raw material costs.
China, as the top steel consumer of both coal and iron ore, has stepped up efforts to tame rising commodity prices that have squeezed manufacturers' margins, including stepping up inspections on trading platforms and releasing state reserves.
Benchmark iron ore futures on the Dalian Commodity Exchange fell 13.1% in July, the steepest drop since February 2020.
A separate NBS statement showed that the consumer price index (CPI) in July rose 1.0% from a year earlier, compared with a 1.1% gain in June and below the government target of around 3% this year.
The Reuters poll forecast the index to inch up 0.8%. On a month-on-month basis, the CPI rose 0.3%, compared with a 0.2% increase tipped by the poll and June's 0.4% decline.

The core consumer price index, which strips out volatile food and energy prices, stood at 1.3% on year, versus a 0.9% rise in June.

The producer price index grew 9% in July from a year earlier, the National Bureau of Statistics said Monday, quickening from 8.8% in the previous month and beating the median forecast of an 8.8% gain. The consumer price index rose 1% in July, compared to the median estimate of a 0.8% increase.
China’s steady economic recovery extended into the second half of the year, although the momentum is weakening. A new round of coronavirus outbreaks across the country is dimming the growth outlook as local authorities restrict travel, hurting domestic demand. It could also temporarily boost inflation pressure, if lockdowns were implemented on a larger scale and supply and logistics are disrupted.
The severity of the economic damage will largely depend on how fast Beijing can bring the pandemic under control, economists said.
Zhou Hao, senior emerging markets economist at Commerzbank AG (OTC:CRZBY) in Singapore, expects CPI to move higher to about 2% at the end of the year as pandemic disruptions possibly push up food prices, he said before the data were released.
Core CPI, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, rose 1.3% suggesting domestic demand is getting stronger. Pork prices, a key element in China’s CPI basket, dropped 43.5%, driving food prices down by 3.7%. Non-food prices, climbed 2.1% partly on the pass-through from elevated upstream prices.
With domestic demand remaining subdued, the central bank has ample policy room to shift to a more dovish stance to support the economy, as reflected by its surprise move in July to cut the the reserve requirement ratio for banks.
The Communist Party’s top leadership also pledged more targeted support for the economy at the Politburo meeting late last month, reiterating a commitment to stabilize commodity prices and pledging more effective fiscal support for the economy in the second half.

1584,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 07, 2021 03:15AM ET</span>",China's export slowdown in July may signal more bumps ahead,"BEIJING (Reuters) -China's export growth unexpectedly slowed in July following outbreaks of COVID-19 cases, while imports also lost momentum, pointing to a slowdown in the country's industrial sector in the second half even as easing global lockdowns boost commerce. 
The world's biggest exporter has staged an impressive economic rebound from a coronavirus-induced slump in the first few months of last year after quickly containing the pandemic, and its rapid vaccination rollout has helped drive confidence.
But new infections in July, mainly caused by the highly transmissible Delta strain have spread to tens of Chinese cities, prompting local authorities to lock down affected communities, order millions to be tested and temporarily suspend operations of some businesses, including factories. 
Seasonal floods and bad weather last month also affected industrial production in some areas such as central China. 
Exports in July rose 19.3% from a year earlier, compared with a 32.2% gain in June. Analysts polled by Reuters had forecast a gain of 20.8%.
""The pandemic worsened in other Asian developing countries, which may have led to a relocation of trade toward China. But leading indicators suggest exports may weaken in coming months,"" said Zhiwei Zhang, chief economist at Pinpoint Asset Management.
Outbreaks of COVID-19 cases in eastern and southern Chinese provinces, the country's main export hubs, had crimped factory output.
Aside from the drag from efforts to counter the spread of the Delta variant, Chinese exporters also struggled with an ongoing global semiconductor shortage, logistics bottlenecks, and higher raw material and freight costs. 
""Although orders are recovering, there are too many uncertainties in the second half of the year, like how the domestic epidemic develops and the cost of raw materials. And at the same time, foreign production capacity is slowly picking up,"" said an exports sales manager based in Suzhou surnamed Ye.
Imports in July rose a slower 28.1% from a year earlier, lagging a 33% increase forecast in the Reuters poll, and 36.7% growth the previous month. Demand has dropped in recent months for iron ore, a key ingredient in steelmaking.
China's crude oil imports, however, rebounded in July from a six-month low as state-backed refiners ramped up output after returning from maintenance.
China's factory activity expanded at a slower pace in July due to higher raw material costs, equipment maintenance and extreme weather.
The slower Chinese shipments also reflected the moderation in U.S. business in July amid supply constraints, suggesting a cooling in the world's biggest economy after what was expected to have been a robust second quarter.
China posted a trade surplus of $56.58 billion in July, compared with the poll's forecast for a $51.54 billion surplus and $51.53 billion surplus in June. 
Its trade surplus with the United States rose to $35.4 billion, Reuters calculations based on customs data showed, up from $32.58 billion in June.

The economy is on track to grow more than 8% this year but analysts say pent-up coronavirus demand has peaked and forecast that growth rates are starting to moderate.

Total consumer credit expanded at a pace of $37.69 billion, which was the quickest rate ever and followed a $36.69 billion increase in May, the U.S. central bank said. Economists polled by Reuters had expected consumer credit to increase at a rate of $23.00 billion in June.
An alternate measure tracking the monthly change in the total amount of credit outstanding increased by the most since December 2010, the data showed. That measure showed that revolving credit, which mostly measures credit-card use, rose by $17.858 billion, the largest gain since 2006, after climbing by $9.089 billion in May.
The surge in June could explain the sustained robustness in consumer spending during last quarter, even as the flow of stimulus money from the government ebbed.
""We expect consumer credit growth will continue at a healthy clip in the second half of 2021, supported by strong consumer spending and an easing of lending standards for consumer loans,"" said Nancy Vanden Houten, lead economist at Oxford Economics in New York.

Consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, notched a second straight quarter of double-digit growth. That helped to pull the level of gross domestic product above its peak in the fourth quarter of 2019.
But growth in nonrevolving credit, which includes auto loans as well as student loans made by the government, slowed to a pace of $19.831 billion from a rate of $27.601 billion in May.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. employers hired the most workers in nearly a year in July and continued to raise wages, giving the economy a powerful boost as it started the second half of what many economists believe will be the best year for growth in almost four decades.
The Labor Department's closely watched employment report on Friday also showed the unemployment rate dropped to a 16-month low of 5.4% and more people waded back into the labor force. The report followed on the heels of news last week that the economy fully recovered in the second quarter the sharp loss in output suffered during the very brief pandemic recession.
""We are charting new economic expansion territory in the third quarter,"" said Brian Bethune, professor of practice at Boston College in Boston. ""The overall momentum of the recovery continues to build."" 
Nonfarm payrolls increased by 943,000 jobs last month, the largest gain since August 2020, the survey of establishments showed. Data for May and June were revised to show 119,000 more jobs created than previously reported. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast payrolls would increase by 870,000 jobs. 
The economy has created 4.3 million jobs this year, leaving employment 5.7 million jobs below its peak in February 2020. 
President Joe Biden cheered the strong employment report. ""More than 4 million jobs created since we took office,"" Biden wrote on Twitter. ""It's historic - and proof our economic plan is working."" 
(GRAPHIC: Nonfarm payrolls - https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-STOCKS/lbpgnrxaqvq/nfpr.png) 
Hiring is being fueled by pent-up demand for workers in the labor-intensive services sector. Nearly $6 trillion in pandemic relief money from the government and COVID-19 vaccinations are driving domestic demand. 
But a resurgence in infections, driven by the Delta variant of the coronavirus, could discourage some unemployed people from returning to the labor force.
July's employment report could bring the Federal Reserve a step closer to announcing plans to start scaling back its monthly bond-buying program. The U.S. central bank last year slashed its benchmark overnight interest rate to near zero and is pumping money into the economy through the bond purchases.
""This is the last employment report Chair (Jerome) Powell sees before Jackson Hole, and we have to imagine that he lays the groundwork for a potential September tapering announcement,"" said Conrad DeQuadros, senior economic advisor at Brean Capital in New York. ""We think the odds continue to rise that tapering begins before the end of 2021.""
Stocks on Wall Street rose, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&P 500 index hitting record highs. The dollar jumped against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices fell.
BROAD EMPLOYMENT GAINS
Employment in the leisure and hospitality sector increased by 380,000 jobs, accounting for 40% of the job gains, with payrolls at restaurants and bars advancing by 253,000.
Government payrolls increased by a whopping 240,000 jobs as employment in local government education rose by 221,000. Education jobs were flattered by a seasonal quirk. 
Hiring was also strong in the professional and business services, transportation and warehousing, and healthcare industries. Manufacturing payrolls increased by 27,000 jobs, while construction employment rebounded by 11,000 jobs. Retail trade and utilities were the only sectors to shed jobs. 
(GRAPHIC: Jobs by industry - https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-FED/INDUSTRY/qmypmdoolvr/chart.png) 
Details of the smaller household survey from which the unemployment rate is derived were also upbeat. Household employment shot up by 1.043 million jobs, leading the unemployment rate to decline half a percentage point to its lowest level since March 2020. 
The jobless rate, however, continued to be understated by people misclassifying themselves as being ""employed but absent from work."" Without this misclassification, the unemployment rate would have been 5.7% in July.
About 261,000 people entered the labor force, lifting the participation rate to 61.7% from 61.6% in June. The employment-to-population ratio, viewed as a measure of an economy's ability to create employment, rose to 58.4% from 58% in June.
Even more encouraging, the number of long-term unemployed dropped to 3.4 million from 4 million in the prior month. They accounted for 39.3% of the 8.7 million officially unemployed people, down from 42.1% in June. The duration of unemployment fell to 15.2 weeks from 19.8 weeks in June. 
(GRAPHIC: Unemployment duration - https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-STOCKS/byprjoaygpe/ueduration.png) 
There was also an improvement in the number of people who have permanently lost their jobs. With economic growth this year expected to be around 7%, which would be the fastest since 1984, further recovery is expected. 
Faced with a record 9.2 million job openings, employers continued to raise wages to attract workers. Average hourly earnings increased 0.4% last month, with sharp gains in the hospitality industry. That followed a similar rise in June and lifted the year-on-year increase in wages to 4.0% from 3.7%. 
(GRAPHIC: Wage growth - https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-STOCKS/mypmnmrebvr/wages.png) 
Lack of affordable child care and fears of contracting the coronavirus have been blamed for keeping workers, mostly women, at home. There also have been pandemic-related retirements as well as career changes. Republicans and business groups have blamed enhanced unemployment benefits, including a $300 weekly payment from the federal government, for the labor crunch.

Half of the nation's states led by Republican governors have ended these federal benefits before their Sept. 6 expiration. Economists are cautiously optimistic that the worker shortage will ease in the fall when schools reopen for in-person learning and sustain the strong pace of hiring.
""August should be another big month, and September as well, as there are still millions who need to find work quickly,"" said Chris Low, chief economist at FHN Financial in New York.

The Commerce Department said on Friday that wholesale inventories rose 1.1%, instead of 0.8% as estimated last month. Stocks at wholesalers advanced 1.3% in May. Wholesale inventories increased 10.5% in June from a year earlier.
Inventories are a key part of gross domestic product. The component of wholesale inventories that goes into the calculation of GDP increased 1.2% in June.
The government reported last week that consumer spending picked up in the second quarter, with outlays on goods rising solidly, even as demand rotates back to services because of COVID-19 vaccinations. The double-digit growth in consumer spending last quarter helped to lift the level of GDP above its peak in the fourth quarter of 2019. 

Business inventories were depleted at a rapid clip in the second quarter. The goods trade deficit surged to a record high in June as imports rose to an all-time high, the government reported on Thursday.
Sales at wholesalers increased 2.0% in June after climbing 0.8% in May. At June's sales pace it would take wholesalers 1.22 months to clear shelves, down from 1.23 in May.

Payrolls climbed by 943,000 last month after an upwardly revised 938,000 increase in June, a Labor Department report showed Friday. The median estimate in a Bloomberg survey of economists called for a 870,000 gain. The unemployment rate dropped to 5.4%.

Government payrolls added 240,000 jobs to the headline figure. Private payrolls posted a steady gain.
A resurgence in economic activity has sparked a surge in labor demand -- particularly in the leisure and hospitality industry -- since the beginning of the year. At the same time, payrolls remain well short of pre-pandemic levels and many employers have struggled to fill a record number of vacant positions.
The figures mark another step toward the Federal Reserve’s goal of “substantial” further progress in the labor market recovery. Fed officials including Chair Jerome Powell and Governor Lael Brainard have indicated the labor-market recovery had some way to go before the central bank could begin tapering asset purchases.
Fed Governor Christopher Waller said this week that if the next two monthly employment reports show continued gains, he could back such a move.

1589,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 06, 2021 04:51AM ET</span>","China's export, import growth seen moderating in July: Reuters poll","BEIJING (Reuters) - China's robust export growth likely moderated in July amid an acceleration in COVID-19 cases globally and continuing severe pressure on global supply chains, a Reuters poll showed on Friday.
Although there are signs China's strong industrial recovery in the first half of the year may be losing some momentum, overseas demand has remained strong in recent months even as factories in many countries return from lockdowns.
Headline trade numbers are also being helped by the statistical base effects when compared with sharp declines a year ago.
Exports are expected to have risen 20.8% in July from a year earlier, according to the median forecast in a Reuters poll of 21 economists, compared with a 32.2% gain in June.
Imports likely rose 33.0% last month year-on-year, the poll showed, compared to 36.7% growth in May. Despite China's attempts to cool surging raw materials prices, commodity prices remain elevated. 
Exports grew much faster than expected in June, as solid global demand led by easing lockdowns and vaccination drives eclipsed fresh virus outbreaks and port delays.
But overall trade growth in the world's second-biggest economy may slow in the second half of 2021, a customs official warned last month.
""Export growth has likely slowed further in July both in year-over-year and month-over-month terms...Korea also reported weaker growth of imports from China. A typhoon around Yangtze River Delta might have also reduced total trade growth in the month due to port disruptions,"" said analysts from Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) in a note.
Exporters are grappling with higher freight costs and lingering logistics bottlenecks.
The acceleration in Delta-variant coronavirus outbreaks in several countries, coupled with natural disasters, has put huge pressure on global supply chains and slowed global container turnaround times.
Container shipping rates from China to the United States have scaled fresh highs above $20,000 per 40-foot box amid rising retailer orders ahead of the peak year-end U.S. shopping season.
China reported on Friday its highest daily count for new coronavirus cases in its current outbreak at 124, fuelled by a surge in locally transmitted infections in a growing number of cities. 
""The next two weeks would be critical to see whether (China is) still effective in dealing with the Delta variant. In any case, consumption, especially summer tourism, is under heavy pressure,"" Larry Hu from Macquarie Capital Limited said in a note.

China's factory activity expanded in July at the slowest pace in 17 months as higher raw material costs, equipment maintenance and extreme weather weighed on business activity, adding to concerns about a slowdown in the world's second-biggest economy.
The trade surplus is expected to be $51.54 billion in July, from $51.53 billion in June, the poll showed. The data will be released on Saturday.

The Federal Statistics Office said industrial output dropped by 1.3% on the month after a downwardly revised decline of 0.8% in May. A Reuters poll had pointed to a rise of 0.5%.
The fall was driven by a drop in the production of capital goods, such as machinery and vehicles, which fell 2.9%, the data showed. Consumer goods output continued to grow, rising by 3.4%.
Industrial production fell by 0.6% in the quarter ending in June compared to the previous quarter, with the automotive industry reporting a drop of 11.2%.
In addition to timber shortage impacting the construction industry, the economy ministry said the drop was due to semiconductor supply bottlenecks. 
""The eagerly awaited semiconductors in Europe will continue to be a long time coming,"" said Thomas Gitzel, an economist at VP bank said.
Earlier on Friday, an Ifo economic institute survey showed that German industry cut its production outlook in June due to the supply issues.
""Bottlenecks for important intermediate products are now making themselves felt,"" Ifo economist Klaus Wohlrabe, the head of surveys at ifo, said 

But the ministry and analysts remained cautiously optimistic about the overall outlook due to high demand and strong exports.
""If the flow of material starts up again, industrial production will be able to wipe out its gap,"" Gitzel said.

House prices last month were 0.4% higher than in June when they fell by a monthly 0.6%, Halifax said. 
In annual terms, prices were 7.6% higher than in July 2020, the slowest rise since March.
Russell Galley, Halifax managing director, said he expected the market to settle after the recent buying surge which was driven by the tax incentive, but a shortage of home on the market was likely to support prices.
Under the incentive scheme, the first 500,000 pounds ($696,000) of any property purchase in England or Northern Ireland were exempt from the stamp duty tax until the end of June. A 250,000 pound tax-free allowance is now running until the end of September.
Galley said the recovery in the economy from its coronavirus shock and higher confidence among consumers suggested annual price growth, while slowing, would remain ""well into positive territory by the end of the year.""

Rival mortgage lender Nationwide said last week its measure of house prices showed a monthly fall of 0.5% in July, the first drop since March. That slowed the annual increase to 10.5% from June's leap of 13.4%, the steepest in 17 years.

1592,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 06, 2021 12:11AM ET</span>",Cooling measures doing little to slow New Zealand's housing boom,"By Praveen Menon
WELLINGTON (Reuters) - Desperation among homebuyers is pushing New Zealand house prices to record highs, overpowering the government's efforts to rein in the red-hot market and putting in jeopardy a key policy promise by Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern.
Nearly 15,000 homes sold for more than NZ$1 million ($705,100) during the last 12 months, compared with just 5,500 in 2020, according to the Real Estate Institute of New Zealand’s (REINZ) Million Dollar Price Report.
In the capital, Wellington, a 50-year-old derelict house deemed ""too dangerous to enter"" sold for almost NZ$1 million - a price far higher than expected.
""The new owners didn't step foot inside before purchasing it... even we could not enter,"" said Ben Atwill of real estate group Ray White, which made the sale. ""From what I am seeing, there is no stopping the premium dollars from coming through.""
Such runaway home prices have made New Zealand's property market one of the most unaffordable in the world, and measures introduced by the government and the central bank have so far done little to cool demand.
This is largely because of pandemic-inspired policies that have translated into cheaper mortgages, allowing affluent buyers and investors to upsize their homes and build up portfolios of rental investment properties, while locking out low and mid-income earners https://www.reuters.com/world/the-great-reboot/how-new-zealands-much-admired-covid-19-response-helped-fuel-housing-crisis-2021-04-16.
The government has tried to rein in the market with policy tweaks by applying new taxes for property investors and putting checks on ""flipping"" activity, in which investors buy a house, quickly renovate it and sell it for a large markup. Such investment has pushed house prices up by nearly 30% to a national average of NZ$820,000, on top of a 90% rise in the preceding decade.
Homebuyers don't want to miss out on what seems like a gold rush, and there is no evidence investors are leaving in a hurry, said independent economist Tony Alexander, who publishes a survey of real estate agents with REINZ.
""They (investors) know that if they stay longer they will come out better,"" Alexander told Reuters, adding that rising inflation was encouraging investment in real estate rather than in savings products.
'ALARM BELLS' 
New Zealand's central bank said this week that it was concerned about high-risk borrowing and that house prices were above sustainable levels. It is proposing tighter mortgage lending and debt-to-income restrictions https://www.reuters.com/article/newzealand-lending-rbnz-idUSL4N2P93NK.
Economists expect the bank to go further and raise interest rates at its policy meeting on Aug. 18.
""The Reserve Bank has highlighted that it's not seeing as much of a reaction to the changes made so far,"" said Brad Olsen, Principal Economist and Director at Infometrics. ""The risk of having such a large pile of debt has continued to ring alarm bells."" 
Housing has become a policy headache for Ardern, who secured a second term in office last year on the back of her success in handling the coronavirus pandemic. New Zealand has had about 2,500 coronavirus cases, with the last one in February.
Opinion polls this week showed her party's popularity has dropped since the election, while her rivals were gaining support. 
When she was elected in 2017, one of the issues in her platform was ending the free run of property investors and building affordable homes. 
But her centre-left government's flagship affordable-housing project, Kiwibuild, foundered. The government has not been able to remove the red tape around land approval, making land artificially scarce. Private developers say the costs and consent process make properties unaffordable.
Ardern has so far been unwilling to introduce a capital gains tax to cool the market.
""Capital gains tax is a political dynamite,"" Olsen said. ""A lot of people who vote also own homes so the housing issue is inextricable linked to politics."" 

The Human Rights Commission this week launched an inquiry into the housing crisis https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/new-zealand-human-rights-commission-launches-inquiry-into-housing-crisis-2021-08-02, saying it was causing a humanitarian crisis as young people were being deprived of their basic right to live in a decent home.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's economy likely recovered slightly in the second quarter from a steep slump at the start of the year, a Reuters poll showed, as solid exports and capital expenditure cushioned some of the blow to consumption from the coronavirus pandemic.
But analysts expect the world's third-largest economy to lag other advanced nations emerging from the doldrums, as expanded state of emergency curbs and a resurgence in infections weigh on household spending.
""There won't be much of a rebound from the first quarter's big contraction. The data will show the economy continues to stagnate,"" said Yoshiki Shinke, chief economist at Dai-ichi Life Research Institute.
""Conditions won't improve much in July-September, as expanded COVID-19 curbs and surging infections hurt consumption during the summer.""
Preliminary gross domestic product (GDP) data will show the economy grew an annualised 0.7% in April-June, after a 3.9% slump in the first quarter, according to analysts polled by Reuters. On a quarter-on-quarter basis, GDP likely grew 0.2%, the poll showed.
Capital expenditure is forecast to have expanded 1.7% as manufacturers ramped up spending to make up for investment delays caused by the pandemic last year, the poll showed.
Consumption shrank 0.1% as the health crisis continued to weigh on service spending, though the drop is smaller than the previous quarter's 1.5% decline, the poll showed.
While exports remain strong, external demand likely shaved 0.1% point off growth as imports rose more than overseas shipments, according to the poll.
The government will release the GDP data at 8:50 a.m. on Aug. 16 (2350GMT, Aug. 15).
Separate data is expected to show wholesale inflation hit 5.0% in July from a year earlier, a sign rising raw material costs were hitting corporate margins, the poll showed.
The data is due 8:50 a.m. on Aug. 12 (2350GMT, Aug. 11).
Japan's economic contraction in the first quarter marked the first fall in three quarters, as curbs on activity to combat the pandemic hit consumption.
While robust global demand has boosted exports and capital expenditure, a worldwide chip shortage has disrupted auto production and clouded the outlook for Japanese manufacturers.

""Growth in exports and output appears to be slowing,"" said Mari Iwashita, chief market economist at Daiwa Securities.
""Japan's factory output may experience some volatility if the chip shortage lasts longer than expected.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits declined further last week, while layoffs dropped to their lowest level in just over 21 years in July as companies held on to workers amid a labor shortage.
The weekly unemployment claims report from the Labor Department on Thursday, the most timely data on the economy's health, also showed the number of people on state jobless rolls dropped in late July to its lowest level since March 2020, when mandatory closures of nonessential businesses were enforced to slow the first wave of COVID-19 cases.
Though the data falls outside the survey period for July's closely watched employment report, it bolstered economists' expectations for another month of strong payrolls gains. The employment report for July is due to be released on Friday.
""From an employment-estimating perspective, this suggests a hefty increase in nonfarm payrolls tomorrow,"" said Chris Low, chief economist at FHN Financial in New York. 
Initial claims for state unemployment benefits fell 14,000 to a seasonally adjusted 385,000 for the week ended July 31. Data for the prior week was revised to show 1,000 fewer applications received than previously reported. 
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast 384,000 applications for the latest week. Unadjusted claims, which economists say offer a better read of the labor market, decreased 20,602 to 323,763 last week. 
There is no sign yet that a resurgence in COVID-19 infections, driven by the Delta variant of the coronavirus, is disrupting economic activity. Nearly half of the population has been fully vaccinated. 
Claims fell in Florida, one of the states hardest hit by the current COVID-19 wave. There were also notable declines in applications in Texas, Pennsylvania, Michigan and Tennessee. 
""The latest week's data was the first in the thick of rising Delta variant COVID-19 cases, and so far that rise in infections hasn’t pushed up layoffs,"" said Robert Frick, corporate economist at Navy Federal Credit Union in Vienna, Virginia. ""Together with microdata such as airline flights and restaurant bookings, it appears that for now, the economy overall is holding fast against the fourth wave of infections.""
Claims remain above their pre-pandemic level of 256,000, though they have dropped from a record 6.149 million in early April 2020. There are still concerns that rising coronavirus cases could slow the labor market recovery amid a shortage of workers. There were a record 9.2 million job openings as of the end of May. About 9.5 million people are officially unemployed. 
(GRAPHIC: Jobless claims - https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-STOCKS/znpnedoryvl/jobless.png) 
The economy fully recovered in the second quarter the sharp loss in output suffered during the very brief pandemic recession. A separate report from the Commerce Department on Thursday showed the U.S. trade deficit surged to a record high in June as efforts by businesses to rebuild inventories to meet robust consumer spending drew in more imports.
Stocks on Wall Street were trading higher on the claims data. The dollar was steady against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices fell. 
(GRAPHIC: Trade balance - https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-STOCKS/movanmzggpa/tradebal.png) 
EYES ON JULY PAYROLLS
The claims report showed the number of people continuing to receive benefits after an initial week of aid dropped 366,000 to 2.930 million during the week ended July 24, the lowest level since the pandemic started. The decline in the so-called continuing claims was led by California, which saw 256,370 people dropping off unemployment rolls. 
Continuing claims declined 59,809 in Pennsylvania. There were also decreases in some of the states led by Republican governors that terminated federal government benefits before their Sept. 6 expiration. 
Republicans and business groups have blamed enhanced unemployment benefits, including a $300 weekly payment from the federal government, for the labor crunch. 
Still, the labor market recovery has a long way to go. About 12.975 million people were receiving unemployment checks under all programs in mid-July.
The Labor Department is expected to report on Friday that nonfarm payrolls increased by 870,000 jobs in July after rising 850,000 in June, according to a Reuters survey of economists. That would leave employment about 5.9 million jobs below its peak in February 2020.
July's nonfarm payrolls estimate is highly uncertain, with labor market indicators mixed. In a separate report on Thursday, global outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas said job cuts announced by U.S.-based employers fell 7.5% to 18,942 in July, the lowest number since June 2000. 
So far this year, employers have announced 231,603 job cuts, down 87.5% compared to the same period last year. 
(GRAPHIC: Challenger Gray - https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-STOCKS/myvmnmwerpr/challenger.png) 
Data from Homebase, a payroll scheduling and tracking company, showed its employees working index rose moderately in July from June. The ADP employment report on Wednesday showed the smallest private payrolls gain in five months in July. 

That was, however, countered by two Institute for Supply Management surveys showing a rebound in manufacturing and services industries employment last month. The Conference Board's labor market differential, derived from data on consumers' views on whether jobs are plentiful or hard to get, in July hit its highest level since 2000.
""Labor market churn will pick up further in the coming months as the conditions in the labor market remain ripe for workers to seek better opportunities,"" said Dante DeAntonio, a senior economist at Moody's (NYSE:MCO) Analytics in West Chester, Pennsylvania.

OTTAWA (Reuters) -Canada unexpectedly posted a trade surplus of C$3.23 billion ($2.58 billion) in June, the largest in almost 13 years, as exports jumped on higher shipments of oil and autos, Statistics Canada data indicated on Thursday.
Analysts polled by Reuters had forecast a trade deficit of C$0.68 billion in June. The surplus was the largest since the C$3.45 billion recorded in September 2008.
Exports leapt by 8.7%, the biggest increase since July 2020, to hit a record high C$53.76 billion as economies continue their recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic.
""This is a very pleasant surprise,"" said Peter Hall, chief economist at Canada's export development agency.
""International supply chains are becoming less encumbered and ... fundamental underlying demand that has been with us all the way along is actually manifesting itself in growth,"" he said by phone.
The value of crude oil exports rose by 25.7% on higher volumes after a slowdown in production in April and May.
Exports of motor vehicles and parts - hobbled in recent months by a shortage of computer chips - rose by 14.9% but remain more than 8% lower than in June 2020.
""The auto sector is still struggling to cope with shortages and, with energy exports now close to a record high, the scope for further gains is limited,"" Paul Ashworth of Capital Economics said in a note.
The shortages also helped cut imports of autos and parts, which fell 3.8%. Overall imports dipped by 1.0%.
Royce Mendes, senior economist with CIBC, said in a note that exports of goods and services ""should provide less of a drag on GDP in the second quarter than previously anticipated"".

JAKARTA (Reuters) -Indonesia pulled out of recession in the second quarter, reporting its strongest annual growth rate in 17 years, but analysts warned its economic recovery will suffer a setback due to a recent surge in COVID-19 infections.
Southeast Asia's largest economy grew 7.07% in the April-June quarter compared with a year earlier, its first expansion in five quarters, Statistics Indonesia reported on Thursday.
The expansion rate beat a 6.57% forecast by analysts in a Reuters poll and was the highest since the October-December quarter of 2004. The first quarter's contraction was revised to 0.71%.
Surging exports - including impressive 56% growth in commodity shipments - a rebound in consumption and investment, and bigger government spending boosted activity. 
However, the statistics bureau said the high growth rate was also due to low base effects when compared to the weak pandemic-stricken second quarter last year.
Despite the better-than-expected outcome, analysts are downgrading their outlooks for the economy due to the virus' resurgence and mobility restrictions imposed since July.
Indonesia recorded a grim milestone of more than 100,000 deaths from COVID-19 on Wednesday, with 3.57 million people infected, though health experts believe the true numbers may be far higher.
""Indonesia's GDP bounce will be short-lived,"" said Krystal Tan, an economist with ANZ who is among those pencilling in slower growth this year. ANZ's new forecast is 3.8%, down from 4%.
""The pace of recovery will be capped until COVID-19 risks fade.""
The central bank had already lowered its projection to a range of 3.5% to 4.3%, from 4.1% to 5.1%, slightly below the government's 3.7% to 4.5% outlook. Indonesia's economy shrank last year for the first time since 1998, by 2.1%. 
The current stay-at-home order, applied in areas with high infection numbers including much of Java and Bali islands, has been extended until at least Aug. 9, but authorities are eyeing a September reopening. Only essential and critical sectors of the economy are allowed to operate at varying capacities now. 
A few analysts flagged a risk of a double-dip recession if curbs are extended for longer.
The government is trying to bring down the number of people being treated with COVID-19 to around 100,000 per day, from 500,000 now, so that the economy can regain momentum in the fourth quarter and grow more than 5%, chief economic minister Airlangga Hartarto said.
Authorities have also pledged to accelerate a vaccination drive, which many economists say is needed for a more sustainable recovery. Since the vaccination campaign began in January, just 8% of the population have been fully inoculated so far.
""Relatively slow vaccination progress means lockdowns may be needed from time to time to contain COVID outbreaks, which will likely result in a more volatile and delayed growth recovery,"" Oxford Economics said in a research note.
Finance Minister Sri Mulyani Indrawati also promised to accelerate spending and extend tax breaks.

Meanwhile, analysts say the central bank, which has slashed interest rates to record lows and injected over $57 billion of liquidity into the financial system, is unlikely to deliver more rate cuts.
A potential boost to GDP growth in the third quarter comes from strong demand for the country's commodities, said Bank Mandiri economist Faisal Rachman. In the second quarter, exports jumped nearly 32% on-year.

This was the strongest increase in 10 months and easily beat a Reuters forecast of a 1.9% increase, more than offsetting a slightly revised drop of 3.2% in May.
Excluding major orders, new orders in manufacturing still rose 1.7% on the month.
Domestic orders soared nearly 10%, with producers of data processing equipment, lens systems, planes and ships benefiting from unusually strong demand, the economy ministry said.
""Incoming orders also rose in the important car and mechanical engineering sectors,"" the ministry added.
Orders for engineering companies soared 53% in June from the previous year due to stronger demand from both domestic and foreign customers, industry association VDMA said on Thursday.
""Investments in equipment, machines and services are high on the agenda around the world,"" VDMA chief economist Ralph Wiechers said.
The German economy, Europe's largest, returned to growth in the second quarter but bounced back less strongly than expected as manufacturers struggle to get intermediate goods and building materials to ramp up production.
""Although the order backlog is high, it cannot be processed quickly due to ongoing delivery bottlenecks for intermediate products and materials,"" Bankhaus Lampe analyst Bastian Hepperle said.
In a further sign that more orders are currently not translating into higher output, real turnover in manufacturing fell by 1.4% on the month in June in seasonally adjusted terms, the office said. On the year, real turnover rose by 8.6%.
The supply bottlenecks in manufacturing will continue to hold back production, so industry is likely to slow down the economic recovery in the third quarter as well, Hepperle added.
Undersupply of semiconductors, as outbreaks of the Delta coronavirus variant in Southeast Asia have crippled its factory sector, is leading to production downtimes in the car industry and many other industrial sectors.
""But the shortage of skilled workers is also becoming more and more noticeable,"" VP Bank economist Thomas Gitzel said.

The current recovery is supported by strong retail sales, which jumped in May and June following the lifting of COVID-19 restrictions.
A survey indicated on Wednesday that domestic demand remains strong, with activity in the service sector growing at the fastest pace on record in July.

1599,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 05, 2021 04:46AM ET</span>",UK construction PMI slumps to lowest since February,"By David Milliken
LONDON (Reuters) - Activity in Britain's construction industry grew last month at its weakest pace since February due to shortages of building materials and contractors, adding to signs of post-COVID bottlenecks in the economy.
The IHS Markit/CIPS construction Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) fell from June's 24-year high of 66.3 to 58.7 in July. This was the PMI's lowest reading since February and the sharpest single-month drop since April 2020, Britain's first full month of COVID lockdown.
While the PMI still points to solid growth in the sector, economists polled by Reuters had expected a much smaller slowdown to a reading of 64.0.
""Long lead times for materials and shrinking sub-contractor availability were cited as factors holding back work on site,"" IHS Markit's economics director, Tim Moore, said.
Some construction firms also reported that a spike in demand when lockdown restrictions first eased earlier in 2021 was now beginning to wane.
Separate data released overnight by the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors painted a similar picture of supply constraints, including growing shortages of bricklayers, carpenters and quantity surveyors.
Britain's economy is bouncing back rapidly this year after suffering its biggest fall in output in more than three centuries in 2020.
But there has been a sharp rise in inflation pressures due to a mix of higher oil prices and supply-chain bottlenecks as the world economy emerges from months of lockdowns.
The Bank of England is expected to revise up its forecasts for inflation later on Thursday, and some economists see British inflation - currently 2.5% - hitting a 10-year high of about 4% around the turn of the year.
The BoE, like most other central banks, expects this spike in inflation to ease next year once the initial effects of lifting lockdowns have passed.

The construction PMI pointed to big inflation pressures in the pipeline, as construction firms' costs grew only slightly less fast than the 24-year high recorded in June.
""Supply imbalances were amplified by a lack of transport availability, port congestion, and Brexit trade frictions,"" IHS Markit said.

1600,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 05, 2021 04:26AM ET</span>",UK new car sales fall to lowest July level since 1998,"LONDON (Reuters) - British new car sales fell by 29.5% to their lowest July level since 1998 as the 'pingdemic' of people self-isolating alongside supply shortages hit demand, according to an industry body.
Whilst July 2020 was boosted by being the first full month dealerships were open across Britain after the initial lockdown, this year has been hit by a semiconductor shortage in the industry and people having to self-isolate due to catching COVID-19 or being in contact with someone who had. 
As cases rose last month, hundreds of thousands of people were being ""pinged"" by the National Health Service's contact-tracing app to isolate for 10 days, although it has now been tweaked to reduce the numbers contacted. 

A total of 123,296 vehicles were registered in July, according to the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT), which said it is marginally downgrading its full-year forecast to around 1.82 million cars. 
""The next few weeks will see changes to self-isolation policies which will hopefully help those companies across the industry dealing with staff absences, but the semiconductor shortage is likely to remain an issue until at least the rest of the year,"" SMMT Chief Executive Mike Hawes said.

1601,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 04, 2021 02:25PM ET</span>",U.S. services sector growth accelerates despite supply constraints,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A measure of U.S. services industry activity jumped to a record high in July, boosted by the shift in spending to services from goods, but businesses continued to pay higher prices for inputs because of supply constraints.
The Institute for Supply Management survey on Wednesday also showed a rebound in a gauge of services industry employment last month. That eased worries of a sharp slowdown in job growth, which had been stoked by the ADP Employment Report showing the smallest gain in private payrolls in five months in July.
The bounce back in the ISM services employment index followed a similar reading for the manufacturing sector. The economy is pushing ahead after fully recovering in the second quarter the sharp loss in output suffered during the very brief COVID-19 pandemic recession.
""For months, employers have struggled to find labor and employment numbers have been held down from the worker side rather than a lack of demand from companies,"" said Chris Low, chief economist at FHN Financial in New York. ""These increases bode well for Friday's employment report. ADP has not been very useful this year.""
The Institute for Supply Management said its non-manufacturing activity index raced to 64.1 last month, the highest reading since the series started in 2008, from 60.1 in June. A reading above 50 indicates growth in the services sector, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the index climbing to 60.5.
All services industries reported growth, with anecdotes of pent-up demand as ""companies begin to fully reopen and remote workers return to offices."" 
Demand is rotating back to services as nearly half of the population has been fully vaccinated against COVID-19, allowing people to travel, frequent restaurants, visit casinos and attend sporting events among services-related activities that were curbed early in the pandemic in favor of goods.
Government data last week showed spending on services accelerated sharply in the second quarter, helping to lift the level of gross domestic product above its peak in the fourth quarter of 2019.
The ISM survey's measure of new orders received by services businesses increased to a reading of 63.7 from 62.1 in June. Further gains are likely in the months ahead, with inventories lean and inventory sentiment among customers poor. Businesses depleted inventories at a rapid clip in the second quarter. Stocks at retailers are well below normal levels.
U.S. stocks were trading lower after a record close for the S&P 500 index. The dollar rose against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices were mixed.
PORTS CONGESTION
The strong demand is continuing to strain supply chains. The survey's measure of supplier deliveries rose to 72.0 from a reading of 68.5 in June. A reading above 50 indicates slower deliveries. Some businesses complained about the scarcity of appliances, laptops as well as rental cars. Others said heating, ventilation and air conditioning repairs also were impacted by longer than normal lead times for replacement units.
Wholesalers said congestion at the ports of Long Beach/Los Angeles and Seattle had increased lead time by 15 days. They were also facing additional delays at the Chicago rail yard. 
With bottlenecks in the supply chain persisting, a measure of prices paid by services industries surged to 82.3, the highest reading in nearly 16 years, from 79.5 in June. 
Fed Chair Jerome Powell has repeatedly stated that inflation will moderate as supply constraints abate.
Services industries hired more workers in July, though labor shortages lingered, especially in the accommodation and food services sector. A measure of services industry employment rebounded to a reading of 53.8 from 49.3 in June. 
That offset the ADP report showing private payrolls rose by 330,000 jobs last month, less than half of the 695,000 that had been anticipated by a Reuters survey of economists. 
The slowdown in hiring last month was across all business sizes and industries. Leisure and hospitality payrolls increased by 139,000 jobs, below the 330,000 average in the second quarter. Economists said this suggested the early terminations of benefits in at least 20 states led by Republican governors was not forcing low-wage earners to return to work.
Factories added only 8,000 jobs in July. A global shortage of semiconductors is hampering production in the automobile sector. Hiring at construction sites stalled as expensive lumber and scarce building materials constrain homebuilding.
The ADP report, which is jointly developed with Moody's (NYSE:MCO) Analytics, was published ahead of the government's more comprehensive, and closely watched employment report for July on Friday. It, however, has a poor record predicting the private payrolls count in the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) employment report because of methodology differences.
According to a Reuters survey of economists, private payrolls likely increased by 750,000 jobs in July after rising 662,000 in June. With government employment expected to have increased by about 130,000, thanks to education-related hiring, that would lead to overall payrolls advancing by 880,000 jobs in July. The economy created 850,000 jobs in June. 
July's nonfarm payrolls estimate is highly uncertain, with labor market indicators mixed. Data from Homebase, a payroll scheduling and tracking company, showed its employees working index rising moderately in July compared to June. 
The Conference Board's labor market differential, derived from data on consumers' views on whether jobs are plentiful or hard to get, in July hit its highest level since 2000.
Education payrolls typically fall by at least 1 million in July, before adjusting for seasonal fluctuations, as schools and universities close for summer. 

This year, however, many students are in summer school catching up after disruptions caused by the pandemic. Economists anticipate a small decline in education employment, which would boost the seasonally adjusted payrolls for the sector.
""We are maintaining our forecast for the BLS report to show 900,000 jobs added in July, with 550,000 coming from the private sector,"" said Daniel Silver, an economist at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) in New York.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A measure of U.S. services industry activity jumped to a record high in July, boosted by the shift in spending to services from goods, but businesses continued to face rising prices because of supply chain constraints.

The strong demand is continuing to strain supply chains. The survey's measure of supplier deliveries rose to 72.0 from a reading of 68.5 in June. A reading above 50 indicates slower deliveries. With bottlenecks in the supply chain persisting, input prices are soaring for services businesses. 
That contrasts with signs of an easing in supply and price pressures reported in the ISM's manufacturing survey on Monday. 
RISING PRICES
Last month, a measure of prices paid by services industries surged to 82.3, the highest reading in nearly 16 years, from 79.5 in June. 
Some economists worry that higher inflation could be more persistent than currently envisioned by the Federal Reserve.
Fed Chair Jerome Powell has repeatedly stated that inflation will moderate as supply constraints abate. The U.S. central bank's preferred inflation measure, the personal consumption expenditures price index, excluding the volatile food and energy components, shot up 3.5% year-on-year in June, the largest gain since December 1991.
Services industries hired more workers in July. A measure of services industry employment rebounded to a reading of 53.8 from 49.3 in June. 
That together with a pick-up in hiring at factories bodes well for July's employment report, due to be released on Friday.
According to a Reuters survey of economists, nonfarm payrolls likely increased by 880,000 jobs last month after rising by 850,000 in June. Employers are struggling to find willing workers to fill a record 9.2 million job openings even as 9.5 million people are officially unemployed. 
Lack of affordable child care and fears of contracting the coronavirus have been blamed for keeping workers, mostly women, at home. There have also been pandemic-related retirements as well as career changes. Republicans and business groups have blamed enhanced unemployment benefits, including a $300 weekly check from the federal government, for the labor crunch.

While more than 20 states led by Republican governors have ended these federal benefits before they were scheduled to run out in early September, there has been little evidence that the terminations boosted hiring. 
The labor shortage is expected to ease in the fall when schools reopen for in-person learning, but a resurgence in new COVID-19 cases, driven by the Delta variant of the coronavirus, could see some people reluctant to return to the labor force.

LONDON (Reuters) - Euro zone business activity roared in July, expanding at its fastest pace in 15 years, as the lifting of more coronavirus restrictions and an accelerated vaccine drive injected life into the bloc's dominant service industry, a survey showed.
But supply chain disruptions and labour shortages meant input prices surged at the fastest rate in over two decades and fears of further curbs to contain the more infectious Delta variant of COVID-19 dented optimism.
IHS Markit's final composite Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI), seen as a good gauge of economic health, climbed to 60.2 last month from June's 59.5, its highest level since June 2006, well above the 50 mark separating growth from contraction, though slightly below a 60.6 ""flash"" estimate.
With more of the services industry reopening, the sector's PMI index rose to its highest final reading since June 2006.
""Across the bloc, the services PMIs remain comfortably in expansionary territory as the services sector benefits from easing restrictions,"" said Katharina Koenz at Oxford Economics.
Services activity in Germany, Europe's largest economy, expanded at a record pace. In France, the bloc's second biggest economy, growth remained elevated but dipped slightly more than originally thought.
Italy's services sector grew in July at its fastest rate for 14 years and although Spain's growth was off June's highs it remained strong.
In Britain, outside the euro zone and the European Union, private-sector growth slowed sharply due to supply-chain bottlenecks and high worker absences prompted by COVID-19 isolation requirements. [GB/PMIS]
DELTA RISK
Manufacturing activity continued to expand at a blistering pace last month, a sister survey showed on Monday, but widespread shortages of materials and poor transport availability pushed the factory input prices index to its highest reading since the survey began in June 1997. [EUR/PMIM]
Inflationary pressures were also felt by services firms and the composite input price index nudged up to its highest in nearly 21 years.

Meanwhile, a Reuters poll last month indicated that the biggest risk to the bloc's economic outlook was new COVID-19 variants and, with the Delta strain sweeping across Europe, the services business expectations index slipped to a three-month low. [ECILT/EU]
""Looking ahead, downside risks to the 2021 outlook remain. For the services sector it will be pivotal to maintain the high vaccination speed to limit the spread of the already prevalent Delta variant,"" Koenz said.

(Reuters) - The 30-year U.S. mortgage rate fell below 3% last week for the first time since February as interest rates globally drifted lower.
The Mortgage Bankers Association (MBA) said on Wednesday its average contract interest rate for traditional 30-year mortgages decreased to 2.97% from 3.01% in the week ending July 30.
After hitting record lows late last year below 2.9%, mortgage rates climbed in the first part of this year and peaked in the spring. Rates have been drifting lower since, held down in large part by the U.S. Federal Reserve's extraordinary stimulus measures aimed at helping the economy rebound from the coronavirus pandemic.

The seasonally adjusted market index fell 1.7% from a week earlier, the MBA said. That reflected a 1.7% decrease in applications to refinance existing loans, while purchase applications also declined 1.7%.
""Purchase application volume decreased again, reflecting the ongoing lack of inventory that continues to drive rapid home-price appreciation across the country,"" Mike Fratantoni, MBA's senior vice president and chief economist, said in a statement.

LONDON (Reuters) - British private-sector growth slowed sharply last month due to supply-chain bottlenecks and high worker absences prompted by COVID-19 isolation requirements, a closely watched survey indicated on Wednesday.
Price pressures rose by the most since the survey began 25 years ago - a concern for the Bank of England as it finalises new inflation forecasts due on Thursday. To date, the BoE has said higher inflation will be temporary.
The IHS Markit/CIPS services Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) sank to 59.6 in July, its lowest reading since March, from 62.4 in June. The broader composite PMI, which includes Tuesday's manufacturing PMI data, showed a similar drop, to 59.2 from 62.2.
""More businesses are experiencing growth constraints from supply shortages of labour and materials, while on the demand side we've already seen the peak phase of pent-up consumer spending,"" said IHS Markit's economics director, Tim Moore.
July's final PMI readings were well above preliminary ""flash"" data, however. IHS Markit said this reflected a boost to services businesses from the lifting of most remaining COVID-19 restrictions in England on July 19. 
Britain's economy is rebounding fast after suffering its biggest fall in output in more than 300 years in 2020, but most economists think the fastest growth probably came in the three months to June, when COVID rules eased most. 
Service businesses were hit last month by a ""pingdemic"" of hundreds of thousands of workers having to self-isolate for up to 10 days after being identified by a government smartphone app as a close contact of someone who had tested positive for coronavirus.
The daily number of new COVID-19 cases has now fallen by more than half since a peak on July 17 - just before social-distancing rules eased in England - and the government will relax self-isolation requirements from Aug. 16.

Even so, many businesses are finding it hard to recruit staff. Employment growth in the survey slowed to its weakest in three months, while service exports continue to be hampered by COVID-related travel restrictions.
Wage costs, higher fuel prices and transport were the biggest factors pushing up costs in the service sector, where managers reported raising prices by the most since July 1996.

IHS Markit's final services Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI)measuring activity in the sector rose to 61.8 in July from 57.5 in June. The July reading was the strongest since the survey began more than 24 years ago.
The composite PMI index, which comprises both the service and manufacturing sectors, rose to 62.4 in July from 60.1 in June, surpassing a previous record set in June 2006.
""The ramping up of activity is ... proving to be good news for workers, with companies taking on extra staff at an unprecedented rate,"" said Andrew Harker, Economics Director at IHS Markit.

""Inflationary pressures remain elevated, however, and companies will take little solace from the fact that costs rose at a slightly weaker pace than in June. With the sector running hot and severe pressure on capacity signalled, rising costs look set to remain a feature in the near term at least,"" he added.
German retail sales rose much more than expected in June following the easing of COVID-19 restrictions, data showed on Monday, supporting hopes of a consumer-driven recovery in Europe's largest economy over the summer months.

BANGKOK/KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - Fresh outbreaks of the Delta coronavirus variant in Southeast Asia have crippled its factory sector, disrupting global supplies of goods such as rubber gloves, semiconductors and SUVs and threatening the $3 trillion region's recovery.
A series of factory surveys this week showed business activity across most Southeast Asian economies fell sharply in July, a contrast to more resilient manufacturing economies in Northeast Asia and the West, where business growth has slowed but remained in expansion.
The economic disruptions in Southeast Asia caused by the virus have been made worse by slow progress in vaccinations in the region of 600 million people. Governments have struggled to secure doses and have imposed costly lockdowns that have left many factories without workers.
The setbacks threaten the growth of one of the world's more resilient emerging market blocs, which has withstood various global crises in recent decades thanks to broad robust economic reforms and its proximity to China.
HSBC economists warn the low inoculation rates in Indonesia, Vietnam, the Philippines and Thailand, as well as the uncertain efficacy of their vaccines, put their economies at risk.
""This means that populations in these countries could remain vulnerable not only to the current outbreak, but any future mutations that may develop,"" HSBC said. ""Touch-and-go restrictions are likely to continue, weighing on the near-term growth outlook.""
For Southeast Asia's manufacturers, which are competitive largely because of low-cost labour and access to raw materials, the impact of new outbreaks on labour supply has been a major production bottleneck.
In Thailand, Asia's fourth-largest auto exporter and a production base for major global car brands,  Toyota  Motor (NYSE:TM) Corp suspended production at three of its plants in July in July due to parts shortages caused by the pandemic.
HIGH DEMAND, LOW PRODUCTION
Siam Agro-Food Industry, a Thai processed fruit exporter, is heavily reliant on migrant labour and has only been able to fill 400 of the 550 roles as workers return to their countries and are unable to return due to closed borders.
""There are 350 tonnes of fruit per day but now we can take only 250 tonnes because of not enough workers to process,"" said Ghanyapad Tantipipatpong, president of Siam Agro-Food Industry.
""There is strong demand from export markets, such as the United States, our main market. The problem now is with the production.""
In Vietnam, which hosts facilities belonging to global companies such as Samsung (KS:005930), Foxconn and  Nike  (NYSE:NKE), companies in the country's south have been forced to keep workers isolated at their production sites at night.
Industrial output in several southern cities and provinces where strict movement curbs were imposed from July, has fallen sharply, the government's statistics office said last week.
In Malaysia, which supplies about 67% of the global rubber glove market, lockdown restrictions forced many glove makers to suspend operations in June and July.
Eased restrictions since then have allowed 60% of the work force to return after the country's glove-making association pleaded with the government for the industry to resume, citing concerns from global buyers. The association is now calling for a full return.
Already, disruptions in Southeast Asia are causing pain elsewhere with German chipmaker Infineon (OTC:IFNNY) Technologies expecting a hit in the tens of millions of dollars from shutdowns at its Malaysia plant. The slowdown will in turn affect Infineon's automotive clients.
Daniel Bernbeck, CEO of the Malaysian-German Chamber of Commerce and Industry, said Malaysia's strict quarantine rules have also made it difficult for higher-end manufacturers such as chipmakers to bring it the technical expertise needed.
Analysts warn the risks go beyond just the hit to production.

Moody's (NYSE:MCO) Investors Service said Asia-Pacific economies with ""concentrated economic structures"" and weak institutions would be hit hardest.
""These are economies with lower-middle incomes, with deep scarring likely to increase social risks,"" Moody's said. ""In some of these economies, high debt burdens are limiting governments' fiscal space to withstand the pandemic.""

Restrictions imposed by local governments to curb the devastating second wave of COVID-19 were relaxed over the past few months following a drop in infection rates, but the threat of a third wave has cast a shadow over the already weak economic outlook. [ECILT/IN]
Although the Services Purchasing Managers' Index, compiled by IHS Markit, rose to 45.4 in July from 41.2 in June it stayed firmly below the 50-level separating growth from contraction for a third month.
Overall demand in the sector shrank again last month, albeit at a slower pace, and overseas demand declined for a 17th month - the longest streak since the sub-index started in September 2014.
""The current COVID-19 environment continued to weigh on the performance of the service sector that is so crucial to the Indian economy,"" noted Pollyanna De Lima, economics associate director at IHS Markit. 
""July data was somewhat disappointing, with incoming new business and output falling solidly over the month, but there was at least a slowdown in rates of contraction.""
That weak demand and a dour outlook pushed services firms to cut headcounts for an eighth month, indicating it may take a long time for the labour market to reach pre-pandemic levels.
Meanwhile, business expectations turned negative for the first time since July last year.
""Uncertainty over when the pandemic will end, as well as concerns about inflationary pressures and financial troubles, dampened business confidence in July,"" added De Lima.
Both input costs and prices charged increased at a faster pace last month, with the latter surging at the quickest rate in eight months.

Still, the Reserve Bank of India is expected to keep key interest rates untouched until the next fiscal year to help the economy through the pandemic.
An overall composite index rose to 49.2 last month from June's 43.1, staying below the 50-mark for a third month as the contraction in services offset a rebound in manufacturing.

1609,By Investing.com,"<span>Aug 04, 2021 12:18AM ET</span>","China’s Private Services Sector Accelerates in July, But COVID-19 Threats Remain","By Gina Lee
Investing.com – China’s services sector recorded accelerating growth in July, even as the country’s latest outbreak of COVID-19 threatens to hamper the country’s economic recovery from COVID-19.
The Caixin services purchasing managers’ index (PMI), released earlier in the day, was 54.9 in July, higher than the 50.3 figure from the previous month and was at its highest point since May 2021. The figure was above the 50-mark indicating growth.
The Caixin manufacturing PMI, released on Monday, was a lower-than-expected 50.3 in July.
The better reading from the private survey, whose focus is more on smaller firms in coastal regions, contrasted with those from the official survey released during the previous week. The non-manufacturing PMI was 53.3, and the manufacturing PMI was 50.4, both lower than expected.
The service sector has trailed its manufacturing counterpart in recovering from COVID-19 but had slowly been closing that gap as consumption increased. However, China’s latest outbreak of COVID-19 cases, which has spread to nearly half of the country's 32 provinces within just two weeks, threatens to put a big dent into the country’s economic recovery.
The July readings were buoyed by the successful containment of COVID-19 cases in southern China, although the impact from the latest round of outbreaks since late July was likely to hurt PMI readings in the next month, according to Caixin Insight Group senior economist Wang Zhe.
""The economy still faces enormous downward pressure, and we need to ensure business owners remain confident,"" Wang added.
China's latest COVID-19 outbreak started with the city of Nanjing confirming its first cases involving the Delta variant of the virus. It has since to numerous cities in southern China and a few northern ones, including Beijing. One sector already feeling the impact is tourism, as the reimplementation of restrictive measures to curb the outbreak’s spread will dampen the peak summer travel demand.
The survey also said new export orders fell again as other countries struggle with their own COVID-19 outbreaks. However, business confidence picked up, even though it was slightly lower than its long-term average. On the jobs front, service sector employment returned to slight growth in July as companies aimed to control costs."

The Caixin/Markit services Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI)rose to 54.9 in July, the highest since May and up from 50.3 the previous month. The 50-point mark separates growth from contraction on a monthly basis.
The better readings in the private survey, which focuses more on smaller firms in coastal regions, stood in contrast with findings in an official survey on Saturday which showed growth in the services sector retreat slightly in July. 
China's services sector has been slower to recover from the pandemic than manufacturing, but has been helped by a gradual improvement in consumption in recent months. A rise in domestic coronavirus infections, however, is threatening to hurt the economy's steady recovery.
The July readings were buoyed by the successful containment of COVID-19 cases in southern China, said Wang Zhe, senior economist at Caixin Insight Group, although he warned that the impact from the latest round of outbreaks since late July was likely to hurt August's PMI readings. 
""The economy still faces enormous downward pressure, and we need to ensure business owners remain confident,"" Wang said. 
Since the eastern city of Nanjing confirmed its first Delta cases on July 20, numerous cities in southern China and a few in the north including Beijing, have reported infections. The tally of locally transmitted cases stood at 414 as of Monday.
Tourism is already taking a hit, as local authorities encourage people to stay put to avoid infection, which will be a blow for industries looking forward to peak summer travel demand.
A sub-index of new business in the Caixin survey stood at 54.5 in July, up from 50.5 the previous month. New export orders contracted again due to the resurgence of COVID-19 cases overseas. 

Business confidence picked up, although it was still slightly lower than its long-term average. Service sector employment returned to growth in July but the rate of job creation was only slight as firms looked to control costs.

1611,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 03, 2021 07:18PM ET</span>","New Zealand Jobless Rate Drops to 4%, Fueling Rate-Hike Bets","(Bloomberg) -- New Zealand’s unemployment rate fell more than forecast in the second quarter as the economy’s recovery boosted hiring and began to stoke wage inflation. The kiwi dollar rose as traders increased bets on higher interest rates.
The jobless rate fell to 4% from a revised 4.6% in the first quarter, Statistics New Zealand said Wednesday in Wellington. Economists expected 4.4%. Employment rose 1% from the previous three months. Private sector, ordinary time wages increased the most in 13 years.
The labor market report is the latest sign that the economy may be overheating, and that the Reserve Bank could start to raise interest rates as soon as this month to keep a lid on price pressures. Annual inflation surged to 3.3% in the second quarter, breaching the central bank’s 1-3% target range.
The kiwi dollar climbed after the report. It bought 70.43 U.S. cents at 10:54 a.m. in Wellington from 70.24 cents immediately before the release.
Investors lifted bets on rate increases, with a quarter-point hike now fully priced in for the RBNZ’s next review on Aug. 18 and at least one more expected by the end of the year.
The RBNZ, which is required to support maximum employment as well as stable inflation, began reducing monetary stimulus last month by ceasing quantitative easing, saying economic conditions since late 2020 had been consistently stronger than anticipated.
Yesterday, Governor Adrian Orr said economic spending has recovered to above pre-Covid levels and the monetary policy committee “needs to think about when and how we would return interest rates to more normal levels.”
Policy Normalization
New Zealand is in the vanguard of developed-world central banks that are beginning to normalize policy and is set to become one of the first to raise rates in the wake of the pandemic. South Korea has also signaled it could lift borrowing costs this year. Still, the Federal Reserve last week indicated there is some way to go before it starts to scale back bond buying, while Australia yesterday said it doesn’t expect to raise rates before 2024.
New Zealand business confidence rebounded in late 2020 after a V-shaped economic recovery boosted by the nation’s success in eliminating community transmission of the virus. The jobless rate never hit the highs feared when the pandemic first hit.
New Zealand employment rose for a third straight quarter after slumping in mid-2020, and also gained 1.7% from a year earlier. Economists had forecast 1.2% annual growth. The participation rate increased to 70.5% from 70.4% in the three months through March. Economists projected 70.5%.
Statistics New Zealand said the underutilization rate, which is a broader gauge that includes employed persons seeking additional hours, fell to 10.5% from 12.1% in the first quarter.
Ordinary time wages for non-government workers rose 0.9% in the quarter, the most since 2008, the statistics agency said. From a year earlier, wage growth picked up to 2.2% from 1.6% in the 12 months through March.

1612,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 03, 2021 12:06PM ET</span>","Solid U.S. factory orders, business spending on equipment point to enduring manufacturing strength","By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - New orders for U.S.-made goods increased more than expected in June, while business spending on equipment was solid, pointing to sustained strength in manufacturing even as spending is shifting away from goods to services.
The Commerce Department said on Tuesday that factory orders rose 1.5% in June after advancing 2.3% in May. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast factory orders increasing 1.0%. 
Orders soared 18.4% on a year-on-year basis. Demand pivoted towards goods during the COVID-19 pandemic as millions of Americans were cooped up at home, boosting manufacturing, which accounts for 11.9% of the U.S. economy. But the surge in demand is straining the supply chain.
""We expect a solid growth path for the factory data through 2021, capped by capacity constraints and supply chain problems,"" said Mike Englund, chief economist at Action Economics in Boulder, Colorado. 
The Institute for Supply Management reported on Monday that manufacturing activity grew at a slower pace in July for the second straight month as raw material shortages persisted. The survey, however, suggested that supply chain bottlenecks were starting to ease.
Spending is rotating back to services as nearly half of the population has been fully vaccinated against COVID-19, allowing people to travel, frequent restaurants, visit casinos and attend sporting events among services-related activities that were curbed early in the pandemic. 
(GRAPHIC: Factory orders - https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-STOCKS/zjpqkqmeepx/factoryorders.png) 
BROAD GAINS
The increase in factory goods orders in June was broad, with notable gains in machinery, computers and electronic products, as well as electrical equipment, appliances and components.
Orders for transportation equipment increased 2.0%, boosted by a surge in bookings at Boeing (NYSE:BA). But motor vehicle orders fell 0.3%. Auto production is being hampered by a global shortage of semiconductors. 
Though momentum is slowing, manufacturing will likely continue to expand. Unfilled orders at factories increased 1.0% in June. Shipments advanced 1.6%. The unfilled orders-to-shipments ratio fell to 6.94 from 6.96 in May. Inventories climbed 1.0% after increasing 1.1% in May. The inventories-to-shipments ratio slipped to 1.48 from 1.49 in May. 
The increase in factory inventories in June was bigger than what the government assumed in its advance estimate for second-quarter gross domestic product published last week. 
The Commerce Department's Bureau of Economic Analysis estimated that GDP grew at a 6.5% annualized rate last quarter, picking up from the first quarter's 6.3% pace. That hoisted the level of GDP well above its peak in the fourth quarter of 2019.
Economists anticipated that GDP growth could be raised to as high as a 6.7% rate when the government publishes its revision later this month.
""It now looks like the BEA data will need to be revised up,"" said Daniel Silver, an economist at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) in New York. ""We continue to expect inventories to boost GDP growth significantly in third quarter following the big pullback reported through the second quarter. We also think equipment spending will continue to increase at a solid rate in the third quarter.""
The Commerce Department also reported that orders for non-defense capital goods, excluding aircraft, which are seen as a measure of business spending plans on equipment, rose a solid 0.7% in June instead of 0.5% as reported last month. 

(GRAPHIC: Core capital goods - https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-STOCKS/klpykelzkpg/corecap.png) 
Shipments of core capital goods, which are used to calculate business equipment spending in the gross domestic product report, advanced 0.6% as estimated last month. Business spending on equipment was robust in the second quarter, notching the fourth straight quarter of double-digit growth.

(Reuters) -U.S. consumers' demand for new debt grew in the second quarter and credit card use rebounded, reversing the trend of declining card use seen earlier in the coronavirus pandemic, according to a report released on Tuesday by the New York Federal Reserve. 
Total household debt increased by $313 billion in the second quarter to $14.96 trillion, the New York Fed said in its quarterly report on household debt and credit. Mortgage debt continued to be the biggest driver of that growth, rising by $282 billion to $10.44 trillion by the end of June. 
""We have seen a very robust pace of originations over the last four quarters with new extensions of credit for mortgages and auto loans combined with rebounding demand for credit card borrowing,"" Joelle Scally, administrator of the Center for Microeconomic Data at the New York Fed, said in a statement. 
Credit card balances ticked up in the second quarter as consumers boosted spending, increasing by $17 billion after mostly declining since the start of 2020. Despite the increase, credit card balances were still $140 billion below where they were at the end of 2019. 
In another sign that consumers' demand for credit is growing, the number of credit inquiries made within the past six months increased by 3.7% to $121 million, reversing the decline that started in the second quarter of 2020.
New extensions of credit for mortgages and auto loans reached record highs in the second quarter, the study found. Auto loan originations, which include both loans and leases, reached $202 billion.
A total of $1.22 trillion in new mortgage debt was originated in the second quarter, including mortgage refinances. Some 71% of those loans went to borrowers with high credit scores, the report found. 

A total of $4.58 trillion in mortgage loans were originated over the past four quarters - the equivalent of 44% of total mortgage debt outstanding. Roughly 40% of originations were for home purchases and 60% were for refinances, New York Fed researchers said. 
Still, some homeowners continued to struggle with their loans. Just under 2 million mortgages remained in forbearance programs at the end of June, down from 9.3 million earlier in the pandemic, New York Fed researchers said in a blog post https://libertystreeteconomics.newyorkfed.org/2021/08/forbearance-participation-declines-as-programs-end-nears published on Tuesday.

The IHS Markit Canada Manufacturing Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) fell to a seasonally adjusted 56.2 in July from 56.5 in June. It was the lowest reading since February but still well above the 50 threshold which shows growth in the sector.
""Another robust improvement in operating conditions was seen across Canada's manufacturing sector in July,"" Shreeya Patel, an economist at IHS Markit, said in a statement. ""A further easing of virus-related restrictions and greater consumer confidence encouraged domestic demand.""
The measure of output rose to 54.4 from 53.8 in June, while the new orders index was at 55.3, edging up from 55.1.
Delivery delays and material scarcity made it difficult for firms to keep up with demand. The backlogs of work index climbed to the second highest in the series history at 56.0 from 53.6 in June and cost pressures continued to rise.
Still, strong demand allowed some costs to be passed on, with the measure of output prices rising to 65.2 from 64.9 in June, and firms remained upbeat about prospects for growth.

""With the vaccine rollout gaining momentum, and case numbers declining, a busy second half of the year is sure to follow,"" Patel said.
More than 81% of Canadians eligible for COVID-19 vaccines have had one shot, and more than 66% are fully inoculated.

1615,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 03, 2021 07:02AM ET</span>",UK public's inflation expectations jump in July - Citi/YouGov,"By David Milliken
LONDON (Reuters) -The British public's expectations for inflation over the coming year jumped in July in response to recent rising prices,although longer-term expectations remained stable, a monthly survey showed on Tuesday.
The Citi/YouGov survey showed public inflation expectations for the next 12 months rose to 3.1% in July from 2.8% in June, taking this measure further above its long-run average though below December's peak of 3.8%.
British consumer price inflation hit a three-year high of 2.5% in June and the Bank of England looks set to raise its near-term inflation forecasts on Thursday, though it is likely to stress that the increase will be temporary.
Longer-term inflation expectations for the next five to 10 years held steady at 3.4%.
Citi said the rise in short-run price expectations probably reflected fears of higher household energy bills later this year as well as the recent faster-than-expected rise in CPI due to higher oil prices and post-COVID supply-chain bottlenecks.
The BoE could draw some comfort from the fact that this had not yet fed into longer-run inflation expectations, but would need to be watchful that higher headline inflation later in 2021 did not push long-term price expectations higher.
""A marked increase here could yet force the Bank to tighten policy even if the recovery is incomplete,"" Citi said.

The BoE looks at public inflation expectations as a guide to how businesses will set prices and the extent to which workers will push for bigger pay rises.
The survey also showed that an above-average percentage of people surveyed said they did not know how inflation would change in future, creating a greater chance of a shift in long-term expectations, Citi added.

1616,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 03, 2021 06:11AM ET</span>",U.S. hiring may have slowed in July amid COVID surge -data,"By Howard Schneider
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - High-frequency data indicate U.S. hiring slowed in July - not held steady as widely expected - with particular softness among states that ended federal unemployment benefits and areas where the COVID-19 Delta variant is raging.
Payroll firm UKG said growth in employees across a wide set of industries grew 1.1% from mid-June to mid-July, coinciding with the period when the federal government employment survey is conducted. That was about half the 2% rate of growth seen between May and June, ahead of a blockbuster June national jobs report showing 850,000 additional positions added to payrolls.
Data on small business hiring from time management company Homebase also fell from mid-June to mid-July.
Notably, a UKG analysis of data spanning the period when 26 states began halting federal unemployment benefits showed that growth in work shifts in those states was half of what it was elsewhere - 2.2% from May through July versus 4.1%.
That adds to an accumulating body of evidence that the gamble a largely Republican group of governors made in halting the $300 weekly stipends didn't parlay into more jobs. 
""People are returning to work on their own. We just haven't seen the surge of people returning that businesses were hoping for,"" said UKG vice president Dave Gilbertson. He anticipates a smaller number of jobs added in July than in June. 
National jobs and unemployment data will be updated Friday in a Labor Department report closely watched for evidence about the path of a U.S. economy that has already returned to pre-pandemic levels in terms of output but remains roughly 7 million jobs shy of where it was in early 2020.
In contrast with Gilbertston's view, the median estimate of economists polled by Reuters is that hiring continued apace in July, with companies forecast to have added 880,000 payroll jobs.
DELTA HEADWINDS
Gilbertson said he still anticipated strong hiring in the fall as schools presumably reopen and daily life continues to notch back toward normal.
That may well depend, however, on how the economy responds to the resurgence of coronavirus infections led by the highly contagious Delta variant. Evidence may be emerging that the renewed outbreak is taking a toll, particularly in some of those Republican-led states where hiring has proved stodgy despite the early cutoff of the unemployment benefits.
A state-level recovery index from Oxford Economics, for example, points to a drop in economic activity and employment among high-infection states like Florida, Missouri and Arkansas. 
Graphic: High-infection states may be sliding, https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-ECONOMY/JOBS/zgvomwyrmvd/chart.png 
""Recoveries were either flat or weaker in the high breakout states,"" said Oxford lead U.S. economist Oren Klachkin, leading the firm's national recovery index to decline for the first time since April. Worsening health data nationally may ""show the recovery slipping.""
So far that has not been evident in other data series. 
The Transportation Security Administration showed 4.2 million travelers checked onto flights last weekend, about 85% of the comparable weekend in 2019 and in line with recent weeks. OpenTable showed diners continued turning up at restaurants at levels comparable to 2019. 
During the pandemic economists have paid particular attention to ""mobility,"" the movement of people outside their homes, as a general sign of recovery. As of now, Klachkin said, it ""hasn't slowed.""
MINIMAL IMPACT FROM CUTTING BENEFITS
But neither does the U.S. economy seem to be kicking into a higher gear when it comes to hiring. 
With roughly one job available for every person estimated to be unemployed, economists have puzzled over why positions aren't filling faster, and offered a list of reasons from the ongoing fear of infection to the lack of available child care.
Recent analysis has consistently minimized one of those explanations: the impact of the extra unemployment benefits. 
Graphic: A (mostly) red state roll off A (mostly) red state roll off, https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-ECONOMY/EMPLOYMENT/oakpedgnkvr/chart.png 
Researchers at the University of Chicago and the JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) Institute, using JPMorgan data on account holders who lost jobs and received enhanced unemployment benefits, found that through April the payments diminished the reemployment rate by no more than 1 percentage point. The payments, offered with few conditions to a broadened group of individuals, were $600 per week early in the pandemic and reduced to $300 late in 2020. They were a key reason personal income rose during the pandemic despite massive unemployment.
Arindrajit Dube, a University of Massachusetts Amherst economics professor, used data from the Census Household Pulse Survey to conclude that the suspension of the benefits in a group of states did nothing to boost hiring but instead ""increased self-reported hardship in paying for regular expenses."" 

UKG's Gilbertson said he attributed the slower rate of shift growth in the one group of states to the fact that they generally were among those that imposed fewer restrictions early in the pandemic and ""didn't have as far to cover."" It was also possible that the surge in cases is leading to ""some early signs of a slowdown.""
Either way, he said the data seemed clear on one point: ""The extra benefits were likely not the thing holding (individuals) back from accepting a new job.""

1617,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 02, 2021 08:21PM ET</span>",South Korea July inflation accelerates; staying at nine-year peak,"By Joori Roh
SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea's consumer inflation accelerated in July, staying at a nine-year peak marked in May, as hot weather conditions lifted prices of fresh food, while oil products and housing rental and other services costs continued rising.
The consumer price index (CPI) last month rose 2.6% year-on-year, Statistics Korea data showed on Tuesday, accelerating from a 2.4% increase in June and beating a 2.4% increase tipped in a Reuters survey.
That was also same as a 2.6% rise in May when it marked the fastest pace since April 2012, and continued to stay above the central bank's 2% target for a fourth straight month.
Breakdown of data showed continued rise in prices of agricultural and oil products further boosted inflation, while housing rental costs and dining and other services costs also added to the boost.
The cost of agricultural, livestock and fisheries and petroleum products jumped 9.6% and 2.8%, respectively, while that of housing rentals and dining rose 1.4% and 2.5% each.
Inflation will likely slow going forward, economists say, due to an impact from toughened COVID-19 distancing measures and the fading base effect of oil and commodity prices.
""Korea's social-distancing measures due to the new wave of the virus pose downside risks to CPI ... which will likely affect services sector CPI,"" said Park Chong-hoon, economist at Standard Chartered (OTC:SCBFF) Bank Korea, adding that he sees inflation easing below 2% in September.
The country struggles to contain the highly contagious Delta variant, even as it stepped up social distancing measures to the toughest level for the Seoul metropolitan and neighbouring areas.
Core CPI, which excluded volatile energy and food prices, came at 1.2% year-on year, unchanged from June.

Month-on-month inflation rose 0.2%, rebounding from June's minus 0.1%, when it fell into negative territory for the first time in seven months. Economists had forecast no change.
The BOK currently sees inflation standing at 1.8% for the whole of 2021. Its next revision of forecasts will be released at its Aug. 26 policy rate decision meeting.

1618,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 02, 2021 01:55PM ET</span>",U.S. manufacturing growth cooling; bottlenecks starting to abate,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. manufacturing activity grew at a slower pace in July for the second straight month as raw material shortages persisted, though there are signs of some easing in supply-chain bottlenecks.
The survey from the Institute for Supply Management (ISM) on Monday showed a measure of prices paid by manufactures fell by the most in 16 months, while the supplier deliveries index retreated further from a 47-year high touched in May. 
Timothy Fiore, chair of ISM's manufacturing business survey committee, noted that ""supply and demand dynamics appear to be moving closer to equilibrium for the first time in many months."" Part of that could be because spending is rotating back to services from goods.
""Manufacturing is slowing from unsustainable boom to sustainable strength,"" said Chris Low, chief economist at FHN Financial in New York. 
""Moderation in supplier deliveries and prices paid indicate bottlenecks are alleviating, but both remain high enough to indicate supply-side problems persist. Still, from a markets and policy perspective, progress is important.""
The ISM's index of national factory activity fell to 59.5 last month, the lowest reading since January, from 60.6 in June. A reading above 50 indicates expansion in manufacturing, which accounts for 11.9% of the U.S. economy. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the index would be little changed at 60.9.
Seventeen out of 18 manufacturing industries reported growth in July, including machinery as well as computer and electronic products. Only textile mills reported a decline.
The ISM survey's measure of prices paid by manufacturers fell to a reading of 85.7 last month from a record 92.1 in June, reflecting an easing in commodity prices. The drop - the largest pullback in the index since March 2020 - supports Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's contention that inflation will moderate as supply constraints abate.
The survey's measure of supplier deliveries fell to 72.5 from a reading of 75.1 in June. The index vaulted to 78.8 in May, which was the highest reading since April 1974. A reading above 50 indicates slower deliveries. 
ISM PMI https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-STOCKS/klpykejdmpg/ism.png 
Demand shifted to goods from services during the COVID-19 pandemic as millions of Americans were cooped up at home, straining the supply chain. Roughly half of the population has been fully vaccinated against the coronavirus, allowing people to travel, frequent restaurants, visit casinos and attend sporting events among services-related activities that were curbed early in the pandemic. 
Government data last week showed spending on services accelerated sharply in the second quarter, helping to lift the level of gross domestic product above its peak in the fourth quarter of 2019.
U.S. stocks were trading higher, with the S&P 500 index near a record high as the U.S. Congress pushed ahead with a $1 trillion infrastructure bill. 
The dollar fell against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices rose.
LEAN INVENTORIES
Still, anecdotes in the ISM survey suggested the supply chain was still a long way from normalizing. Machinery manufacturers said they are ""having to place orders months ahead of time just to get a place in line."" 
In the computer and electronics industry, manufacturers reported that ""purchases continue to have long lead times due to shortages of raw materials.""
The scarcity of inputs has been well documented in the automobile industry, where a global semiconductor shortage has forced some car makers to idle assembly plants to manage their chips supply.
The ISM survey's forward-looking new orders sub-index fell for a second straight month. But with inventories at factories very lean and business warehouses almost empty, the moderation in new orders growth is likely to reverse or remain minimal. 
Businesses depleted inventories at a rapid clip in the second quarter. Stocks at retailers are well below normal levels. Economists at Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) expect retail and auto inventories will return to normal levels in mid-2022.
Factories also hired more workers in July. A measure of factory employment rebounded after contracting modestly in June for the first time since November, though manufacturers continued to complain about the scarcity of workers. 
Still, the rebound bodes well for July's employment report, due to be released on Friday. According to a Reuters survey of economists, nonfarm payrolls likely increased by 880,000 jobs last month after rising by 850,000 in June.
The economy is facing a shortage of workers, with a record 9.2 million job openings. About 9.5 million people are officially unemployed. 
Lack of affordable child care and fears of contracting the coronavirus have been blamed for keeping workers, mostly women, at home. There have also been pandemic-related retirements and career changes. Republicans and business groups have blamed enhanced unemployment benefits, including a $300 weekly payment from the federal government, for the labor crunch.

While more than 20 states led by Republican governors have ended these federal benefits before they were scheduled to run out in early September, there has been little evidence that the terminations boosted hiring. 
The labor shortage is expected to ease in the fall when schools reopen for in-person learning, but a resurgence in new COVID-19 cases, driven by the Delta variant of the coronavirus, could make some people reluctant to return to the labor force.

Construction spending, which accounts for less than 4% of U.S. gross domestic product, increased by 8.2% on a year-on-year basis in June after falling 0.2% in May, data showed. 
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast construction spending rising by 0.4% in June.
Spending on private construction projects climbed 0.4%, with outlays on residential projects increasing 1.1%. Single-family homebuilding spending surged 1.8%, after outlays on residential projects rose 0.3% in May. 
The government reported last week that residential spending contracted in the second quarter, weighed down by lower broker commissions and other ownership transfer costs because of a decline in home sales. 
Although demand for housing remains robust, a rise in the cost of building materials, especially framing lumber, are constraining builders' ability to ramp up construction and close an inventory gap, driving up home prices and crimping sales.

Investment in private non-residential construction like gas and oil well drilling fell 0.7% in June. Business spending on non-residential structures fell in the second quarter led by declines in commercial and healthcare structures. Private construction outlays was unchanged in May.
Spending on public construction projects dropped 1.2% in June, after declining 0.8% in May.

The IHS Markit Mexico Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index rose to 49.6 in July from 48.8 in June, the highest reading since February 2020 and marginally below the 50 threshold that separates growth from contraction.
The index has been clawing its way higher gradually after plummeting to 35.0 in April 2020 amid the fallout from the coronavirus pandemic, in what was by far the lowest reading in the survey's 10-year history.
""It is encouraging to see the headline PMI stir closer to the critical 50.0 threshold and some reports of rising sales among Mexican manufacturers,"" said Pollyanna De Lima, economics associate director at IHS Markit.
Some firms indicated that production fell due to raw material shortages, the pandemic and low sales, but the drop was curbed by rising output at companies that noted increases in new projects.
""The sector was again impacted by bottlenecks at global logistic firms, with raw material shortages and delivery delays leading to rising backlogs of work, declines in stocks and a substantial increase in overall input costs,"" De Lima said.
According to the survey, businesses turned more optimistic regarding the 12-month outlook for production, with the overall degree of confidence at the strongest level in 1-1/2 years and firms anticipated a pick-up in sales and improved raw material availability.

Job losses were also the slowest in 1-1/2 years.

The Federal Statistics Office said on Monday retail sales rose 4.2% on the month in real terms after an upwardly revised increase of 4.6% in May. The June reading was more than double a Reuters forecast for a rise of 2.0%.
Department stores and specialist suppliers benefited from lifted restrictions, with sales soaring 34% on the month, while a drop in online sales provided early evidence that consumer habits are rotating back to services and away from online shopping.
On the year, retail sales - a volatile indicator often subject to revisions - jumped 6.2% in real terms following an upwardly revised drop of 1.8% in the previous month.
The German economy returned to growth in the second quarter but bounced back less strongly than expected from the impact of supply chain bottlenecks.
Almost two out of three industrial companies are having difficulties in getting enough intermediate goods in time and keeping supply chains intact, the Ifo institute said on Monday.
""This could undermine the recovery,"" Ifo economist Klaus Wohlrabe said.
Together with rising coronavirus infections driven by the more contagious Delta variant, the supply issues have dampened the outlook for the economy. Nonetheless, the central bank expects growth of 3.7% for this year and 5.2% next year.

The manufacturing sector was boosted in July by faster growth in new orders and employment, a survey showed on Monday, but supply shortages for semiconductors and other intermediate goods continued to hold back production.
Another survey showed last week that consumer sentiment held steady heading into August as shoppers grew more ready to spend, but the rise in coronavirus cases made them less upbeat about the economic outlook.

LONDON/TOKYO (Reuters) -Factories across the world are suffering from supply bottlenecks which sent prices skyrocketing in July, while a new wave of coronavirus infections in Asia demonstrated the fragile nature of the global recovery.
Business surveys on Monday highlighted the divergence in the global economy on the pace of recovery from the pandemic, which led the International Monetary Fund to downgrade this year's growth forecast for emerging Asia.
Although manufacturers largely remained open throughout lockdowns, the loosening of some restrictions designed to limit infections has driven a flurry of demand - but factories are suffering from staff shortages and supply chain problems.

""The global economic recovery is still on track. The level of activity has been really strong but there have been delays in deliveries,"" said Marchel Alexandrovich at Jefferies (NYSE:JEF). 
IHS Markit's final manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) for the euro zone dipped from June's record high but was still firmly in growth territory.
The upbeat survey follows official data on Friday which showed the bloc's economy grew faster than expected in the second quarter, pulling out of a recession caused by the COVID-19 pandemic as curbs to stop the virus were eased.
ASIA STRAIN
In China, however, demand contracted for the first time in over a year, a private survey showed. This broadly aligned with an official survey released on Saturday showing a slowdown in activity. 
""Supply bottlenecks remain a constraint. But the PMIs suggest demand is cooling too, taking the heat out of price gains and weighing on activity in industry and construction,"" said Julian Evans-Pritchard, senior China economist at Capital Economics.
Indonesia, Vietnam and Malaysia saw factory activity shrink in July due to a resurgence in infections and stricter COVID-19 restrictions, according to private surveys.
Once seen as a driver of global growth, Asia's emerging economies are lagging their advanced peers in recovering from the pandemic's pain as delays in vaccine rollouts hurt domestic demand and countries reliant on tourism.
""The risk is that growth scars linger for longer even if activity recovers in the coming months,"" said Frederic Neumann, co-head of Asian Economics Research at HSBC.
""Plus, cooling export momentum, far from a temporary blip, provides a hint of what to expect in quarters to come,"" he said, adding that such uncertainty over the outlook would prod Asian central banks to maintain loose monetary policy.
The final au Jibun Bank Japan PMI rose to 53.0 in July from 52.4 in the previous month, though manufacturers saw input prices rise at the fastest pace since 2008.
Japan also faces a surge in Delta variant cases that has forced the government to expand state of emergency curbs to wider areas through Aug. 31, casting a shadow over the Olympic Games and dashing hopes for a sharp rebound in July-September growth.

South Korea's PMI held above breakeven for the 10th straight month. But a sub-index on input prices rose at the second highest on record.
While still grappling with infections, easing restrictions helped India's factory activity to bounce back in July as demand surged both at home and abroad.

The IHS Markit/CIPS UK Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) dipped to 60.4 from June's 63.9. The July reading was unchanged from a preliminary ""flash"" figure.
The index peaked at an all-time high of 65.6 in May as the sector - which accounts for about 10% of British economic output - rode a wave of demand the coronavirus lockdowns were lifted. 
Growth in output and new work eased to four-month lows in July and some firms reported clients brought forward purchases to guard against supply-chain issues.
Seventy-two percent of manufacturers reported higher costs for a wide range of inputs such as chemicals, commodities, cardboard, electronics, foodstuffs, metals, packaging and timber, with Brexit causing problems alongside the pandemic.
In response, factories increased their prices by almost as much as June's record jump.
""Amid growing indications that many supply chain disruptions and raw material shortages are unlikely to be fully resolved until 2022, the outlook remains one of constrained growth combined with high inflation for the foreseeable future,"" Rob Dobson, a director at IHS Markit, said.
The Bank of England looks set to raise its forecasts for inflation on Thursday, at the end of its August meeting.
But most of its policymakers are expected to stick to their view that the rise in prices is largely transitory, meaning no curtailment of the BoE's pandemic emergency stimulus programme.
The PMI survey showed British manufacturing firms in July remained optimistic about the outlook with 63% forecasting output would rise over the coming year.
Exports gathered pace in July as overseas markets reopened.

Final PMIs for the services and construction sectors are due to be published on Wednesday and Thursday.
The manufacturing survey was conducted between July 12 and July 27.

IHS Markit's final Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) for manufacturing, which accounts for about a fifth of the economy, rose to 65.9 in July from 65.1 in June. The July reading was the third highest since the survey began in 1996.
The industrial sector in Europe's largest economy has been humming along during the pandemic almost undisturbed by COVID-19 restrictions and helped by generous state support measures.
High demand from abroad has led to filled order books, but supply shortages for semiconductors and other intermediate goods have been holding back production.
Trevor Balchin, Economics Director at IHS Markit, said ""the latest survey results provided further evidence that output growth is being constrained by supply shortages.""
""Suppliers' delivery times continued to lengthen substantially in July, though there were signs that supply pressures had peaked as the incidence of delays was the lowest in five months,"" he added.
Indices on input and output prices both rose faster, with input price inflation accelerating to a new survey record high.
""Consequently, the rate of output price inflation hit a new peak for the fifth month running,"" Balchin said.

The cost pressures are feeding through to consumer prices.
Germany's annual consumer price inflation accelerated by more than expected to hit a 13-year high in July, leading services sector trade union Verdi to immediately demand ""strong wage increases"".

By Swati Pandey
SYDNEY (Reuters) - Crippled by its tightest lockdown since the pandemic began, Sydney's construction industry has slowed to a crawl, throwing many builders out of work, while shopping malls have shut - but the housing market has never been hotter.
That exuberance has stunned many as prices crack new records, with national home loan growth at its strongest in 2-1/2 years, compared to the gloom over Australia's economic outlook cast by Sydney's strict stay-home orders since June-end.
""The confidence in the market is very strong,"" said Alex Pattaro, chief auctioneer for real estate agency Ray White Australia, who conducted seven auctions on Saturday and has more lined up.
""I have five auctions this coming weekend and we're excited about them.""
Among his sales last weekend was a A$3.6 million ($2.6 million) house in the city's northwest suburb of Ryde that sold at about 30% above the price guide.
Even though the coronavirus stay-home orders have forced all auctions online, 580 homes went under the hammer across Australia's largest city on Saturday, with clearance rates of about 75%.
Market players say the pandemic curbs are feeding the frenzy.
""The question is…is this possibly the best market a seller could ever take advantage of?"" David Murphy, principal of his eponymous property firm, asked clients in a newsletter. ""Frustrated, and greying, locked-down buyers fuelled by rosé (wine) and desperation.""
In the beach suburb of Fairlight, where median home prices have jumped 21.7% to A$2.8 million, a three-bedroom home sold for A$4 million over the weekend, as more than 20 bidders in the inner west drove up the price of a four-bedroom home to A$2.5 million.
Buyer demand has remained strong while the number of properties on sale fell 40% in the first three weeks of July versus the corresponding June period, says Nerida Conisbee, chief economist at the Ray White agency. 
That has kept auction clearance rates high, at above 70%, in recent weeks.
The pick-up in auctions and credit growth comes as median home prices in Sydney swelled 8.2% in the June quarter to an all-time high of A$1.4 million, or a rise of more than A$1,200 a day.
The gains extended into July, when Australian home prices jumped 1.6%, CoreLogic's national home value index showed on Monday, with Sydney prices racing at 2% over the previous month to stand a startling 18.2% up from a year ago. 
A prolonged lockdown, could prove a damper, however, amid forecasts of a third-quarter contraction in Australia's $1.5 trillion economy. Already, the hit is evident in mobility and credit and debit card spending data from banks.
""With dwelling values rising more in a month than incomes are rising in a year, housing is moving out of reach for many members of the community,"" said CoreLogic's research director, Tim Lawless. 

""It’s possible market activity could reduce through the second half of the year, helping to rebalance the market and take some heat out of the rate of house price growth.""

The Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index, compiled by IHS Markit, jumped to 55.3 last month from 48.1 in June, well above 50-level separating growth from contraction.
""Output rose at a robust pace, with over one-third of companies noting a monthly expansion in production, amid a rebound in new business and the easing of some local COVID-19 restrictions,"" said Pollyanna De Lima, economics associate director at IHS Markit.
India grappled with a devastating second wave of coronavirus infections in April and May but falling case numbers have allowed many restrictions to be eased.
The country is still reporting more than 40,000 cases per day, taking the total number of infections to around 31.6 million, but the economic re-opening induced higher demand and sales, leading to a sharp expansion in output.
New export orders grew at the fastest rate since April.
Employment rose for the first time since March 2020, breaking a 15-month chain of job shedding. However, the pace of hiring was mild, indicating a job crisis is still evident.
Growth in Asia's third-largest economy could lose momentum, with new coronavirus variants posing the biggest risk to already weakened forecasts, while inflation was expected to rise, a recent Reuters poll showed.
A lack of raw material availability and higher freight fees drove input costs higher, though the pace was at a seven-month low.
Despite higher input costs, output charges rose only slightly, suggesting companies absorbed the extra cost burden to boost sales and stay competitive.

""With firms' cost burdens continuing to rise, however, and signs of spare capacity still evident, it's too early to say that such a trend will be sustained in coming months,"" added De Lima.
The Reserve Bank of India is not expected to raise interest rates until next fiscal year on predictions inflation remains within its target band of 2%-6% this year.

Investing.com – China’s factory activity growth dropped sharply in July, as high product prices led to demand contracting for the first in over a year. Data from the business survey, released on Monday, indicated that challenges remain for the world’s second-largest economy as it continues its recovery from COVID-19.
The Caixin manufacturing purchasing managers’ index (PMI), released earlier in the day, was 50.3, its lowest level since April 2020. The reading was also lower than the 51 in forecasts prepared by Investing.com and the previous month’s 51.3 reading but remained above the 50-mark indicating economic growth.
While continuing its economic recovery from COVID-19, the biggest challenge that China has faced recently is higher raw material costs that dragged on profit growth at industrial firms in June 2021.
Policymakers have stepped up efforts to curb surging commodity prices that have squeezed manufacturers' margins. The country continues to deal with its latest COVID-19 outbreak involving the virus’ Delta variant, the worst since the initial Wuhan outbreak in December 2019.
The Caixin PMI follows the release of July’s manufacturing and non-manufacturing PMIs on Saturday that showed activity grew at the slowest pace in 17 months. The manufacturing PMI was 50.4, lower than the 50.8 predicted in forecasts prepared by Investing.com and June’s 50.9 reading. The non-manufacturing PMI was 53.3, lower than the previous month’s reading of 53.5.
""The economy is still facing huge downward pressure,"" Caixin Insight Group senior economist Wang Zhe said in comments released alongside the data. High product prices also brought down demand, especially for consumer goods and intermediate goods.
Input prices continue to rise faster than output prices, although the pace slowed down from the previous month, putting pressure on margins. The private sector enterprises surveyed by Caixin said raw material prices, especially for industrial metals, remained high.
""Market demand was sensitive to product prices, which limited enterprises' pricing power,"" said Wang.
Slower growth was also visible in export orders, which also grew at a slower pace than the month before as global outbreaks of COVID-19 dampened demand. Factories also hired more workers for a fourth consecutive month, but slowed the pace."

The Caixin/Markit Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) fell to 50.3 last month from 51.3 the month before, the lowest level since April 2020.
Analysts polled by Reuters had expected the index to ease to 51.1. The 50-mark separates growth from contraction on a monthly basis.
The Chinese economy has largely recovered from disruptions caused by the coronavirus pandemic, but it has faced new challenges in recent months such as higher raw material costs, which dragged on profit growth at industrial firms in June.
Policymakers have stepped up efforts to curb surging commodity prices that have squeezed manufacturers' margins.
The weaker results in the private survey, mostly covering export-oriented and small manufacturers, broadly aligned with those in an official survey released on Saturday that showed activity growing at the slowest pace in 17 months.
""The economy is still facing huge downward pressure,"" said Wang Zhe, senior economist at Caixin Insight Group, in comments released alongside the data. High product prices brought down demand, especially for consumer goods and intermediate goods, said Wang.
A sub-index for new orders slipped sharply into contraction for the first time since May 2020, while another sub-index for production fell to the slowest pace of expansion since March last year.
Input prices continued to rise, albeit at a slower pace than the previous month but much faster than output prices, putting pressure on margins. Surveyed enterprises said raw material prices, especially for industrial metals, remained high.
""Market demand was sensitive to product prices, which limited enterprises' pricing power,"" said Wang.

Export orders grew slightly faster than the month before but still at a slow pace as the pandemic dampened overseas demand. Factories hired more workers for the fourth month in a row but at a slower pace.

""The Japanese manufacturing sector continued to see an improvement in operating conditions at the start of the third quarter,"" said Usamah Bhatti, economist at IHS Markit, which compiles the survey.
The PMI survey showed that overall output and new orders rose at a faster pace due to strong output in the electronics and auto sectors and solid demand for semiconductors. Firms' expectations for the year ahead remained firm.
Manufacturers, however, struggled with material shortages and logistical disruptions stemming from higher costs as input prices rose at the fastest pace since September 2008.

""Supply chain disruption continued to impact activity within the sector, with firms recording the second-greatest deterioration in lead times in over a decade,"" Bhatti said.

The IHS Markit purchasing managers' index (PMI) for July stood at 53.0, slipping from 53.9 in June but holding above the 50-mark, which indicates an expansion in activity.
""South Korean manufacturers continued to report a sustained improvement in operating conditions at the start of the second half of the year as production levels continued to expand,"" said Usamah Bhatti, economist at IHS Markit.
The sub-index for output stood at 53.5, marking the 11thconsecutive month of expansion, and up from 53.3 amonth earlier.
To meet the increased production, firms continued to raise staffing levels for another month, though the rate was the softest in five months.
Total new orders and export orders both expanded for a 10th month but the pace of growth slightly eased from June as highly contagious Delta variant and related curbs weakened global demand.
""Anecdotal evidence suggested a resurgence in COVID-19 cases across Asia and ongoing supply chain disruption had led to demand easing in domestic and external markets,"" Bhatti said.
Monday's survey showed that raw material shortages and delivery delays continued, leading to a further increase in input prices. That also put firms under pressure to pass higher costs on to their clients.
The sub-index for input prices stood at the second-highest on record, extending the rise to a 13th straight month, while the pace for output prices hit an all-time high.

Looking ahead, firms remained positive over the coming 12 months on expectations that output and demand would rise and the launches of new products would further boost the sector, but the gauge of optimism eased to a seven-month low.

Data from property consultant CoreLogic out on Monday showed national home prices climbed 1.6% in July from June, when they rose 1.9%. Prices were up 16.1% on last year, the fastest annual pace since 2004, with houses surging 18.4% amid a pandemic-driven shift to working from home.
A lockdown did nothing to stop Sydney gaining another 2.0% in the month, to be up 18.2% on a year ago. Melbourne added 1.3%, Brisbane 2.0% and Adelaide 1.7%. Prices across the major cities grew 1.6% in July, while the regions rose 1.7%.
""Dwelling sales are tracking approximately 40% above the five-year average while active listings remain about 26% below the five-year average,"" said CoreLogic's research director, Tim Lawless.
""The mismatch between demand and advertised supply remains a key factor placing upwards pressure on housing prices.""
The red-hot market has provided a huge windfall to consumer wealth and confidence. The Australian Bureau of Statistics estimates the value of homes rose a record A$450 billion in the March quarter alone to reach A$8.3 trillion ($6.09 trillion).
However, with the average home in Sydney now above A$1 million prices were looking stretched.
""With dwelling values rising more in a month than incomes are rising in a year, housing is moving out of reach for many members of the community,"" said Lawless.
Buyers have still been encouraged by the outlook for super-low borrowing costs, with the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) saying rates were likely to remain at just 0.1% until 2024.

Analysts had expected it to slip to 50.8. It was the lowest figure since the index slumped to 35.7 in February 2020, after China began lockdowns to control the coronavirus pandemic.
An NBS official said in a statement the PMI's sub-index for production slipped to 51.0 from 51.9 in June, pointing to equipment maintenance and extreme weather. The new order sub-index fell to 50.9, from 51.5, reflecting a slowdown in demand.
""The most alarming signal is the new export order index, which is at lowest level since July last year,"" said Zhiwei Zhang, chief economist of Pinpoint Asset Management.
The sub-index for new export orders has dropped for three straight months starting in May. It stood at 47.7 in July.
A sub-index for raw material costs stood at 62.9 in July, compared with June's 61.2, pointing to an increase in costs. High raw material prices have eaten into the profitability of industrial firms and deterred some Chinese exporters from taking on orders.
Authorities are eager to prevent high factory-gate prices being passed on to consumers, which would only add to current economic headaches as underlying demand remains weak.
Hit by extreme weather, the construction index dropped to 57.5, from June's 60.1, and analysts expect the sector to face headwinds amid Beijing's clampdown on the property market.
To bolster a slowing economy, the People's Bank of China (PBOC) in mid-July surprised the market by lowering the reserve requirement ratio (RRR) for banks, releasing around 1 trillion yuan ($154 billion) in long-term liquidity.
China's economy has largely recovered from disruptions caused by the pandemic, with the consumption and service sectors gradually catching up to the improvements in exports and manufacturing.
However, manufacturers are grappling with new challenges including higher raw material prices, surging logistics costs and global supply chain bottlenecks, and the pace of gross domestic product growth is expected to moderate.
The country is also racing to contain a fresh COVID-19 outbreak of the more infectious Delta variant in the eastern city of Nanjing. China's zero-tolerance approach could present significant downside risks to the current economic recovery, analysts say.

New home prices in 100 cities rose 0.35% in July from a month earlier, versus 0.36% growth in June, according to data from China Index Academy, one of the country's largest independent real estate research firms.
This year Chinese authorities have implemented measures to rein in the red-hot real estate market, including caps on developers' borrowing and strict bans on illegal flows of funds into the sector.
""New home growth softened in July against the backdrop of stringent measures and tighter credit"", said the group's director, Cao Jingjing.
Growth in home sales is expected to remain mild as the curbs are unlikely to be eased, the survey said.
In July, China's housing ministry urged five cities including the eastern city of Jinhua and the southeastern city of Quanzhou to stabilise their property markets, while the central bank ordered lenders in Shanghai to raise interest rates on mortgage loans.
Prices in China's smaller tier-three and tier-four cities rose 0.21% on-month, versus 0.29% in June. Tier-two cities, which include some provincial capitals, gained 0.29%, slowing from June's 0.31% rise.
Price growth in China's biggest cities such as Shanghai and Beijing, however, continued to accelerate, up 0.54% versus June's 0.48% growth, suggesting persistent demand for properties in the country's economically most vibrant cities.
But new home prices in the southern tech hub of Shenzhen declined 0.26%, the first drop since February. Local media had warned in May that Shenzhen could be a testing ground for China's plans to impose a nationwide property tax, due to elevated home prices.
On an annual basis, China's new home prices grew 3.81% in July, slowing from June's 3.89% gain.
Resale homes also showed slower month-on-month price growth in July, while existing home prices in Shenzhen were down 0.43% on-month.
Local governments in some hot property markets may implement pricing references for resale homes to stabilise prices, the survey said.

Land sales by floor space in 300 cities fell 25% in July from a month earlier, and declined 38% on an annual basis, separate survey data showed.

SEOUL (Reuters) -South Korean exports jumped to a record high in July as overseas demand for chips and biohealth products extended export growth to a ninth consecutive month, supporting an economic recovery facing headwind from the country's worst COVID-19 outbreak yet. 
Exports rose 29.6% in July from the same month a year earlier to $55.43 billion, the largest amount since South Korea began compiling relevant data in 1956, the trade ministry said on Sunday. 
The pace of growth, however, slowed from 39.8% in June on a fading base effect from a pandemic-induced slump last year. The figure was also short of the 30.2% median of 16 analyst estimates in a Reuters survey.
Imports soared 38.2% from a year earlier and compared to a 40.7% rise in June. 
With consumer sentiment weakening at home due to tightened social distancing measures since mid-July, the Bank of Korea is counting on global demand to lead economic growth which it forecasts at 4% for this year.
While growth in exports was widely expected to slow, July exports of chips and biohealth products were brisk, gaining 39.6% and 27.2%, respectively.
Exports of petrochemical products also surged 59.5%, while those of cars and computers increased 12.3% and 26.4% respectively.
""Demand for main exports items across chips, cars and petrochemical products remains strong, as economic recovery is being led by advanced nations,"" said analyst Chun Kyu-yeon at Hana Financial Investment.
""Having said that, the pace of growth will weaken on fading base effects, and some hiccups in supply chains are raising logistical costs also.""

By destination, exports to China - South Korea's biggest trading partner - gained 15.7% on year. Overseas sales to the United States and the European Union also increased 32.1% and 43.9%, respectively.
South Korea is currently battling its worst COVID-19 outbreak with record numbers of cases per day in the past week. Tighter curbs on movement and activity have been enacted to prevent spread of the coronavirus during South Korea's peak summer holiday season.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. consumer spending surged in June as vaccinations against COVID-19 boosted demand for travel-related services, but part of the increase reflected higher prices, with annual inflation accelerating further above the Federal Reserve's 2% target.
Though personal income barely rose last month, other data on Friday showed wage growth in the second quarter was the fastest in 13 years on an annual basis. That, together with rising household wealth and ample savings should keep consumer spending strong, though rising COVID-19 infections pose a risk. 
""The overall trend of healthy-to-strong growth will continue into next year,"" said Scott Hoyt, a senior economist at Moody's (NYSE:MCO) Analytics in West Chester, Pennsylvania. ""Downside risks remain large. The return of shutdowns from increased infections is unlikely, but cannot be ruled out.

Consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, rebounded 1.0% last month after dipping 0.1% in May, the Commerce Department said. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast consumer spending rising 0.7%.

Nearly half of the population has been vaccinated against COVID-19, allowing Americans to travel, frequent restaurants, visit casinos and attend sporting events among services-related activities that were curbed early in the pandemic. 
Spending on services advanced 1.2% last month. The broad increase was led by spending at restaurants and hotels. 
While spending on goods remains strong, the pace has slowed amid shortages of motor vehicles and some household appliances, whose production has been hampered by tight supplies of semiconductors across the globe. Demand is also shifting to services from goods. Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) on Thursday said sales growth would slow in the next few quarters as customers venture more outside the home.
Spending on goods rose 0.5%. Spending on long-lasting goods decreased 1.5%, reflecting a decline in motor vehicle purchases. Outlays on nondurable goods rose 1.8%.
The data was included in the second-quarter gross domestic product report published on Thursday. Consumer spending grew at a robust 11.8% annualized rate last quarter, accounting for much of the economy's 6.5% growth pace, which lifted the level of GDP above its peak in the fourth quarter of 2019.
With demand outpacing supply, inflation is rising. 
The personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index, excluding the volatile food and energy components, rose 0.4% in June after advancing 0.5% in May. The so-called core PCE price index was lifted by increases in prices of airline tickets, used cars as well as hotel and motel accommodation.
In the 12 months through June, the core PCE price index shot up 3.5%, the largest gain since December 1991, after rising 3.4% in May. The core PCE price index is the Federal Reserve's preferred inflation measure for its flexible 2% target.
""Price pressures are centered on areas that are having struggles during reopening. Some of those areas are simply reflating to pre-pandemic prices; others should see prices come down as they adjust capacity and work out supply chain issues,"" said Will Compernolle, senior economist at FHN Financial in New York. ""Even with modest monthly increases in PCE prices for the next year, year-over-year readings will be high for a while.""
Consumers are taking note of higher inflation, which is eroding sentiment.

WAGES RISING
The U.S. central bank on Wednesday kept its overnight benchmark interest rate near zero and left its bond-buying program unchanged.
Excluding inflation, consumer spending rebounded 0.5% in June after dropping 0.6% in May. The bounce back in the so-called real consumer spending last month puts it on a higher growth trajectory heading into the third quarter.
Personal income gained 0.1% in June after dropping 2.2% in May as transfers from the government declined. The saving rate fell to a still-high 9.4% from 10.3% in May, which should underpin spending as the flow of government money dries up.
Households accumulated at least $2.5 trillion in excess savings during the pandemic. Record-high stock market prices and accelerating home prices are boosting household wealth. Wages are also rising as companies compete for scarce workers.
In a separate report on Friday, the Labor Department said its Employment Cost Index, the broadest measure of labor costs, rose 0.7% last quarter after gaining 0.9% in the January-March period. That raised the year-on-year rate of increase to 2.9%, the largest gain since the fourth quarter of 2018, from 2.6% in the first quarter.
Wages and salaries rose 0.9% after shooting up 1.0% in the first quarter. They were up 3.2% year-on-year, the largest rise since the second quarter of 2008, after increasing 2.7% in the first quarter. Wage gains were led by the leisure and hospitality sector.

The economy is facing a shortage of workers, with a record 9.2 million job openings at the end of May. About 9.5 million people are officially unemployed. Lack of affordable child care and fears of contracting the coronavirus have been blamed for keeping workers, mostly women, at home. There have also been pandemic-related retirements as well as career changes.

Republicans and business groups have blamed enhanced unemployment benefits, including a $300 weekly check from the federal government, for the labor crunch. 
""We should be prepared for labor supply constraints that keep solid upward pressure on compensation costs in the second half of 2021,"" said Oren Klachkin, lead U.S. economist at Oxford Economics in New York. ""Better health conditions and reopenings will only gradually equalize the imbalance between strong labor demand and the limited supply of workers.""

(Reuters) -U.S. consumer sentiment fell to a five-month low in July amid lingering concerns about inflation, a survey released on Friday showed.
The University of Michigan's Consumer Sentiment Index fell to a final reading of 81.2, the lowest level since February, from June's final level of 85.5. The final reading for July, however, was above the July preliminary reading of 80.8 and above the median forecast of 80.8 among economists polled by Reuters.
""While most consumers still expect inflation to be transitory, there is growing evidence that an inflation storm is likely to develop on the not-too-distant horizon,"" Richard Curtin, the survey director, said in a statement. ""The improved finances of consumers have greatly reduced consumers' resistance to price increases.""
The survey's barometer of current economic conditions fell to 84.5, the lowest since August 2020, from June's 88.6 reading. This was also in line with July's preliminary reading of 84.5. 

The survey's gauge of consumer expectations declined to 79.0 in July from June's 83.5, but up from the mid-month reading of 78.4. 
The survey's one-year inflation expectation rose to 4.7%, the highest level since August 2008, from 4.2% in June, while the survey's five-year inflation outlook was unchanged at 2.8%.

The Employment Cost Index, the broadest measure of labor costs, rose 0.7% last quarter after gaining 0.9% in the January-March period, the Labor Department said on Friday. 
That raised the year-on-year rate of increase to 2.9%, the largest gain since the fourth quarter of 2018, from 2.6% in the first quarter.
The ECI is widely viewed by policymakers and economists as one of the better measures of labor market slack and a predictor of core inflation as it adjusts for composition and job quality changes. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the ECI advancing 0.9% in the second quarter.
Wages and salaries rose 0.9% after shooting up 1.0% in the first quarter. They were up 3.2% year-on-year. Benefits gained 0.4% after rising 0.6% in the first quarter.

Republicans and business groups have blamed enhanced unemployment benefits, including a $300 weekly check from the federal government, for the labor crunch. 
While more than 20 states led by Republican governors have ended these federal benefits before they were scheduled to run out in early September, there has been little evidence that the terminations boosted hiring.

The U.S. central bank on Wednesday kept its overnight benchmark interest rate near zero and left its bond-buying program unchanged.

MEXICO CITY (Reuters) -Mexico's economy bounced back to annual growth in the second quarter, boosted by services and manufacturing for export to the United States, its top trade partner, a preliminary estimate from the national statistics agency showed on Friday.
Compared with the same quarter a year earlier, when the formal and informal economy was largely shut down by coronavirus pandemic restrictions, growth was 19.7%, the statistics agency said. 
That was the first year-on-year quarterly growth since before the pandemic, and close to the number forecast in a Reuters survey of 14 analysts. [L1N2P21IX]
Hammered by restrictions brought about by the pandemic, Latin America's second-largest economy shrank 8.5% in 2020, its worst performance since 1932.
The current recovery has been led by demand from the United States for the cars and electronics made in Mexican factories, while remittances sent by migrants north of the border have helped domestic consumers. 
However, Mexico's economy is still 3.6 percentage points below its peak in the July-September period of 2019, noted Gabriel Casillas, an economist at Mexican bank Banorte. The economy had contracted for half a year even before the coronavirus appeared in Mexico. 
Quarter-on-quarter, seasonally adjusted growth was 1.5%, marking the fourth consecutive quarter of economic expansion. It was lower than the 1.7% forecast by analysts.
Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) economist Alberto Ramos said the quarterly expansion was crimped by supply chain disruptions and shortages of parts for key industries. A global crunch for computer chips has slowed factory output in Mexico. Ramos flagged risks ahead.
""We expect real GDP growth to reach 6.0% in 2021, but the recent deterioration of the COVID backdrop, high inflation and rising rates could slow down the envisaged recovery,"" Ramos said in a client note. 

Secondary activities, which include factories, rebounded by 28.2% in the April-June period, while tertiary activities, including trade and financial services, were up 17.1%, the data showed. 
Quarter-on-quarter, secondary activities rose a modest 0.4%, reflecting the supply problems, while tertiary activities were up 2.1%.

OTTAWA (Reuters) -The Canadian economy most likely expanded by 0.7% in June as businesses reopened after shutdowns imposed to help fight the coronavirus pandemic, Statistics Canada said on Friday.
Statscan also said second-quarter annualized growth was set to be 2.5%, better than the Bank of Canada's July 14 forecast of 2.0%. Analysts predicted the third quarter would be stronger.
""With virus cases generally low across the country, the economy has some open road to recover even more ground this summer,"" Royce Mendes, senior economist with CIBC, said in a note.
Statscan said growth in retail trade and accommodation and food services was boosted by the easing of public health measures in many of Canada's 10 provinces in June. 
There were also gains in manufacturing and mining, quarrying, and oil and gas extraction.
""The strong handover from June means that GDP should accelerate in the third quarter to around 6% annualized,"" said Stephen Brown, senior Canada economist at Capital Economics.
The Canadian dollar was trading nearly unchanged at 1.2441 to the greenback, or 80.38 U.S. cents. 
The Bank of Canada, which says third-quarter annualized growth should be 7.3%, has identified possible new variants of COVID-19 as a potential threat.
""There remain challenges on the horizon, most notably in the form of variants of the virus which have slowed progress towards healing in other developed economies,"" Mendes said.

The economy shrank by 0.3% in May, matching a forecast from analysts polled by Reuters. Statscan revised April's decline to 0.5% from an initial 0.3% drop.
In May, 12 of 20 industrial sectors posted decreases, with services-producing industries down by 0.2% and goods-producing industries contracting by 0.4%.

1641,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 30, 2021 10:06AM ET</span>","Euro zone growth rebounds, inflation tops ECB target","By Philip Blenkinsop and Balazs Koranyi
BRUSSELS (Reuters) -The euro zone economy grew faster than expected in the second quarter, pulling out of a pandemic-induced recession, while the easing of coronavirus curbs also helped inflation shoot past the European Central Bank's 2% target in July.
The European Union's statistics office Eurostat said on Friday that its initial estimate showed gross domestic product (GDP) in the 19 countries that use the euro had expanded 2.0% in April-June from the previous quarter. 
Compared to the same period a year earlier, when lockdowns to slow the spread of the coronavirus brought economic activity close to a standstill, GDP jumped 13.7%. 
But unlike the U.S. and Chinese economies, which have pulled above their pre-pandemic peaks, the euro zone economy remains some 3% smaller than it was at the end of 2019.
Eurostat also said euro zone inflation accelerated to 2.2% in July from 1.9% in June - the highest rate since October 2018 and above the 2.0% mean expectation of economists.
Economic growth also surpassed a Reuters poll forecast of 1.5% for the April-June quarter and a 13.2% annual increase. 
Among the outperformers were the euro zone's third and fourth largest economies, Italy and Spain, with quarterly growth respectively of 2.7% and 2.8%. Portugal's tourism-heavy economy expanded by 4.9%.
Since the start of 2020 the euro zone has twice suffered two consecutive quarters of contraction - defining a technical recession - with coronavirus curbs hitting most recently in the period spanning the end of 2020 and the start of 2021.
Activity was dragged down in the first three months of this year largely by weakness in Germany, where a lockdown from November had curbed private consumption.
Europe's biggest economy returned to growth in the second quarter, but the expansion of 1.5% compared to Q1 showed a weaker rebound than expected.
The French economy, the euro zone's second largest, grew by 0.9%, just ahead of forecasts, with its third lockdown gradually being eased from May.
The strong growth could add to arguments for the ECB to start scaling back its crisis fighting measures.
The central bank's 1.85 trillion euro ($2.20 trillion) Pandemic Emergency Purchase Programme is due to expire in March at the earliest, and policy hawks are already arguing that it is time to start tapering purchases given the bloc's rebound. 
Policy doves are warning that the more transmissible Delta variant poses a threat to the recovery, however, so the ECB's Sept. 9 meeting is too early for a firm call on winding down the scheme early next year. 
SIMILAR Q3 GROWTH SEEN
Bert Colijn, senior economist at ING, said supply chain problems were likely to have hampered growth in Germany, with its large auto industry, while Italy and Spain saw impressive growth because they were further behind pre-pandemic levels.
Even with the Delta variant and continued supply chain issues, ING expects growth across the bloc to be 2% again in the third quarter.
""Despite all the greening efforts, the euro zone economy continues to perform like a diesel engine: it takes a while to get going but don't underestimate it once it's picked up steam,"" Colijn said.
Capital Economics saw third-quarter growth of a little over 2%, which would still leave the euro zone economy smaller than before the pandemic.
""Germany should reach that (pre-pandemic) benchmark in the second half of the year, but we don't expect the southern economies to do so until well into 2022,"" its chief Europe economist Andrew Kenningham wrote in a note.
Figures on Thursday showed the U.S. economy grew at a slower than expected 6.5% annualised rate in the second quarter, pulling GDP above its pre-pandemic peak, as massive government aid and vaccinations fuelled spending on goods and services.
The equivalent euro zone rate was 8.3%.
For inflation, energy prices were again the driving factor, rising 14.1% in July compared to a year before.
Without the volatile energy and unprocessed food components, or what the European Central Bank calls core inflation, prices rose 0.9% year-on-year, the same as in June. Economists had expected a dip to 0.7%.
ECB policymakers have already warned of a temporary spike in inflation and made clear they will not adjust policy as the one-off factors behind the rise, such as higher oil prices, are likely to fade next year.
Inflation could even reach 3% by year-end before falling back, with core inflation more subdued.
The ECB promised a longer period of easy policy when it unveiled a new strategy earlier this month, as beyond this spike, inflation is likely to languish below its target for years to come. 

Eurostat also said euro zone unemployment fell in June to 7.7% of the workforce, or 12.517 million people, from an upwardly revised 8.0% in May, or 12.940 million people. Economists had expected a jobless rate of 7.9%.

Despite some slowdown in robust export growth, the government said the city's economic recovery remains on track as global demand picks up and local coronavirus fears ease. 
The preliminary gross domestic product (GDP) estimate released on Friday compares with a revised growth rate of 8% in the first quarter and forecasts of 8.4% by DBS and 8.5% by ING. 
On a quarterly basis, the economy contracted by a seasonally adjusted 1% in April-June, its first decline since the second quarter of 2020. That compared with a revised 5.5% growth in the previous quarter.
""The global economic recovery should continue to support Hong Kong's exports of goods in the near term, though there may be some moderation from the exceptionally strong performance in the first half of 2021,"" a government spokesman said in a statement along with the GDP figures.
""Exports of services should likewise sustain growth,"" the spokesman said, adding that a stabilised pandemic situation locally and a consumption voucher scheme will help stimulate consumer demand.
For the first half of 2021, economy grew by 7.8% over a year earlier.
The government maintained its full-year growth forecast at 3.5%-5.5%. 
Analysts caution, however, that the recovery will be uneven. While consumer spending is improving as coronavirus worries ebb, international travel restrictions will continue to weigh on tourism and related retail and services sectors. 
The trade-reliant city is also benefiting from mainland China's swift recovery from the COVID-19 crisis, though China's growth rates are slowly returning to more normal levels.
Hong Kong's economy fell into its longest recession on record in early 2019, weighed down by huge anti-government protests followed by the pandemic in 2020.
Seasonally adjusted unemployment slipped to 5.5% in April-June, from 6% in March-May and 6.4% in February-April. Exports jumped 33% in June, their eighth straight month of growth. 
Retail sales rose 10.5% in May from a year earlier, the fourth consecutive monthly gain, but growth lagged pre-pandemic levels as inbound tourism is virtually non-existent.

Hong Kong reported two new imported COVID-19 cases on Friday, with no local community infections recorded in over 50 consecutive days.
The government has urged more people to get vaccinated to pave the way for a reopening and broader based economic recovery. About 35% of the population has received the recommended two doses and 47% have had their first dose.

""Growth is decent, but it could have been stronger if it wasn't for shortages of materials,"" VP Bank Group Chief Economist Thomas Gitzel said.
Supply chain worries and rising coronavirus infections have dampened the outlook for the economy. A survey showed on Monday that German business morale fell unexpectedly in July, the first decline since January.

After more than two months of steady decline, COVID-19 cases have been rising since early July, due mainly to the spread of the more infectious Delta variant.
Roughly 60% of Germany's 83 million people have had a first shot of a COVID-19 vaccine and just over half are fully vaccinated.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's household spending likely rebounded in June from last month's slump, according to a Reuters poll, as a temporary fall in coronavirus infections during the month underpinned service consumption.
But fresh state of emergency curbs declared in July will drag on consumption by hitting retailers during the Olympic Games and the country's summer holiday season, analysts say. The anti-virus measures are set to be expanded on Friday to a larger part of Japan through Aug. 31 as new COVID-19 cases surge.
""People are encouraged to watch the Olympics at home, so we can't count on the Games boosting consumption,"" said Yoshiki Shinke, chief economist at Dai-ichi Life Research Institute.
""A spike in infections may also discourage people from going out. We're pretty cautious on the outlook for consumption,"" he said.
Household spending likely rose 2.0% in June from the previous month on a seasonally-adjusted basis, according to analysts polled by Reuters. That would follow a 2.1% drop in May.
On a year-on-year basis, household spending is expected to have risen 0.1% in June after a 11.6% rise in May, the poll showed. The slowdown reflects a jump in spending in June last year caused by a lifting of the first state of emergency curbs.
The government will release the household spending data at 8:30 a.m. on Aug. 6. (2330GMT, Aug. 5).

Japan's economy shrank an annualised 3.9% in January-March and likely barely grew in the second quarter, as the pandemic took a toll on service spending.

The official manufacturing Purchasing Manager's Index (PMI) is likely to edge lower to 50.8 in July from 50.9 in June, according to the median forecast of 25 economists polled by Reuters. A reading above 50 indicates expansion from the previous month.
Reasons why economists at Nomura expected major activity indicators to show broadly weaker growth in July included heavy rainfall and floods in Henan and the Yangtze River Delta, outbreaks of the coronavirus Delta variant in Jiangsu and some other provinces, local government efforts to curb crude steel output, and Beijing's latest steps to cool the property market.
""We continue to believe a more notable growth slowdown will materialize in the second half (especially in Q4) and Beijing's existing policy easing measures, including the RRR cut, will be unable to reverse the growth downtrend,"" Nomura said in a note on Thursday.
However, analysts from  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) say that the current economic headwinds could be partly offset by the likely improvement in the mid- to downstream production as global demand stays buoyant and the impact of power shortage fades.
To bolster a slowing economy, the People's Bank of China (PBOC) in mid-July lowered the reserve requirement ratio (RRR) for banks to the surprise of market, releasing around 1 trillion yuan ($154.19 billion) in long-term liquidity.
China will base the pace and intensity of monetary policy on the domestic economy and inflation trends in the second half of the year, the PBOC has said.
Higher raw material prices, especially of metals and semiconductors, have eaten into the profitability of industrial firms and deterred some Chinese exporters from taking on orders.
Authorities are mindful to prevent the pass-through from high factory-gate prices to consumers, which would only add to the current economic headaches as the underlying demand remains weak.

The official PMI, which largely focuses on big and state-owned firms, and its sister survey on the services sector, will both be released on Saturday.
The private Caixin manufacturing PMI will be published on Monday. Analysts expect the headline reading will slip to 51.1 from June's 51.3.

TOKYO (Reuters) -Japan's factory output jumped in June and job availability rose to the highest level in nearly a year, data showed, a sign robust overseas demand was offsetting the drag to consumption from the coronavirus pandemic.
But a spike in domestic infections to new records and a lingering global chip shortage add to woes for the world's third largest-economy, dashing policymakers' hopes for a strong rebound in July-September growth, analysts say.
The government is set to expand state of emergency curbs to more parts of the country through Aug. 31, overshadowing the Olympic Games held in capital city Tokyo.
""With the resurgence in infections, initial hopes of a clear economic rebound in July-September have faded,"" said Yoshiki Shinke, chief economist at Dai-ichi Life Research Institute.
""The economy will probably stagnate in the current quarter with any recovery pushed back until October-December onward.""
Industrial output rose 6.2% in June after a sharp 6.5% drop in May, data showed on Friday, marking the highest growth since July last year and recovering to pre-pandemic levels.
The increase, which exceeded a median market forecast for a 5.0% gain, was driven mainly by a 22.6% surge in auto production as manufacturers sought to make up for the slump in May.
Manufacturers surveyed by the government expect output to fall 1.1% in July but rise 1.7% in August, a sign robust global demand for machinery and cars will underpin Japan's recovery.
Japan's job market remains tight. An index gauging job availability rose to 1.13 from 1.09 in May, exceeding market estimates for a 1.10 reading and marking the highest level since May last year. The jobless rate fell to 2.9% from 3.0% in May.
Underscoring the fragile state of consumption, however, retail sales were up just 0.1% in June from a year earlier, compared with a median market forecast for a 0.2% gain.
Some analysts are marking down their growth estimates for the current quarter, reflecting the planned expanded state of emergency curbs.
SMBC Nikko Securities said it now expects Japan's economy to grow an annualised 1.5% in July-September, well below its previous forecast of a 7.8% expansion.
Former Bank of Japan policymaker Takahide Kiuchi also expects the economy to grow around 2-3% in the current quarter instead of the initially projected double-digit expansion.
With the expected expansion, the state of emergency curbs could lead to a total loss of 2.19 trillion yen ($20 billion) for Japan's economy, offsetting an estimated 1.67 trillion yen benefit from the Olympic Games, said Kiuchi, who is currently executive economist at Nomura Research Institute.
""The economic boost from the Games will be completely wiped out from the expanded curbs,"" he said in a research note.

1649,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 29, 2021 05:18PM ET</span>",China’s Factories Will Likely Show Country’s Recovery Is Stable,"(Bloomberg) -- China’s factory conditions likely stabilized in July, implying a more steady recovery in the economy in the second half of the year as growth risks mount.
The official manufacturing purchasing managers’ index, due to be published Saturday, is forecast to slip slightly to 50.8 in July from 50.9 in June, according to a Bloomberg survey of economists, remaining above the 50 line that separates expansion from contraction.
The non-manufacturing gauge, which measures activity in the construction and services sectors, is expected to have softened to 53.3 from 53.5 in the previous month.
A shortage of computer chips and electricity in July likely weighed on factory output, although export demand continues to be a strong support for the sector. Recent Covid-19 outbreaks, like in Jiangsu province, a major manufacturing hub, are also a worry, threatening to hamper some production and weigh on consumer spending.
The data come as top Communist Party officials meet at a key Politburo meeting this week to review the economy’s performance in the first half and set policy priorities for the rest of the year. Economists expect the leadership to signal a shift toward more monetary and fiscal support as growth gradually slows.
Government Spending
Construction activities likely stayed stable or contracted slightly in July as local governments slowed the pace of special bond sales used to finance spending on infrastructure like highways and houses.
“It’s possible that provincial decision makers are having difficulty identifying projects that meet the investment criteria, as scrutiny over big projects increases,” Freya Beamish, chief Asia economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics Ltd. wrote in a note.
The PMI forecasts are largely in line with a set of early indicators tracked by Bloomberg, which showed China’s economy continuing to recover at a stable pace in July, though with some signs of weakness. Property sales slumped, small business confidence slipped and the stock market fell, the latest gauge showed.
Officials expect the recovery to remain stable in the second half of the year but have warned of some downward pressure on growth, including a likely slowdown in trade.

1650,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 29, 2021 01:26PM ET</span>","Fiscal stimulus, vaccinations lift U.S. economy above pre-pandemic level","By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. economy grew solidly in the second quarter, pulling the level of gross domestic product above its pre-pandemic peak, as massive government aid and vaccinations against COVID-19 fueled spending on goods and services.
The pace of GDP growth reported by the Commerce Department on Thursday was, however, slower than economists had expected. That was because businesses ran down inventories further to meet the robust demand. Supply constraints, which have caused shortages of goods such as motor vehicles and household appliances, are making it harder for business to replenish stocks.
""The U.S. economy is off and running,"" said Scott Hoyt, a senior economist at Moody's (NYSE:MCO) Analytics in West Chester, Pennsylvania. ""Real GDP has fully recovered what it lost in the downturn. The economy is well ahead of much of the rest of the world, save China and some parts of southeast Asia, in its recovery from the pandemic recession""
Gross domestic product increased at a 6.5% annualized rate last quarter, the government said in its advance estimate of second-quarter GDP. The economy grew at a 6.3% rate in the first quarter, revised down from the previously reported 6.4% pace.
The level of GDP is now 0.8% higher than it was at its peak in the fourth quarter of 2019, marking the shortest recession and fastest recovery in the nation's history. After the 2007-09 downturn, it took the economy 3-1/2 years to return to its pre-recession peak. 
""The economy has achieved escape velocity from which there is no going back,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at FWDBONDS in New York.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast GDP rising at an 8.5% rate last quarter. Inventories contracted at a rate of $165.9 billion, slicing 1.13 percentage points from GDP growth.
Trade, housing and government spending were also drags on GDP growth last quarter. Excluding inventories, trade and government spending, the economy grew at a 9.9% pace. This measure of domestic demand rose at an 11.8% pace in the first quarter. 
Annual revisions to GDP data showed the economy shrinking 3.4% in 2020, instead of 3.5% as previously estimated. That was still the biggest drop in GDP since 1946. The revisions to growth in other years and quarters were minor. 
The National Bureau of Economic Research, the arbiter of U.S. recessions, declared last week that the pandemic downturn, which started in February 2020, ended in April 2020.
Even with the second quarter marking the peak in growth this cycle, the economic expansion is expected to remain solid for the rest of the year. Economists expect growth of around 7% this year, which would be the strongest performance since 1984. 
The International Monetary Fund on Tuesday boosted its growth forecasts for the United States to 7.0% in 2021 and 4.9% in 2022, up 0.6 and 1.4 percentage points respectively, from the forecasts in April.
A resurgence in COVID-19 infections, driven by the Delta variant of the coronavirus, however, poses a risk to the outlook. Higher inflation, if sustained, as well as ongoing supply chain disruptions could also slow the economy. 
Inflation soared in the second quarter, with the Federal Reserve's preferred measure - the personal consumption expenditures price index, excluding the volatile food and energy components - surging at a 6.1 % rate after increasing at a 2.7% pace in the January-March quarter. 
The Fed on Wednesday kept its overnight benchmark interest rate near zero and left its bond-buying program unchanged. Fed Chair Jerome Powell told reporters that the pandemic's economic effects continued to diminish, but risks to the outlook remain.
Stocks on Wall Street rose, with the S&P 500 and the Dow indexes scaling record highs on the GDP data and a slate of strong corporate earnings reports. The dollar fell against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices were lower.

ROBUST CONSUMER SPENDING
President Joe Biden's administration provided $1.9 trillion in pandemic relief in March, including sending one-time $1,400 checks to qualified households, bringing the amount of government aid to nearly $6 trillion since the pandemic started in the United States in March 2020.
Nearly half of the population has been vaccinated against COVID-19, allowing Americans to engage in services-related activities that were curbed early in the pandemic.
Consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of the U.S. economy, grew at an 11.8% rate in the second quarter after rising at an 11.4% pace in the prior period.
Americans frequented restaurants, stayed at hotels and visited casinos. They also bought motor vehicles and clothing. 
Though the fiscal boost is fading and COVID-19 cases are rising in states with lower vaccination rates, consumer spending will likely continue to grow. Households accumulated at least $2 trillion in excess savings during the pandemic. Record-high stock market prices and accelerating home prices are boosting household wealth. Wages are also rising as companies compete for scarce workers amid a strengthening labor market.
A separate report from the Labor Department on Thursday showed initial claims for state unemployment benefits fell by 24,000 to a seasonally adjusted 400,000 for the week ended July 24. Claims hit a two-month high in the prior week, but that was likely due to difficulties stripping out seasonal fluctuations from the data. 
Businesses maintained a robust pace of investment, buying light trucks, aircraft and machinery. They invested in research and development as well as software, but cut back on spending on commercial and health care structures.

Government spending was weighed down by weakness in nondefense services as the processing and administration of Paycheck Protection Program loan applications by banks on behalf of the federal government declined.
""Supply chains allowing, the need to rebuild off of the currently very low level of inventories should set up for inventory investment to boost GDP in coming quarters, but the availability of certain goods will be the key constraint determining the timing of that recovery,"" said Ellen Zentner, chief U.S. economist at  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) in New York.

(Reuters) -Contracts to purchase previously owned U.S. homes declined in June in step with a spike in home prices after rebounding strongly in the prior month.
The National Association of Realtors (NAR) said on Thursday its Pending Home Sales Index, based on contracts signed last month, fell 1.9% to 112.8. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast pending home sales would increase 0.3%.
Pending home sales for May were revised to show an increase of 8.3% instead of the 8.0% gain previously reported.
Pending home contracts are seen as a forward-looking indicator of the health of the housing market because they become sales one to two months later.
""Pending sales have seesawed since January, indicating a turning point for the market,"" Lawrence Yun, NAR's chief economist, said in a statement. ""Buyers are still interested and want to own a home, but record-high home prices are causing some to retreat.""
House prices have soared in the past year, with the median price for both new and existing homes now topping $360,000.
Compared with one year ago, pending home sales were down 1.9%.
Sharp (OTC:SHCAY) drops in pending home sales in the South and West in June outweighed modest increases in the Northeast and Midwest.
""The Midwest region offers the most affordable costs for a home and hence that region has seen better sales activity compared to other areas in recent months,"" Yun said. 
Home prices have surged nationwide in large part due to limited supply. Contrary to the run-up to the 2007-2009 financial crisis, the current boom does not feature a frenzy of speculators and buyers with low credit scores trying to flip homes.
Sales of new single-family homes fell for the third consecutive month in June, hitting a 14-month low. However, existing home sales rebounded moderately last month. 

""With prices at record highs and mortgage rates still hovering near record lows, sellers are recognizing the favorable conditions,"" said George Ratiu, senior economist at Realtor.com. 
The average contract interest rate for traditional 30-year mortgages declined to 3.01% - its lowest level since February - in the week ended July 23.

BRASILIA (Reuters) - Employment growth in Brazil picked up in June, official figures showed on Thursday, the sixth month of gains and bringing the number of formal jobs created in the first half of the year to its highest since 2010.
The increase was widespread, with all five sectors covered by the Economy Ministry figures showing net job growth in June, meaning more than 1.5 million new positions have been opened up in the first six months of the year.
Some 1.6 million positions were created in June and 1.29 million were cut, resulting in 309,114 net new positions. That was up from the previous month and the most for any June since at least 2010, ministry figures showed.
The gains were led by the dominant services sector, which created a net 125,713 new positions. Commerce accounted for 72,887 net new positions, industry 50,145 and agriculture 38,005, the ministry said.
This means Brazil created a net 1.54 million new formal jobs in the first half of the year. These figures do not include the nearly 40 million undocumented workers in Brazil who do not have formal employment registration.
The total number of formally registered workers in Brazil rose to 40.9 million, the highest June reading since 2014, according to ministry figures.

Earnings fell slightly, however, with the average monthly salary of new jobs created in June down 0.1% in real terms from the prior month to an unadjusted 1,806.29 reais ($355.50).

BERLIN (Reuters) -Germany's annual consumer price inflation accelerated by more than expected to hit a 13-year high in July, leading services sector trade union Verdi to immediately demand ""strong wage increases"".
Consumer prices, harmonised to make them comparable with inflation data from other European Union countries, rose by 3.1% in July compared with 2.1% in June, the Federal Statistics Office said. A Reuters poll had pointed to a reading of 2.9%.
July's reading was the highest since August 2008, when the harmonised inflation rate hit 3.3%, an official at the Statistics Office said.
The rise pushed the inflation rate further above the European Central Bank's 2% target, and fuelled a debate about whether the increase in the cost of living will persist.
""From today's perspective, a sustained increase in inflation is not to be expected,"" an Economy Ministry spokesperson said, citing base effects from a temporary reduction in VAT rates in the second half of 2020 that affected comparisons.
However, German central bank chief Jens Weidmann has said he is worried about the prospect of the ECB's low-interest-rate environment being extended for too long. Weidmann said his advisers anticipated inflation nearing 5% in Germany later this year.
Weidmann made his comments after the ECB pledged to keep interest rates at record lows for even longer to boost sluggish inflation and warned that the fast-spreading Delta variant of the coronavirus poses a risk to recovery.
ING economist Carsten Brzeski said supply chain disruptions and higher commodity costs could put more pressure on prices, adding: ""Don't rule out that headline inflation north of 4% at the end of the year will affect wage negotiations in 2022.""
Services sector trade union Verdi jumped on the acceleration in inflation to call for robust wage rises.
""We need strong wage increases for employees precisely because of rising prices,"" Verdi deputy chair Andrea Kocsis told Reuters.
Holger Schmieding, economist at Berenberg Bank, said some service sector businesses had taken advantage of the reopening of the economy after COVID-19 lockdowns to raise their prices.
""In the coming months, the inflation rate will remain high and even tend to increase somewhat,"" he added.

Euro zone inflation figures for July are due on Friday. In June, the rate ran at 1.9%.
The ECB said last week it would not hike borrowing costs until it sees inflation reach its 2% target ""well ahead of the end of its projection horizon and durably"".

1654,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 29, 2021 08:36AM ET</span>","U.S. Jobless Claims Declined Last Week, Near Pandemic Low","(Bloomberg) -- Applications for U.S. state unemployment fell last week, signaling that the labor market continues to improve even as the delta variant of Covid-19 rages amid sustained vaccine hesitancy.
Initial jobless claims in regular state programs totaled 400,000 in the week ended July 24, down 24,000 from the prior week, Labor Department data showed Thursday. The median estimate in a Bloomberg survey of economists called for 385,000 new applications.
Weekly unemployment claims have fallen considerably since the beginning of the year against a backdrop of elevated labor demand. At the same time, the delta variant that’s fueled a recent surge in new infections across the country poses a risk.
As the threat of renewed restrictions looms and large swaths of the country remain unvaccinated, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention updated its guidance on indoor masking to include K-12 classrooms and inoculated people who live in Covid-19 “hot spots.”
To prevent a so-called fourth wave of infections, local governments are becoming more aggressive in getting city employees vaccinated. New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio is mandating that all public workers get inoculated by Sept. 13 while San Francisco considers a similar move pending full Food and Drug Administration authorization for the jabs.
At the federal level, President Joe Biden says he is assessing a vaccine mandate for government employees.
About half of U.S. governors have ended all three of the federal unemployment benefit programs created during the pandemic before their expiry in September, arguing the supplemental aid is preventing businesses from filling a record number of job openings.

1655,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 29, 2021 08:36AM ET</span>",U.S. economy contracted 19.2% during COVID-19 pandemic recession,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. economy contracted at a record average annualized rate of 19.2% from its peak in the fourth quarter of 2019 through the second quarter of 2020, government data showed on Thursday, confirming that the COVID-19 recession was the worst ever.
The pace of recovery from the pandemic downturn, the deepest going back to 1947, was equally stunning. The Commerce Department's Bureau of Economic Analysis said gross domestic product rebounded at a historic average rate of 18.3% between the second and fourth quarter of 2020. 
Mandatory shutdowns of nonessential businesses in March last year to slow the first wave of coronavirus infections left the economy reeling, throwing a record 22.362 million people out of work. The government provided nearly $6 trillion in pandemic relief, while the Federal Reserve slashed its benchmark overnight interest rate to near zero and is pumping money into the economy through monthly bond purchases. 
The National Bureau of Economic Research, the arbiter of U.S. recessions, declared last week that the pandemic downturn, which started in February 2020, ended in April 2020. 
Massive fiscal stimulus, the Fed's ultra-easy monetary policy and vaccinations against COVID-19 have allowed economic activity to resume, with GDP pulling above its pre-pandemic level in the second quarter. The government also said the economy shrank 3.4% in 2020, instead of 3.5% as previously estimated. That was still the biggest drop in GDP since 1946. 
Revisions to growth in other years and quarters were minor. From 2015 to 2020, GDP increased at an average annual rate of 1.1%, unrevised from previously published estimates. 
The BEA said in 2018 it had fully addressed a methodology problem, or residual seasonality, which analysts had argued tended to understate economic growth in the first quarter.

While growth likely peaked in the second quarter, economists see GDP increasing around 7% this year, which would be the strongest performance since 1984. 
The International Monetary Fund on Tuesday significantly raised its growth forecasts for the United States to 7.0% in 2021 and 4.9% in 2022, up 0.6 and 1.4 percentage points respectively, from its forecasts in April.

Investing.com -- The U.S. economy didn't grow as fast as analysts expected in the second quarter, as labor and product shortages across various industries offset a rebound in service activity.
Much of the all important service-sector had reopened for business between April and June as the nation's vaccination program and seasonal factors allowed a relaxation of public health measures to stop the spread of Covid-19.
All the same, gross domestic product grew at an annualized rate of only 6.5%, well below the 8.5% rate forecast and only a marginal acceleration from the 6.4% registered in the first quarter.
The figures are the first reading for the quarter, and are likely to be revised in the coming weeks. While subject to revision, they stand in contrast to widespread reports of a broad and rapid rebound.
The Bureau of Economic Analysis said that the figures reflected ""increases in personal consumption expenditures (PCE), non-residential fixed investment, exports, and state and local government spending.""
These ""were partly offset by decreases in private inventory investment, residential fixed investment, and federal government spending"", the BEA said. The decline in federal spending happened despite the latest round of stimulus checks approved by the Biden administration and Congress. Anecdotal reports suggest much of the stimulus was spent on imported goods, which are subtracted from the calculation of GDP.  Imports started the quarter at a blistering pace: having hit a record $277 billion in March before falling to $273 billion in April.
Elsewhere, there was fresh evidence that the labor market is struggling to sustain the improvement it showed earlier in the year. Initial jobless claims topped 400,000 for the second week in a row, rather than falling to 380,000 expected. 
In the week through July 10, the overall number of people claiming any kind of unemployment benefit actually rose by over 500,000 to 13.16 million."
1657,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 29, 2021 06:56AM ET</span>",UK mortgage lending booms but consumers stay wary about debt,"By William Schomberg and David Milliken
LONDON (Reuters) -British mortgage lending showed a record surge in June as home-buyers rushed to qualify for a tax break before it was scaled back, but other data added to signs that a rise in COVID-19 cases in recent weeks slowed the broader economic recovery from lockdown.
Mortgage borrowing leapt by a net 17.9 billion pounds ($25.0 billion) from May, the biggest monthly increase in Bank of England records which date back to 1993.
The scale of the increase underscored how the tax incentive fired up Britain's housing market, which was already being boosted by rising demand for bigger properties as more people worked from home because of the pandemic.
A Reuters poll of economists had pointed to a much smaller net increase of 7.9 billion pounds.
The data also showed the end of the full tax break was having an effect on new activity in the housing market.
Approvals of new mortgages by lenders - which in June would have been made too late for buyers to complete their purchase in time to get the tax break - fell to 81,300, the lowest figure since July 2020, the month when the incentive first took effect. 
Under the scheme - part of finance minister Rishi Sunak's support for the pandemic-hit economy - the first 500,000 pounds of any property purchase in England or Northern Ireland were exempt from stamp duty until the end of June. 
A 250,000 pound tax-free allowance is now running until the end of September.
In contrast to the surge in mortgage lending, borrowing by British consumers rose only slightly last month. 
Unsecured lending increased by a net 300 million pounds, well below the 1.2 billion-pound monthly average in the two years before the pandemic. A Reuters poll of economists had pointed to a rise of 600 million pounds in June.
""These figures chime with other early indicators such as spending on electronic cards that the resurgence of COVID-19 cases has increased consumer caution,"" Kieran Tompkins (NYSE:TMP), an economist at consultancy Capital Economics, said.
The BoE is expected to keep its stimulus programme running at full speed on Aug. 5, after its latest policy meeting, as it waits to see the impact of reduced emergency government help for workers and companies in the months ahead as well as progress in tackling the virus.
Sunak is phasing out a wage subsidy furlough scheme by the end of September.
Figures published on Thursday showed 4.9% of the workforce remained on the scheme in early July, though most were only furloughed on a part-time basis and were working some of their normal hours for their employer. This was down from 19.9% in January when the government ordered a new lockdown, but was little changed from late May.

Data from the Office for National Statistics also showed spending using payment cards edged up last week but was 6% below its pre-pandemic level, while online job advertisements rose by 1% to 31% above their February 2020 average.

The EU executive said its monthly survey that sentiment in the 19-country single-currency bloc rose to 119.0 points in July, a record since data began to be collected in 1985, from 117.9 in June, which was already a 21-year high.
However, as the positive impact of the reopening of economic activities begins to wane and fears grow around the Delta coronavirus variant, sentiment grew at a slower pace.
""Compared to the last months, the latest improvement was much weaker, suggesting that the indicator is approaching its peak,"" the European Commission said in a statement.
The rise in sentiment in July was supported by a new surge of optimism in the manufacturing sector which reached another all-time-high after repeated increase this year as factory managers remain largely upbeat.
Confidence also rose to its highest level since August 2007 in the services sector, which has been hit hardest during the pandemic and is the chief beneficiary of the current reopenings.
But the rise in the overall sentiment was checked by a decline in consumers' confidence, after a five month rally, partly caused by households' worse assessment of the future economic situation and plans to make major purchases.
That contributed to a slight fall of optimism in the retail sector.
Selling prices expectations continued to increase across the board in line with forecasts of higher inflation towards the end of the year in the euro zone.

1660,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 28, 2021 10:57AM ET</span>",U.S. goods trade deficit widens on imports; inventories increase,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. trade deficit in goods increased in June as imports continued to rise amid strong economic activity, suggesting trade likely remained a drag on growth in the second quarter.
The U.S. economy has rebounded more quickly from the pandemic compared to its global rivals, thanks to massive fiscal stimulus, low interest rates and vaccinations against COVID-19. But bottlenecks in the supply chain have hampered manufacturers' ability to boost production, drawing in more imports.
""The widening in the advance nominal goods deficit in June is further evidence that net exports will be a drag on second- quarter GDP,"" said Ryan Sweet, a senior economist at Moody's (NYSE:MCO) Analytics in West Chester, Pennsylvania.
The goods trade deficit increased 3.5% to $91.2 billion last month, the Commerce Department said on Wednesday. Imports of goods advanced 1.5% to $236.7 billion. There were increases in imports of food, industrial supplies and capital goods. 
But imports of motor vehicles and consumer goods fell. While that could hint at a possible moderation in consumer spending in the months ahead, the drop could reflect a global shortage of semiconductors, which has weighed on the production of motor vehicles and some household appliances.
Spending during the pandemic shifted to goods from services, with Americans cooped up at home. With nearly half of the United States population fully vaccinated against the coronavirus, demand for services is picking up. 
That has raised optimism among some economists that fewer goods will be imported in the coming months and allow the trade gap to shrink. But the Delta variant of the virus is driving a resurgence in new infections across the country, which could limit demand for services.
""We expect the overall trade deficit to narrow in the coming months as consumers rotate their spending towards services and greater vaccine diffusion abroad encourages stronger export growth,"" said Mahir Rasheed, a U.S. economist at Oxford Economics in New York. ""However, risks from sticky supply chain disruptions and the rapid spread of the Delta variant could slow trade flows.""
Stocks on Wall Street were mixed. The dollar rose against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices were lower.
EXPORTS RISE 
Goods exports rose 0.3% to $145.5 billion, amid a sharp decline in food shipments. Capital goods exports also slipped. But the nation exported more motor vehicles and consumer goods.
The report was published ahead of Thursday's advance second-quarter gross domestic product data. Trade has been a drag on GDP growth for three straight quarters.
According to a Reuters survey of economists, the economy likely grew at a robust 8.5% annualized rate last quarter, an acceleration from the first quarter's 6.4% pace. The anticipated growth pace in the second quarter would be the fastest since 1983 and could mark a peak in the current cycle. 
Some of the imports last month were used to replenish inventories at wholesalers and retailers, which could soften the drag on GDP growth from trade. 
The Commerce Department reported wholesale inventories increased 0.8% last month after rising 1.3% in May. Stocks at retailers gained 0.3% after dropping 0.8% in May. Motor vehicle inventories slipped 0.3% after declining 5.5% in May. Auto production has been undercut by the global chip shortage.
Retail inventories excluding autos, which go into the calculation of GDP, climbed 0.6% after advancing 0.9% in May. 

Business inventories were drawn down in the first quarter.
""Overall, it looks like real inventories fell sharply in the second quarter on net, but the weakness was most severe early in the quarter,"" said Daniel Silver, an economist at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) in New York.

In monthly terms, house prices fell by 0.5% from June, their first fall since March, slowing the annual increase to 10.5% from June's leap of 13.4% which was the steepest rise in 17 years.
Economists polled by Reuters had expected a less marked cooling of the market, predicting prices would rise by 0.6% from June and by 12.1% in annual terms.
Nationwide's chief economist Robert Gardner said the rush to qualify for the full tax break - housing transactions hit a record in June, according to official data - meant savings from the incentive had been dwarfed by the surge in house prices.
Under the incentive scheme, the first 500,000 pounds ($693,850.00) of any property purchase in England or Northern Ireland were exempt from the stamp duty tax until the end of June. A 250,000 pound tax-free allowance is now running until the end of September
Gardner said July's slowdown had been expected after the run-up in prices which rose by an average of 1.6% a month over the April-to-June period, more than six times the average monthly gain during the five years before the pandemic.
""Underlying demand is likely to remain solid in the near term,"" he said.
Improved consumer confidence, low borrowing costs and a shortage of homes on the market would provide support for house prices despite an expected rise in unemployment as the government scales back its pandemic jobs support programme. 

""Even if the labour market does weaken, there is also scope for shifts in housing preferences as a result of the pandemic to continue to support activity for some time yet,"" Gardner said.

The GfK institute said its consumer sentiment index, based on a survey of around 2,000 Germans, was unchanged at -0.3 points. The reading compared with a Reuters forecast for 1.0.
After more than two months of steady decline, COVID-19 cases have been rising since early July, due mainly to the spread of the more infectious Delta variant.
""This is currently preventing a further significant increase in consumer sentiment,"" GfK consumer expert Rolf Buerkl said in a statement, but he added that the domestic economy would make a positive contribution to growth in the second half of the year.
Roughly 60% of Germany's 83 million people have had a first shot of a COVID-19 vaccine and about half are fully vaccinated.
A separate survey published on Monday showed German business morale fell unexpectedly in July on continuing supply chain worries and amid rising coronavirus infections, posting its first decline since January.

1664,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 27, 2021 11:35PM ET</span>","Australian CPI blows hot in second quarter, core inflation far cooler","By Wayne Cole
SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia's consumer prices rose at the fastest annual pace in almost 13 years last quarter as petrol jumped and government subsidies unwound, but a far tamer reading for core inflation suggested the spike would be fleeting.
Indeed, the run-up has already been overtaken by events as coronavirus lockdowns in major population centers will almost certainly send the economy backwards this quarter, a powerful argument for extended monetary and fiscal stimulus.
""The heightened risk posed by the delta variant will result in the economy contracting sharply in the September quarter,"" said Sarah Hunter, chief Australia economist for BIS Oxford Economics. ""Against this backdrop core inflation is likely to remain subdued.""
Wednesday's data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics showed the headline consumer price index (CPI) rose 0.8% in the June quarter, from the previous quarter, just topping market forecasts of a 0.7% increase.
Petrol was the biggest contributor, followed by health care, fresh food and motor vehicles, where strong demand and supply bottlenecks have pushed up prices.
The CPI climbed a sharp 3.8% on a year ago, but largely because the index had been artificially depressed last year by lockdown relief measures notably on child care payments.
The more benign underlying trend was evident in the Reserve Bank of Australia's (RBA) trimmed mean measure of inflation which rose just 0.5% in the quarter and 1.6% for the year.
Core inflation has run stubbornly short of the RBA's 2-3% target band for more than five years, and the bank itself fears it will not reach 2% until the middle of 2023 even with interest rates at record lows.
Crucially there has been scant sign of the kind of broad wage pressures seen in the United States, with Australian firms focused on controlling costs above all else.
The outlook has been further clouded by the spread of the Delta variant, which forced New South Wales on Wednesday to extend a lockdown of Sydney for another four weeks.
Restrictions in the country's most populous city are set to blow a hole in consumer spending and employment this quarter, puncturing what had been a remarkably rapid national recovery.

Gareth Aird, head of Australian economics at CBA, now expects the economy to shrink by a gut wrenching 2.7% this quarter, with a revival unlikely until November.
""A deep contraction in GDP over Q3 21 is now a fait accompli,"" he warned. ""Substantial policy support will once again be needed to ensure that the economic rebound is swift when restrictions are eased.""

1665,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 27, 2021 09:18AM ET</span>",U.S. core capital goods orders and shipments rise solidly in June,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) -New orders for key U.S.-made capital goods increased solidly in June despite supply constraints hampering production at some factories, suggesting business spending on equipment could remain strong beyond the second quarter.
Orders for non-defense capital goods excluding aircraft, a closely watched proxy for business spending plans, rose 0.5% last month, the Commerce Department said on Tuesday. These so-called core capital goods orders had gained 0.5% in May.
Economists polled by Reuters had on average forecast core capital goods orders advancing 0.7%. 
U.S. stock index futures moved lower after the data. The dollar slipped against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices were higher.
Business investment on equipment has boomed during the COVID-19 pandemic, underpinning manufacturing, which accounts for 11.9% of the U.S. economy. Meanwhile consumer spending shifted to goods from services, with millions of Americans cooped up at home. 
Record low interest rates and massive fiscal stimulus measures offered a further boost, causing supply constraints.
Though demand is reverting to services, with just under half of the population fully vaccinated against the coronavirus, spending on goods is likely to remain strong. 
Households accumulated at least $2.5 trillion in excess savings during the pandemic and inventories are low, which will likely see businesses continuing to invest in equipment to boost output.
Core capital goods orders were lifted last month by machinery and primary metal products, as well as computers and electronic products. Orders for electrical equipment, appliances and components were unchanged.
BUSINESS SPENDING 
Shipments of core capital goods increased 0.6% after accelerating 0.9% in May. Core capital goods shipments are used to calculate equipment spending in the government's gross domestic product measurement.
Business spending on equipment has recorded three straight quarters of double-digit growth. Another solid quarter of growth is expected when the government publishes its advance estimate of GDP growth for the second quarter on Thursday.
According to a Reuters survey of economists, GDP growth likely increased at an 8.6% annualized rate last quarter, an acceleration from the first quarter's 6.4% pace. The anticipated growth in the second quarter would be the fastest since 1983 and could mark a peak in the current cycle.
Orders for durable goods, or items ranging from toasters to aircraft that are meant to last three years or more, advanced 0.8% in June after rebounding 3.2% in May. They were supported by a 2.1% increase in orders for transportation equipment.
Orders for civilian aircraft climbed 17.0%. Boeing (NYSE:BA) reported on its website it had received 219 aircraft orders last month, including 200 for the 737 MAX jet from United Airlines. That compared with 73 aircraft orders in May.

Orders for motor vehicles and parts slipped 0.3% after rising 2.0% in May. Motor vehicle production has been hit by a global semiconductor chip shortage. Output of computers and electronic products has also been impacted. 
Unfilled durable goods orders increased 0.9% in June after rising 1.0% in May.

1666,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 27, 2021 06:11AM ET</span>",UK retail sales dip slightly in July after post-lockdown jump-CBI,"LONDON (Reuters) - British retailers reported only a slight slowdown in July after sales growth hit its highest in almost three years in June, the first full month after non-essential shops reopened from a coronavirus shutdown, industry data showed on Tuesday.
The Confederation of British Industry's measure of the volume of sales compared with a year earlier dipped to +23 from June's +25, which was the highest since August 2018.
Economists polled by Reuters had mostly expected a bigger fall to +21.
The CBI said the growth in orders was the fastest since December 2010 and the pace of sales was expected to pick up again in August.
However, sales were reported as in line with usual levels for the time of year, excluding the effect of Britain's coronavirus lockdown. 
CBI economist Ben Jones said consumer demand was supporting Britain's economic recovery, although clothing and footwear stores in particular had yet to see demand recover.
""While demand may be more stable, operational issues worsen,"" he said. 
""Relative stock levels are at a record low and expected to fall further still, while the number one worry for many firms at the minute is labour shortages throughout the supply chain as staff self-isolate.""

The Bank of England is keeping a close eye on how much Britons spend from savings Britons build up during the lockdown, which could prove a key driver of the country's recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic.
It is also looking at whether bottlenecks in supply caused by the pandemic - such as dwindling stocks in the retail sector - will lead to longer-term inflation pressures.

1667,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 27, 2021 01:06AM ET</span>",Taiwan seen growing at slower pace in second quarter; strong exports support: Reuters poll,"TAIPEI (Reuters) - Taiwan's economy is expected to have expanded at a slower pace in the second quarter as a rare spike in COVID-19 cases hurt consumption, a Reuters poll showed, although a strong growth in exports supported the trade-reliant island.
Gross domestic product (GDP) likely expanded 6.05% in the April-June period versus a year ago, the poll of 12 economists shows, after it grew 8.92% year-on-year in the first quarter, the strongest quarterly growth in over a decade.
As a key hub in the global technology supply chain for giants such as Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), Taiwan's economy has outperformed many of its regional peers during the pandemic as it benefited from robust demand for its tech exports.
But domestic consumption was hit by a rare spike in community COVID-19 transmissions in mid-May. The outbreak has now been brought well under control, with the alert level lowered and restrictions on gatherings and restaurant dining eased this week. 
Economists' forecasts for preliminary GDP data due on Friday varied widely from growth of 2.6% to as high as 7.2%.
""We do not think this epidemic outbreak will impact the recovery of domestic consumption,""  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) analysts said in a note. ""Strong global demand and domestic capital expenditure will be able to support Taiwan's economic growth.""
Taiwan's key semiconductor industry has been largely unaffected by the pandemic at home, and exports have remained strong. June exports rose 35.1% from a year earlier to $36.65 billion, the second highest monthly figure on record.
Last week, the Asian Development Bank raised its full-year GDP outlook for Taiwan to 5.6% from an earlier 4.6%, citing among other things ""robust external demand"".
Taiwan has benefited from the work-and-study from home trend around the world, which has buoyed demand for laptops, tablets and other electronics made with components supplied by firms like Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd (TSMC).

The economy in China, Taiwan's top trading partner, expanded more slowly than expected in the second quarter, as slowing manufacturing activity, higher raw material costs and new COVID-19 outbreaks weighed on the recovery momentum.
Taiwan's preliminary figures will be released in a statement with minimal commentary. Revised figures will be released about two to three weeks later, with more details and forward-looking forecasts.

1668,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 27, 2021 12:16AM ET</span>",China's industrial profit growth slows in June on high raw material prices,"BEIJING (Reuters) -Profit growth at China's industrial firms slowed for the fourth straight month in June, as high raw material prices weighed on factories' margins, pointing to some weakness in the recovery of the world's second-biggest economy. 
Industrial firms' profits rose 20% year-on-year in June to 791.8 billion yuan ($122.27 billion), data from the National Bureau of Statistics showed on Tuesday, after a 36.4% increase in May.
The Chinese economy has largely recovered from disruptions caused by the coronavirus pandemic, but it has faced new challenges in recent months such as higher raw material costs and global supply chain crunches.
""The unevenness in the recovery of corporate profitability still exists, with private firms and small businesses facing a slow rebound,"" said Zhu Hong, a senior statistician at the NBS.
""Commodity prices continue to stay at high levels, squeezing the profitability of enterprises, and there are still weak points in supply chains and industrial chains.""
In the first half of 2021, industrial firms' profits grew a hefty 66.9% from a pandemic-induced slump in the same period a year earlier. Profits in January-June increased 45.5% from the same period in 2019, before the global pandemic started.
""The profit margin of upstream industrial enterprises improved further while downstream profit margin edged down slightly,"" said analysts from Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) in a note.
China's factory activity slowed in June on a resurgence of COVID-19 cases in the export province of Guangdong, with epidemic prevention and control efforts curbing port processing capacity.
Metals processing, as well as chemicals and pharmaceuticals industries, drove profit growth in June, according to NBS data. 
Chinese policymakers have stepped up efforts to curb surging commodity prices that have squeezed manufacturers' margins to prevent the price increases from being passed on to consumers.
While China's producer price inflation eased in June after the government crackdown on runaway commodity prices, the annual rate continued to hover at an uncomfortably high level. Some analysts expect the factory gate inflation to stay elevated in the second half of this year.
China's economy grew slightly more slowly than expected in the second quarter. Officials have warned that the recovery remains uneven.

Liabilities at industrial firms were up 8.5% year-on-year at the end of June, versus the 8.2% growth seen at the end of May.
The industrial profit data covers large firms with annual revenues of over 20 million yuan from their main operations.

1669,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 26, 2021 09:25PM ET</span>",South Korea's second-quarter GDP growth hits decade high but risks loom,"By Cynthia Kim
SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea's economy expanded at the fastest annual pace in a decade in the second quarter, thanks to a pick up in private consumption, though a resurgence of COVID-19 casts doubt over the outlook for growth for the rest of the year.
Data from the Bank of Korea on Tuesday showed gross domestic product (GDP) grew 0.7% in the second quarter, after rising 1.7% three months earlier and matching 0.7% growth tipped in a Reuters survey.
The economy surged 5.9% year-on-year, the fastest growth in a decade and up sharply from 1.9% in the first quarter, in part because of the low base effect of last year but also driven by strong exports and imports as major trading partners continued to reopen.
That, however, missed market forecast growth of 6.0% for the annual reading.
The result would be no surprise for the BOK, which is expected to be the first Asian central bank to raise interest rates from pandemic-era lows, as growth and inflation return.
But economists see the pace of growth slowing in the third quarter as the government brought in its toughest coronavirus restrictions yet to contain the worst outbreak in the country.
While exports surged 22.4% on-year, they declined 2.0% from the previous quarter and became a net drag on economic output in the second quarter, suggesting growth may plateau in the months ahead.
""We record exports in volume terms, not in terms of value, which should help explain the slight decline in exports, as export prices have been increasing quite a lot. Also, a shortage of chips for cars also dragged production,"" said Park Yang-su, head of statistics department at the BOK. 
SK Hynix, the world's second-biggest memory chipmaker, on Tuesday reported the highest quarterly profit since the end of 2018, while Korean steelmaker  POSCO  (NYSE:PKX) posted its highest ever quarterly profit last week.
The main driver of growth in the second quarter was private consumption and government expenditure, which rose 3.5% and 3.9%, respectively, on-quarter.
Finance Minister Hong Nam-ki said in a Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) post on Tuesday the government will soon release measures to boost consumption to help those hit by the latest virus curbs, using the 34.9 trillion won ($30.36 billion) extra budget spending earmarked for pandemic relief packages.
Still, some economists are lowering their growth projection for the country.
""Given that growth was not as strong as we had expected, we are lowering our forecast for the year as a whole to 4.3%, from 5% previously,"" said Alex Holmes, an economist at Capital Economics.

""We don’t think there was anything in the figures that would persuade the BOK to delay the timing of its first rate hike. We are sticking with our non-consensus view of a move in late-August.""

1670,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 26, 2021 11:27AM ET</span>",U.S. new home sales drop to 14-month low in June,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Sales of new U.S. single-family homes tumbled to a 14-month low in June and sales in the prior month were weaker than initially estimated, suggesting that expensive building materials and the resulting surge in prices for properties were restraining the housing market.
New home sales fell 6.6% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 676,000 units last month, the lowest level since April 2020, the Commerce Department said on Monday. May's sales pace was revised down to 724,000 units from the previously reported 769,000 units. Sales have now dropped for three straight months.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast new home sales, which account for a small share of U.S. home sales, increasing 3% to rate of 800,000 units in June.
""Until builder costs and supply-chain problems become less of an impediment, it is hard to see new sales picking up significantly in the near term,"" said David Berson, chief economist at Nationwide in Columbus, Ohio.
The report followed in the wake of news last week that building permits fell to a nine-month low in June, while sales of previously owned homes rebounded moderately. The COVID-19 pandemic, which forced millions of Americans to work from home and take online classes, led to a boom in housing demand.
But supply has lagged behind, with builders constrained by expensive lumber as well as shortages of other building materials, household appliances, land and labor. The backlog of single-family homes approved for construction but yet to be started surged in June to the highest level since October 2006.
U.S. financial markets were little moved by the data. 
Graphic: New home sales: https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-STOCKS/byvrjokmyve/newhomesales.png
The housing market was one of the economy's star performers during the pandemic, posting double-digit growth for three straight quarters. That streak likely came to an end in the second quarter, with residential investment believed to have had a neutral impact on gross domestic product.
The government is scheduled to publish its snapshot of second-quarter GDP on Thursday.
Last month, new home sales dropped in the populous South, the Northeast and West. They rose in the Midwest. New home sales are drawn from a sample of houses selected from building permits and tend to be volatile on a month-to-month basis.
Sales declined 19.4% on a year-on-year basis in June. That was the first annual decrease since the pandemic.
The median new house price increased 6.1% from a year earlier to $361,800 in June. Sales were concentrated in the $200,000-$749,000 price range. Sales below the $200,000 price bracket, the sought-after segment of the market, accounted for only 2% of transactions last month.

There were 353,000 new homes on the market, up from 330,000 in May. At June's sales pace it would take 6.3 months to clear the supply of houses on the market, up from 5.5 months in May. 
About 77% of homes sold last month were either under construction or yet to be built.

1671,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 26, 2021 05:36AM ET</span>","German business morale down on supply shortages, virus fears","By Kirsti Knolle and Caroline Copley
BERLIN (Reuters) -German business morale fell unexpectedly in July on continuing supply chain worries and amid rising coronavirus infections, a survey showed on Monday, the first decline since January. 
The Ifo institute said its business climate index fell to 100.8 from a revised figure of 101.7 in June and versus a Reuters poll forecast of 102.1.
""Supply bottlenecks for preliminary materials and concerns regarding a renewed rise in (coronavirus) infection numbers are weighing on the German economy,"" Ifo President Clemens Fuest said in a statement. 
Companies gave a slightly better assessment of their current situation but optimism with regard to the coming months waned.
The Ifo expectations index fell to 101.2 from 103.7 in June, while the current conditions index rose to 100.4 from 99.7. 
Almost 64% of industrial firms in Europe's biggest economy complained about bottlenecks in supply chains, while 60% of wholesalers and 42.5% of retailers also reported shortages, according to the institute. 
""Nerves are on edge again,"" said Andreas Scheuerle, economist at Dekabank. ""The first drop in the Ifo business climate came faster than feared.""
Events including the COVID-19 pandemic, natural disasters in China and Germany and cyber attacks have conspired to drive global supply chains towards a breaking point, threatening the flow of raw materials, parts and consumer goods.
""The expected straight-line economic recovery in the second half of 2021 is not a foregone conclusion,"" Bankhaus Lampe chief economist Alexander Krueger said.
Supply chain disruptions are likely to persist and economic recovery will continue to depend on the pandemic, Krueger added. 
Germany's car industry - featuring powerful brands like Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p), Daimler (OTC:DDAIF) and BMW and accounting for an estimated 5% of the economic output and more than 800,000 jobs - this month slashed its forecast for 2021 production growth in response to the insecurities.
The flooding in western Germany two weeks ago is likely to add to the problems, and road transportation of goods has slowed significantly. In the week of July 11, as the disaster unfolded, the volume of late shipments rose by 15% from the week before, according to data from supply-chain tracking platform FourKites. 
In Germany's tourism and hospitality sectors, among the worst hit by lockdowns, euphoria has also ebbed, with many fearing a fourth wave of the coronavirus, Ifo economist Klaus Wohlrabe said.
After more than two months of steady decline, COVID-19 cases have been rising since early July, due mainly to the spread of the more infectious Delta variant.

Roughly 60% of Germany's 83 million people have had a first shot of a COVID-19 vaccine and about half are fully vaccinated.

The au Jibun Bank Flash Japan Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) slipped to a seasonally adjusted 52.2 in July from a final 52.4 in the previous month, in a sign of a softer improvement in operating conditions.
Among key economic elements, output and new orders growth eased to six-month lows amid rising COVID-19 infections and delays in getting raw materials, said Usamah Bhatti, economist at IHS Markit, which compiles the survey.
The survey also showed the services sector continued to face severe conditions, with activity contracting at the fastest pace in five months and marking the 18th straight month of decline.
Bhatti said that meant overall private-sector activity fell at a faster rate in July than in the previous month. 
""Short-term disruption to activity is likely to continue until the latest wave of COVID-19 infections passes and restrictions enacted under state of emergency laws are lifted,"" Bhatti said.
""Employment levels in the Japanese private sector continued to expand, however the rate of job creation eased,"" he added. ""At the same time, input costs across the private sector rose at the fastest pace since September 2008.""

1673,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 23, 2021 09:50AM ET</span>",U.S. business activity cools further in July - IHS Markit survey,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. business activity grew at a moderate pace for a second straight month in July amid supply constraints, suggesting a cooling in economic activity after what was expected to have been a robust second quarter.
Data firm IHS Markit said on Friday its flash U.S. Composite PMI Output Index, which tracks the manufacturing and services sectors, fell to a four-month low of 59.7 from 63.7 in June. A reading above 50 indicates growth in the private sector.
Businesses are battling shortages of raw materials and labor, which are fanning inflation, in the aftermath of the economy's reopening after severe disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. The survey's findings fit in with economists' views that growth will slow after accelerating in the second quarter, thanks to massive fiscal stimulus.
Even with the boost from government money fading, the economy remains supported by strong demand, with households having accumulated at least $2.5 trillion in excess savings during the pandemic. The labor market recovery is also gaining traction and wages are rising as companies compete for workers.
But the Delta variant of the coronavirus, which is behind a resurgence in new COVID-19 infections in parts of the country with low vaccination rates, could result in consumers being more cautious.
""While the second quarter may therefore represent a peaking in the pace of economic growth according to the PMI, the third quarter is still looking encouragingly strong,"" said Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit. ""Short-term capacity issues remain a concern, constraining output in many manufacturing and service sector companies while simultaneously pushing prices higher as demand exceeds supply.""
The government is due to publish its snapshot of second-quarter gross domestic product next Thursday. Growth estimates are converging around a 9.0% annualized rate. The economy grew at a 6.4% pace in the first quarter.
The IHS Markit survey's flash services sector PMI fell to a reading of 59.8 from 64.6 in June, slowing further from May's record high. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast a reading of 64.8 this month for the services sector, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity.
Firms reporting a slowdown in activity cited labor shortages and difficulties acquiring stock. According to the survey, some firms reported customer hesitancy because of significant hikes in selling prices. Companies are passing on to consumers the higher production costs brought about by scarce raw materials and workers.
The government reported last week that consumer prices increased by the most in 13 years in June, while producer prices accelerated.
There are, however, signs that inflation is close to peaking. The survey's measure of prices paid by services businesses slipped to 72.1 from a reading of 74.2 in June.

While services sector activity is cooling, manufacturing continues to power ahead. The survey's flash manufacturing PMI rose to an all-time high reading of 63.1 from 62.1 in June. Economists had forecast the index for the sector, which accounts for 11.9% of the economy, would dip to 62.
A measure of new orders received by factories increased and manufacturers reported unfinished work continued to pile up even as hiring picked up. Suppliers continued to struggle to deliver inputs on time.

LONDON (Reuters) -Britain's rapid economic bounce-back from the coronavirus pandemic slowed sharply in July as a new wave of cases forced hundreds of thousands of workers to self-isolate under government rules to limit the spread of the disease.
Supermarkets and hauliers say staff shortages are making it hard to restock shelves and deliver goods, and Friday's monthly purchasing managers' index (PMI) data gave the first clear evidence of the scale of the impact.
The IHS Markit/CIPS flash composite PMI dropped to 57.7 in July from 62.2 in June. A reading above 50 indicates growth in the economy but the reading was the lowest since March and a sharper fall than most economists had forecast in a Reuters poll.
""July saw the UK economy's recent growth spurt stifled by the rising wave of virus infections, which subdued customer demand, disrupted supply chains and caused widespread staff shortages, and also cast a darkening shadow over the outlook,"" Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit, said.
The economy was still on course to expand in the third quarter, but at a slower pace than before, he added.
The British PMI contrasted with the one for the euro zone, which struck its highest since July 2000, and sterling extended losses after the data.
Britain's economy has rebounded after its nearly 10% slump in 2020 when the country suffered one of the world's heaviest coronavirus death tolls and locked down for longer than many other European nations.
But reopening has created bottlenecks and inflation pressures. Two Bank of England policymakers have suggested an early end to the BoE's bond-buying stimulus.
Friday's PMI data showed a record rise in businesses' costs and a near-record increase in the prices they charged.
However, the weaker-than-expected activity figures are likely to make other policymakers wary of scaling back support next month. The BoE is due to announce its next policy decision on Aug. 5.
""Given today's numbers, the uncertainty around the Delta variant and the impact of the end of the Job Retention Scheme from September, we expect the Bank to stick to its current course,"" Willem Sels, chief investment officer at HSBC's wealth management division, said. 
CONSUMERS SEE CLOUDS AHEAD
The slower growth in business activity seen in the PMI survey - conducted July 12-21 - contrasted with a return to pre-pandemic consumer confidence levels in a survey by market researchers GfK published earlier on Friday.
However, households did express greater concern about the economic outlook than a month earlier due to worries about COVID-19 variants, rising inflation and reduced furlough support.
Other figures showed retail sales volumes rose 0.5% in June to stand 9.5% above pre-pandemic levels, bolstered by a jump in food and drink during the Euro 2020 soccer tournament.
Monday marked the end of most COVID restrictions on businesses in England, with nightclubs allowed to reopen, mask-wearing requirements largely scrapped and capacity restrictions lifted for pubs, restaurants and shops.
But the reopening has been questioned by critics of the government, coming just as COVID cases are rising again.
The latest wave of infections led to more than 600,000 people in England and Wales being told to self-isolate last week because they were close contacts of people who tested positive and were ""pinged"" by a government app.
Businesses want the government to bring forward the scheduled Aug. 16 lifting of that requirement for workers who are fully vaccinated or test negative for COVID. The government said it would exempt up to 10,000 workers in food supply chains.

The fall in the PMI was greatest in the services sector, especially among transport and hospitality firms.
Orders growth was the weakest since February and business optimism fell to its lowest since October 2020, before news of effective COVID vaccines. Brexit-related trade frictions also hurt business morale and new orders.

LONDON (Reuters) -Euro zone business activity expanded at its fastest monthly pace in over two decades in July as the loosening of more COVID-19 restrictions gave a boost to services but fears of another wave of infections hit business confidence, a survey showed.
With vaccination rates accelerating and the burden on health care easing governments have lifted some of the curbs they imposed to try and contain the virus' spread, unleashing pent-up demand.
IHS Markit's Flash Composite Purchasing Managers' Index, seen as a good guide to economic health, climbed to 60.6 in July from 59.5, its highest reading since July 2000. It was ahead of the 50-mark separating growth from contraction and a Reuters poll estimate for 60.0.
""Better than expected PMIs confirm the strong rebound expected for 3Q, as reopening services make up for the slight decline in manufacturing output due to supply chain problems,"" said Bert Colijn at ING.
""Easing restriction measures are boosting service sector activity at the moment, but concerns about the spread of the Delta variant resulted in a somewhat weaker business outlook for the year ahead,"" Colijn said.
A PMI covering the bloc's dominant service industry jumped to 60.4 from 58.3, its highest since June 2006 and ahead of the Reuters poll forecast for 59.5.
Indicating that pace won't slow anytime soon, demand was racing. The new business index rose to 59.7 from 58.7, one of the highest readings in the survey's 23 year history.
The strong recovery in Germany, Europe's biggest economy, continued with its PMI hitting the highest level in nearly a quarter of a century, fueled by strong demand partly resulting from an easing of virus containment measures.
But French activity weakened more than forecast and fell to a three-month low as shortages of materials and transportation delays impacted firms.
And in Britain, outside the euro zone, the rapid economic bounce-back from the pandemic slowed sharply as a new wave of cases forced hundreds of thousands of workers to self-isolate under government rules to limit the spread of the disease. [L8N2OY58T]
DELTA WAVE
Factories had another blistering month. The manufacturing PMI only dipped from June's record high of 63.4 to 62.6. An index measuring output that feeds into the composite PMI fell to 60.9 from 62.6.
But the spread of the highly transmissible Delta variant of the coronavirus has further impacted already disrupted global supply chains and pushed prices for raw materials factories need soaring.
The input prices index held steady at June's survey high of 88.5.
On Thursday the European Central Bank pledged to keep interest rates at record lows for even longer to boost sluggish inflation.
It expects inflation in the euro zone as a whole to hit 1.9% this year before falling back to 1.5% in 2022 and 1.4% the year after, well below its 2% target.
The ECB also warned the rapidly spreading Delta variant of the coronavirus posed a risk to the bloc's recovery and rising infections and fears of another wave of the coronavirus put a dent in overall confidence. The composite future output index slumped to 67.8 from 71.9, its lowest February.

That chimes with European Commission data released on Thursday which showed consumer confidence fell this month.
""While actual and prospective activity trends remain very solid, it is clear that the recent increase in new coronavirus trends and the spread of the more transmissible Delta variant are leaving a mark on euro zone confidence,"" said Ricardo Amaro at Oxford Economics.

1676,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 23, 2021 03:35AM ET</span>",Rapid German recovery triggering inflation bottlenecks - PMI,"BERLIN (Reuters) - The German economy continued its strong recovery in July with IHS Markit's flash composite Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) hitting its highest level in nearly a quarter of a century, creating inflationary bottlenecks.
That was fueled by strong demand, partly resulting from an easing of virus containment measures in Europe's largest economy. Firms, facing capacity constraints, took on staff at an unprecedented rate, Markit said.
The flash composite PMI clocked a reading of 62.5 from 60.1 in June. 
Rising input costs and output charges were feeding strong inflation, even though the actual rate of price increases was down slightly from May's record level.
Activity in the service sector was expanding very strongly, with the services index standing at 62.2, up from 57.5, its highest level since 1997. Manufacturing growth was also robust, with the index standing at 65.6, although this was only a three-month high.

""Germany's private sector economy remains in the fast lane to recovery,"" wrote IHS Markit Associate Director Phil Smith.
He added: ""Across the manufacturing sector, the picture on the demand side remains highly positive, but July's survey suggests that output has fallen further behind new orders as supply shortages continue to constrain production growth.""

Data compiler IHS Markit said its preliminary composite Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) fell to 56.8 points in July from 57.4 in June - its lowest figure in three months.
The July figure also came in below a forecast for 58.5 points, although it remained well above the 50-point threshold dividing an expansion in activity from a contraction.
The preliminary July PMI reading for France's dominant services sector fell to 57.0 points from 57.8 in June, missing a forecast for a reading of 58.7 points.
The flash PMI for France's manufacturing sector fell to 58.1 points in July from 59.0 in June - also below a forecast for 58.4.

""Given the sharp increases in new orders that PMI data are signalling, the only hindrance to sustaining strong rates of output growth will be on the supply-side. Backlogs of work were accumulated once again in July as firms struggled to meet unrelenting demand pressures amid looser lockdown measures and subsequent economic recovery efforts both domestically and overseas,"" said IHS Markit senior economist Joe Hayes.
""This was compounded by continued shortages of inputs and poor freight availability, leading to the fastest rate in cost inflation since May 2011,"" added Hayes.

LONDON (Reuters) -British retail sales resumed their post-lockdown recovery in June after a surprise fall in May, as soccer fans watching the Euro 2020 tournament loaded up on food and drink to enjoy at home, Britain's statistics agency said.
Retail sales volumes rose by 0.5% in June from May, the Office for National Statistics said, slightly stronger than a 0.4% increase expected by economists polled by Reuters.
Sales were up by 9.5% compared with their pre-coronavirus pandemic February 2020 levels, the ONS said.
Food stores, which suffered the biggest hit in spending in May as consumers returned to restaurants and bars, drove the increase in June with volumes rising by 4.2%, helped by the start of Euro 2020, the ONS said.
This was the biggest monthly rise since March 2020, when households stocked up on food at the start of the pandemic.
The ONS figures showed a 4.7% fall in clothing sales and a 10.9% drop at household good stores.
Samuel Tombs, an economist with Pantheon Macroeconomics, said Euro 2020 provided only a temporary boost to retailers and shoppers were likely to rein in spending in the face of rising inflation and the end of COVID crisis aid from the government.
""Retail sales probably will fall back over the coming months,"" he said.
Face-to-face retailers also got a boost from the lifting of restrictions that shut non-essential shops until mid-May.
The ONS said online sales made up the lowest share of retail spending since March 2020 at the start of the pandemic, dropping to 26.7% in June from 28.4% in May.
Britain's economy has bounced back sharply from its nearly 10% slump in 2020 when the country locked down for longer than many other European nations in a bid to counter one of the world's heaviest coronavirus death tolls.
Prime Minister Boris Johnson this week lifted almost all the remaining restrictions in England.
An opinion poll published earlier on Friday showed consumers in the first half of July were their most confident since before the coronavirus pandemic despite a fresh pick-up in COVID-19 cases.
But a fall in confidence in the economy for the year ahead showed consumers were aware of the risks still posed by COVID, as well as from higher inflation and the end of the government's huge wage subsidy scheme which sheltered many workers from the crisis.

Retailers, like other companies, are facing new problems in July after an official health app told hundreds of thousands of workers to isolate following contact with someone with COVID-19.
British supermarkets warned this week that some products were in short supply as a result of staff shortages caused by the surge in self-isolating workers.

1679,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 22, 2021 01:16PM ET</span>",U.S. housing market floats back to earth,"By Stephen Culp
NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. housing market appears to be straining under the weight of its own pandemic-driven success. Recent data shows the sector is returning from the stratosphere and coming back to pre-COVID levels, as evidenced by a slew of data released this week.
While for much of the pandemic a rush to suburbia made the home and real estate stars of the recovery, the resulting plunge in inventory and dearth of building supplies have launched home prices beyond the grasp of many potential buyers, particularly at the lower end of the market.
""The housing market isn't caving just yet,"" said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Spartan Capital Securities in New York. ""Have we reached a peak? That’s a possibility, but worst case scenario, I see a leveling off.""
The best news of the week for investors was delivered on Thursday by the National Association of Realtors (NAR), which reported that sales of previously owned homes rose 1.4% to 5.86 million units in June at a seasonally adjusted annualized rate, although the rebound was weaker than expected.
The number undershot consensus by 40,000 units, and followed May's downwardly-revised 1.2% decline. 
Graphic: Existing home sales: https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-STOCKS/movanmkqkpa/ehs.png 
The inventory drought has provided sturdy support for homebuilding, but that support appears to be on the wane.
While groundbreaking on new residential homes increased by 6.3% in June, building permits, a more forward-looking indicator, dropped 5.1% to an eight-month low.
With these moves, starts and permits returned to pre-pandemic levels. 
On Monday, the National Association of Homebuilders reported builder sentiment softening, as higher input costs and rising home prices appear to be denting the traffic of potential homebuyers. 
Graphic: NAHB: https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-STOCKS/yxmvjzzwdvr/nahb.png 
The most recent data shows an annual increase of 14.9% in the Case-Shiller's 20-city composite home price index, and NAHB's traffic of potential buyers - while still well above pre-pandemic levels - off 15.6% from November's apex. 
Graphic: Home prices and potential buyer traffic: https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-STOCKS/gkvlgmgblpb/pricesbuyers.png 
Indeed, mortgage demand dropped by 4% last week, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association (MBA). Applications for loans to purchase homes are down 18% from the same week last year.

The equities market, the most forward-looking indicator of them all, also reflects a bit of fading luster for housing stocks.
Through much of the pandemic the group outperformed the broader market, even as much of the economy struggled with the effects of social distancing mandates that spawned an exodus from the cites to more spacious properties in the suburbs and beyond. 

Over the last 12 months, the S&P 1500 Homebuilding index and the Philadelphia SE Housing index are up 36.2% and 31.2%, respectively, more or less in line with the S&P 500's 33.0% advance over the same time period.

1680,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 22, 2021 12:31PM ET</span>",U.S. weekly jobless claims increase to two-month high; trend still low,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits rose to a two-month high last week, a reminder that the labor market was far from being out of the woods as the nation confronts a resurgence in new COVID-19 infections. 
Still, the weekly jobless claims report from the Labor Department on Thursday, showed more people are returning to work, a trend that bodes well for July's employment report. The Delta variant of the coronavirus is behind the latest outbreak, with states that have low vaccination rates worst affected.
""The rise in jobless claims this week tells us that the labor market's troubles are not completely behind us and the Delta variant may yet throw a monkey wrench into the economic recovery from the shortest recession in American history,"" said Christopher Rupkey, chief economist at FWDBONDS in New York.
Initial claims for state unemployment benefits increased 51,000 to a seasonally adjusted 419,000 for the week ended July 17, the highest level since mid-May. Data for the prior week was revised to show 8,000 more applications received than previously reported. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast 350,000 applications for the latest week.
There were large increases in filings in Kentucky, Michigan, Missouri and Texas. Some of these states have experienced a surge in new coronavirus cases. 
Though economists do not expect large-scale business shutdowns similar to 2020, the latest wave of infections poses a risk to the economy. The National Bureau of Economic Research's business cycle dating committee declared on Monday that the pandemic recession, which started in February 2020, ended in April 2020.
Some of the rise in claims likely reflects difficulties smoothing the data for seasonal fluctuations following the upheaval from the pandemic. In normal years, layoffs are usually expected to decline in the second half of July. Before the pandemic, summer factory closures were the norm in early July, especially in the automobile industry.
The four-week average of claims, considered a better measure of labor market trends as it strips out weekly volatility from the data, rose only 750 to 385,250.
""We need to filter the noise in the data points and not lose sight of the big picture, which is that the trend line continues to head lower, said Anu Gaggar, senior global investment analyst at Commonwealth Financial Network in Waltham, Massachusetts. ""There has been some distortion in data and in consensus expectations around automakers' annual retooling shutdowns that will work its way through the system in the upcoming weeks.""
(Graphic: Jobless claims: https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-STOCKS/znpnedbxkvl/joblessclaims.png)
Claims have declined from a record 6.149 million in early April 2020, though they remain above the 200,000-250,000 range that is seen as consistent with healthy labor market conditions.
While other data on Thursday showed a rebound in sales of previously owned homes in June after four straight monthly declines, the pace was moderate as higher prices and low inventory remained constraints.
Stocks on Wall Street were mixed. The dollar was little changed against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasuries were higher.

JOBLESS ROLLS SHRINKING
Last week's claims data covered the period in which the government surveyed business establishments for the nonfarm payrolls component of July's employment report. Claims were little changed between the June and July survey periods.
The economy created 850,000 jobs in June after adding 583,000 in May. Employment is 6.8 million jobs below its peak in February 2020. Claims data have been muddied by the federal government's expansion of benefits to people who do not qualify for the regular state programs. People have to apply for state programs to determine eligibility for federal benefits.
But the unemployed are returning to work. The claims report showed the number of people continuing to receive benefits after an initial week of aid dropped 29,000 to 3.236 million during the week ended July 10, the lowest level since the pandemic started. 
The so-called continuing claims, which are reported with a one-week lag, have been falling since late June, and data next week will offer more clues on how hiring fared in July. 
At least 20 states led by Republican governors have pulled out of federal government-funded unemployment programs, including a $300 weekly payment, which businesses claimed were encouraging unemployed Americans to stay at home. 
There were a record 9.2 million job openings at the end of May. About 9.5 million people are officially unemployed. 
Evidence is mixed on whether the early termination of federal benefits, which started on June 12 and will run through July 31, is encouraging job searches. The expanded benefits will lapse on Sept. 6 for the rest of the country.
Continuing claims have decreased in some states that have terminated federal benefits as well as in those that remain on the programs. They have also risen in some states that have prematurely ended expanded benefits. Texas reported a sharp rise in the week ended June 10.
""We expect the downward trend in continuing claims will gather momentum as top-off benefits end in all states in early September and other constraints on labor supply including lack of childcare recede,"" said Nancy Vanden Houten, lead U.S. economist at Oxford Economics in New York. ""The latest surge in coronavirus cases may make some individuals more reluctant to return to work, however.""

At least 12.6 million people were receiving benefits under all programs in early July, down 1.263 million from late June. The latest resurgence in coronavirus infections could sharpen criticism of the states that have terminated federal benefits.
""Businesses in hard-hit areas could be forced to curtail operations and shed positions if new restrictions are needed,"" said Andrew Stettner, senior fellow at The Century Foundation. ""What will happen to the nearly four million workers whose unemployment benefits have been cut off early?""

(Reuters) - A gauge of future U.S. economic activity increased in June, suggesting the economy continued to recover from the recession caused by the novel coronavirus outbreak.
The Conference Board on Thursday said its index of leading economic indicators (LEI) rose 0.7% last month to 115.1, topping its previous peak reached in May.
That was shy of economists' expectations of a 0.9% increase, according to a Reuters poll.
""June’s gain in the U.S. LEI was broad-based and, despite negative contributions from housing permits and average workweek, suggests that strong economic growth will continue in the near term,"" said Ataman Ozyildirim, senior director of economic research at The Conference Board in Washington.

The LEI's coincident index, a measure of current economic conditions, rose by 0.4% in June after increasing 0.5% in May. 
But the lagging index was unchanged last month after increasing 0.6% in May.

1682,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 22, 2021 10:07AM ET</span>",U.S. existing home sales rebound moderately in June,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. home sales rebounded in June after four straight monthly declines, but the pace was moderate as higher prices and low inventory remained constraints.
Existing home sales increased 1.4% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.86 million units last month, the National Association of Realtors said on Thursday. Sales rose in the Northeast, West and Midwest. They were unchanged in the densely populated South.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast sales would rise to a rate of 5.90 million units in June.
Home resales, which account for the bulk of U.S. home sales, increased 22.9% on a year-on-year basis. 
The COVID-19 pandemic fueled demand for houses as millions of Americans switched to remote work and schooling. 
Supply was already tight before the pandemic and is unlikely to improve as builders battle higher costs for raw materials, including lumber and concrete. Labor and building lots are also in short supply. The Commerce Department reported on Tuesday that permits for future homebuilding dropped to an eight-month low in June. 
Realtors, homebuilders and a group of other stakeholders met last Friday with White House officials, including Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo and Housing and Urban Development Secretary Marcia Fudge, to discuss strategies to address the short-term supply chain disruptions in the homebuilding sector.
The median existing house price increased 23.4% from a year ago to $363,300 in June. Higher prices are in part due to sales being concentrated in the upper end of the market. Bidding wars have become the norm across the country, though the NAR said the number of multiple offers was declining. 
There were 1.25 million previously owned homes on the market last month, down 18.8% from a year ago. At June's sales pace, it would take 2.6 months to exhaust the current inventory, down from 3.9 months a year ago. 
A six-to-seven-month supply is viewed as a healthy balance between supply and demand. Economists do not believe another housing bubble is developing, noting that the surge is being mostly driven by a mismatch between supply and demand, rather than poor lending practices, which triggered the 2008 global financial crisis. 
But higher home prices could dampen demand. The University of Michigan's survey of consumers published last week showed consumers' complaints about rising home prices holding at an all-time high in early July. 

In June, properties typically remained on the market for 17 days, matching May's all-time low. Eighty-nine percent of the homes sold last month were on the market for less than a month. 
First-time buyers accounted for 31% of sales in June, down from 35% a year ago.

Initial jobless claims in regular state programs totaled 419,000 in the week ended July 17, up 51,000 from the prior week, Labor Department data showed Thursday. The median estimate in a Bloomberg survey of economists called for 350,000 new applications.
Continuing claims for state benefits fell to 3.24 million in the week ended July 10.
The unexpected jump in initial jobless claims reflected outsize increases in four states -- Michigan, Texas, Kentucky and Missouri. While a number of factors make seasonal adjustment of the weekly data difficult, the rapidly spreading delta variant of Covid-19 could inject further volatility into the figures in the coming months.
The initial claims figures coincide with the survey period for the Labor Department’s monthly jobs report. A majority of states reported declines on an unadjusted basis from the prior week, including New York, Oklahoma and Tennessee.
Nearly half of U.S. governors have ended all three of the federal unemployment benefit programs created during the pandemic before their expiry in September, arguing the supplemental aid is holding back job growth and preventing businesses from filling a record number of job openings.

LONDON (Reuters) -British manufacturers' expectations for output growth over the next three months are the strongest on record as the economy bounces back from its coronavirus pandemic lockdowns, the Confederation of British Industry said on Thursday.
The CBI's quarterly survey showed surging levels of employment and investment in factories but also acute inflation pressures. Average cost growth in the three months to July hit its fastest pace since 1980.
The growth in costs was expected to ease next quarter but still remain high.
""UK industry is reawakening following the economic ravages of the pandemic,"" CBI chief economist Rain Newton-Smith said, while pointing to challenges ahead. 
""Acute staff shortages evident across the economy are biting deeply within manufacturing, with skills in short supply and the number of people isolating climbing steeply.""
More than 600,000 people in England and Wales were advised to isolate in the week to July 14 by a government mobile app which detects if they have been in close contact with someone who has tested positive for COVID-19.
New orders were driven mostly by surging domestic demand, although export orders rose for the first time since January 2019.
Investment intentions for plant and machinery over the next 12 months were the strongest since April 1988.

British finance minister Rishi Sunak announced in March a costly two-year tax incentive for companies to invest in plant and machinery to help the manufacturing sector modernise as it emerges from the coronavirus pandemic. 
A monthly version of the CBI showed total orders slipped slightly in July but remained far about their average levels and expectations for prices over the next three months similarly dipped but stayed high.

The updated basket weights represent consumer spending patterns in 2020, during the coronavirus pandemic, and will be incorporated into June 2021 CPI, Statistics Canada said. The June data is due for release on July 28.
The CPI provides insight on inflation and is sometimes used to help determine wage increases. It also has implications for real return bonds, which compensate investors for changes in the index.
Statscan created an alternate index to better reflect the impact of spending shifts due to the pandemic, and it has consistently tracked above official inflation.
The previous basket update was based on 2017 purchasing patterns.
Three of the eight major components saw unprecedented growth in their basket weights, the statistics agency said, led by shelter, already the highest-weighted major component, which grew to 29.78% as a share of the basket, from 26.92% in 2017.
Canadian home prices have surged during the pandemic.
The share of the household operations, furnishings and equipment component grew to 15.21% and alcoholic beverages, tobacco products and recreational cannabis was up at 4.86%.
Four of the major components declined in basket share, with the transportation component shrinking the most. It fell to 15.34% from 19.72%.
The updated weightings utilize alternative data sources, to help account for pandemic-related shifts in consumer spending.

Canada's annual inflation rate accelerated to 3.6% in May, its fastest pace in a decade, due in part to the statistical comparison to tanking prices last year.
The Bank of Canada targets inflation at 2%, with a 1%-3% control range. It expects inflation to ease back to the 2% target by 2022.

(Reuters) - The number of applications for U.S. home mortgages declined last week, driven by a decrease in both refinancing and purchase activity as mortgage rates rose. 
The Mortgage Bankers Association (MBA) said on Wednesday its seasonally adjusted market index fell 4.0% in the week ended July 16 from a week earlier. That reflected a 2.8% decrease in applications to refinance existing loans, while purchase applications declined 6.4% to their lowest level since May 2020.
The average contract interest rate for traditional 30-year mortgages increased to 3.11% from 3.09% the prior week. Last week, the average contract interest rate dropped to its lowest level since February.
""Limited inventory and higher prices are keeping some prospective homebuyers out of the market,"" Joel Kan, MBA's associate vice president of economic and industry forecasting, said in a statement.
""Refinance activity fell over the week, but because rates have stayed relatively low, the pace of applications was close to its highest level since early May 2021,"" the statement added.
This week's data comes just one day after the Commerce Department reported housing starts accelerated in June, while building permits dropped to an eight-month low. 
Also, U.S. homebuilder confidence fell to an 11-month low in July, driven by shortages in both supply and labor.

LONDON (Reuters) -British public borrowing last month was almost a fifth lower than a year earlier, when the economy was feeling the full force of the coronavirus pandemic, but rising inflation put upward pressure on debt costs.
Public sector net borrowing, excluding public sector banks, fell to 22.8 billion pounds ($31.0 billion) in June, still the second-highest June figure on record. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast a drop to 21.6 billion pounds.
Reflecting the surge in borrowing by British finance minister Rishi Sunak to soften the hit from the pandemic, the data showed Britain's budget deficit leapt to 14.2% of gross domestic product during the financial year to the end of March 2021, its highest share of GDP since World War Two.
""We still expect borrowing to undershoot the OBR's latest forecast for this year. But we are not out of the woods yet, with the recent surge in COVID-19 cases putting some parts of the economy at risk of further restrictions later in the year,"" KPMG economist Michal Stelmach said.
The Institute for Fiscal Studies, a think tank, said in a report with economists from Citi that borrowing in the 2021/22 financial year would drop to 9.3% of GDP. This is 30 billion pounds less than the government's forecasters expected in March but would still be the third-highest on record. 
The Office for National Statistics said June's debt servicing costs - which include an inflation uplift to index-linked gilts' future redemption values as well as actual interest payments - rose to a record 8.7 billion pounds.
A rise in the rate of retail price inflation was largely to blame, it added.
However, debt servicing costs as a share of GDP remain low by historic standards, and most economists say the pace of economic recovery will be the key factor in improving the public finances.
""The economy can do more of the job in 'fixing' the public finances than a fiscal tightening,"" Ruth Gregory of Capital Economics said.
Public borrowing for the first three months of the financial year totalled 69.5 billion pounds, down more than 40% from the three months to June 2020, when Britain recorded its heaviest-ever borrowing in cash terms due to its COVID spending surge.
But public debt as a share of GDP, excluding public sector banks, was 2.218 trillion pounds or 99.7% of GDP in June, its highest since March 1961.
""It's ... right that we ensure debt remains under control in the medium term, and that's why I made some tough choices at the last budget to put the public finances on a sustainable path,"" finance minister Rishi Sunak said.
Sunak's support for furloughed workers and a tax break on property purchases are being phased out, while a temporary increase in the main benefit for the unemployed and low-earners will stop on Oct. 1. Overseas aid spending has also been cut.
Sunak is due to hold a review of government spending before the end of the year.

The IFS think tank said that although the short-run outlook for the public finances was better than in March - giving scope for one-off giveaways - the long-term prospects pointed to spending cuts for some government ministries unless taxes rise.

Robust overseas demand has underpinned exports and factory output, which have been a bright spot for the world's third-largest economy over the past months, despite May's slump which was due to a sharp fall in car production.
""As production adjustments at some factories of carmakers are expected to continue from July onward due to the prolonged impact of the chip shortage, there remains a downside risk to car output,"" said Junpei Fujita, an economists at Mitsubishi UFJ (NYSE:MUFG) Research and Consulting.
Japan's economy likely avoided falling into recession in the second quarter but a fresh state of emergency in Tokyo to halt a rise in coronavirus infections is hurting the growth outlook, a separate Reuters poll showed this month.
Separate trade ministry data due at 8:50 a.m. July 30 (2350 GMT July 29) is expected to show retail sales edged up 0.2% year-on-year in June, slowing substantially from the previous month's sharp 8.3% gain.

Job availability and the jobless rate were projected to come in little changed in June, at 1.10 and 3.0% respectively, while housing starts were expected to see a 7.2% jump in June, slowing from a 9.9% rise in the prior month, the poll showed.
Job data will be released by the labour ministry at 8:30 a.m. July 30 (2330 GMT July 29) and housing starts data will be issued at 2 p.m. July 30 (0500 GMT).

Preliminary retail sales dropped 1.8% in June from a month earlier, compared with economists’ median estimate of a 0.7% decline, the Australian Bureau of Statistics said in a report released in Sydney Wednesday.
“June’s fall in turnover was due to the impact of coronavirus restrictions across multiple states,” Ben James, an official at the ABS, said in a statement. “Other states and territories saw interrupted trade due to mini-lockdowns, as well as reduced mobility between states with the tightening of border restrictions.”
The Australian dollar edged down and was trading at 73.19 U.S. cents at 11:48 a.m. in Sydney
Australia has been hit hard by renewed infections from the delta strain of coronavirus that has now pushed half of the country into lockdown, including its two largest cities. The economy had been growing strongly prior to the outbreak, with unemployment in June falling to 4.9%, the lowest reading in 10 years.
Victoria led the falls in June retail sales, slumping 3.5%, with the impact of the state’s fourth lockdown more pronounced. New South Wales dropped 2% and Queensland fell 1.5%.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australian retail sales slumped in June as coronavirus lockdowns and mobility restrictions in much of the country hit demand, casting a shadow over the outlook for growth in the third quarter as COVID-19 cases continue to rise.
Retail turnover in June fell 1.8% from a month earlier, the biggest drop this year, preliminary figures from the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) showed on Wednesday. That compared with a larger-than-expected 0.4% gain in May and a median forecast for a 0.5% drop.
""We expect retail sales to fall again in July as the Sydney lockdown intensifies, another Melbourne lockdown starts and South Australia also falls into lockdown,"" ANZ economists wrote in a note.
""As the risks of a long Sydney lockdown increase, so do the risks of a muted recovery.""
Electronics giant JB Hi-Fi this week warned its sales have suffered through July while a ban on construction activity in Sydney will likely hit hardware store sales. 
Reduced government income support and job insecurities amid extended lockdowns could further hit demand, economists warned. 
Prime Minister Scott Morrison on Wednesday assured Australians that the government was providing ""timely, proportionate and targeted"" support, adding the lockdowns would have a ""significant"" impact on economic growth in the current quarter. 
The remarks come as the virus situation worsened on Wednesday with both Victoria state and Sydney reporting sharp increases in new COVID-19 cases.
""With around half of Australia's population and economy now subject to hard lockdowns, the country's 'V'-shaped economic recovery could quickly become 'W'-shaped if persistent COVID-19 outbreaks aren't brought under control,"" CommSec economist Ryan Felsman said.
Fears that current lockdowns across three of Australia's six states would extend sent the local dollar in a tailspin as it slipped for a fifth straight session to the lowest since November 2020. [AUD/]
Already, a majority of economists are predicting Australia's A$2 trillion ($1.5 trillion) economy will shrink in the third quarter, its first contraction since June 2020, while the country's central bank is seen reversing its taper decision in response to the current virus outbreak.
The slowdown in demand is already evidenced by weekly consumer confidence readings, with the latest report showing a 5.2% slump last week, the biggest fall since March 2020 when the pandemic first hit.

Credit and debit card spending data from the Commonwealth Bank showed a 0.6% drop in New South Wales, of which Sydney is the capital city, over the week ending July 16 versus 2019 levels. That compares with a 2.1% lift in the prior week.

TOKYO (Reuters) -Japan's exports jumped in June led by U.S. demand for cars and China-bound shipments of chip-making equipment, supporting hopes for an export-led recovery in the world's third-largest economy.
Exports rose 48.6% in June from a year earlier, the fourth straight month of double-digit gains, although growth was largely exaggerated by a COVID-led plunge last year. Export growth has remained strong even as a global chip shortage weighs on Japan's car output and shipments.
With consumer spending weakening due to renewed coronavirus curbs in Tokyo, policymakers are counting on external demand to pick up the slack.
In an encouraging sign for a trade-dependent economy, exports grew 23.2% in the first half of this year, up for the first time in five periods and exceeding pre-pandemic levels seen in the first half of 2019. It was the fastest growth since the first half of 2010.
The 48.6% year-on-year export growth beat a 46.2% increase expected by economists in a Reuters poll and followed a 49.6% expansion in May, which was the sharpest monthly increase since April 1980.
""China's economy may be pausing but stimulus measures are being taken. With the help of recovery in Europe and America, it is expected to pick up again,"" said Takeshi Minami, chief economist at Norinchukin Research Institute. ""That will help Japanese exports remain in an uptrend, backed by car exports as well as capital goods and information-related items.""
By destination, exports to China, Japan's biggest trading partner, rose 27.7% in the year to June, led by demand for chip-making equipment, raw materials and plastic.
U.S.-bound exports grew 85.5% in June, driven by shipments of cars, auto parts and motors.
Imports rose 32.7% in the year to June, more than the median estimate for a 29.0% increase.
The trade balance came to a surplus of 383.2 billion yen ($3.49 billion), versus the median estimate for a 460.0 billion yen surplus.

Japan's economy shrank an annualised 3.9% in January-March and likely barely grew in the second quarter, as the pandemic took a toll on service spending.

Five of 14 sectors monitored by Lloyds (LON:LLOY) Bank reported faster growth last month. Pubs, restaurants and other hospitality firms reported their strongest performance in nine years for as restrictions on indoor service were lifted. 
But the overall expansion slowed from May, when 11 out of 14 sectors reported accelerating growth.
""The slowdown of output growth across the majority of sectors shows we are entering a new phase of the UK's recovery,"" Jeavon Lolay, head of economics and market insight at Lloyds Bank Commercial Banking, said.
""We are less likely to experience the rapid month-on-month output growth we've typically seen when businesses have been able restart operations after successive lockdowns.""
Eleven of the 14 sectors monitored in June were less optimistic about achieving stronger output volumes over the next 12 months, driven by concerns over inflation, capacity constraints and staff shortages, Lloyds said.

Purchasing managers' indices for firms in Britain's dominant services sector and manufacturing showed a slowdown in the pace of recovery in June.
The Bank of England is due to announce its latest forecasts for the economy on Aug. 5. Some of its policymakers have said that risks to the recovery mean they should maintain their huge stimulus, while others have said the time for easing off on the programme is approaching.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. homebuilding increased more than expected in June, but permits for future home construction fell to an eight-month low, likely reflecting hesitancy caused by expensive building materials as well as shortages of labor and land.
The report from the Commerce Department on Tuesday suggested a severe shortage of houses, which has boosted prices and sparked bidding wars across the country, could persist for a while. Demand for houses is being driven by low mortgage rates and a desire for more spacious accommodations during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Though lumber prices are coming down from record highs, builders are paying more for steel, concrete and lighting, and are grappling with shortages of appliances like refrigerators.
""Reports of multi-month delays in the delivery of windows, heating units, refrigerators and other items have popped up across the country, delaying delivery of homes and forcing builders to cap activity, and many builders continue to point to a shortage of available workers as a separate challenge,"" said Matthew Speakman, an economist at Zillow.
Housing starts rose 6.3% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.643 million units last month. Data for May was revised down to a rate of 1.546 million units from the previously reported 1.572 million units. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast starts would rise to a rate of 1.590 million units.
Despite last month's increase, starts remained below March's rate of 1.737 million units, which was the highest level since July 2006. Homebuilding increased in the West and the populous South, but fell in the Northeast and Midwest.
Single-family starts rose 6.3% to a rate of 1.160 million units. The volatile multi-family homebuilding category advanced 6.2% to a pace of 483,000 units.
Starts increased 29.1% on a year-on-year basis in June.
Permits for future homebuilding fell 5.1% to a rate of 1.598 million units in June, the lowest level since October 2020. Permits are now lagging starts, suggesting that homebuilding will slow in the coming months.
Stocks on Wall Street were trading higher after a sharp selloff on Monday. The dollar gained versus a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury yields fell.

BUILDERS CAUTIOUS
While lumber futures have dropped nearly 70% from a record high in early May, economists caution that higher prices are likely to prevail because of wildfires in the Western United States.
Dustin Jalbert, head of Fastmarkets RISI's lumber team, also noted that log prices are soaring in the interior of the Canadian province of British Columbia and duties are potentially set to increase on Canadian producers later this year.
There are also signs that the exodus to suburbs and other low-density areas in search of larger homes for home offices and schooling is gradually fading as COVID-19 vaccinations allow companies to recall workers back to offices in city centers.
A rise in COVID-19 infections among unvaccinated Americans also poses a risk to the housing market outlook.
Economists expect the housing market, one of the economy's star performers during the coronavirus pandemic, was a mild drag on gross domestic product in the second quarter.
Still, homebuilding remains underpinned by the dearth of homes available for sale. The inventory of previously-owned homes is near record lows, leading to double-digit growth in the median house price.   
A survey from the National Association of Home Builders on Monday showed confidence among single-family homebuilders fell to an 11-month low in July.
Shortages and higher input prices likely weighed on new home sales in June. The Mortgage Bankers Association Builder Application Survey, which was published on Tuesday, showed mortgage applications for new home purchases fell 23.8% in June from a year ago. Applications decreased 3% compared to May. The data has not been adjusted for typical seasonal patterns. The Commerce Department is due to publish new home sales data for June next Monday.
Homebuilders and a group of other stakeholders met last Friday with White House officials, including Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo and Housing and Urban Development Secretary Marcia Fudge, to discuss strategies to address the short-term supply chain disruptions in the homebuilding sector.
Building permits fell in all four regions in June. Single-family permits dropped 6.3% to a rate of 1.063 million units, the lowest since August 2020. Permits for multifamily housing slipped 2.6% to a rate of 535,000 units.
The backlog of single-family homes yet to be started grew in June to the highest level since October 2006.
""Widespread anecdotal reports point to builders delaying or turning down orders to allow shortages to ease and to catch up to a growing construction backlog,"" said Mark Palim, deputy chief economist at Fannie Mae in Washington.
Housing completions fell 1.4% to a rate of 1.324 million units last month. Single-family home completions declined 6.1% to a rate of 902,000 units, the lowest level since October.

Realtors estimate that single-family housing starts and completion rates need to be in a range of 1.5 million to 1.6 million units per month to close the inventory gap.
The stock of housing under construction rose 1.8% to a rate of 1.359 million units last month.

The Teranet-National Bank Composite House Price Index, which tracks repeat sales of single-family homes in 11 major Canadian markets, rose 2.7% in June from May. It follows a 2.8% gain in May, which was the largest monthly rise in the history of the index.

Taiwan's export orders, a bellwether of global technology demand, jumped 31.1% from a year earlier to $53.73 billion in June, data from the Ministry of Economic Affairs showed on Tuesday. 
That was the 16th month of expansion and the pace was faster than the median forecast of a rise of 29.45% in a Reuters poll. 
The ministry attributed the strong performance to demand for 5G and semiconductors, especially from auto makers, as the world grapples with chip shortages.
Demand for home electronics like laptops to support the ""home economy"", with the COVID-19 pandemic still restricting the movement of millions around the world, also remained strong, the ministry added. 
In May, export orders surged 34.5% from a year earlier to$52.29 billion. 
Taiwan companies such as Foxconn and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd (TSMC) are major suppliers to Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) and other global tech firms. 
Looking ahead, the ministry warned of uncertainly over the spread of COVID-10 variants around the world, but saw an upside in climbing vaccination rates and the recovery of the global economy.
The start of the second half of the year is when companies start preparing new products for the year-end holiday season, while demand for 5G and other high end applications, as well as auto electronics, will also help Taiwan's orders, the ministry added. 
It expects export orders in July to rise between 15.7% and 18.9% from a year earlier.

Orders from the United States jumped 24% in June from a year earlier, a slower rate of expansion compared with the 28.1% logged in May, while orders from China were up 36.7%, versus a gain of 40% the previous month. 
Orders from Europe rose 24.3%, while those from Japan were up 28.4%.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The U.S. recession touched off by the coronavirus lasted only two months, ending with a low point reached in April 2020 after the start of a sharp drop in economic activity in March of that year, the U.S. Business Cycle Dating Committee announced Monday.
The committee, a group of macroeconomists who assign the start and end dates of U.S. business cycles, said that while the country had by no means gotten back to normal operating capacity at that point, indicators of both jobs and production ""point clearly to April 2020 as the month of the trough,"" with a rebound beginning in May.
Indeed, the resumption of growth was so rapid the committee said it was only ""the unprecedented magnitude of the decline"" that led members to consider what happened to be a recession in the first place, with a downturn typically requiring ""depth, duration and diffusion"" to qualify for the label.
Around 22 million jobs disappeared from company payrolls in March and April of that year, an event that sparked concern about a new Depression and led Congress and the White House to approve the first of several massive relief packages to keep firms and households afloat.
The designation of the recession's end date is of historical note, but also relevant to research on the dynamics of business cycles and, in this case, into how that historic policy response played out.
The announcement makes the pandemic recession by far the shortest on record, at two months only a third as long as the six-month downturn at the start of 1980, and a fourth as long as the recession that followed the collapse of the tech bubble in 2001. 
That alone may feed arguments in favor of the ""cash-first"" approach fiscal policymakers have taken to fighting this pandemic through repeated household support payments, expanded unemployment benefits, and liberal financing for small businesses.
It also highlights the still open debate over how fast the U.S. economy will get back to normal, and what that will mean. Measured by output, the country may already have recovered; measured by employment, it is still far short, with the biggest economic scars threatening lower wage and less educated workers.
Amid what became a divisive national conversation over masks and lockdowns, some 2.8 million people were brought back to work in May of 2020, and over the next year about 15 million jobs were recovered. More than 7 million jobs remain lost.
Employment ""reached a clear trough in April before rebounding strongly the next few months and then settling into a more gradual rise,"" with incomes rising as well, the committee said in a statement released through the National Bureau of Economic Research. 

With coronavirus infections again increasing and a national immunization drive stalled with less than 60% of the eligible population vaccinated, fears of a new slowdown have increased. 
The S&P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average were both down more than 2% by midday, and U.S. 10-year Treasury yields fell to a 5-month low.

TOKYO (Reuters) -Japan's core consumer prices rose 0.2% in June from a year earlier to mark the fastest annual pace in over a year, data showed on Tuesday, a sign the impact of global commodity inflation was gradually broadening.
But the increase, driven largely by higher energy costs, was much smaller than that of other major economies due to weak consumption, reinforcing expectations the Bank of Japan will be forced to maintain its massive stimulus for the time being.
The rise in the core consumer price index (CPI), which includes oil products but excludes volatile fresh food prices, matched a median market forecast for a 0.2% gain and followed a 0.1% increase in May.
The increase, which was the fastest since March 2020, was due mostly to a 4.6% rise in energy costs with gasoline prices up 17.9% in a sign households were facing higher cost of living.
""It's cost-push type inflation that likely won't have legs, with items propping up prices mostly energy-related,"" said Yasunari Ueno, chief market economist at Mizuho Securities.
Some countries, including the United States and Britain, have seen inflation rise faster than expected as demand recovers from the coronavirus pandemic, triggering debate on how quickly they should wean their economies off stimulus.
With inflation well short of its 2% target, the BOJ is likely to lag well behind its counterparts in dialing back its massive monetary support to underpin a fragile recovery.
While global commodity inflation has pushed up wholesale prices in Japan, consumer prices have barely risen as companies remain cautious about passing on higher costs to households.
From the CPI data for July due on Aug. 20, the government will use a new base year that will lead to tweaks in the weighting of some items consisting the index.
Many analysts project the change to push core CPI back to negative territory due to an expected increase in the weighting of cellphone fees, which have been declining recently.
Mizuho Securities' Ueno expects the base year change to push down core CPI by around 0.2% point.
A resurgence in COVID-19 infections forced the government to impose new state of emergency curbs in Olympic host city Tokyo from Monday through August 22, dashing policymakers' hope for a solid rebound in economic growth in July-September.

In fresh quarterly projections released on Friday, the BOJ cut its economic growth forecast for the fiscal year ending in March 2022 to 3.8% from 4.0% due in part to the new curbs.
It revised up this year's core CPI forecast to 0.6% from 0.1% largely reflecting the boost from higher energy prices.

(Reuters) -U.S. homebuilder confidence in the market for single family homes fell in July to its lowest level since August 2020, driven by shortages in both supply and labor.
The NAHB/Wells Fargo Housing Market index declined to a reading of 80 this month from 81 in June. Economists polled by Reuters had expected the index to advance marginally to a reading of at 82. A reading above 50 means more builders view market conditions as favorable than poor. The index hit an all-time high of 90 in November 2020.
""Builders are contending with shortages of building materials, buildable lots and skilled labor as well as a challenging regulatory environment,"" said NAHB Chief Economist Robert Dietz. ""This is putting upward pressure on home prices and sidelining many prospective home buyers even as demand remains strong in a low-inventory environment.""
Surging home prices and limited supply has put a lid on home sales recently, and fewer U.S. consumers believe that now is a good time to buy a home.
The NAHB survey's measure of single-family home sales expectations in the next six months rose two points to a reading of 81 in July, while a gauge of current sales conditions decreased one point to 86.

The prospective buyers index fell six points to 65.

The University of Michigan said its preliminary consumer sentiment index fell to 80.8 in the first half of this month - the lowest since February - from a final reading of 85.5 in June. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the index would rise to 86.5.
""Consumers' complaints about rising prices on homes, vehicles, and household durables has reached an all-time record,"" Richard Curtin, the survey director, said in a statement.
Supply constraints nationwide have led to a surge in consumer prices, as they increased by the most in 13 years in June.

The survey's one-year inflation expectation shot to the highest level since August 2008 at 4.8%, up from 4.2%, while its five-year inflation outlook ticked up to 2.9% from 2.8% in June.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. retail sales unexpectedly increased in June as demand for goods remained strong even as spending is shifting back to services, supporting expectations that economic growth accelerated in the second quarter.
The rebound in sales reported by the Commerce Department on Friday was despite purchases of motor vehicles declining for a second straight month due to a lack of supply caused by a global semiconductor shortage. Sales were also flattered by higher prices resulting from supply constraints as COVID-19 vaccinations, low interest rates and massive fiscal stimulus fuel demand.
""Growing pains from reopening are on the supply side,"" said Chris Low, chief economist at FHN Financial in New York. ""Inflation reports earlier this week confirm firms are still struggling to keep up with this demand, but another month of high retail spending should give companies confidence that consumer demand is not slowing down anytime soon.""
Retail sales rose 0.6% last month. Data for May was revised down to show sales falling 1.7% instead of declining 1.3% as previously reported. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast retail sales dropping 0.4% in June. 
Sales advanced 18.0% compared to June last year and are now 18.0% above their pre-pandemic level. Retail sales mostly capture the goods component of consumer spending, with services such as healthcare, education, travel and hotel accommodation making up the remaining portion. Restaurants and bars are the only services category in the retail sales report.

Demand shifted to goods like electronics and motor vehicles during the pandemic as millions of people worked from home, took online classes and avoided public transportation. Spending is now rotating back to services like travel and entertainment.
Though worries about inflation hurt consumer sentiment this month, spending was likely to remain underpinned by record savings and rising wealth. The University of Michigan's consumer sentiment index fell to 80.8 early this month from 85.5 in June. The survey's inflation expectations over the next 12 months shot up to 4.8% from 4.2% in June.

""Lack of available cash or credit to spend is as small a restraint on spending as it ever is. Combined with massive forced saving, wealth is likely higher than it would have been without the pandemic.""
Households accumulated at least $2.5 trillion in excess savings during the pandemic. Starting this month through December some households will receive income under the expanded Child Tax Credit program, which should help middle- and lower-income households to maintain spending.

Receipts at auto dealerships fell 2.0% after declining 4.6% in May. But sales at clothing stores increased 2.6%, likely as people venturing outside their homes spruced up their wardrobes. Sales at services stations also rose, reflecting increased mobility and higher gasoline prices. 
Consumers increased spending at restaurants and bars, leading to a 2.3% rise in receipts. Sales at restaurants and bars increased 40.2% compared to June 2020. Receipts at food and beverage stores gained 0.6%. 
Online retail sales rose 1.2%, a modest increase given Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN)'s Prime Day, which was emulated by other retailers. Sales at electronics and appliance stores rose 3.3%.

""This summer, the kids are headed back to camp or the family is ready to hit the road."" 
Excluding automobiles, gasoline, building materials and food services, retail sales increased 1.1% last month after a downwardly revised 1.4% decrease in May. These so-called core retail sales correspond most closely with the consumer spending component of gross domestic product. They were previously estimated to have dropped 0.7% in May.
""Heading into the back-to-school season, we expect record sales as families purchase electronics, shoes and backpacks for in-person learning this year,"" said Matthew Shay, president of the National Retail Federation. 

Despite the downward revision to May core retail sales, economists remained steadfast in their belief that consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, logged double-digit growth in the second quarter. Consumer spending grew at an 11.4% annualized rate in the first quarter.
Gross domestic product growth estimates for this quarter are around a 9% rate, which would be an acceleration from the 6.4% pace notched in the first quarter. Economists believe the economy could achieve growth of at least 7% this year. That would be the fastest growth since 1984. The economy contracted 3.5% in 2020, its worst performance in 74 years.

Business inventories rose 0.5% after edging up 0.1% in April, the Commerce Department said on Friday. Inventories are a key component of gross domestic product. May's increase was in line with economists' expectations.
Inventories increased 4.5% on a year-on-year basis in May.
Retail inventories decreased fell 0.8% in May as estimated in an advance report published last month. That followed a 1.7% decrease in April. 
Motor vehicle inventories decreased 5.5%, rather than 5.3% as estimated in an advance report published last month. A global semiconductor shortage is undercutting auto production, leading to stocks being run down and prices of used car and trucks soaring, boosting inflation. 
Retail inventories excluding autos, which go into the calculation of GDP, increased 0.9% as estimated last month. 
Raw material and labor shortages are making it difficult for businesses to restock. COVID-19 vaccinations, low interest rates and nearly $6 trillion in government relief since the pandemic started in the United States in March 2020 are fueling demand., straining the supply chain. 
Inventories were depleted in the first quarter. The inventory drawdown subtracted 2.7 points from GDP growth in the January-March quarter. Most economists are forecasting GDP growth just under a 10% annualized rate in the second quarter. The economy grew at a strong 6.4% rate in first three months of the year after expanding at a 4.3% pace in the fourth quarter.

Wholesale inventories rose 1.3% in May. Stocks at manufacturers advanced 0.9%.
Business sales fell 0.3% in May after increasing 0.6% in April. At May's sales pace, it would take 1.26 months for businesses to clear shelves, up from 1.25 months in April.

Investing.com -- U.S. retail sales in June outstripped expectations, in the latest show of strength from an American consumer that seem happy to swallow some of the sharpest price rises in years. 
Overall retail sales rose 0.6% on the month, in comparison to expectations for a drop of 0.4%. However, the rise came from a lower baseline as May's data were revised to show a drop of 1.7%, from the 1.3% originally reported.
Core retail sales, which exclude some of the more volatile components of consumer spending, rose by 1.3%, clearly ahead of the 0.4% rise expected, while the 'retail control' metric of spending rose by 1.1%. They, too, both had their May numbers revised down slightly."

1706,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 16, 2021 01:15AM ET</span>","Japan exports seen soaring in June, consumer inflation tame: Reuters poll","By Tetsushi Kajimoto
TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's exports likely soared in June thanks to robust global demand for machinery and technology-related goods and as shipments rebounded sharply from last year's pandemic-induced slump, a Reuters poll showed on Friday.
Exports jumped 46.2% in June from a year earlier, the fourth straight month of double-digit gains, with the annual export growth rate largely skewed by a COVID-driven plunge in June 2020. Export growth has remained strong even as a global chip shortage has weighed on Japan's car output and shipments.
With consumer spending weakening due to a renewed state of coronavirus emergency curbs in Tokyo, policymakers are counting on external demand to pick up the slack in the world's third largest economy.
Japan's economy shrank an annualised 3.9% in January-March and likely barely grew in the second quarter, as the pandemic took a toll on service spending.
Core consumer inflation likely picked up just a tad in June, according to the Reuters poll, underscoring the challenge the Bank of Japan (BOJ) faces as it tries to meet its elusive 2% inflation target.
Investors will keep a close eye on the release of trade data on July 20 at 2350 GMT and consumer prices on July 19 at 2330 GMT after the BOJ stuck to its massive monetary stimulus on Friday.
The export growth in June comes after exports soared 49.6% in May, the sharpest monthly increase since April 1980. They plunged 26.2% in June of 2020.
Imports likely jumped 29.0% year-on-year last month, which would result in a trade surplus of 460.0 billion yen ($4.18 billion), the poll showed.
The core consumer price index (CPI), which includes oil products but excludes volatile fresh food prices, is expected to have risen 0.2% in June from a year earlier, after a 0.1% increase in May, the Reuters poll showed.

The BOJ maintained its massive monetary stimulus at its policy review that ended on Friday, keeping its policy interest rate at minus 0.1% and the 10-year Japanese government bond yield target at around 0%.

BUENOS AIRES (Reuters) - Argentina's consumer prices rose 3.2% in June, in line with analyst forecasts, taking 12-month inflation above 50% for the first time since early last year as the country grapples to bring down runaway inflation that hurts wages and growth.
The country's official INDEC statistics agency said on Thursday that prices rose 25.3% in the first half of the year and were up 50.2% versus a year earlier.
A Reuters poll of analysts had earlier predicted the monthly rise, which is the slowest of the year so far, but warned that prices would likely reheat as the country neared mid-term legislative elections in November.
""There is a slight slowdown that began in May due to seasonal factors,"" said Natalia Motyl, analyst at the Fundacion Libertad y Progreso.
""This slowdown is expected to reverse as we get closer to the elections, when the uncertainty of the year causes a greater run against the peso."" 
Argentina's Economy Ministry in a statement said it expected monthly price rises to continue to cool, though cited elevated global inflation and high commodities prices including grains such as soy and wheat which the country produces and exports.
""This disorderly inflation is a new phenomenon typical of the pandemic, not only in Argentina, but it is also making it difficult for other countries to meet their goals,"" it said.
Battling inflation: https://tmsnrt.rs/36BZUr1
Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) analyst Alberto Ramos said the price rises came despite soft domestic demand, high unemployment and depressed real wages. Capital and pricing controls were creating ""a significant amount of repressed inflation in the system"".
""High inflation remains one of the key macroeconomic challenges facing the government, and a significant political liability for the government coalition,"" he said.
Argentina has been battling runaway inflation for years, with an annualized rate currently at an eye-watering 50%, far higher than the government's 29% target for the year.
""It looks very difficult that this year's inflation is not higher than that of 2020,"" said Tobías Pejkovich, an economist at the Abeceb consultancy, referring to the 36% rise last year.

Analysts estimates had ranged from a minimum monthly Consumer Price Index (CPI) advance of 3.0% to a maximum of 3.6%.

(Reuters) - Applications to start new U.S. businesses dropped sharply in June, falling for the first time since February. 
The Commerce Department said on Thursday that business applications decreased 9.8% to a seasonally adjusted 448,553 last month. The data is derived from business applications for tax identifications. 
There were a seasonally adjusted 51,543 applications from corporations, down 1.6% from May. Applications for businesses with planned wages totaled 52,325, a decrease of 7.6% from the prior month. 
Business applications fell in all four U.S. regions, led by a 12.25 drop in the Midwest last month and were lower across all industries. 

The largest drop was in mining, which recorded a 25.7% decline, with other sizable drops in ,accommodation and food services as well as the administrative and support category. 
Based on June's figures, the Commerce Department's Census Bureau, which compiles the data, projected about 32,990 new business start-ups with payroll tax liabilities would form within four quarters of application, down 6.9% compared with the estimates for May.

(Reuters) -Factory activity in the U.S. mid-Atlantic region slowed sharply for the third consecutive month to its lowest growth since December after hitting its highest pace in nearly half a century earlier this spring, a survey showed on Thursday.
The Philadelphia Federal Reserve Bank said its business activity index fell to 21.9 from 30.7 in June. That was well below economists' expectations for a reading of 28.0, according to a Reuters poll.
Any reading above zero indicates expansion in the region's manufacturing. The survey covers factories in eastern Pennsylvania, southern New Jersey and Delaware.
It is seen as one of the first monthly indicators of the health of U.S. manufacturing leading up to the national report by the Institute for Supply Management, next due out August 2.
Even though U.S. factory orders rebounded sharply in May, factories are still struggling to keep up with demand as the COVID-19 pandemic shattered supply chains and rattled the global shipping industry. Nationwide, manufacturing output at U.S. factories fell in June. 
In March, the Philly Fed's factory activity gauge hit its highest level since 1973.
The Philly Fed employment index decreased to 29.2 from 30.7 in June. 

Additionally, the price paid index fell sharply to 69.7 in July from 80.7 in the month prior, after reaching a 42-year high in June. While this marked the index's first decline in three months, it still remains at a historically elevated level.
In addition, the bank's six-month outlook index, a gauge of future business activity, tumbled to 48.6 in July from 69.2 the previous month, its lowest reading since February. It was also the largest drop in a year.

1710,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 15, 2021 01:45PM ET</span>",U.S. weekly jobless claims at 16-month low; shortages hamper manufacturing,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits fell to a 16-month low last week as the labor market gains traction, but worker shortages and bottlenecks in the supply chain are frustrating efforts by businesses to ramp up production to meet strong demand for goods and services.
Manufacturing production fell in June, with motor vehicle assembly tumbling amid a relentless global shortage of semiconductor chips, other data showed on Thursday. The imbalance between supply and demand as the economy emerges from the COVID-19 pandemic is stoking inflation, with prices expected to remain high in the months ahead before moderating.
Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell told lawmakers on Thursday that he anticipated the shortages and high inflation would abate over time.
""The problem continues to be sourcing the input components and the skilled workers that remain in short supply, but there is evidence that the logjam is beginning to break up,"" said Tim Quinlan, a senior economist at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) in Charlotte, North Carolina. 
Initial claims for state unemployment benefits fell 26,000 to a seasonally adjusted 360,000 for the week ended July 10, the lowest level since the middle of March in 2020, the Labor Department said. Data for the prior week was revised to show 13,000 more applications received than previously reported.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast 360,000 applications for the latest week. Claims have struggled to make further progress since dropping below 400,000 in late May, even as at least 20 states led by Republican governors have pulled out of federal government-funded unemployment programs. 
Graphic: Jobless claims: https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-STOCKS/qzjvqxrjypx/joblessclaims.png 
Unemployed people are required to file claims under the regular state programs to determine eligibility for federal benefits. The early termination of the federal programs followed complaints by businesses that the benefits, including a $300 weekly check, were encouraging unemployed Americans to stay at home. The economy is experiencing a shortage of workers, with a record 9.2 million job openings as of the end of May. 
About 9.5 million people are officially unemployed. The disconnect has also been blamed on lack of affordable child care, fears of contracting the coronavirus as well as pandemic-related career changes and retirements. 
Evidence is mixed on whether the early termination of federal benefits, which started on June 12 and will run through July 31, is encouraging job seeking. The expanded benefits will lapse on Sept. 6 for the rest of the country. 
The number of people continuing to receive benefits after an initial week of aid fell 126,000 to 3.241 million in the week ended July 3. Texas and Georgia accounted for the bulk of the decline in these so-called continuing claims, which are reported with a one-week lag.
""Claims in those two states, where top-off benefits ended June 26, fell to their lowest level since March 2020, suggesting the early end to benefits might be encouraging some people to return to work,"" said Nancy Vanden Houten, lead U.S. economist at Oxford Economics in New York. 
Florida and South Carolina, which have also terminated federal benefits early, reported big increases in continuing claims. Some states that have not prematurely ended expanded benefits also saw declines in people on the jobless rolls. 
At least 13.8 million people were collecting unemployment checks under all programs in late June.
Stocks on Wall Street were trading mostly lower. The dollar rose against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury yields fell.
SUPPLY CONSTRAINTS
In a separate report on Thursday, the Fed said manufacturing output dipped 0.1% in June after accelerating 0.9% in May. It was pulled down by a 6.6% plunge in production at auto plants. The global chip shortage is forcing automakers to adjust production schedules.
General Motors (NYSE:GM) announced on Thursday that its Lansing Delta Township Assembly plant in Michigan and Spring Hill Assembly plant in Tennessee would take downtime from July 19 through July 26.
Auto production cuts have boosted demand for used cars and trucks, the major driver of consumer inflation in recent months.
Still, manufacturing, which accounts for 11.9% of the U.S. economy, grew at a 3.7% annualized rate in the second quarter after increasing at a 2.3% pace in the January-March period. Demand is being fueled by COVID-19 vaccinations, low interest rates and nearly $6 trillion in government relief since the pandemic started in the United States in March 2020.
Though vaccinations are boosting spending on travel-related services and dining out among other activities, demand for goods remains robust and inventories are extremely low, which should keep manufacturing supported. 
A third report from the New York Fed showed its measure of factory activity in New York state surged in July, with new orders and shipments rising strongly.
While a fourth report from the Philadelphia Fed showed a drop this month in its gauge of manufacturing in the region that covers factories in eastern Pennsylvania, southern New Jersey and Delaware, activity continued to expand at a solid clip.
""Anecdotal guidance suggests that supply issues could start to be resolved later this year and into 2022,"" said Veronica Clark, an economist at  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) in New York. ""As long as indications of demand remain strong, we expect production to remain supported into 2022 as supply issues eventually ease.""
An easing of bottlenecks is expected to relieve some of the inflation pressure. In a fifth report, the Labor Department said import prices rose 1.0% in June after surging 1.4% in May. In the 12 months through June, import prices advanced 11.2% compared to 11.6% in May.

The government reported this week that consumer prices increased by the most in 13 years in June, while producer prices accelerated.
""The U.S. is experiencing cost-push inflation, which historically has proven more temporary than other causes of inflation, primarily demand pull,"" said Ryan Sweet, a senior economist at Moody's (NYSE:MCO) Analytics in West Chester, Pennsylvania.

BEIJING (Reuters) -China's economy grew slightly more slowly than expected in the second quarter, weighed down by higher raw material costs and new COVID-19 outbreaks, as expectations build that policymakers may have to do more to support the recovery.
Gross domestic product (GDP) expanded 7.9% in the April-June quarter from a year earlier, official data showed on Thursday, missing expectations for a rise of 8.1% in a Reuters poll of economists.
Growth slowed significantly from a record 18.3% expansion in the January-March period, when the year-on-year growth rate was heavily skewed by the COVID-induced slump in the first quarter of 2020.
Retail sales and industrial output grew more slowly in June, the latter dragged by a sharp fall in motor vehicle production, while NBS data also showed a cooling in China's housing market, a key engine of growth.
But June activity data still beat expectations, providing some relief to investors concerned about a slowdown after the central bank announced policy easing last week.
""The numbers were marginally below our expectation and the market's expectation (but) I think the momentum is fairly strong,"" said UOB economist Woei Chen Ho in Singapore.
""Our greater concern is the uneven recovery that we've seen so far and for China the recovery in domestic consumption is very important...retail sales this month was fairly strong and that may allay some concerns.""
While the world's second-largest economy has rebounded strongly from the COVID-19 crisis, buoyed by solid export demand and policy support, data releases in recent months have suggested some loss in momentum.
Higher raw material costs, supply shortages and pollution controls are weighing on industrial activity, while small COVID-19 outbreaks have kept a lid on consumer spending.
Investors are watching to see if the central bank is shifting to an easier policy stance after the People's Bank of China (PBOC) announced last week it would cut the amount of cash that banks must hold as reserves, just as some other central banks begin or start thinking about exiting pandemic-era stimulus.
Average second quarter growth in 2020 and 2021 was 5.5%, up slightly from a 5% average for the first quarter, according to the National Bureau of Statistics. 
On a quarterly basis, GDP expanded 1.3% in the April-June period, the NBS said, just beating expectations for a 1.2% rise in the Reuters poll. The NBS revised down growth in the first quarter from the fourth quarter last year to 0.4%.
POLICY EASING?
The PBOC move, which released about 1 trillion yuan ($154.64 billion) in long-term liquidity to bolster the recovery, comes even as policymakers have sought to normalise policy after the economy's strong rebound from the coronavirus crisis to contain financial risks.
It highlights the challenges policymakers will face in rolling back pandemic-era stimulus as the coronavirus continues to flare-up around the world.
""The domestic economic recovery is uneven,"" said Liu Aihua, an official at the NBS at a briefing on Thursday. 
""We must also see that the global epidemic continues to evolve, and there are many external instabilities and uncertain factors,"" she said. 
Premier Li Keqiang reiterated on Monday that China would not resort to flood-like stimulus.
Still, economists in the Reuters poll expected more support this year, forecasting a further cut in the bank reserve requirement ratio (RRR) in the fourth quarter.
Some market watchers say a cut in the country's benchmark loan prime rate may be next, possibly as early as next week.
""Based on the current situation, if policymakers do not act, the GDP figure in Q4 could fall out of the reasonable range as data from last Q4 was shining,"" said Xing Zhaopeng, senior China strategist at ANZ in Shanghai.
""I expect the government to roll out targeted easing measures."" 
HEADWINDS
China's strong exports have been a key support to the country's post-COVID recovery, but a customs official said this week overall trade growth may slow in the second half of 2021, partly reflecting COVID-19 pandemic uncertainties.
""Headwinds to growth are likely to intensify during the second half of the year,"" said Julian Evans-Pritchard, senior China economist at Capital Economics in a note.
""China's COVID-19 export boom appears to have peaked and will unwind over the coming quarters as vaccine rollouts and reopening help to normalise global consumption patterns.""
New home prices rose in June at the slowest clip since April and property investment at its weakest pace this year as government measures to cool a hot housing market further tapped the brakes on growth.
The NBS data showed China's industrial output grew 8.3% in June from a year ago, slowing from a 8.8% rise in May. Economists in the poll had expected a 7.8% year-on-year rise. 
Retail sales grew 12.1% from a year earlier in June. Analysts in the poll had expected a 11.0% increase after May's 12.4% rise.
Economists in the Reuters poll expected a 8.6% GDP expansion in 2021, which would be the highest annual growth in a decade and well above the country's official target for growth higher than 6%. China was the only major economy to have avoided a contraction last year, expanding 2.3%.

Fixed asset investment grew 12.6% in the first six months of 2021 from the same period a year earlier, versus a forecast 12.1% uptick and down from a 15.4% jump in January-May.

LONDON (Reuters) -The number of employees on British company payrolls surged in June by the most since the start of the coronavirus pandemic, according to data which painted a picture of a roaring jobs market and growing inflationary pressure from rising wages.
A day after a top Bank of England official said the time for the BoE to think about taking action on inflation might be approaching sooner than he had expected, tax data https://www.ons.gov.uk/employmentandlabourmarket/peopleinwork/earningsandworkinghours/bulletins/earningsandemploymentfrompayasyouearnrealtimeinformationuk/july2021 showed a 356,000 leap in employment in June from May.
The increase was driven by 94,000 more accommodation and food jobs, which were hit by lockdowns that have now been largely lifted, and a 72,000 rise in jobs in administration and support services, including temporary staff at recruitment agencies.
The headline unemployment rate https://www.ons.gov.uk/employmentandlabourmarket/peopleinwork/employmentandemployeetypes/bulletins/uklabourmarket/july2021 for the three months to May stood at 4.8%, the Office for National Statistics said. Economists polled by Reuters had mostly expected it to hold at 4.7% seen in the three months to April.
But the ONS said the population estimates used to calculate the unemployment rate had changed and the figure for the three months to April would have been 4.8% under the new system. 
Britain's labour market has been propped up by finance minister Rishi Sunak's job subsidies which paid the wages on 8.9 million jobs at its peak in May 2020, during the first COVID-19 lockdown, and supported 2.4 million jobs at the end of May 2021.
The scheme is being phased out by the end of September which could push unemployment back up.
""We anticipate the unemployment rate to rise to around 5.5% in winter this year as the furlough scheme ends, with around one in 10 furloughed workers potentially unable to return to their original job,"" Yael Selfin, chief economist at KPMG UK, said.
RECORD GROWTH IN PAY AND VACANCIES
Thursday's figures showed the fastest headline wage growth in the year to May since records began in 2000, although the comparisons have been skewed by greater job losses among low-paid workers and comparison with depressed wages a year ago.
Average weekly earnings in the three months to the end of May rose by 7.3% compared with a year earlier.
The ONS estimated underlying wage growth, excluding distortions caused by the pandemic, was between 3.9% and 5.1% for average weekly earnings. For average earnings excluding bonuses it was between 3.2% and 4.4%.
The pick-up in hiring and in pay added to signs of how fast Britain's economy is bouncing back from its nearly 10% crash last year when it was hit by one of the world's heaviest COVID death tolls and long lockdowns.
The number of job vacancies in the three months to June rose by 241,000 to 862,000, the biggest quarterly increase since records began in 2001 and just short of the record-high total number of vacancies seen in late 2018.
BoE Deputy Governor Dave Ramsden said on Wednesday that the conditions set by the central bank for any tightening of monetary policy might be approaching.
Data earlier that day showed inflation hit 2.5% in May due to higher oil prices and bottlenecks as the economy reopened - a sharper rise than the BoE had been forecasting.
Ramsden said British inflation might rise as high as 4% ""for a period later this year"" - double the BoE's target - and the factors driving it up might take some time to ease off.
On Thursday, financial markets were pricing in a first rise in BoE interest rates to 0.25% by August 2022, little changed from Wednesday.
Ruth Gregory, an economist with Capital Economics, said the labour market was well on its way to recovery but revisions to past figures, including lower employment than previously reported, suggested it could still absorb inflation pressure.
""While there is growing evidence that firms are finding it more difficult to hire workers, we suspect that most of these labour shortages will prove temporary and that they will be confined to a few sectors,"" she said.

Average new home prices in 70 major cities grew 0.5% in June from a month earlier, down from a 0.6% rise in May, according to Reuters calculations based on data released by the National Bureau of Statistics. 
Tightening credit conditions and existing curbs have helped rein in rising housing prices, said Yan Yuejin, director of the Shanghai-based E-house China Research and Development Institution. 
Compared with a year earlier, new home prices rose 4.7%, down from a 4.9% uptick in May in the first slowdown since December last year. 
With policy tightening on developers' financing and tight credit quotas, China's real estate investment also rose in June at its weakest pace this year, a separate set of official data showed on Thursday.
China's property market has rebounded quickly from the COVID-19 shock early last year, raising concerns about financial risks and overheating.
Late last year, authorities began stepping up curbs on the sector, including restricting debt accumulation by developers, capping banks' lending to the sector and guiding banks to increase mortgage rates.
But the moves are starting to drag on the property sector, a vital source of growth for the economy.
""Housing price growth is expected to soften in the future with ongoing tight credit and the possibility of more cities implementing pricing reference for resale homes,"" said Xu Xiaole, analyst at Beike Research Institute.

Despite a flurry of cooling measures, head of China's banking and insurance regulator Guo Shuqing warned last month that local real-estate bubbles remained serious.

The East Asia and Pacific region, excluding China, is expected to grow 4% this year, World Bank President David Malpass said, down from a 4.4% forecast in March, with countries like conflict-torn Myanmar facing a deeper-than-expected slump. 
Including China, which the global lender said will likely grow 8.5% in 2021, the region is expected to expand by 7.7% this year, faster than a 7.4% projection made in March, Malpass told a streamed news conference.
The speed by which nations could roll out vaccines remained a risk to the outlook, with many countries in the region unlikely to be able to fully vaccinate their population until 2024, Malpass said. 
""The immediate priority for developing countries is widespread access to COVID-19 vaccines that match their deployment programmes,"" Malpass said.
The World Bank chief said he is concerned about developing nations falling behind in what has become a two-speed recovery with advanced economies posting a stronger rebound as more of their people get fully vaccinated. 
""This is the reason why we have a major focus on expanding the reach of vaccines,"" said Malpass, who earlier this month announced the bank was raising financing for COVID-19 vaccine purchases and deployment to $20 billion from its previous target of $12 billion.
Malpass again urged advanced economies to give up excess doses of COVID-19 vaccines for developing countries which are facing greater needs. 

Unlike countries like Britain and Germany which are preparing to remove most remaining restrictions, many in the region are reimposing targeted lockdowns to arrest a surge in cases and control the spread of more contagious variants.
The worsening COVID-19 crisis in Myanmar, which has been in turmoil since its military took power in a coup on Feb. 1, could push its economy into a ""bigger contraction"" this year, Malpass said. The World Bank forecast a 10% slump in Myanmar's economy in March.

Investing.com – China’s GDP growth slowed in the second quarter of 2021, in a further sign that the economic recovery from COVID-19 continued to show signs of slowing down, according to second-quarter data released earlier in the day.
The National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) data said China’s second-quarter GDP grew 7.9% year-on-year in the second quarter, lower than both the 8.1% growth in forecast prepared by Investing.com and the 18.3% growth from the first quarter. However, it grew 1.3% quarter-on-quarter, exceeding both the 1.2% growth in Investing.com forecasts and the previous quarter’s 0.6% growth.
The data also said industrial production grew 8.3% year-on-year in June, higher than the forecast 7.8% growth but lower than the 8.8% growth recorded in May. Fixed asset investment also grew 12.6% year-on-year in June, higher than the 12.1% in Investing.com forecasts but lower than the 15.4% growth recorded in the previous month.
The unemployment rate, meanwhile, was unchanged at 5%.
Trade data released earlier in the week showed a surprise growth in June exports alongside indications of the slowdown in economic recovery. Consumers have also been more cautious spenders as incomes decreased due to COVID-19 and sporadic outbreaks of the virus restrict travel.
The data also comes as the People’s Bank of China (PBOC) cut the reserve requirement ratio (RRR) in a surprise move during the previous week, thus freeing up about CNY 1 trillion yuan ($154.55 billion) in liquidity that can be used to boost the economic recovery. This cut came into effect earlier in the day.
The central bank also rolled over a portion of medium-term policy loans coming due, signaling its unwillingness to make big changes in monetary policy.
Investors remained cautious, with Standard Chartered (OTC:SCBFF) Plc head of China macro strategy Becky Liu warning the economy needs more support and there could be more RRR cuts ahead.
“China’s growth is decent, but it’s not good enough, and the economy will likely moderate further from here... the market underestimated the central bank’s determination to ease monetary policy and support growth... the RRR cut is an obvious signal that China has entered an easing cycle. RRR is never one-off, and I expect the PBOC to reduce RRR again by year-end,” she said.
Chinese Premier Li Keqiang was also cautious about the economic outlook, saying earlier in the week that the country must prepare for cyclical risks and make appropriate counter-cyclical adjustments."
